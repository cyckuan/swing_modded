L.A. ASTHMA WOES WORST IN AMERICA

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it ``Wheeze City'' _ L.A. is the asthma
capital of America.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma attacks send children in Los Angeles to the emergency
room more often than in any other hot spot for the disease, and the
illness accounts for more missed school days and workdays locally,
according to an American Lung Association study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of the asthmatic children in Los Angeles were
rushed to emergency rooms in the past year, topping 13 other
regions around the nation, the study showed. The city ranked worse
than the national average in every category the survey measured.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said they suspect that Los Angeles fares so poorly
because of a sedentary lifestyle and a lack of education about the
chronic lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are accepting a way of life that isn't acceptable,''
said Dr. Miguel Lanz, a Miami-based allergist who analyzed the
study. ``Even a severe asthmatic should never have to go to the
emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were disappointed with the results of the survey,
which Lanz called the most comprehensive on asthma in the past 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals should be no missed work, no missed sleep, no trips
to the emergency room,'' said Asthma in America spokeswoman Toni
Delacorte. ``Asthma is a treatable, controllable illness, and a lot
of people are suffering needlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   While the smog in Los Angeles isn't helping asthmatics, doctors
said it isn't a chief reason for the poor survey results. In fact,
a stroll outside might be the best thing for some asthma sufferers
who are spending too much time indoors with recirculated air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids aren't going outdoors to play; they're playing
Nintendo,'' Lanz said. ``With windows rolled up, we're constantly
being bombarded by allergens and particles in our homes that can
make us sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Roberts, a San Fernando Valley-based allergist, said
there are other reasons why asthma sufferers in an urban area like
Los Angeles might be harder hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody lives in their cars.'' Roberts said. ``Research
shows the possibility that certain diesel exhaust particles can
contribute (to asthma symptoms).''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Craig Jones of the University of Southern California School
of Medicine said the best way to avoid a trip to the emergency room
or a missed day of work is to get treatment before the lung disease
takes over your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asthma care is good, but it could be better,'' Jones said.
``The most important thing that people with asthma can do is
educate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is caused by inflammation of the lower airwaves and
airwave obstruction that can be caused by mucus or muscle spasms.
Symptoms can include wheezing, shortness of breath and tightness of
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 15 million asthma sufferers in the nation, just
under 500,000 are in the Los Angeles area, according to the study.
All of the cases are treatable, Delacorte said, pointing out that
Olympic swimmer Amy Van Dyken and Pittsburgh Steelers running back
Jerome Bettis are both asthmatic.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association lists asthma as the No.1 reason
children miss school and the No. 1 reason they are rushed to
California emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The survey this summer by Washington, D.C.-based Asthma in
America interviewed 2,500 asthma sufferers, in addition to hundreds
of doctors and members of the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers picked 14 asthma hot spots, gathering specific data
for those areas, including Phoenix, Miami, Chicago and the state of
Texas. About 150 asthma sufferers were interviewed in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The city beat all the other regions when it came to people
missing school or work, with 44 percent saying the illness forced
them to stay home. The survey listed the national average at 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The national average for emergency room visits by children was
32 percent. Providence, R.I., was the leader in asthma-related
sleep disruption, with 35 percent of respondents there saying they
woke up with breathing problems at least once per week, compared
with 32 percent in Los Angeles and 30 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, a survey-high 59 percent of asthma sufferers said
they are limited in sports and recreation, vs. 50 percent in Los
Angeles and 48 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors pointed out that in other countries, even those
associated with poor health care, asthma is less of a problem
because it is treated early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asthma is unheard of in rural China and Africa,'' Lanz said.

WASHINGTON: your votes.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president's chances of avoiding trial in the Senate _ where
his opponents are exceedingly unlikely to get the 67 votes needed
for conviction _ rest with a few dozen Republican moderates. The
vote in the House, which is to return on Thursday, is considered
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, both parties in the House were
prepared to take extraordinary steps to bring back members,
including carrying one California congressman recuperating from
surgery to Washington on an air ambulance if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Clinton is not making headway, six previously
undeclared Republicans _ Jack Metcalf of Washington, Saxby Chamblis
of Georgia, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
Florida, Bob Franks of New Jersey and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New
Jersey _ came out in favor of impeachment or said they were leaning
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said after Clinton's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And a moderate Republican who has said he opposes impeachment,
Rep. Amo Houghton of New York, became the target of a conservative
Republican who said he would run against Houghton in 2000. Jim
Pierce said Houghton had ``betrayed'' conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has not been in the direction of those who want to
avoid impeachment,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, New York's new
senator-elect. ``Over the weekend Americans are going to realize
this is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a signal from the Senate Friday that it was
suddenly taking seriously the possibility that it could become the
jury in a trial of the president. The press secretaries of Trent
Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, and Tom Daschle, the
minority leader from South Dakota, did something they rarely do _
put out a joint statement. All it said was that the two men would
make no comment until after the House acted.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a year ago that the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, began investigating the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and whether he was trying to persuade her to commit
perjury in the Paula Jones case. The investigation plunged the
White House into a yearlong crisis that Clinton compounded when he
emphatically told the nation that he had not had sex ``with that
woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later Starr reported to Congress that he had
``substantial and credible evidence'' that Clinton had committed 11
possibly impeachable offenses in his effort to cover-up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Hyde said ``we all agree any impeachment cannot
succeed unless it is done in a bipartisan way.'' But on Friday he
defended his inquiry.

 WASHINGTON: his inquiry.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be an endless process,'' he said. ``I
think it's in the interest of the country to finish it and we have
tried to do our level best. And I have tried to grant every request
the Democrats have made. Maybe I haven't succeeded, but I have
certainly tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, as he called for impeachment, praised a few of the
committee's Democrats. He said he admired Schumer greatly. He spoke
kindly of Rep. Thomas M. Barrett, a Wisconsin Democrat. ``He has
tried to say to this committee, `Let's bring the country
together,''' Graham said. ``What a noble cause. Don't worry, Mr.
Barrett, if we don't come together. This country is strong. We
shall survive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the long day went on the partisanship became ever more
pronounced. Democrats fought to the end against every charge
against Clinton and they plunged the committee Republicans into
some noticeable confusion when they demanded to know precisely
which of the president's statements were perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that in a presentation Thursday, David P. Schippers,
the Republicans' investigative counsel had ``set out in detail''
the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you should be able to tell me what they are,'' shot back
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had to summon Schippers and his other chief aide, Thomas E.
Mooney to his side. It was finally Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who
began giving the answers, plowing grimly through the sexual details
needed to make the perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Clinton's grand jury testimony that he did not think
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky fit the definition of sexual
relations used by Ms. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Clinton's denial when he was asked whether ``oral
sex performed on you was within the definition as you understood
it.'' He noted that Clinton conceded that ``kissing or touching of
the breast or genitalia of another person'' would be covered by the
definition of sex in the Jones case, and yet Clinton had still
denied lying when he said he had not had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony is false and misleading,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, charged that the
Republicans were guilty of ``deliberate vagueness and obfuscation''
because they were prepared to impeach Clinton over definitions of
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell us what he touched, therefore it was perjury,''
Frank said, mocking the Republicans case.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the Watergate scandal of 24 years ago, Republicans
countered that the articles of impeachment against Nixon had also
lacked a detailed bill of particulars. And Rep. Charles Canady, a
Florida Republican, noted that it was the Republican defenders of
Nixon who had made the same demand for specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said the Democrats were really engaged in a
``clever ruse'' designed to limit the evidence that the Senate
could consider in any trial.
</P>
<P>
   But at other moments the debate reached a higher tone conscious
of history, as lawmakers quoted the nation's founders, and John
Kennedy and recalled wrenching chapters in the nation's history,
from civil war to assassinations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a passionate debate that was by turns solemn
with history, fiercely partisan and at times sorrowful, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Friday to impeach
President Clinton and remove him from office for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:20 P.M., the Republican-controlled committee, voting 21
to 16, late Friday afternoon charged Clinton in one article of
impeachment with providing ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' last Aug. 17 before a grand jury investigating the
Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, one Republican _ Rep. Lindsey O. Graham of
South Carolina _ broke with his party as the committee voted 20 to
17 to approve a second article of impeachment on perjury, this time
for Clinton's deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
harassment case. Graham had long said he would not support
impeachment for a lie in a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   And then at 9:15 P.M., the committee again voted 21 to 16, this
time to approve the third article, which accuses the president of
obstruction of justice. The article accuses Mr. Clinton of trying
to influence witnesses in the Lewinsky matter, including his
personal secretary and the White House intern. The committee
adjourned for the evening, planning to resume debate on the fourth
article of impeachment, on abuse of power, on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   So what began with a civil sex harassment suit by an obscure
Arkansas civil servant and was transformed into a criminal
investigation of sex and mendacity by the president, left Clinton
Friday as the third president to confront impeachment, with a House
vote scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson was spared removal from office by one vote in the
Senate after the House impeached him in 1868. Richard Nixon
resigned in disgrace in the Watergate scandal 24 years ago after
the Judiciary Committee approved three articles against him, but
before the House voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman, brought the
Judiciary Committee's ten-week inquiry towards a close, insisting
on the gravity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president performs the public act of asking God to
witness his promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, that is not trivial,'' the Illinois Republican said.
``Whether it's a civil suit or before the grand jury the
significance of the oath cannot or must not be cheapened if our
proud boast that we are a government of laws and not of men is to
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself commented for the first time since the committee
began televised proceedings. Just minutes before the committee was
to take its first vote, the president walked into the Rose Garden
and spoke once again of his remorse for his affair with Ms.
Lewinsky. For the first time he publicly said he would accept a
rebuke or censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through and for what members of both
parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past months have been a torturous process of coming to
terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences and I'm prepared to accept
them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped well short of the admission that some
undecided Republicans were looking for that he had in fact lied
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   At the Judiciary Committee, most members left the debate to
watch the president on television. Then, minutes later, in the same
cavernous hearing room where Nixon's fate was weighed 24 years ago,
they voted to approve the first article of impeachment and moved on
to the second.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is to vote by Saturday on articles of impeachment
accusing the president of obstruction of justice and abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats argued that Clinton had deceived the nation, but
said he did not deserve removal from office for lies about an
extra-marital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up America'' implored Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida,
calling for the nation, which polls show overwhelmingly opposes
impeachment, to make its feelings known. ``They are about to
impeach our president. They are about to reverse two national
elections. They are about to discard your votes.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The president's chances of avoiding trial in the Senate _ where
his opponents are exceedingly unlikely to get the 67 votes needed
for conviction _ rest with a few dozen Republican moderates. The
vote in the House, which is to return on Thursday, is considered
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, both parties in the House were
prepared to take extraordinary steps to bring back members,
including carrying one California congressman recuperating from
surgery to Washington on an air ambulance if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Clinton is not making headway, six previously

of Georgia, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
Florida, Bob Franks of New Jersey and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New
Jersey _ came out in favor of impeachment or said they were leaning
that way.
</P>

   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said after Clinton's statement.

Rep. Amo Houghton of New York, became the target of a conservative

   Hyde said that in a presentation Thursday, David P. Schippers,
the Republicans' investigative counsel had ``set out in detail''
the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you should be able to tell me what they are,'' shot back
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had to summon Schippers and his other chief aide, Thomas E.
Mooney to his side. It was finally Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who
began giving the answers, plowing grimly through the sexual details
needed to make the perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Clinton's grand jury testimony that he did not think
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky fit the definition of sexual
relations used by Ms. Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Clinton's denial when he was asked whether ``oral
sex performed on you was within the definition as you understood
it.'' He noted that Clinton conceded that ``kissing or touching of
the breast or genitalia of another person'' would be covered by the
definition of sex in the Jones case, and yet Clinton had still
denied lying when he said he had not had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony is false and misleading,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, charged that the
Republicans were guilty of ``deliberate vagueness and obfuscation''
because they were prepared to impeach Clinton over definitions of
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell us what he touched, therefore it was perjury,''
Frank said, mocking the Republicans case.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the Watergate scandal of 24 years ago, Republicans
countered that the articles of impeachment against Nixon had also
lacked a detailed bill of particulars. And Rep. Charles Canady, a
Florida Republican, noted that it was the Republican defenders of
Nixon who had made the same demand for specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said the Democrats were really engaged in a
``clever ruse'' designed to limit the evidence that the Senate
could consider in any trial.
</P>
<P>
   But at other moments the debate reached a higher tone conscious
of history, as lawmakers quoted the nation's founders, and John
Kennedy and recalled wrenching chapters in the nation's history,
from civil war to assassinations.

TRADING RESUMES IN COYOTE NETWORK SYSTEMS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trading of Coyote Network Systems' shares resumed
Friday after Nasdaq imposed a one-day halt due to a controversy
involving one of its business partners.
</P>
<P>
   The telecom equipment and network services company ran into
trouble after TheStreet.Com reported earlier this week that it
couldn't find Coyote's partner Crescent Communications, which
Coyote described as an international telecom company. Crescent
indirectly accounted for the majority of Coyote's second quarter
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote's stock dropped by 45 percent to $7.8125 on Wednesday,
and Nasdaq halted trading on Thursday to let the market absorb
material news about the firm. When trading resumed Friday, Coyote
took another hit, dropping by 19 percent to $6.5625 on volume of
2.3 million shares _ 18 times its six-month daily average.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq spokesman would not say whether the organization is
investigating Coyote. However, he explained that it's customary to
halt trading if there's news about a company that might materially
affect its stock price. Trading resumes once Nasdaq deems that the
market has had enough time to absorb the news.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote has defended itself against the allegations, and an
analyst dismissed TheStreet.Com's report. Coyote officials could
not be reached for comment Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coyote issued two statements explaining its
relationship with Crescent. Coyote said it sold equipment to
Comdisco, an established Illinois telecom leasing firm, which in
turn leased it to Crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Comdisco officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, editor-in-chief of TheStreet.Com, said his
reporters started to search for Crescent before Thanksgiving. A
reporter even drove to the company's Long Beach address, but there
was no company.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote analyst Vik Grover said that although he has never talked
to anyone at Crescent, he believes it is based in Long Beach but
operates out of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the phone of Gene Curcio, president of Crescent,
in Long Beach, and he did not respond to a Daily News e-mail
request for comment.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A careworn President Clinton on Friday once more
expressed regret for the actions that have brought him to the brink
of impeachment and, for the first time in public, invited Congress
to censure him.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said Republican leaders on Capitol
Hill told them that they were still determined to prevent a vote on
censure in the full House. The leaders of the House majority have
insisted that Clinton must face a floor vote on articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked slowly from the Oval Office to the Rose Garden at
4:11 p.m. Friday to acknowledge his shame and to state his
willingness to accept the rebuke and censure of Congress for his
``errors of word and deed.''
</P>
<P>
   His face lined with apparent anguish, the president spoke for
four minutes, apologizing for the torment to which he has subjected
his family and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through, and for what members of both
parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' Clinton said.
``These past months have been a tortuous process of coming to terms
with what I did. I understand that accountability demands
consequences, and I'm prepared to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-designate, Robert Livingston, said Friday night that
he had not told the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt,
``anything definitive'' about a censure vote. He continued:
``Actually, I haven't been very clear. I haven't been any more
clear with him than I have with you _ deliberately so.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to respond to questions shouted by reporters
after he finished speaking and strode silently back through the
West Wing colonnade to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Friday at the urging of undecided members of
Congress, who wanted him to forthrightly confess his sins and end
the legalisms that have marked his defense all year. But he did not
offer any new confession and left at least some members of Congress
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed for several days whether to speak in public
about the impeachment votes, deciding only this afternoon that he
would do so. He rejected suggestions from some aides that he go
further in admitting misconduct. His lawyers have consistently
refused to admit that the president lied under oath or broke other
laws, fearing it would make him liable to criminal prosecution
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that those who were demanding
that Clinton admit to illegal acts had already decided to vote for
impeachment, so such an admission would also be politically futile.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, Judiciary Committee members left the hearing
room to watch the president on televisions in staff offices,
returning quickly to resume their deliberations. Nine minutes after
Clinton concluded his remarks, the panel began the roll-call on the
first of four articles of impeachment, accusing him of false
statements under oath before a federal grand jury hearing testimony
on the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not admit Friday to the essence of the charges
against him _ perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
He said he would leave the explanation for his actions to his
lawyers, who spent two days before the Judiciary Committee this
week. ``Others are presenting my defense on the facts, the law and
the Constitution,'' Clinton said. ``Nothing I can say now can add
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``What I want the American people to know, what I
want the Congress to know, is that I am profoundly sorry for all I
have done wrong in words and deeds. I never should have misled the
country, the Congress, my friends or my family. Quite simply, I
gave in to my shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's remarks, largely a new formulation of earlier
regrets, fell short of what many in Congress were demanding and
failed to sway any minds, judging by their comments after he spoke.
He may even have hurt his case with some members who wanted an
unqualified confession.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Franks, a moderate Republican from New Jersey, said
before the president spoke that he was waiting to hear what the
president would say before deciding how to vote on impeachment.
Franks, who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, said after
Clinton spoke that he was disappointed that the president had not
admitted breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said in a statement. ``The House Judiciary
Committee has laid out a compelling case that the president
committed perjury. Unless the president comes forward soon and
admits his guilt, I am prepared to vote for articles of impeachment
charging him with perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Democratic opponent of impeachment said that the president
had accomplished one critical task that could help persuade members
that censure was a more appropriate penalty than impeachment and
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put to rest that he is treating this proceeding in a
cavalier manner,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a member of the
Judiciary panel. ``The sincerity was clear. It is obvious the
president understands he has behaved wrongfully and will suffer the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The president departs for the Middle East early Saturday morning
and wanted to address the matter before leaving Washington for the
four-day journey, according to aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do it before the trip so it won't bedevil him
while he is in Israel,'' a senior White House official said. ``He
is just loath to talk about it on foreign soil.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the president did not expect immediately to change
any impeachment votes with his remarks. But he hoped to ``freeze''
opinion while he was gone, leaving open the option of a second,
more forceful appeal to undecided members of Congress when he
returns late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to begin debate on the Judiciary
Committee impeachment report on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Near the end of his remarks, Clinton cited four lines from
Edward FitzGerald's translation of ``The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''
as capturing his regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ```The moving finger writes and, having write, moves on. Nor all
your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line, nor
all your tears wash out a word of it,''' the president read.
</P>
<P>
   ``So nothing _ not piety, nor tears, nor wit, nor torment _ can
alter what I have done. I must make my peace with that,'' Clinton
said with a bite of his lower lip and a note of resignation. ``I
must also be at peace with the fact that the public consequences of
my actions are in the hands of the American people and their
representatives in Congress,'' Clinton added. ``Should they
determine that my errors of word and deed require their rebuke and
censure, I am ready to accept that.''

BRAZIL REVISITS PENSIONS, VOTING TO TRIM BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 3rd, 4th &AMP; 5th grafs to clarify; no other changes.)  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With a towering $41.5 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund in the offing, world leaders
and economists nervously scrutinized Brazil last week as its
Congress faced an important vote on cutting pension deficits.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody in Congress was thinking of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian collapse last year prompted instant total cooperation
by local legislators. But the government of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, whose coalition grew more fractious after recent
elections, faces a tougher fight to push through unpopular economic
measures.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote on the pension approached, some coalition allies
jostled for Cabinet posts. Others fielded calls from opponents of
the bill. One hundred legislators just stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   When the unexpected defeat came, the nose-dive in financial
markets was instant, reminding Brazilians that the tolerance so
readily granted to their enormous economy a year ago had been
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is under immense pressure to convince investors that it
can streamline its government to reduce its dependence on outside
financing.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago the country seemed to be hovering near collapse and
threatening to pull down the hemisphere with it. More than $30
billion flew from the foreign reserves, as investors who had been
focusing on the potential for growth instead looked at the
government budget deficit, swollen to 8 percent of the gross
national product, and its debt of $530 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For economists and others, the vote on Dec. 3 highlighted the
difficulties that Cardoso faces in his quest to slash spending and
the variety of factions his administration will have to court.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by the defeat, the government lobbied hard to win
congressional approval for a measure to increase pension
contributions from charities and small businesses. Although the
private pension system's troubles are minor compared with the
cavernous deficit in the public retirement system, the victory
showed that the government could pick up the thread of change that
it had dropped the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts acknowledged that they might have overreacted
to the congressional setback. The Sao Paulo stock market climbed
back from the 8.8 percent ditch that it fell into the day after the
defeat of the pension bill.
</P>
<P>
   But investors and economists also described the stock plunge as
inevitable. It corrected a surge of unrealistic enthusiasm that
followed the IMF commitment to Brazil and priced in the political
uncertainties that investors had initially overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   In national elections two months ago government-allied parties
increased their representation in Congress. But the new allies
represented a wide range of interests that will force the
government to make greater concessions to win support.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the pension bill failed because the
government, overly confident, neglected the legwork to rally
support. The administration also packed too much into one measure,
focusing on active and retired government workers along with other
groups because of time pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the classical opposition-led defeat but something
that resulted from confusion and discontent within the government's
own ranks,'' the chief equities strategist for Banco Icatu, Rodrigo
Fiaes, wrote in a report about the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have raised pension costs for government workers
who earned more than $960 a month and forced government retirees to
contribute for the first time. It would have also stripped workers
unemployed for long periods of an array of government protections,
including accident, maternity, death and retraining benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deepening recession, which is producing Brazil's worst
unemployment in 15 years, the measure was bitterly attacked,
underscoring the difficulty that the government will have in
winning approval for austerity measures as hardships worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add together the ambition of the allied parties and the
social crisis in Brazil, you're going to have a very explosive
situation for the government,'' said Marcello Deda, leader of the
opposition Workers' Party in the lower chamber of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The tension erupted again this week, as the powerful president
of the Senate, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, offended that he had not
been consulted, blocked Cardoso's efforts to convene a special
session of Congress during the holidays to consider extending a tax
on financial transactions and other austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Magalhaes told reporters in Brasilia, ``did not go
through me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a decision about an extraordinary session that doesn't go
through me is worth nothing,'' the senator added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he pledged to help advocates of land reform who
sought his support in blocking $600 million in budget cuts that
would affect land distribution to the poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Social Security Minister Waldeck Ornelas said the bill that
Congress rejected last week would be presented again in February,
when a new session convenes. Last month, before the IMF package was
announced, the government won a significant victory toward trimming
Social Security for public workers by establishing minimum
retirement ages and a pension ceiling of $960 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally their generous retirement system guarantees
benefits equal to a worker's highest salary for as long as he or
she lives. It has been fueling a pension deficit that experts
expect will exceed $40 billion next year, even with complete
success for the changes, whose savings will be fully realized only
in later years.
</P>
<P>
   This week the government was more successful. It neutralized a
cluster bomb of measures to trim government pension benefits that
had again been crammed into a single bill and successfully
negotiated with the Workers' Party to win support. The government
also agreed to weaken elements of the bill to counter opposition
from legislators who draw tax advantages for private hospitals and
schools that they own under the current rules.
</P>
<P>
   The bill this week would limit Social Security exemptions for
nonprofit organizations, increase pension contributions by small
businesses and raise pension costs for workers in risky and onerous
jobs. Congressional sources estimated that the plan would bring in
$1 billion in revenues next year.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory the government has so far won approval in
Congress for measures that should supply more than $6 billion of
the $23.5 billion in savings promised for next year. It remains for
Congress to extend and increase a tax on financial transactions,
which the government expects will raise $5.8 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress would also have to pass the reduced budget, which
Cardoso is counting on for $7 billion in savings. And it has to
vote on the guidelines for laying off tens of thousands of Civil
Service workers.

Secret talks put a deal in sight
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stern, Hunter take NBA bull by the horns
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NBA commissioner David Stern and union executive director Billy
Hunter have been holding secret meetings and are close to reaching
a deal that could end the 164-day-old NBA lockout before Christmas,
sources close to the negotiations told the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said the framework for a new collective bargaining
agreement could be hammered out as early as next week, putting NBA
players back on the court by the end of January and salvaging what
had been getting precariously close to a lost season.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are still in a ``delicate'' stage, but Stern and Hunter
are close to resolving several points of contention in the
often-acrimonious labor negotiations between the owners and the
National Basketball Players' Association. And the only way they
felt it could get done was away from the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy as well as David understands the fact that if we get
this (a new agreement) done, they're going to have to do it,'' said
one source of the secret meetings. ``They weren't going to get it
done (with the negotiating committees) because there was just too
much finger-pointing going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking each individual issue and coming to an
agreement so each side understands what the other has agreed to.
When they finally come in there (to the full negotiating
committees), they're going to have it down so neither side can say,
`No, that's not what I meant.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way it's going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Hunter brought in scaled-down negotiating teams for a
secret five-hour meeting in New York on Thursday. Stern and deputy
commissioner Russ Granik represented the owners, and Hunter and
union president Patrick Ewing represented the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed not to discuss any of the details, and I don't want
to break that pledge,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   More discussions are planned for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key issues reportedly hammered out is the percentage
of basketball-related income (BRI) to be divided between players
and owners. The owners began negotiations requesting a 50-50 split,
while players had a 60-40 split as their starting point.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that the final agreement will have players
receiving an average of 54 percent of BRI over the life of a
seven-year agreement, even though the union was still asking for a
bit more than that as of Friday. The owners will respond by
relaxing their proposal for a timing-rule change, which would have
forced teams that sign another team's free agent to forfeit the
right to go over the salary cap to re-sign their own Larry Bird
exception free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The timing-rule change reportedly will be phased in after two or
three years, with possible exemptions involved to make it less
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be unhappy people on both sides when this
(agreement) is announced,'' said one source. ``But that's
understandable when you look at the hard-line stance both sides
took during the course of this lockout. Something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some things the players are going to get
that the owners won't be happy with, and there are some things the
owners are going to get that aren't going to make the players
happy. But that's part of the negotiating process.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some grumbling over concessions, approval of the new
collective bargaining agreement by the union rank and file is not
expected to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that will not be a problem,'' said one union source of
approval. ``These guys have so much faith in Billy that when he
brings something to him, they're going to feel that it's the best
deal they could get. They trust him that much. As soon as the
negotiating committee gets through reviewing it, I'm confident it
will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility seemed remote at best just one week ago, when
it appeared the cancellation of the season was imminent. But such a
move would cost the league an estimated $2 billion in revenues and
the players just over $1 billion in salaries and would do untold
damage to an image that has been embraced by corporate sponsors
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say both Stern and Hunter were unhappy with the
contentious nature of the negotiating meetings, preferring instead
to meet one-on-one, or in small groups, minus all the distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings had gone beyond negotiating,'' said one source.
``We had real serious negotiating problems. We'd start negotiating
on a point, but for whatever reason, things would break down into
shouting matches. It gets to the point where everyone is (angry) at
each other, and nothing gets accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can get more accomplished in a smaller group. They've
been over this territory so many times that it's not like they're
starting from scratch. It's just Billy and David saying, `Can you
sell this to your people?' and, `Can you sell this to yours?'
That's what's allowing this (stalemate) to break.''
</P>
<P>
   The next hurdle will be getting players in camp while the
agreement is drawn up and ratified, a process that could take two
weeks, even though some think the process could be condensed to 10
days. Stern has indicated in the past that a handshake deal would
not be enough to lift the lockout, since that occurred after the
brief 1995 lockout, when misunderstandings and disagreements over
``unresolved issues'' caused further tensions between players and
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, one management source said, ``The lockout will
continue until the ink is dry on the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, at least three weeks would be necessary to sign free
agents, make trades, hold an abbreviated training camp and squeeze
in either an exhibition game or a scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The league will reportedly organize a schedule that will have
teams playing exclusively in their respective conferences, which is
what hockey did after the lockout of 1994-95, when the NHL, after a
six-day camp, wound up playing 48 games in a 102-day regular
season. Every NHL game that season was played in-conference, with
more weight given to divisional games.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA will go with a schedule that is all in-conference,
meaning the only time East will meet West will be in the NBA
Finals. But the NBA will go with a balanced, completely redrawn
52-game schedule, which means the Rockets would play each of the
other 13 Western Conference teams four times. Because each Eastern
Conference team would have 14 opponents, a slight adjustment will
be necessary for those clubs to play 52 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the traditional thing to do,'' said one NBA source,
``but it's not going to be a traditional season.''
</P>
<P>
   Is 52 games enough to make a meaningful season? Consider that at
the halfway point of last season, the top eight teams in each
conference were the same eight that made the playoffs _ Chicago,
Indiana, Miami, New Jersey, New York, Charlotte, Atlanta and
Cleveland in the East, and Utah, Seattle, San Antonio, Houston,
Phoenix, Portland, Minnesota and the Lakers in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Should the season begin Feb. 1, which is the date many are
pointing to right now, the Rockets would have 40 games left on
their old schedule, which ends April 21.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the extra 12 games necessary to reach 52, the NBA
would play through what would have been the All-Star break (Feb.
10-16) and tack on an additional two weeks to the end of the
regular season, perhaps going until May 10. As a result, the
playoffs would be pushed back toward the end of June, with Game 7
of the Finals scheduled for no later than July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it makes any sense to us or to them (TV
networks) to put the Finals on into July,'' Granik said.
``Households using television drops so dramatically as you approach
July 4th weekend, that I don't think that is a realistic
possibility.''

Rumors run ahead of action at baseball meetings
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The baseball winter meetings, which resumed
Friday after a six-year absence, are famous for big deals and
bigger rumors.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of that reputation stood up on Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slow day when the sight of Steve Avery walking into the
interview room qualifies as big news, but that was the highlight of
Friday's dealings. The veteran lefthander signed a one-year deal
with Cincinnati, officially kicking off the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a few rumors were making the rounds, including one
involving the Astros, and the agent for Kevin Brown hinted that his
client is close _ perhaps within hours _ of announcing who will
employ that talented right arm for the next five, six or seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash brushed off speculation the
Astros and Toronto had reached an agreement on a trade that would
send outfielder Derek Bell and righthanded reliever Jay Powell to
Toronto for five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Ash said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are believed to be pushing for a package anchored
by Bell and righthander Scott Elarton. Outfielder Carl Everett's
name also has been mentioned in recent speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said five teams remain in the running for Clemens, with two
teams farther along in the process than the other three. The Astros
are believed to be one of the two front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that we'll leave here (Nashville) without
getting this done,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our winter-meetings practice. In the past, clubs
always have shown a willingness to do deals in this setting. This
isn't Rocket science; excuse the pun. This is a matter of trying to
get the best deal possible.''
</P>
<P>
   All eyes will continue to focus on Clemens and Astro-killer
Brown, who reportedly has narrowed his choice of teams to Los
Angeles and Baltimore _ the only two willing to meet agent Scott
Boras' demand for a six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Once the two marquee pitchers have landed with new teams, it
could have a domino effect on other dealings and create the kind of
excitement that gave this annual session its reputation in the late
1980s and early '90s _ before team owners got fed up with the kind
of money being paid out and canceled the gathering of baseball's
general managers.
</P>
<P>
   In signing Avery, the Reds reunited the lefthander with the man
who replaced him in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, 10-7 for Boston last season, was the Braves' No. 4
starter in 1996 until Atlanta acquired Denny Neagle from
Pittsburgh. Avery was bumped to the bullpen, became a free agent
after the 1996 World Series, and spent the last two seasons with
the Red Sox, where he was a combined 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle was traded to the Reds last month in a four-player deal
also involving Bret Boone and Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, 28, the Red Sox's No. 4 starter most of 1998, said: ``I
like hitting, and I like the NL cities. That's not a knock on the
AL. But I think if you're a pitcher, you like the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a hitter, you like the AL. And I'm no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's only other deal involved outfielder Tony Phillips
agreeing to terms with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is said to be interested in Astros righthander
Sean Bergman, and the Astros would seem to have an excess of
starting pitching _ if there is such a thing _ assuming Chris Holt
makes a full recovery from rotator-cuff surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker is expected to arrive
here on Sunday, and he would love to return home with a deal for
Clemens. But he probably would settle for addressing a couple of
the Astros' other needs _ a righthanded reliever and a righthanded
bat off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   In other major-league rumblings, Reds shortstop Barry Larkin has
asked to be traded, listing five teams as possible destinations _
including the Dodgers, Cardinals, Cubs and Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden has said he doesn't intend to
trade Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have explored trade possibilities involving All-Star
outfielder Greg Vaughn, and Boston appears to have an interest.
Also, all-time steals leader Rickey Henderson is expected to sign
with either the Mets or Mariners by the time the winter meetings
end.

Reconnecting with the past gives Drexler's Cougars direction
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
RALEIGH, N.C. _ Never mind the flecks of gray in the hair, the age
lines that sprint away from the corners of the eyes or the extra
pound or so around the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you know you're getting old:
</P>
<P>
   At a recent practice, University of Houston assistant basketball
coach Reid Gettys was asked a question by one of his players.
``Coach,'' the kid wanted to know, ``have we ever played North
Carolina State before?''
</P>
<P>
   Have the Dodgers played the Yankees? Have the Colts played the
Jets? Has Poland ever played Germany?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' said Gettys, smiling and then swinging his arm to
deliver a mock backhand. ``I just wanted to smack him.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive them their naivet, these millennium-straddling
dribblers. The oldest, Gee Gervin, was only 6{ years old on April
4, 1983, the gloomiest night in Cougars basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Anders just misses the steal. Dereck Whittenburg launches
the fateful airball. Lorenzo Charles stuffs in the dunk for the
NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State 54, Houston 52.
</P>
<P>
   It was the night when Jimmy Valvano seemed to sprint all over
downtown Albuquerque, N.M., searching for somebody to hug and the
Cougars left the floor with a vacant look in their eyes that hasn't
gone completely away, even 15 year later.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings them all to tonight's encounter at Reynolds
Coliseum, just another game on the schedule for the rookie head
coach's 4-3 team, but full of tainted memories for Clyde Drexler
and his staff. For Drexler, a junior, it was his last collegiate
game before leaving for the NBA. Michael Young was a junior, Gettys
a sophomore and George Walker a graduate assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde, as you might expect, tries to glide over any show of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I would have liked to have won that game,'' he said.
``But look at it this way. If we had won like everybody expected,
the world might never have heard of Jim Valvano. That was his claim
to fame, and now he's gone. Maybe you have to say that every event
does have a purpose from some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you, there are February games against the
Clippers that I can remember every detail of the loss. The key is
to learn and then let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Without a doubt. No different than a loss to the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   So consider this tale told by Gettys, who is in charge of
putting together the schedule:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Saturday morning last May, just a couple of hours
before the Rockets were going to play the Jazz in Game 5 of the
playoffs, and I called Clyde in his hotel room in Salt Lake City.
He was going out the door to the game when I got him. He was in a
hurry. But I said, `Just one question. I've got a chance to line up
a game with N.C. State. Do you want it?' And he didn't hesitate for
a second. `Absolutely!' he said. `Get them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was last Saturday night after the Cougars survived a
63-61 win at Sacramento State. Drexler had just finished addressing
the media when Tom Abatemarco, the losing coach and a former N.C.
State reserve, entered the room. He walked right up to Drexler,
shoved his hand with the NCAA championship ring in Clyde's face and
said, ``Yeah, but I got you in '83.''
</P>
<P>
   What is often forgotten is N.C. State got UH twice in '83,
winning 76-64 behind Spud Webb in the Hall of Fame Classic at
Springfield, Mass., to open the next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack will finally pay a visit to Hofheinz Pavilion next
year. A four-game set with Georgetown is on tap, and the Coogs are
trying to get a series with North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gettys jokes that he seeks revenge on all of UH's conquerors in
the Final Four in '82, '83 and '84. But it's actually part of the
big picture, which is to upgrade the schedule considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be happy to have every game against a Top 25 team,''
Drexler said. ``That's the only way we're going to get where we
want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gettys works the phones. He has managed to get the Cougars a
spot in the high-profile Top of the World Classic next year in
Nome, Alaska. They will likely play in the Puerto Rico Shootout in
2000, Rainbow Classic (Hawaii) in 2001 and Great Alaska Shootout in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA, Stanford, Kentucky, Duke, Temple _ we'll play any of
them,'' he said. ``We want to get this back to where we were. I
remember how that excitement and emotion felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they have to spoon-feed it to the next generation. So
the other day at practice, in the middle of three-on-two drills,
Gettys called out to Treva Crosby, a sophomore, who was 5 years old
in 1983:
</P>
<P>
   ``Treva, how do we feel about N.C. State?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate 'em!''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clyde smiled. It's all part of the teaching process.

BURNED STUDENT OFF CRITICAL LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICIA FARRELL AIDEM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hart High School senior Christopher James was
taken off the critical list Friday, days after he exercised his
burned vocal cords for the first time in two weeks to tell his
mother, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors upgraded James' condition from critical to serious after
performing the latest in a series of skin-grafting surgeries, said
Larry Weinberg, spokesman for the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman
Oaks Hospital. The 17-year-old was severely burned Nov. 25 in a
physics class experiment on the football field of the Newhall
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's past the critical shock stage,'' Weinberg said. ``He now
has a tracheotomy tube that allows him to speak somewhat. I don't
think they want him to talk too much, but the first thing was to
his mom. He said, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   James and two classmates were burned the day before Thanksgiving
while participating in a physics experiment that involved homemade
cannons ignited by burning methanol.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel flashed, severely burning James and classmate Nolan
LeMar.
</P>
<P>
   James inhaled the superheated fuel, burning his vocal cords, and
35 percent of his body was severely burned. LeMar suffered burns
over 12 percent of his body and was released from the Sherman Oaks
hospital Sunday. Classmate Jesse Honea was treated at Henry Mayo
Newhall Memorial Hospital and released the day of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened during the physics class is being
investigated by Sheriff's Department arson specialists and school
officials, but the William S. Hart Union High School District has
halted such experiments until their questions are answered. The
experiment is not uncommon, and is used to teach students to
measure velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's surgery was expected to be one of the final skin
graftings for James. Doctors took healthy skin from the teen's back
and used it to cover the last of the burned areas to prevent
life-threatening infection caused by bacteria from decaying skin.
</P>
<P>
   Infection is still the greatest threat to the varsity soccer
player, but doctors are ``always more comfortable when they've
covered the damaged skin,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the grafting is done,'' he said. ``Everybody can feel
a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also viewed James' lungs and vocal cords with a scope
and were pleased with his progress.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements have raised James' spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten a lift from being able to talk with his folks,''
Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   According to his parents, he is visited constantly by relatives
and school friends.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a passionate debate that was by turns solemn
with history, fiercely partisan and at times sorrowful, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Friday to impeach
President Clinton and remove him from office for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled committee approved three articles of
impeachment after more than 12 hours of rancorous deliberations. It
charged the president with ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' both before a grand jury and in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit. And the committee charged that Clinton had
``prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in one instance did a Republican, Rep. Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina, break with his party, aligning with the Democrats
against the second perjury charge for a vote of 20 to 17. The other
articles passed, 21 to 16. Graham had long said that he would not
support impeachment for a lie in a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The committee adjourned for the evening, planning to resume
debate on the fourth article of impeachment, on abuse of power, on
Saturday. Because it moved so swiftly Friday on the articles, the
panel will also take up a censure resolution drafted by Democrats,
but it is not expected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   So what began as a civil sex harassment suit by Ms. Jones, an
obscure Arkansas civil servant, and then was transformed into a
criminal investigation of sex and mendacity by the president, left
Clinton Friday as only the third president to confront impeachment,
with a House vote scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson was spared removal from office by one vote in the
Senate after the House impeached him in 1868. Richard Nixon
resigned in disgrace in the Watergate scandal 24 years ago after
the Judiciary Committee approved three articles against him, but
before the House voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman, brought the
Judiciary Committee's ten-week inquiry towards a close, insisting
on the gravity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president performs the public act of asking God to
witness his promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, that is not trivial,'' the Illinois Republican said.
``Whether it's a civil suit or before the grand jury the
significance of the oath cannot or must not be cheapened if our
proud boast that we are a government of laws and not of men is to
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself commented for the first time since the committee
began televised proceedings. Just minutes before the committee was
to take its first vote, the president walked into the Rose Garden
and spoke once again of his remorse for his affair with Ms.
Lewinsky. For the first time he publicly said he would accept a
rebuke or censure, but there were no indications that his offer
moved the Republican leaders off their determination to deny a vote
on anything but impeachment in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through and for what members of both
parties in Congress are now forced to deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past months have been a torturous process of coming to
terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand that
accountability demands consequences and I'm prepared to accept
them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family. There is no greater agony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped well short of the admission that some
undecided Republicans were looking for that he had in fact lied
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the Judiciary Committee left the debate to watch
the president on television. Minutes later, in the same cavernous
hearing room where Nixon's fate was weighed 24 years ago, they
returned to approve the first article of impeachment and moved on
to debate a second article on perjury.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats argued that Clinton had deceived the nation, but
said he did not deserve removal from office for lies about an
extra-marital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up America'' implored Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida,
calling for the nation, which polls show overwhelmingly opposes
impeachment, to make its feelings known. ``They are about to
impeach our president. They are about to reverse two national
elections. They are about to discard your votes.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With the House instructed to return next Thursday, the
president's chances of avoiding trial in the Senate _ where his
opponents are exceedingly unlikely to get the 67 votes needed for
conviction _ rest with a few dozen Republican moderates. The vote
is considered too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, both parties in the House were
prepared to take extraordinary steps to bring back members,
including carrying one California congressman recuperating from
surgery to Washington on an air ambulance if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Clinton is not making headway, six previously
undeclared Republicans _ Jack Metcalf of Washington, Saxby Chamblis
of Georgia, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
Florida, Bob Franks of New Jersey and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New
Jersey _ came out in favor of impeachment or said they were leaning
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed from the president today was an admission, not
contrition,'' Franks said after Clinton's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And a moderate Republican who has said he opposes impeachment,
Rep. Amo Houghton of New York, became the target of a conservative
Republican who said he would run against Houghton in 2000. Jim
Pierce said Houghton had ``betrayed'' conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has not been in the direction of those who want to
avoid impeachment,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, New York's new
senator-elect. ``Over the weekend Americans are going to realize
this is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a signal from the Senate Friday that it was
suddenly taking seriously the possibility that it could become the
jury in a trial of the president. The press secretaries of Trent
Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, and Tom Daschle, the
minority leader from South Dakota, did something they rarely do _
put out a joint statement. All it said was that the two men would
make no comment until after the House acted.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a year ago that the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, began investigating the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and whether he was trying to persuade her to commit
perjury in the Paula Jones case. The investigation plunged the
White House into a yearlong crisis that Clinton compounded when he
emphatically told the nation that he had not had sex ``with that
woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later Starr reported to Congress that he had
``substantial and credible evidence'' that Clinton had committed 11
possibly impeachable offenses in his effort to cover-up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Hyde said ``we all agree any impeachment cannot
succeed unless it is done in a bipartisan way.'' But on Friday he
defended his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be an endless process,'' he said. ``I
think it's in the interest of the country to finish it and we have
tried to do our level best. And I have tried to grant every request
the Democrats have made. Maybe I haven't succeeded, but I have
certainly tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, as he called for impeachment, praised a few of the
committee's Democrats. He said he admired Schumer greatly. He spoke
kindly of Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Wisconsin Democrat. ``He has tried
to say to this committee, `Let's bring the country together,'''
Graham said. ``What a noble cause. Don't worry, Mr. Barrett, if we
don't come together. This country is strong. We shall survive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the long day went on the partisanship became ever more
pronounced. Democrats fought to the end against every charge
against Clinton and they plunged the committee Republicans into
some noticeable confusion when they demanded to know precisely
which of the president's statements were perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had simply stated broadly in the articles of
impeachment that the lies involved the ``nature and details'' of
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, including his own
statements and his failure to stop his lawyer from making
misleading statements in the Jones deposition, and his efforts to
influence the testimony of witnesses in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the language of the Starr report, which had mainly
referred to the offenses as lying under the oath, the Republican
language characterized Clinton's statements as perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats wanted the particulars. When Hyde demurred that
David Schippers, the Republicans' investigative counsel, had ``set
out in detail'' the lies on Thursday, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,
shot back, ``Then you should be able to tell me what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dealing with fun and games here,'' joined in
Schumer, forcing the Republicans onto the uncomfortable ground of
describing the difference between Ms. Lewisnky's and Clinton's
versions of their sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had to summon Schippers and his other chief aide, Thomas
Mooney to his side. It was finally Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., who gave detailed answers to the democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned Clinton's denial when he was asked whether ``oral
sex performed on you'' was within the definition of sexual
relations used in the Jones case. He noted that Clinton conceded
that ``kissing or touching of the breast or genitalia of another
person'' would be covered by the definition, and yet the president
had still denied lying in his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony is false and misleading,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, charged that the
Republicans were guilty of ``deliberate vagueness and obfuscation''
because they were prepared to impeach Clinton over definitions of
sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., answered: ``This is not trivial
at all. He goes to a grand jury and lies again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of Watergate were evoked repeatedly. Harkening back
to that scandal 24 years ago, Republicans said that the articles of
impeachment against Nixon had also lacked a detailed bill of
particulars.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over obstruction of justice was equally heated as the
two parties squabbled over whether attempts by administration
officials and by Vernon Jordan Jr., Clinton's close friend, to find
Ms. Lewinsky a job were designed to keep her quiet about her affair
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was a job hunt _ we all agree there was a job
hunt,'' Schumer said. But he said it was unfair to assume the
worst, adding, ``We need more than surmise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at other moments the debate reached a higher plane that
was conscious of history, as members of the committee quoted the
nation's founders, George Washington and John Kennedy, and recalled
wrenching chapters in history. ``If there is a vote to impeach, it
will not be the end of our Republic,'' said Rep. Bill Jenkins,
R-Tenn.. ``Although our system is fragile, it has survived
impeachment. It has survived two world wars and numerous other
conflicts, the Great Depression and a very bitter Civil War.''

HASEK AGAIN SHUTS OUT THE RANGERS, AND THEY GET TESTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Goalie Dominik Hasek of the Sabres gets lots of
shutouts. Some are spectacular, the kind that have prompted voters
to award him the Vezina and Hart trophies for the last two seasons
as the best goalie and the most valuable player in the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Others are just routine. That was the case Friday night, when
Hasek made only 16 saves in a 2-0 victory over the Rangers. It was
so routine that he was not even the most interesting Sabre. That
distinction went to Mike Peca, who scored the winning goal, and his
linemate Vaclav Varada, who scored the other one and had many
Rangers angry at him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hasek's second shutout against the Rangers this season
and his fifth over all, to lead the league. Mike Richter, the
Ranger goalie, was the man of the match, making 30 saves, many of
them spectacular. The only shot that beat him was a backhander by
Peca, the Sabres' captain, with 2 minutes 1 second remaining in
what was then a scoreless game, a rebound that was the third shot
of a high-pressure volley.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a minute remaining and Richter out of his net for
an extra attacker, Varada scored for Buffalo into the empty net. He
took his time about it, tantalizing Todd Harvey, who chased him
down the ice, before depositing the puck over the line as if it
were a Christmas card in a mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   After the red light flashed, Harvey continued his pursuit,
following the celebrating Varada to the sideboards. From behind,
Harvey hit him on the head, triggering an angry scrum of players
immediately and another one after the next face-off.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were angry not only for the empty-net goal, but for
something Varada said two weeks ago after Buffalo beat the Rangers
by 4-2. When asked how hard it was for his line to check Wayne
Gretzky's line, Varada said it was easy, that he did not have much
to do because Gretzky spent much of that game, two weeks ago, in
the middle of the ice without the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to talk about that kind of stuff in the papers,
that is up to him,'' Harvey said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's deed could be reviewed for suspension by Colin
Campbell, the National Hockey's Leagues chief disciplinarian.
However, Campbell is the former Rangers coach and he has chosen
twice this season not to suspend New York players for flagrant
fouls. One was a ``slew-foot'' trip by Jeff Beukeboom; the other
was a flagrant elbow by Ulf Samuelsson.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought the league should investigate Harvey's
deed, Varada said: ``They should do something. It's not my
decision. I got fined last game for a cross-check.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggested that the Rangers remained angry about his
words regarding Gretzky, Varada said: ``I said what was the truth.
I didn't lie and I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's attack was similar to that by Washington's Dale Hunter
against Pierre Turgeon, then with the Islanders, in the 1993
playoffs. Hunter was suspended for 21 games, but Turgeon suffered a
severe shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Varada said he was not hurt except for a headache. But earlier
this season, Matt Johnson of Los Angeles was suspended for 12 games
after knocking Beukeboom unconscious with a sucker punch.
Beukeboom, who returned for a few games, has missed the last two
with post-concussion syndrome. The league has said it is cracking
down on blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the Rangers coach, said he did not see Harvey's
hit. But Lindy Ruff, the Buffalo coach, said: ``I didn't like the
fact that Harvey came from all the way from across the ice to jump
him from behind. That wasn't really called for. If you're going to
get a guy and you're upset with him, get him at the right time.
After he scores a goal, he's not looking. I guess it was a cheap
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 0-2-1 against Buffalo this season, including a
0-0 tie, and are 0-6-3 against them in their last nine meetings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers' second consecutive defeat. Their last best
chance to tie was hurt in the final minute when defenseman Mathieu
Schneider was sent off for elbowing Jay McKee after the Rangers had
pulled Richter for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, several Rangers bumped Varada hard, but
that didn't give them an edge in the first period. After 20
minutes, the Sabres had a 14-2 advantage in shots, and one of the
Rangers' two shots came in the final seconds, from near the New
York blue line, by Brian Leetch, near the end of an ineffective
power play. During two power plays in the first half of the second
period, the Rangers had no shots on goal, although a couple
whistled inches wide of Hasek's posts.
</P>
<P>
   As play ground on toward the second intermission, the top lines
for both teams got good chances, grinding and cycling deep. Petr
Nedved's line and Gretzky's line threatened, as did Peca's. But,
after 40 minutes, the score was 0-0 with Buffalo holding a 22-9
edge in shots

POLITICAL COST OF MEXICAN BANK BAILOUT IS MOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 11th &AMP; 12th grafs with details of pressure lawmakers are
placing on Ortiz; In optional trim, subs 2nd &AMP; 3rd grafs with
biographical details for Ortiz. ) (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Although at heart a bookish economist, Guillermo
Ortiz rose to become one of the most powerful people in Mexico and
as finance minister won acclaim for steering the country through
the fiscal equivalent of a category 5 hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the center of a controversy that has brought Mexico's
young democracy to a high-risk impasse and severely tested the
ability of the country's Congress to resolve issues through the
dickering and deal-making of party politics.
</P>
<P>
   A major opposition group, the conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, has demanded that Ortiz resign as head of the Banco
de Mexico, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The party's lawmakers charge that as finance minister he
violated the Constitution in putting together a $61 billion
emergency program to rescue sinking banks during the economic
crisis of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators argue that he should have obtained congressional
approval when he financed the bailout with government debt. Ortiz
responded that the program had been vetted by government legal
advisers before they were carried out and had been repeatedly
reviewed by Congress since then.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo and his party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, closed ranks around Ortiz last week,
firmly if belatedly, saying he would not resign.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is Mexico's continued financial stability. The ups and
downs of the long bailout debate, which began in February, have
shaken the country's markets, left the banks in limbo and rattled
the nerves of international investors.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions have tied up the Congress for weeks, even
pushing aside deliberations about the 1999 federal budget, which
must be approved by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fight over Ortiz is couched in high-toned legal
arguments, it is driven by plain old politics. The National Action
Party has drawn up an ambitious proposal to reorganize the bailout
program, which is believed by many taxpayers to have rescued
crooked bankers at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   To pass the proposal, the party's lawmakers have been forced
into an uneasy alliance with the governing party, which has the
largest delegation in the lower house of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But anxious to avoid appearing to voters as a handmaiden to a
government party they consider corrupt, the National Action Party
wants to exact a political price from Zedillo. It wants Ortiz's
head, and the party's legislators say they will not even vote for
their own bailout solution if they do not get it.
</P>
<P>
   This week, those lawmakers upped the ante even more, announcing
that unless Ortiz resigned they would not approve $1.8 billion
allotted in next year's budget to cover payments on the current
bailout program.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure became so high that embarrassing splits began
to show in the party's ranks, with some leaders uncomfortable with
the personal attack on Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' price is high indeed. If Zedillo lets Ortiz fall,
he will tacitly admit that he also was at fault in the bailout,
acknowledging an offense that would be impeachable were the
president not protected by the Constitution from prosecution while
in office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ortiz, who is admired on Wall Street for his
hard-headed approach to fiscal management, is the first official to
start a full term as head of the central bank since it was endowed
with new independence in 1994 in legislation written, interestingly
enough, by the National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the president must open an impeachment trial
against Ortiz to remove him, something he is not about to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is questioning my performance as head of the Banco de
Mexico,'' Ortiz said in an interview. ``This is not about me; it is
about preserving the autonomy of the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the president's thinking said:
``Losing Ortiz would send a terrible message of weakness. It would
signal the markets that the government bows to populist demands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ortiz, who is 50, is an unlikely figure to provoke such a
dramatic standoff. Trained at Stanford University, he is an
economic pragmatist who never adopted the lordly manner of past
finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 it fell to him as finance minister to have to push a
federal budget through an opposition-controlled Congress for the
first time in modern Mexico. Through down-to-earth lobbying, he
walked it through without a major quarrel.
</P>
<P>
   But his career has been clouded by spectacular scandals
involving Mexicans who bought banks from the government during a
privatization campaign in the early 1990s. Ortiz was chairman of
the committee that oversaw the sale of 18 banks, which was hailed
as an exemplary success at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But three buyers _ Carlos Cabal Peniche, Angel Isidoro Rodriguez
Saez and Jorge Lankenau Rocha _ misused the banks so badly that
they now face criminal-fraud charges amounting to hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government doesn't want to admit its responsibility,''
said Gerardo Buganza, a National Action lawmaker. ``It is just
caprice on the part of President Zedillo to keep the man who did it
wrong the first time.''

   ST. CLOUD, Minn. _ A natural-gas pipeline exploded in the middle
of downtown shortly before noon Friday, killing four people,
injuring 16 others and leveling three buildings in a one-block
area.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the blast, which blew out windows several blocks
away and could be felt up to five miles away created a dust cloud
that covered the entire downtown area and hurled debris up to three
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said a construction crew laying fiber-optic
cable accidentally ruptured the line, releasing gas into the air.
Firefighters and investigators from Northern States Power Co. were
on the scene warning people of the leak and evacuating the area
when the explosion was sparked. The cause of the spark was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dead were employees of the power company who were
investigating the leak. The other two were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Michael Holman of the St. Cloud fire department said all
potential victims had been accounted for, and he said crews would
work through the night, with the help of search dogs, heavy
equipment and dozens of volunteers to clear the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the injured were treated at the hospital,
including two firefighters and four victims who were rescued from
the rubble. One woman was in critical condition undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area can be pretty busy during lunchtime,'' Holman said.
``We're very lucky this didn't happen even a half-hour later.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred in the Courthouse Square section of the city,
the central part of downtown. A bar, a restaurant and a two-story
building containing a law office and apartments were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Murray was delivering beer to Bookem's, the bar that was
destroyed, when the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing in the bar making my delivery when I felt this
enormous push of air,'' he said. ``The next thing I knew I was
outside the bar. It was like a movie, everything happening in slow
motion and debris flying everywhere. The dust was so thick I
couldn't see a foot in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred just one block from the headquarters of the
fire and police departments, and Murray said authorities were
immediately on the scene to help victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back inside the bar to find the owner, and by the time
I located him and came back out, police were giving first aid and
evacuating people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities shut off power and gas to the area immediately
and evacuated a six-block area that included an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Len Smallwood of the St. Cloud police department, who felt
the windows shake in his office a block away, said he and other
officers ran outside to assist after hearing the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We headed out the doors and there was debris just floating in
the air and this huge dust cloud,'' he said, likening the scene to
his experience at war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't see anything like it except for Vietnam,'' Smallwood
said. ``It made me want to take cover.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After clearing the rest of the wreckage to ensure that no
victims were trapped, the authorities said they would begin
investigating what ignited the explosion. Fire officials as well as
investigators from the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety were
sent to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Arne Carlson traveled Friday to St. Cloud, a city of about
58,000 people, 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis. He promised state
emergency money to help pay for the cleanup and emergency services.

ZANARDI PREDICTED HIS RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only did Alex Zanardi seal his future by capturing the
Championship Auto Racing Teams title, he also predicted it.
</P>
<P>
   A second straight championship nudged Zanardi into seeking
Formula One employment, which he secured by signing a lucrative
contract to drive next season and beyond for Frank Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But before Zanardi departed for Italy, where he lives, he proved
prophetic by announcing he would return to Indianapolis Motor
Speedway before any of his CART peers.
</P>
<P>
   As it eventually turned out, Zanardi was right.
</P>
<P>
   A rumor became a reality last week when IMS owner Tony George
and F-1 czar Bernie Ecclestone said the series will return to the
United States in 2000 for the first time since 1991, when it waved
bye-bye to Phoenix after three financially dismal performances.
</P>
<P>
   While some purists believe the additions of NASCAR's Brickyard
400 and now the U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis will further dilute
the prestige and glamour of the track, which for 82 years was the
site of only the Indy 500 and nothing else, there's no question
that F-1 needs to be in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the defunct Iceberg Grand Prix through the streets of
downtown Phoenix attracted ridiculously sparse crowds, those fans
who did pony up the cost of outrageously priced tickets ($50 for
standing room only) watched some of the all-time greatest drivers.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to judge the immense talents of such drivers as
Alain Prost and the late Ayrton Senna on a temporary downtown road
course lacking technological genius, but there should be no
question regarding Senna's abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Senna could have negotiated a one-hour commute home during rush
hour into a 20-minute breeze. And he would have done so without so
much as a scratch on the fender.
</P>
<P>
   F-1's recent version of Senna is Germany's Michael Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Finland's Mika Hakkinen captured this year's crown,
Schumacher remains the sport's heralded star.
</P>
<P>
   A chance to see Schumacher in person should be on any fan's
holiday wish list. And if F-1 racing continues to put on decent
shows, unlike some years when there were more passes at a shy
people's convention than there were on the racetrack, whatever
George charges will be money well-spent.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is Ecclestone. I don't trust him.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, city officials share some of the blame for entering into a
contract in which it would pay $8 million over five years to stage
a race and not even share in gate receipts, advertising or
concession revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Ecclestone is the same flighty bird who left the Valley the
day before the first race in 1989, undoubtedly embarrassed by poor
ticket sales, and the same guy who didn't even show up for the 1990
race.
</P>
<P>
   Ecclestone stuck around for the third race, assuring at least
one member of the media that the series would return for the
contract's final two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will exhaust all possibilities before we even think'' of
moving to another state, Ecclestone said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during the course of two telephone calls seven months
later, Ecclestone informed city officials that the circuit would
not return.
</P>
<P>
   Ecclestone cited low attendance, among other reasons, for
pulling the plug on the financial nightmare, leaving the city with
an approximate $1.2 million bill for garages, barricades and other
race-related capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I don't think it looked like a good deal for
Phoenix,'' said Jim Haynes, who was Chamber of Commerce president
at the time. ``It was a very expensive lesson in humility for the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ticket prices ($50 to $100) were astronomical, and there
were very little resources committed to marketing the event by
Formula One,'' Greater Phoenix Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau
President David Radcliffe said. ``It was always up to the city (to
do the promoting), but (Ecclestone) was the one always making
money. His net (profit) was pretty much guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the city fallout, the on-track performance, while not
always spectacular over the Phoenix layout, still provided a
glimpse into F-1 racing and its stars.
</P>
<P>
   If the racing is as good as it was this past season, it will
have been worth the wait. &QL;

NASCAR SEEKS DRIVER'S SEAT  
 CIRCUIT WANTS TO NEGOTIATE OWN TV DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  TV-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its never-ending search to further fatten the piggy bank,
NASCAR may start doing what other professional sports already do,
which is negotiate its television contracts.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's surging popularity has transformed the sport into a
financial cash cow on four wheels. Yearly souvenir and licensed
merchandise sales should reach $1 billion by 2000, and attendance
is at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings also have increased, up 20.8 percent between
1993 and 1997. During the same period on cable, the increase was 40
percent, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, NASCAR television ratings (5.8) in 1997 were second
only to the NFL (12.2).
</P>
<P>
   So like any business, NASCAR is attempting to take advantage of
its product. And one way it might succeed is studying whether it
would be economically prudent to auction off its TV rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, racetrack owners do their negotiating, a major
reason 33 races this past season were shown on two broadcast (CBS,
ABC) and three cable (ESPN, TNN, TBS) networks. NBC also will join
the mix in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NFL recently signed an eight year, $18 billion
contract for its TV rights, NASCAR rights fees are sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   TNN President David Hall, whose cable network televised nine
Winston Cup races last season, including the Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at
Phoenix International Raceway, estimated the average rights fee
worth of each race is about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every race is not worth the same amount of money,'' Hall said.
``I read where (CBS paid) $12.5 million for the Daytona 500, but
the rest of the races average in the $3 million range, and some are
in the $600,000 range.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if NASCAR's study concludes all parties would be
financially better off by allowing it sole authority to sell the
entire TV rights package, the sanctioning body still will have to
convince racetrack owners to go along with it. And that might be
difficult considering much of a racetrack's annual revenue stems
from rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, between International Speedway Corp., Speedway
Motorsports Inc., and Penske Motorsports Inc., those companies own
nearly half of the racetracks comprising the Winston Cup schedule.
And many of their races are sold as a package.
</P>
<P>
   ISC owns six racetracks, including PIR and Daytona International
Speedway, and SMI also owns six.
</P>
<P>
   ISC spokesman David Talley declined to speculate what NASCAR
might or might not do.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Hall isn't overly worried of losing his place
on the NASCAR map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we would be part of (the future),'' Hall said.
``There's no way we would wake up one day standing on the
sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   PIR Executive Vice President and General Manager Robin Braig
said he hopes Hall is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with TNN,'' Braig said. ``TNN gives us
great coverage and a great lineup of broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   TNN recently extended its contract with PIR by three years,
which now expires in 2001. Although neither Hall nor PIR officials
would reveal the financial terms of the deal, it is believed to be
worth between $15 million and $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the agreement, however, is the Copper World Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, what NASCAR is studying probably will (become a
reality),'' Hall said. ``But I think (NASCAR) has a long, long ways
to go in getting it done.'' &QL;

WASHINGTON HAS BEEN EARLY DISAPPOINTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The early returns from Pac-10 precincts are in, and there aren't
a lot of surprises so far. Stanford, despite losses to North
Carolina and Maryland and some injuries that have thinned its
bench, is still probably the league's best team, although ``Sports
Illustrated's'' preseason No. 1 ranking was ludicrous.
Freshman-intensive Arizona and UCLA are formidable now and will
only get better. California looks like an NCAA Tournament team.
Southern California is exceeding expectations, Oregon and Arizona
State are under construction and Washington State and Oregon State
are laying the groundwork for potential coaching changes.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Washington as the biggest, and most disappointing,
story to date.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1986,
where they advanced to the Sweet 16, and the fourth straight year
of improvement under Coach Bob Bender, the Huskies were supposed to
break through this year. They made everyone's preseason Top 25, and
SI had them eighth. (What's with this infatuation with the Pac-10?)
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Washington has turned the predictions to mush,
making it seem as if last year's hot streak during the tournament
was more like a hot flash. The Huskies are 4-3, losers of three
straight for the first time since the 1994-95 season. After losing
by 20 to Connecticut in the Great Eight, the next two defeats came
at the hands of Boise State and Gonzaga. Both were on the road and
both happened without starting guard Donald Watts, who injured his
ankle in the Boise State game, but this is not how a quality team
is supposed to play.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than Bender, who yelled at his players
after the Gonzaga game, which ended with the Spokane Arena crowd
yelling ``overrated'' at the Huskies. The primary topic on Bender's
agenda was toughness _ the Huskies' apparent lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new for our guys, being an important (opponent)
for people,'' Bender said. ``Obviously, we haven't learned our
lessons yet. That's what needs to sink in. We're not pushing all
the right buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior center Todd MacCulloch scored 28 points against Gonzaga,
trying to fill the void left by Watts, who averaged 16.9 points
last year. Junior forward Chris Walcott added 18. But junior guard
Deon Luton made just 1 of 9 shots. Luton was one of three Huskies,
along with MacCulloch and Watts, who averaged more than 15 points
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Luton will have better days, but the overriding problem
continues to be at point guard. That should have been a red flag
for anyone who fell in love with the Huskies before the season.
Sophomore Dan Dickau and freshman Senque Carey are showing their
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Counting three games at the Hilo Classic in Hawaii, which the
Huskies won against a so-so field, Washington played six straight
games away from home in 11 days because Bender wanted to toughen
his troops. It's far too early to write anyone off, and the Huskies
probably are better than what they have shown lately. The question
is whether they're as good as they were supposed to be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Temple doomed? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An even more mystifying tailspin is Temple's. The Owls, who
appeared to be a bona fide Top 10 team, have lost four straight for
the first time since 1992-93 and for only the third time in head
coach John Chaney's 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the skid should be five, because Temple was admittedly
lucky in coming back to beat Michigan State in their last victory.
The Owls trailed by 10 points with 3:36 to go, but took advantage
of the new held-ball rule to overtake the Spartans on two free
throws by Pepe Sanchez with half a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney remarked before that game that it wouldn't be bad if his
team lost, just to humble his players a little bit. Now it seems
they're getting a bit carried away with that. Like Bender, Chaney
addressed his team at great length and decibel level after the
latest loss, 63-56, at home to Wisconsin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our way,'' Chaney said. ``The guards beat us
tonight. Not the other guards, our guards. We got beat through our
own lack of effort. They were absolutely horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is pretty good at 8-1, and its coach, Dick Bennett, is
excellent. But Chaney is genuinely concerned. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fast breaks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temple has plenty of company in the Atlantic-10 in the letdown
department. Two other teams with high expectations, Massachusetts
and Xavier (Ohio), are off to slow starts. UMass played well in its
59-54 loss to No. 1 Connecticut, but the Minutemen have dropped
four straight since beating Niagara to start the season. Xavier is
missing injured forward Darnell Williams but still has a deep,
veteran team. But the Musketeers have lost four of their past six.
After losing to Toledo on Wednesday, Coach Skip Prosser turned
around en route to his post-game radio show to offer some more
thoughts to his team. He never did the show.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often that a ranked team derives a moral victory from a
loss, but that's how Stanford looked at the Maryland game. Playing
perhaps the best team in the country in a near-road environment
(the MCI Center in Washington, D.C.), the Cardinal shot 40 percent
and had 19 turnovers, yet lost by just two. Forward Peter Sauer
said, ``I think it's a confidence builder. We're not hitting on all
cylinders and we're right there. We know that when we play well, we
can beat any team.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California outscored Loyola Marymount by 37 points
Wednesday _ in the second half. The Trojans shot 29 percent in the
first half and trailed by one point before steamrolling the Lions
after halftime. USC (6-0), off to its best start since 1974-75,
will play at Kansas tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's next game is Dec. 19 at Texas A&AMP;M. The 7-1
Aggies are led by point guard Clifton Cook, a transfer from Howard.
Cook's nickname is ``Fats.'' Why is that? His dad said, ``He was so
overweight when he was a baby that he could barely walk. He just
kind of wobbled. So, one day I called him a `big old fatso.'
Everybody laughed and the nickname stuck. His friends later
shortened it to Fats.'' Let's hear it for positive reinforcement. &QL;

MOTEN ACTIVATED, LIKELY TO KEEP PLANE SEAT

<P>
   Rumors persist that the loser in the Los Angeles-Houston NFL
expan sion sweepstakes will try to bring an existing franchise to
that city, but the Cardinals may not be that team.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Robert McNair has said he would go after
another franchise if Los Angeles is picked over Houston for the
NFL's 32nd team.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to McNair said he would have little interest in
the Cardinals because the team is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   McNair owns the rights to the Houston franchise and wants to run
the team. The Cardinals have been owned by the Bidwill family since
the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials reiterated Friday that they have had no
contact with officials from either city and are spending their time
trying to get a new multipurpose domed stadium in the East Valley. &QL; 
Mike Moten has followed a circu itous path to reclaiming a roster
spot for the Cardinals' stretch drive to the playoffs. He was
activated on Friday when Eric Swann was placed on injured reserve,
officially ending the Pro Bowl defensive tackle's season.
</P>
<P>
   Moten was yanked off the team's charter jet moments before
takeoff for the season opener to Dallas and told he'd been waived
because hold out first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth had come to
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Moten was re-signed to the practice squad midway through the
season. He was activated for Sunday's game at Philadelphia in the
wake of widespread injuries along the defen sive line, including
Swann's seventh knee surgery on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a backup almost my whole career at Florida, so I know
how important it is to stay ready,'' Moten said.
</P>
<P>
   He will be insurance against further injuries. Backups Rashod
Swinger and Bernard Wilson will start at the tackles for Swann and
Mark Smith (ankle). First-team ends Simeon Rice (ribs) and
Wadsworth (calf) are expected to start. Wadsworth prac ticed most
of the week. Rice did not practice at all. Carl Simpson and Jomo
Cousins also are available for backup duty ahead of Moten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who are playing are maybe not as good as the guys
they are replacing, but they've got to execute and do their
responsibilities, and I think they will do that,'' Coach Vince
Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles no doubt have noted the Cardinals have had difficulty
stop ping the run recently. Eagles back Duce Staley is averaging
3.9 yards per carry and is on pace for a 1,000-yard season. &QL; 
Take a seat &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tobin on Friday announced that offensive lineman Matt Joyce (bro
ken hand), Smith, running back Michael Pittman (broken hand) and
cornerback Tom Knight (hamstring strain) will be inactive.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the status of starting middle linebacker Ron
McKinnon a game-day decision. McKinnon has not practiced and has
been expected to miss his second straight game (knee strain). He
would be replaced again by Mark Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   Three more players will be declared inactive on Sunday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Move unlikely &QL;

JACKE GETS COLD RECEPTION  
 KICKER HAPPY ABOUT 2ND SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it one of life's ironies.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals kicker Chris Jacke spent eight years on the frozen
tundra of Green Bay, often dreaming of performing his art on a soft
green field under a warm sun.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a place that sounds, looks and smells exactly like
the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   So Jacke arrives in town as the emergency replacement for
injured kicker Joe Nedney last week, and on the day he debuts, it
snows in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable, it snows and now I've got a cold,'' said Jacke,
who upon arrival last week suggested he might carry around a bag of
ice to remind him of Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will be perfectly happy if he merely kicks as he
did in Green Bay, where he posted very impressive numbers en route
to winning a Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight seasons there, Jacke attempted 22 field goals
in the fourth quarter when the score was within three points of
being tied. He made 19.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did he miss from inside the 30 in the fourth quarter or
overtime. He's one of only three players in Packers history to
score 700 points, and he made 15 game-winning kicks.
</P>
<P>
   He made good on 40 of his 51 field-goal attempts in the fourth
quarter or in overtime, and 17 of the 26 field goals he tried from
50-plus yards.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was 31 of 39 on grass fields when the temperature
was 32 degrees or lower, which makes one only hope that whoever
kept that statistic has found a life.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke's one-game Arizona career is perfect and now consists two
successful extra-point conversions and a 21-yard field goal after
sitting out for what basically has been a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The butterflies were gone after the first kick,'' Jacke said
of last Sunday's action. ``After that, you don't have time to think
about it because you are into the flow of the game. Once you are
out there, it's like you have done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was this man so unceremoniously bumped into the night by the
Packers after Green Bay's Super Bowl victory on Jan. 26, 1997?
Because the Pack didn't show him the money.
</P>
<P>
   Dealings between his agent, Steve Weinberg, and the team grew so
acrimonious that the team wasn't going to take Jacke along when it
visited the White House after the Super Bowl victory. It yielded
only after public reaction to the slight.
</P>
<P>
   On draft day, Weinberg thought he was close to reaching a deal,
but the Packers refused to give an extra $150,000 to $200,000
signing bonus and drafted kicker Brett Conway, who is no longer
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice of the fans to rally around me, but everything
that happened there is now in the past,'' Jacke said. ``I don't
even think about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he didn't have time to think of it. He went to
Pittsburgh's training camp last year but suffered a thigh injury
and was released.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play again until the final game of the season, when he
was 5 for 5 on extra points and was promptly released. He spent
this season working in the finance department for American Express
in Green Bay, until Nedney suffered his injury two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough sitting at home knowing or feeling that I could
still be kicking in this league,'' Jacke said. ``It was real tough.
It's why I've got to use this opportunity to take full advantage of
it. I don't know what the outcome will be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they (Cardinals) are quite happy with Joe, and he's
done an outstanding job for them. I can possibly use this as a
steppingstone to go elsewhere or, if they want me, to just come
back here. We can discuss it after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Cardinals called about replacing Nedney, Jacke's phone
wasn't ringing off the hook. He might have thought he could still
kick in the league, but even he had some doubts about whether
another opportunity would surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there were times when I thought it (career) was over,''
said Jacke, whose wife, Tracey, and two young sons are remaining in
Green Bay until his future is solidified. ``But you have to keep
out. I've been out of the game for a year and a half, but I kept
plugging and kicking, hoping for another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unhappy it happened this way, but it has and I have to
take advantage of it. I kicked 25 to 30 balls, twice a week. I did
it because I thought I'd get one more chance, and I wanted to stay
in shape. If not this year, then when expansion comes. There will
probably be a lot of movement among players and kickers.'' &QL;

NO ACTION AT WINTER MEETINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ There was a time when the winter meetings took place
in the lobby of whatever hotel major league officials converged on
each December.
</P>
<P>
   The wheeling and dealing were intense as general managers
basically set up shop in some lounge chair, usually one where they
had a bird's-eye view of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I used to do,'' said Cincinnati Manager Jack
McKeon, who was nicknamed ``Trader Jack'' during his days as a
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd find the best seat in the lobby and plant myself there for
days. If I saw someone I wanted to talk to, I'd send someone over
to them and we'd talk. We'd end up making a deal in no time. Those
were different times, though. It's not the same anymore, at least I
don't see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   No one sees it that way anymore, because general managers no
longer troll through the hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the winter meetings are back in earnest, just the way major
league baseball wanted them to be. After six years of baseball
dissuading big league clubs from attending the traditional winter
meetings, it has brought them back.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the national press has come back to the meetings,
once the zenith of all off-season baseball talk. But with free
agency taking center stage, the meetings don't measure up to their
former status. Trades aren't as big a part of baseball as they once
were. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No lobby strolling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These winter meetings really don't resemble the ones we
remember. General managers, who used to discuss (and sometimes
consummate) trades at the lobby, the hotel bar, the dining room and
even the registration line, no longer linger in plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   The days of strolling through the lobby looking for fellow GMs
appear to be over. After spending most of Friday waiting to watch
the migration of GMs _ any general managers _ the realization
finally set in that these are not the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   New-age general managers tend to spend their time holed up
inside their hotel rooms, making phone calls to each other and
poring over statistical breakdowns from computers (none of the
old-school GMs ever had a computer on hand) of any and all players
they might be interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they think they can outsmart everyone by studying inside
their rooms,'' McKeon said. ``But that's not what these meetings
were for. They were for everyone to see each other and discuss
trades. You can't see anyone from inside your room.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason computer breakdowns are necessary seems to be the
general distrust among today's GMs. There was a time when GMs would
see each other and one would simply say, ``I need a catcher for my
Triple A club.''
</P>
<P>
   Another would say, ``I got one. I need an outfielder at Double
A.'' Within minutes, a deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, you knew you were getting equal value for the
player,'' former GM Dick Balderson said. ``You didn't want to screw
anyone over because word would spread that you didn't deal fairly.
There was a lot more trust in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's basically a free-for-all, with each club responsible
for knowing every player's ability in every system at every level.
That's sad. It's also sad how the winter meetings now include
little action. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lasorda does Lasorda &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights (if that's an appropriate word) from the
first day was watching Tommy Lasorda be Tommy Lasorda in the lobby
of the expansive Opryland Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as though Lasorda, who barely moved from one spot,
was in the lobby simply to be seen by anyone who cared to walk up
and ask him a question. Lasorda even stopped to take pictures with
Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
   There was nary a GM in the lobby Friday, and the odds seem small
that they will congregate there in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   If the ensuing days resemble Friday, the winter meetings may
indeed be a thing of the past, at least in the traditional sense.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball needs to seize the moment instead of boring us to
death. &QL;

COYOTES SEEK REVENGE FOR `EMBARRASSING' LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sits there, like a huge black mark on the NHL's best record.
The only blot on an otherwise unbeaten home record: Ottawa Senators
4, Phoenix Coyotes 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes can't erase the opening night setback, or its
memory. But they can gain some peace of mind tonight at 5 (Arizona
time) when they get their second and last chance of the regular
season at the Senators, who will play host at the Corel Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is always to win, but, yeah, it means a little more
to us,'' Coyotes forward Keith Tkachuk said. ``It was embarrassing,
and we would like to get a little revenge, sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still the most important thing is to win to keep us going in
the right direction. It's always important to win the first game of
a road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game opens a four-game trip that also sees the Coyotes
play Monday night at Montreal, which Phoenix beat, 4-2, at home on
Wednesday night, and then take on Northeast Division-leading
Toronto on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The trip ends Thursday in St. Louis against the Blues, who are
second in the Central Division. The Coyotes return home Dec. 20 to
play the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has only one question mark in the injury department.
Defenseman Gerald Diduck missed the Montreal game because of a
thigh bruise and is listed day-to-day, but he was with the the team
when it departed Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win every game you play, but obviously we will be
happy with anything over .500 on the trip,'' Tkachuk said. ``I'd
just like to see us start playing complete 60-minute games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been finding ways to win, but we haven't played a
complete 60 minutes of solid and hard hockey yet. We have been
getting up 2-0 and 3-0, but we haven't been putting teams away like
we should. Our record (16-3-3) is great, but we haven't played our
best yet. It's not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   After going unbeaten in 11 games in November, the Coyotes are
2-1-1 in December, a month in which they play 10 of their 14 games
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, 13-9-3 and fourth in the tough Northeast Division,
are unbeaten in their past three outings against the Coyotes. But
at least the Coyotes won't see goalie Damian Rhodes, who was in net
in the opener and has stuffed Phoenix in two straight games by a
4-1 count.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes rotates in net with Ron Tugnutt, who will get the start
tonight. Tugnutt was in goal last season when the Coyotes tied the
Senators 4-4 at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottawa is a hard-working and fast team,'' Tkachuk said. ``They
get a lot of goals on rushes that they create defensively with
their speed. We'll have to play a solid defensive game to beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in the opener. The Coyotes were a study in
still life. The Senators jumped off to a 1-0 first-period lead and
added two goals in 3{ minutes in the second period. Their play was
so disappointing that fans booed them as they left the ice at the
end of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense the poor effort served as a catalyst for the league's
fastest start. The Coyotes had four days off before they played
again, and returned to the ice against Colorado as a different team
that had bought into Coach Jim Schoenfeld's forechecking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a couple of games under their belt and it was opening
night for us,'' Tkachuk said. ``Like I said, it was embarrassing.
Opening nights are tough, but we expected a lot from ourselves and
so did the fans and we ended up standing around a lot.'' &QL;

FINALLY, A WORKOUT FOR POTATOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's face facts: Some of your biggest sports fans are . . .
``big'' sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   As in, fat. Something about lying on a couch balancing a beer on
your belly while shoveling tortilla chips into your mouth as fast
as you can tends to lead to weight gain. I've known people who kept
coolers next to their recliners; if they knew how to
self-catheterize themselves, they'd never get up.
</P>
<P>
   If the only exercise you get during ``Monday Night Football'' is
lifting cylindrical weights that start out at 12 ounces and
decrease every time you lift them, well, welcome to the club,
fatso.
</P>
<P>
   But don't despair. Stewart Smith is offering hope.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former Navy SEAL, has written ``The TV Watcher's
Workout'' ($14.95, Five Star Fitness). While it's aimed at tube
hounds of all types, it works fine for TV sports fans, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ideal for them,'' Smith said, from outside Annapolis,
Md., where he lives. ``You can probably get a good hour and a half
worth of exercise during a football game. There's a lot of
commercials in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't say is that many of those commercials advertise
beer and food. So maybe we're better off skipping them anyway. But
really, exercise?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Smith is, as you might guess, something of a fitness
nut. He's no longer in the Navy, but he owns a fitness center. He
got the idea for the book from his parents. Not from their minds _
from their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are the type of people who work all day, eat
dinner, watch a couple of hours of TV and go to bed,'' he said. ``I
was concerned for their health. They weren't tremendously
overweight, (but) I want my child to know grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew that starting them on a regular exercise program
wouldn't work, so he searched for an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dissected my parents' day to the minute,'' he said. ``I
said, `Where can we squeeze in exercise here without interrupting
their day too much?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The only place he could find was during their television time.
One problem: They didn't want to interrupt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let's do it during the commercials,' '' he said. ``I
started timing the commercials, and I said, `Wow!' I couldn't
believe there was 20 minutes of commercials in an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is laid out, as you might expect from a military man,
with precision. It tells you how to budget your time, how to
stretch, explains the exercises, offers schedules and includes a
section on nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises are your garden-variety basics, with television
names thrown in. For instance, the standard push-up is the ``Regis
Regular Push-up.'' One in which you put your knees on the ground is
the ``Kathy Lee Knee Push-up.'' Others include ``Letterman
Lunges,'' ``Brady Bunch Crunches'' and ``Primetime Pelvic Lifts,''
which sound rather adult in nature but aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledges that these are just a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a beginning exercise, for people who haven't done
anything in a long time or who never have before,'' he said. ``They
get a good foundation. Now they're ready to start a good exercise
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith works out regularly, but says he takes his own advice,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say I missed my workout because I was too busy all day,'' he
said. ``I drop down and try to do push-ups the entire commercial
series. You go to exhaustion, till you can't do them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't have to _ I'm exhausted just hearing him talk about it.
The next set of commercials he'll do squats, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has written a follow-up book of more advanced exercises,
called the ``Five Star Fitness Boot Camp Workout'' that he hopes
will be in stores early next year. Meanwhile, he's promoting ``The
TV Watcher's Workout'' and keeping his sense of humor. He knows his
book isn't for every couch potato, but that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``At worst,'' he said, laughing, ``it makes a great gift.'' &QL;

psychoanalysis, and the shift in attitudes about homosexuality is
no exception. Unlike the American Psychiatric Association, which
removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973,

   MUSICALS-BISHOP (Undated) _ I happened to be in a secondhand
bookstore a while ago and came across a copy of ``Climate of
Eden,'' by Moss Hart, a play I didn't know by a writer I admire.
What turned out to interest me more than the play was the author's
introduction, in which he listed all the things that ailed the
Broadway theater at that time (the early 1950s). I was astonished
to note that nothing, nothing has changed. By Andre Bishop. (With

</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS-KRIEGER (Undated) _ Broadway musicals that explore
daring subjects always push the envelope of acceptability but with
varying results: some find their audiences, others don't. Of the
ones that don't, some just aren't done well and would fail no
matter what the subject matter. Others electrify their audiences,
even get good notices, but still fail at the box office because of
an underlying uneasiness on the part of the public. This was my
experience with ``Side Show.'' By Henry Krieger. (With photo.)

union, will meet face to face Saturday. It will be the second time
in three days that the principal negotiators in the league's labor
dispute have convened in a private setting. By Mike Wise.

   BBO-MEETINGS (Nashville, Tenn.) _ General Manager Steve Phillips
of the Mets is not scheduled to arrive at the first winter meetings

signed. By Jason Diamos.
</P>

   BKN-RHODEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the most significant lockout
news of the week, pro basketball players announced a charity game
in Atlantic City, N.J. They were then criticized for waffling on

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Lindsey Graham has always had a renegade
streak in him, which he displayed Friday when he became the lone
Republican to vote against the second article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the South Carolina conservative stepped up as the
ringleader in a plot to oust Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House speaker,
before it became fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, when members were scrambling for bits of
``pork'' to haul to their districts from the highway spending bill,
Graham courted the wrath of Rep. Bud Shuster, the near monolithic
Transportation Committee chairman, by criticizing his own party for
engineering the largest public works bill in history.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Graham followed up on his public reservations about
the second article, which accused President Clinton of committing
perjury in his civil deposition in the Paula Jones case. He had
discussed his reticence frequently in closed-door meetings and on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the second article?'' Graham asked, as he rushed into
the committee room during the roll call vote after ending remarks
to reporters outside. When someone answered yes, he voted no and
took his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who has long said he would not support impeachment for a
lie in a civil case, said he based his no vote on a legal
technicality, not on his belief that Clinton had been telling the
truth. A federal judge had found Clinton's statements to be
inadmissible, and that was enough to persuade Graham that the whole
thing was immaterial and did not deserve impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' Graham said
after the vote. ``I know he lied, but that's what the law is for.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his one no vote, Graham, the conservative firebrand with
a penchant for moderation on the impeachment issue, approved two
other articles, one that accused Clinton of lying to a grand jury,
the other that he obstructed justice. He said he would vote yes on
the fourth article, abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, he just plain ran out of patience with
Clinton. This week, he went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only believe your defense if I check my common sense at
the door, and I forget the way the world really works,'' he told
the president's lawyer, Charles F.C. Ruff, during a caustic
exchange in front of the committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people in America follow Bill Clintonspeak, we're going to
ruin the rule of law, and he's not worth that,'' Graham added. ``No
one person in America is worth trashing out the rule of law and
creating a situation where you can't rely on your common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for him came when, he said, Ruff failed to
offer a credible defense of Clinton's actions, the worst of which
was not simple perjury, but using the power of the presidency to
try to smear a witness, Monica Lewinsky, by painting her as a
``sexual predator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he treated Monica Lewinsky,'' he said, in
exasperation, ``his political interests were more important than
the truth or welfare of the person he was involved in a sexual
relationship with. He was using the office in a most sinister
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is in trouble when you let politicians use the
resources of their office to crush a citizen that may get in their
way,'' Graham added.
</P>
<P>
   On the Judiciary Committee, where he is a junior member, Graham
has stood apart with his vivid, concise remarks, the kind that
would make sense to his grandmother at the kitchen table, not just
to a roomful of lawyers skilled in legalisms. He speaks right off
the cuff, without text, something his colleagues seldom do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always asked whether this would be more like Peyton Place
than Watergate,'' Graham said. Friday, he answered his own
question. ``Watergate,'' he said.

RANGERS' BID FOR CLEMENS FALLING SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Rangers lack the resources to acquire
right-hander Roger Clemens, unless their best proposal _ likely
right-hander Esteban Loaiza and designated hitter Lee Stevens among
others _ emerges as the most attractive the Toronto Blue Jays
receive.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' proposal for Toronto's five-time Cy Young Award
recipient encompasses only a ``framework or grouping'' of eight or
nine players for the Blue Jays' consideration, general manager Doug
Melvin acknowledged yesterday from Major League Baseball's winter
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we haven't offered the best package that suits
their needs,'' Melvin said. ``They have a couple of needs we might
not be able to fill. Sometimes you're not compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the Rangers are giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking to improve their offense, and that's why I
still think we have a chance in this,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin foresees a scenario in which the Blue Jays might not
receive what could be expected for a pitcher of Clemens' stature
and perhaps slide to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always that possibility,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that acquires Clemens not only will be required
to part with players in the trade, but it likely will be forced to
renegotiate the 36-year-old pitcher's existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who informed the Blue Jays on Dec. 2 of his desire to
be traded to an organization closer to his Houston home or a
playoff contender, can veto any trade. That empowers Clemens to
force potential suitors to renegotiate his existing contract _ in
length and/or value _ before granting consent to any trade made by
Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash. Clemens will earn $8 and $8.1
million the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' representatives, Randy and Alan Hendricks, likely will
seek ``Randy Johnson money'' from that organization during
negotiations. Johnson, whom the Rangers also pursued, signed a
four-year contract worth $52.4 million with the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza and Stevens appear to represent the best the Rangers can
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin recently called it ``very unlikely'' that catcher Ivan
Rodriguez or left fielder Rusty Greer would be involved in the
Rangers' proposal for Clemens, and the Blue Jays' insistence on
receiving major-league talent likely rules out minor-league center
fielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez's contract contains a limited
no-trade clause that prevents him from being traded to the Blue
Jays, and first baseman Rafael Palmeiro's contract also includes a
no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton cannot be traded after being signed
earlier this month as a free agent, and the Blue Jays likely
possess little interest in second baseman Mark McLemore or third
baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore underwent his fourth knee operation after the season,
and the Blue Jays plan to utilize a platoon of Tony Fernandez and
Tom Evans at third base this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not want to part with center fielder Tom Goodwin
or right-hander Rick Helling, and right-hander Aaron Sele's ability
to become a free agent after the 1999 season makes him unattractive
to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Loaiza and Stevens as the best proposal the Rangers
can assemble, with the Blue Jays interested in major-league talent
with little service time and reasonable salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one guy clubs have asked about more than any of our
pitchers,'' Melvin said of Loaiza, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league officials respect Loaiza's arm, and the
right-hander will earn just $1.4 million this season. The Blue Jays
also seek a power hitter to replace designated hitter Jose Canseco,
who signed Thursday with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who earned $1.2 million this past season, remains
eligible for salary arbitration and cannot become a free agent
until after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lack the second baseman the Blue Jays seek, but Ash
yesterday acknowledged a potential trade for one _ likely
Pittsburgh's Tony Womack, Colorado's Mike Lansing or Los Angeles'
Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the table, and we're waiting to hear for a call back
now,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   Ash also wants Clemens' suitors to make firm proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use this pun, but this isn't rocket science,'' Ash
said. ``I'm just trying to get clubs to put their best packages
together so we can make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash also does not foresee departing Nashville without a trade
for Clemens being consummated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see going home,'' Ash said, ``without making a deal.''

RANGERS' BID FOR CLEMENS FALLING SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Rangers lack the resources to acquire
right-hander Roger Clemens, unless their best proposal _ likely
right-hander Esteban Loaiza and designated hitter Lee Stevens among
others _ emerges as the most attractive the Toronto Blue Jays
receive.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' proposal for Toronto's five-time Cy Young Award
recipient encompasses only a ``framework or grouping'' of eight or
nine players for the Blue Jays' consideration, general manager Doug
Melvin acknowledged yesterday from Major League Baseball's winter
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we haven't offered the best package that suits
their needs,'' Melvin said. ``They have a couple of needs we might
not be able to fill. Sometimes you're not compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the Rangers are giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking to improve their offense, and that's why I
still think we have a chance in this,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin foresees a scenario in which the Blue Jays might not
receive what could be expected for a pitcher of Clemens' stature
and perhaps slide to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always that possibility,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that acquires Clemens not only will be required
to part with players in the trade, but it likely will be forced to
renegotiate the 36-year-old pitcher's existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who informed the Blue Jays on Dec. 2 of his desire to
be traded to an organization closer to his Houston home or a
playoff contender, can veto any trade. That empowers Clemens to
force potential suitors to renegotiate his existing contract _ in
length and/or value _ before granting consent to any trade made by
Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash. Clemens will earn $8 and $8.1
million the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' representatives, Randy and Alan Hendricks, likely will
seek ``Randy Johnson money'' from that organization during

GRAPEVINE MUSTANGS HAVE THEIR EYES ON CLASS 4A DIVISION I TITLE
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE _ The ring rests on a wooden shelf in Jordan Wilson's
bedroom, tossed to the side next to some old medals like an
unwanted knick-knack. The shelf is dusty, the ring case is dusty
and part of Wilson _ who will try to quarterback Grapevine High
School today to a state championship _ doesn't even want it.
</P>
<P>
   The ring is from Grapevine's 1996 state championship. Wilson got
it the easy way, as a junior-varsity call-up at the end of the
regular season, seeing action mostly on kickoffs the day the
Mustangs dispatched Hays Consolidated on a December afternoon at
Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wants another ring to replace the one on his shelf. He
wants a ring he can call his own.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, he'll wear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got that ring as a keepsake. I wasn't expecting to get
the opportunity to get my own,'' Wilson said. Years ago, his family
considered moving to Southlake so he could someday lead Carroll's
state-title rich Dragons to glory. Now, Wilson has his shot in a
Grapevine uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mom that's all I want for Christmas,'' he said.
``It's the only thing I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wilson will get his chance.
</P>
<P>
   So will the rest of the Mustangs, who will try to give the high
school and city its second state title in three years. A victory
today against Bay City will be the perfect cap to an imperfect
season, coaches and players said. In 1996, Grapevine was supposed
to win it all. Today, the Mustangs weren't supposed to even be
here.
</P>
<P>
   So what would a championship earned today at Texas Stadium mean?
</P>
<P>
   Everything.
</P>
<P>
   Junior nose guard J.J. Barnett remembers. He was on the field in
1996, another seldom-used call-up who stood and watched Grapevine
stars like Jack Brewer and Tellis Redmon hold high the hardware,
the same state-championship trophy that occupies the trophy case at
Grapevine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe today he will be holding a trophy, too. Maybe today he
will know what it feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean more than the world to me,'' said Barnett,
Grapevine's defensive leader. ``This would be something that I
earned. I'll never let this go, even when I go home, even when I'm
in college, even after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmon and Brewer now are at the University of Minnesota, but
they remember. The only thing that this year's Grapevine players
wanted was a chance at that same memory. And now they have it.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a tale of two teams, a tale of two seasons and a
tale of two fortunes. Hopefully, coach Mike Sneed said, the ending
today will be just as fairy-tale as it was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Mustangs were loaded. They won a state
championship because they were supposed to, Sneed said. The
pressure they played under wasn't so much to win, but more ``not''
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   This season, however, has been different. Eight games decided by
five points or less. Consecutive victories against highly regarded
Colleyville Heritage and Keller simply to make it to the playoffs.
Second-half rallies in playoff victories against Greenville and
Plainview, including one in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed's coaching accomplishment of 1996 was dimmed because of
the opinion that anybody could have coached that year's Mustangs to
the summit of Class 4A. But this season, few _ if any _ seriously
picked Grapevine in August to be playing today in Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, here they are.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sneed says, he will start his day just as any other game
day. He will rise from bed at 5:30 in the morning, let his dog,
Daisy, out and then settle down at the kitchen table, reading the
newspaper and reflecting.
</P>
<P>
   But today, those reflections may be a bit more intense than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   He will remember 1996. How can he forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting this week, I've been trying to go back to that time
two years ago,'' Sneed said. ``I try not to do it too much because
I get anxiety attacks, but the feeling is almost the same: the
anticipation, the questions. Can we win? Will we win? Every time I
really start thinking about things, I get that rush.''
</P>
<P>
   A new ring to call their own. Validation for a coaching job well
done. The satisfaction that working out in 100-degree heat during
August was worth it. All the hours put into the weight room, away
from Friday night's lights, away from the crowds and the
cheerleaders and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   These are the things a state title would bring today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really think we'd make it out of district, and now,
here we are,'' senior receiver Jason Schindler said. A title today
would place an emphatic punctuation mark to a season of highs and
lows. He is the only starter from that 1996 season playing today.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler wants to finish his high school career by coming full
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the Colleyville Heritage game, we've come back and
won,'' he said. ``I don't know if this is luck. It happens to
people who do things right. Luck doesn't just happen. We've had our
ups and downs, but I'm glad that we're on an up right now. It
drives us. We want to be picked to lose. It gives us a little edge.
We want to win the game not only because we want to win, but
because we want to prove people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Schindler and his teammates can do that again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state championship is like life's ultimate goal,'' Wilson
said. ``That's all my mind has been set on since 1996. I don't wear
my ring because I don't think I earned it. I would like to have my
own. I would never take that one off.''
</P>
<P>
   Every game as the team captains walk to midfield for the pregame
coin toss, Wilson and Barnett stroll side by side. In the
regular-season finale against Keller, knowing the Mustangs needed a
victory or miss the playoffs, Wilson turned to Barnett on the way
to midfield and said, ``You know, this isn't my last game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past five weeks, Wilson has told Barnett the same thing.
It has become part ritual, part good luck charm, part promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, J.J. is telling me that this next one ``is'' my last
game,'' Wilson said. ``I say fine to that. I just want to go out a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   And a champion.

CONVERSE JUDSON MYSTIQUE DOESN'T AWE DUNCANVILLE
</HEADLINE>
 FOOTBALL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE IVEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNCANVILLE _ The Duncanville football players were not
intimidated by six-time state champion Odessa Permian and they are
not at all intimidated by five-time state champion Converse Judson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we be?'' said Panthers coach Bob Alpert. ``None of
those kids played on any of their state championship teams. We've
won more playoff games in the last two seasons than they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers (11-3) and Rockets (14-0) meet at 12:05 p.m. today
in Houston for the Class 5A Division I championship.
</P>
<P>
   Converse Judson, state champions in 1983, '88, '92, '93 and '95,
enter the game ranked No. 2 in the state and No. 5 in the nation.
Alpert is exactly right, however. The Rockets have won four playoff
games in the past two years while the Panthers have won seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't fear them. We don't fear anyone,'' Alpert said. ``We
do respect their program, their players and their tradition. But
there's no fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncanville might be playing in its first title game, but the
program is not without its own traditions. The alumni include
ex-Pittsburgh Steelers running back Barry Foster, Broncos defensive
back Ray Crockett and Texas Tech running back Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But when Alpert took over before the 1996 season, he became the
third head coach in four years. In the three seasons before
Alpert's arrival from Aldine MacArthur, the program won a total of
13 games. Alpert won 10 his first season, 12 the next and has 11
victories so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Duncanville, which has won numerous state titles in other
sports, is now a fixture on the Texas football map. Alpert gives
credit for a quick turnaround to his coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that it takes great players to win,'' he said.
``But they had great players here before and didn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 assistant coaches in the Duncanville school district
(10 varsity assistants, eight ninth-grade coaches and 12
junior-high coaches), 23 were hired by Alpert. That number includes
assistant head coach and offensive coordinator Dan Schreiber and
defensive coordinator Mark Howeth.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert praised his staff's ability to get the Panthers prepared
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not how hard you work, it's how smart you work. I'm
fortunate to be surrounded by some smart workers,'' he said. ``They
are the foundation of our success and they deserve the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that would make the turnaround complete is within
reach this afternoon at the Astrodome _ a state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert won a Class 4A state title in 1980 as the defensive
coordinator for the Huntsville Hornets. He was on the losing end in
1993 as head coach at Aldine MacArthur in the Class 5A final
against Lewisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst loss of your life is losing in a state championship
game,'' he said. ``Twenty years from now, only one team has those
rings. Five years from now, nobody remembers who lost in the
finals.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this for high drama:
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators are in their seats. In the well of the Senate
is a defense table. President Clinton may or may not be at the
table, but his lawyers are, on the edge of their chairs. Facing
them, at a prosecution table, are Rep. Henry Hyde and a few of his
Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   High on the dais, Chief Justice William Rehnquist leans forward
in the presiding officer's chair and reads solemnly into the
microphone from a slip of paper handed up to him by the Senate
parliamentarian: ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent,
William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty? The clerk will
call the roll.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, as their names are called alphabetically, the
senators rise behind their desks and utter the first words they
have spoken about the matter in public session since the
impeachment trial began. No speeches. No explanation. Just
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the way the trial will end _ probably sometime next
summer _ if a majority of the members of the House of
Representatives vote this week to impeach the president on the
accusations recommended by the House Judiciary Committee, and if
the Senate goes forward with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in and around Congress think it will never get that
far _ that somehow, though no one can say just how, the Senate will
avert a drawn-out legal process that could tie up the country for
months. That might seem logical, since no one imagines that the
Senate will come close to obtaining the two-thirds majority needed
to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ not just Republican opponents of the president but
also steadfast guardians of the Senate's prerogatives like Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., _ believe that the Senate would be obligated to
try the president if the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing about an impeachment trial would be logical, by
ordinary legal standards. This trial would be part law and part
politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by ancient
Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. In the history of
the nation, there have been only 13 such trials (one of a

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this for high drama:
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators are in their seats. In the well of the Senate
is a defense table. President Clinton may or may not be at the
table, but his lawyers are, on the edge of their chairs. Facing
them, at a prosecution table, are Rep. Henry Hyde and a few of his
Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   High on the dais, Chief Justice William Rehnquist leans forward
in the presiding officer's chair and reads solemnly into the
microphone from a slip of paper handed up to him by the Senate
parliamentarian: ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent,
William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty? The clerk will
call the roll.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, as their names are called alphabetically, the
senators rise behind their desks and utter the first words they
have spoken about the matter in public session since the
impeachment trial began. No speeches. No explanation. Just
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the way the trial will end _ probably sometime next
summer _ if a majority of the members of the House of
Representatives vote this week to impeach the president on the
accusations recommended by the House Judiciary Committee, and if
the Senate goes forward with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in and around Congress think it will never get that
far _ that somehow, though no one can say just how, the Senate will
avert a drawn-out legal process that could tie up the country for
months. That might seem logical, since no one imagines that the
Senate will come close to obtaining the two-thirds majority needed
to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ not just Republican opponents of the president but
also steadfast guardians of the Senate's prerogatives like Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., _ believe that the Senate would be obligated to
try the president if the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing about an impeachment trial would be logical, by
ordinary legal standards. This trial would be part law and part
politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by ancient
Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. In the history of
the nation, there have been only 13 such trials (one of a
president), and only 7 convictions (all of federal judges). The
only trial of a president, in which Andrew Johnson was acquitted by
one vote, was 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all of academia, in all the library stacks, in all the
cubicles and carrels of the Capitol, there is no reference book
that spells out what the impeachment trial of a president would
look like in 1999, and there is no person who considers himself or
herself an absolute authority.

don't know whether it can be confined in a rational way or whether

</P>
<P>
   ``We are,'' Baron cautions, ``on the edge of a real seismic
event.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have to be given a month or two to prepare for the
trial, Baron said. Then, he said, there would be months of
pre-trial activity.
</P>
<P>
   The first question to be answered would be whether a vote of
impeachment by the lame-duck 105th Congress would be sufficient for
the Senate to conduct a trial in the new Congress or whether the
new House (with a smaller Republican majority) would have to
impeach the president all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist would rule first on this. His ruling would be subject
to reversal by the senators. Because this is a constitutional
question, the matter would doubtless go next to the Supreme Court _
where the chief justice, of course, presides.
</P>
<P>
   (Paradoxically, Rehnquist comes as close as anyone in the
country to being an expert on impeachment trials. In 1992, he
published a book, ``Grand Inquests,'' on the two most famous
impeachment trials, both of which ended in acquittal _ the Johnson
trial in 1868 and the trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase
in 1805.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, motions on other questions would arise. What standard of
proof would be required for conviction _ ``beyond a reasonable
doubt'' as in a criminal trial; ``preponderance of evidence,'' as
in a civil trial, or something completely different? What is the
definition of perjury, the accusation in the first two articles of
impeachment recommended last week by the House Judiciary Committee?
What rules of evidence would apply? For instance, would hearsay
evidence be allowed? Would the president's lawyers and senior
advisers be protected from testifying by attorney-client privilege
and executive privilege? If misconduct by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr can be proved, should the case be dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a Clinton trial, scores of witnesses would have
to be interviewed and documentary evidence would have to be
reviewed. The prosecution could not rely, as the House Judiciary
Committee did, solely on Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be similar to those in
courtrooms. There would be opening statements, presentation of
witnesses and evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals
and closing arguments. The witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp
and the rest _ would testify in public, under oath, and would be
subjected for the first time to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution would be supervised by a team of congressmen,
called House managers, led by Hyde. They would function like
district attorneys who oversee cases but leave the courtroom work
to assistants. The organization of the prosecution's case,
questioning of witnesses and opening and closing arguments
presumably would be handled by prosecutors hired from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense would also be conducted by a team of hired
lawyers. Because his defense in an impeachment trial is one of the
president's official duties, the cost would be borne by the
government. The president could choose whether to appear at the
trial and whether to testify himself.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference from a courtroom trial, of course, would be the
nature of the jury. Senators would not represent an impartial jury
of the president's peers. Unlike an ordinary jury, the senators
would decide questions of law as well as fact. And the verdict, no
doubt, would turn more on politics than on evidence. Under the
Constitution, it would require a two-thirds vote of the senators
present to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The other big qualification to keep in mind is that under the
Senate rules, the trial could be abandoned at any point by a
majority vote. This is how a plea bargain might occur. The senators
could agree to stop the trial if they decided to censure or
otherwise punish the president instead, and if the president agreed
to accept the offer, as he indicated he would on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the question of a Senate impeachment trial was
seriously considered was in August 1974, after the House Judiciary
Committee had voted to recommend the impeachment of President
Richard M. Nixon. The Senate voted to direct its Rules Committee to
examine the procedures and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nixon resigned. Whatever thought had gone into the matter
was quickly shelved.

<P>
   Half-crazed, shrieking children rip into present after present,
tossing toys right, left and up in the air. Suddenly, they are
done. Some are still wild-eyed, but some are dazed as they stare at
their seasonal loot. Soon, all are playing merrily with the empty
boxes as if they are the best toys of all.
</P>
<P>
   America's children are being buried in an avalanche of toys.
It's partly a function of demographics: There are fewer children
and more adults to dote on them. But television's ceaseless
shilling of merchandise fuels the fire. So do guilt on the part of
working, often absentee parents; clever marketing of toys as
learning tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid
transfixed by a toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough, already!'' is the cry of a growing chorus of
professionals dealing with children. They fear children are being
simultaneously overstimulated and desensitized by a deluge of
misguided love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even grandparents are becoming almost hesitant to give their
grandchildren toys,'' said Dr. Karen Nesbitt Shanor, a clinical
psychologist in Washington. ``They see the children have so many
toys and that everybody's overwhelmed by the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shanor, who next year will publish a book on the development
of children's brains called ``The Emerging Mind,'' said too much
gift-generated stimulation can hurt learning by decreasing
concentration. Moreover, she said, the stimulation itself feeds the
need for ever more stimulation as a result of chemical changes in
the mind. Ultimately, such an addiction to stimulation can
contribute to such syndromes as attention deficit disorder. ``It's
a vicious cycle,'' Dr. Shanor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids might be pardoned for seeing a different sort of
viciousness. After lecturing that candy rots teeth and playground
see-saws are unsafe and peanut butter sandwiches are dangerous, the
grown-ups are now plotting to take away Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But too many gifts can affect a child's emerging sense of self
worth, said Dr. Paul Ciborowski, a professor in the counseling
department of Long Island University. Children can become confused
if their value seems to be measured in things, he said. In the
worst cases, a child could begin measuring his worth by how much
money is spent on him, Ciborowski added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine expression of caring is very important in terms of
the ego development of young children,'' he said. ``Toys are only
one of a number of ways to share and express love.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody blames children, but almost all experts fault parents for
the toy explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents communicate feelings by giving gifts rather than
by direct communication of their feelings,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Skodnek, a child psychiatrist at Nassau County Medical Center, on
New York's Long Island. ``It's almost as if materialism becomes the
matrix of social relations _ our sense of self esteem and our
relation to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults, the experts say, should simply take a firm stand.
``Children need adults to tell them they've had too much candy,''
said Dr. Gail Saltz, a psychologist at New York Cornell Medical
Center. ``And if the adult is the cause of too much candy, it's
really a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense, without shades of Ebenezer Scrooge, is the goal.
One of Dr. Shanor's suggestions is to parcel gifts out over longer
periods; she even suggests putting away all but a couple of gifts
after they are opened.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Brush, a psychology professor at Fordham University,
says Hanukkah with its eight days of gift-giving, or celebrating
the 12 Days of Christmas, can be considerably more reasonable than
a single gift-giving orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to give children more complicated toys that can
engage them for longer periods of time. ``More complicated toys
that are developmentally appropriate are better than multiple
toys,'' Dr. Brush said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she suggested a toy called a surprise box that
requires five different skills to open: To open one door, you slide
a lever, and to open another, you flip the equivalent of a light
switch. Such toys, she said, can enhance a child's sense of
mastery. And motivation to achieve, she added, flows from doing
something simple and having an effect on one's environment.
</P>
<P>
   But this requires concentrated study and thought on the part of
children _ and an overabundance of toys can be a decided
distraction. ``If you have too many toys, children don't want to
explore a particular toy in depth,'' Dr. Brush said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, child experts say toys should be chosen to
encourage fantasy. Complicated toys that offer more to watch than
to do are a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the toy does for you, the less opportunity you have
to engage actively,'' said Elizabeth Schnur, a psychologist at the
Jewish Child Care Association who studies the developmental reasons
some children do better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Derevensky, a child psychologist at McGill
University, has studied toys and children extensively. He has also
worked as a consultant with Fisher-Price and others to get better
toys on the market.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that even from a child's viewpoint, more is not
always better. An example is children's desire to hear the same
book read over and over. ``If you read it enough times, they know
it by heart,'' he said. ``But you can't skip pages in it. They want
that kind of element of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Educational toys are best, Derevensky said, particularly
educational computer software. ``The best thing about a computer is
that it has an infinite amount of patience,'' he said. ``It never
yells at a child. It never says, `How many times are we going to
have to go over this before you learn it?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Derevensky and others particularly recommended gifts like
board games that can bring families together to participate in an
activity. ``When you think about the fond memories of holiday
times,'' he said, ``certainly some of the things stand out, like
the old Schwinn bicycle. But the vast majority of the memories are
personal ones, the ones where families did things together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask kids what is the best part of Christmas, and they'll say,
`No school and I got to go to the movies with my parents.' ''

a vicious cycle,'' Dr. Shanor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids might be pardoned for seeing a different sort of
viciousness. After lecturing that candy rots teeth and playground
see-saws are unsafe and peanut butter sandwiches are dangerous, the
grown-ups are now plotting to take away Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But too many gifts can affect a child's emerging sense of self
worth, said Dr. Paul Ciborowski, a professor in the counseling
department of Long Island University. Children can become confused
if their value seems to be measured in things, he said. In the
worst cases, a child could begin measuring his worth by how much
money is spent on him, Ciborowski added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine expression of caring is very important in terms of
the ego development of young children,'' he said. ``Toys are only
one of a number of ways to share and express love.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody blames children, but almost all experts fault parents for
the toy explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents communicate feelings by giving gifts rather than
by direct communication of their feelings,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Skodnek, a child psychiatrist at Nassau County Medical Center, on
New York's Long Island. ``It's almost as if materialism becomes the
matrix of social relations _ our sense of self esteem and our
relation to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults, the experts say, should simply take a firm stand.
``Children need adults to tell them they've had too much candy,''
said Dr. Gail Saltz, a psychologist at New York Cornell Medical
Center. ``And if the adult is the cause of too much candy, it's
really a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense, without shades of Ebenezer Scrooge, is the goal.
One of Dr. Shanor's suggestions is to parcel gifts out over longer
periods; she even suggests putting away all but a couple of gifts
after they are opened.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Brush, a psychology professor at Fordham University,
says Hanukkah with its eight days of gift-giving, or celebrating
the 12 Days of Christmas, can be considerably more reasonable than
a single gift-giving orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to give children more complicated toys that can
engage them for longer periods of time. ``More complicated toys
that are developmentally appropriate are better than multiple
toys,'' Dr. Brush said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she suggested a toy called a surprise box that
requires five different skills to open: To open one door, you slide
a lever, and to open another, you flip the equivalent of a light
switch. Such toys, she said, can enhance a child's sense of
mastery. And motivation to achieve, she added, flows from doing
something simple and having an effect on one's environment.
</P>
<P>
   But this requires concentrated study and thought on the part of
children _ and an overabundance of toys can be a decided
distraction. ``If you have too many toys, children don't want to
explore a particular toy in depth,'' Dr. Brush said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, child experts say toys should be chosen to
encourage fantasy. Complicated toys that offer more to watch than
to do are a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the toy does for you, the less opportunity you have
to engage actively,'' said Elizabeth Schnur, a psychologist at the
Jewish Child Care Association who studies the developmental reasons
some children do better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Derevensky, a child psychologist at McGill
University, has studied toys and children extensively. He has also
worked as a consultant with Fisher-Price and others to get better
toys on the market.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that even from a child's viewpoint, more is not
always better. An example is children's desire to hear the same
book read over and over. ``If you read it enough times, they know
it by heart,'' he said. ``But you can't skip pages in it. They want
that kind of element of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Educational toys are best, Derevensky said, particularly
educational computer software. ``The best thing about a computer is
that it has an infinite amount of patience,'' he said. ``It never
yells at a child. It never says, `How many times are we going to
have to go over this before you learn it?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Derevensky and others particularly recommended gifts like
board games that can bring families together to participate in an
activity. ``When you think about the fond memories of holiday
times,'' he said, ``certainly some of the things stand out, like
the old Schwinn bicycle. But the vast majority of the memories are
personal ones, the ones where families did things together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask kids what is the best part of Christmas, and they'll say,
`No school and I got to go to the movies with my parents.' ''

<P>
   No one's calling for affirmative action for boys just yet.
</P>
<P>
   But given the fact that girls are becoming an ever larger
majority at most American colleges, many educators are beginning to
think boys should get more attention.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the conventional wisdom _ reinforced by a
steady drumbeat of stories stressing female victimhood _ has been
that girls are shortchanged in school, getting less attention from
their teachers than boys and gradually losing their self-esteem as
they enter adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   By all kinds of measures, though, girls rule in school. They
have better grades, higher reading and writing scores, higher class
ranks and more school honors, and they are more likely than boys to
take Advanced Placement exams in English, social studies and
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out, be put in
special education, be diagnosed with learning disabilities and be
put on behavior-modifying medication like Ritalin. As teen-agers,
they are also far more likely than girls to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth that the schools shortchange girls is dangerously
wrong because it has diverted policy attention from the group at
genuine education risk _ African-American boys,'' said Judith
Kleinfeld, a University of Alaska professor, in a paper earlier
this year that found that schools put boys at more of a
disadvantage than girls. ``This is the group that scores lowest on
virtually every educational measure. This is the group where an
enormous gap does exist between males and females. But the
African-American gender gap favors females.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that boys need more help than girls do is slowly
gaining currency nationally. ``Something is changing,'' Ms.
Kleinfeld said. ``Just recently, people are beginning to be willing
to think about boys' problems.''
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that the status of women remains a real issue in
society. Despite the flood of women into business and the
professions over the last two decades, women are underrepresented
in corporate boardrooms, science labs and partnerships at law
firms. And even in school, sexual harassment remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Boys still dominate the nation's technical and engineering
schools, and obtain higher scores on many standardized tests _
although those gaps are narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   But some educators say the boys-versus-girls bean-counting has
gone too far, that those gaps have become small enough that they
are unimportant, especially when measured against the very large
racial differences in educational achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying that more girls take biology and chemistry, but
uh-oh, there's more boys in physics,'' said Diane Ravitch, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an alarm bell ringing in the night,'' she said.
``What we should be concerned about is the racial disparities.
There's a four-year gap between blacks and whites on the national
tests. The average black 17-year-old scores the same as the average
white 13-year-old. That's a crisis, not gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, president of Columbia University's Teachers
College, takes a middle road, stressing that both sexes have unique
problems that schools should address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not either-or, and we shouldn't always see things as the
crisis du jour,'' he said. ``We can do better by boys. We need to
do a lot better with regard to racial and socioeconomic
differences, and that doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to
the special needs of girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor over gender equity was kindled in 1992 by the release
of a study by the American Association of University Women, ``How
Schools Shortchange Girls,'' which declared that girls face bias
from preschool through high school in textbooks, tests and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The association presented the situation as dire. ``This report
brings to light the pervasive inequalities that have made girls
second-class students in America's schools,'' said Alice McKee, the
AAUW Educational Foundation president at the time. ``Girls and boys
enter school roughly equal in ability. Twelve years later, girls
have fallen behind in key areas. Whether one looks at achievement
scores, curriculum design or teacher-student interaction, it's
clear that our schools are shortchanging America's girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The report stimulated debate on teacher training and gender
equity, experiments with single-sex math and science classes and
new interest in girls' schools, including new efforts like the
Young Women's Leadership Academy in New York's Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But based on extensive re-examination of the AAUW data and
findings, Ms. Kleinfeld's paper found the report shoddy, biased and
simply incorrect. She wrote: ``In the view of elementary and high
school students, the young people who sit in the classroom year
after year and observe what is going on, both boys and girls agree:
Schools favor girls. Teachers think girls are smarter, like being
around them more and hold higher expectations for them.''

girls had just overtaken boys in almost every area. It might have

it was like calling a wedding a funeral. It was phony, it dominated
the news for years and it was harmful. There were all these special
programs put in place for girls, and no one paid any attention to
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Weinman, executive director of the AAUW, defends the

<P>
   ``The boy-girl problem is much deeper than education, it's a
civic responsibility problem. When I was a university president,
dealing with discipline cases where someone was being expelled or
suspended, it was always boys. I don't remember a single girl. We
need to teach boys responsibility. That's why sexual harassment is
still a problem. Boy-girl differences are still important, but they
pale in comparison to the big differences in education, which are
due to race and class.''

girls' gains, as well as the areas where boys lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree, the issue shouldn't be boys versus girls,'' Ms.
Weinman said. ``It should be equity and excellence for everyone.
And we're not stuck in the same groove, singing the same song. Our
follow-up report said number one, that girls had made real
progress; number two, that boys had not made that kind of progress
in the fields where they lag, and number three, that we should look
at subgroups, like Hispanic girls or African-American boys, to
determine where there are particular needs.''

   But even the new report emphasized a growing technology gap that
leaves girls less equipped for skilled computer jobs, calling
technology the new boy's club.
</P>

   ``It's a significant problem, and we're very concerned about
it,'' Ms. Weinman said. ``And it's true, we're the American
Association of University Women, and our mission is to look at

IN HOT PURSUIT OF MINUTIAE: THE SOUND OF ONE LAW BREAKING DOWN

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In theory, the independent counsel statute was
supposed to be a legal traffic light, blinking red and green at the
crossroads of law and politics. It would stop frivolous charges
against high-level officials, but serious accusations would be
waved on to an outside prosecutor. In recent days, however, the
statute's already overloaded circuitry seems to have blown a fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the law are coming at a critical time: The
statute is due to expire next year, and Democrats and Republicans
are lining to up declare that, after two decades, the law intended
to keep politics out of corruption cases should be allowed to die.
Last week an independent bipartisan commission that included Howard
Baker, the former senator and Reagan administration chief of staff,
and Griffin Bell, the former Carter administration attorney
general, issued a report saying the law doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of breakdown seems to be everywhere. In big-name
independent counsel cases, like Kenneth Starr's $33 million
sex-and-lies impeachment investigation of President Clinton, or
less pricey prosecutions, like Donald Smaltz's unsuccessful $17
million case against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy,
prosecutors seem to be ending up in bitter controversy or
humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And even when a scandal seems like a natural candidate for an
independent counsel, involving allegations of serious violations of
federal election law and accusations against a president and vice
president, the law doesn't seem to apply _ at least in the hands of
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years about 20 independent counsels have been appointed
(some ended their tenure after brief inquiries that were never made
public) to investigate charges against both Republican and
Democratic presidents, Cabinet officers and lesser officials. At
the moment, five independent counsels are still in operation, in
inquiries focused on Clinton and four current or former Cabinet
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic critics cite Starr and Smaltz as prime examples of
what the statute can produce: overzealous inquisitors operating
with limitless budgets and without the usual constraints on Justice
Department prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The critics complain that Starr and Smaltz seemed to be obsessed
by playing cat and mouse with a single quarry, in the process
bullying witnesses and spending years fruitlessly pursuing
investigative trails that career prosecutors would have dropped in
months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course many of the Democrats who are now complaining about
Starr were silent when the Republicans assailed Lawrence Walsh's
four-year independent counsel investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair. But even that inquiry largely failed to hold anyone
criminally liable for the profound constitutional issues at the
heart of the scandal. The inquiry ended abruptly when President
George Bush, after being defeated by Clinton, pulled the plug on
the prosecution by pardoning former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and five other former officials on Christmas Eve in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some inquiries have never gotten off the ground. Twice in the
last two weeks Ms. Reno has terminated 90-day preliminary inquires
with decisions that cleared Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of
wrongdoing in campaign fund raising. Her decisions made it highly
unlikely that either will ever be investigated by an outside
prosecutor for their role in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her recent decisions were consistent with her refusals over the
last two years to seek an outside counsel to investigate myriad
charges of campaign finance abuse, overruling both FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance unit. Each had concluded that the evidence required that
the case be sent to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, said last week that Ms. Reno's decision was
probably the ``final nail in the coffin of the independent counsel
law.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans complain that Ms. Reno has set the standard too
high in the campaign finance case, Democrats complain she has set
it too low in the case of lower-level Clinton administration

is the investigation of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
over the relatively small issue of whether he lied to the FBI about
how much money he paid his former mistress.
</P>

   So for whatever reasons recently, the law has been toothless in
cases of possibly serious violations of campaign finance laws but
has been used aggressively to investigate gifts of sports tickets,
payments to a mistress and whether Clinton lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet. Ms. Reno has one more independent counsel
decision. On Nov. 30, faced with a decision on whether to seek an
outside inquiry of Harold Ickes, formerly Clinton's deputy chief of
staff, Ms. Reno got a 60-day extension. At issue is whether Ms.
Ickes lied about his activities on behalf of the teamsters' union
in a labor dispute with a California walnut processor.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In theory, the independent counsel statute was
supposed to be a legal traffic light, blinking red and green at the
crossroads of law and politics. It would stop frivolous charges
against high-level officials, but serious accusations would be
waved on to an outside prosecutor. In recent days, however, the
statute's already overloaded circuitry seems to have blown a fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the law are coming at a critical time: The
statute is due to expire next year, and Democrats and Republicans
are lining to up declare that, after two decades, the law intended
to keep politics out of corruption cases should be allowed to die.
Last week an independent bipartisan commission that included Howard
Baker, the former senator and Reagan administration chief of staff,
and Griffin Bell, the former Carter administration attorney
general, issued a report saying the law doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of breakdown seems to be everywhere. In big-name
independent counsel cases, like Kenneth Starr's $33 million
sex-and-lies impeachment investigation of President Clinton, or
less pricey prosecutions, like Donald Smaltz's unsuccessful $17
million case against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy,
prosecutors seem to be ending up in bitter controversy or
humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And even when a scandal seems like a natural candidate for an
independent counsel, involving allegations of serious violations of
federal election law and accusations against a president and vice
president, the law doesn't seem to apply _ at least in the hands of
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years about 20 independent counsels have been appointed
(some ended their tenure after brief inquiries that were never made
public) to investigate charges against both Republican and
Democratic presidents, Cabinet officers and lesser officials. At
the moment, five independent counsels are still in operation, in
inquiries focused on Clinton and four current or former Cabinet
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic critics cite Starr and Smaltz as prime examples of
what the statute can produce: overzealous inquisitors operating
with limitless budgets and without the usual constraints on Justice
Department prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The critics complain that Starr and Smaltz seemed to be obsessed
by playing cat and mouse with a single quarry, in the process
bullying witnesses and spending years fruitlessly pursuing
investigative trails that career prosecutors would have dropped in
months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course many of the Democrats who are now complaining about
Starr were silent when the Republicans assailed Lawrence Walsh's
four-year independent counsel investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair. But even that inquiry largely failed to hold anyone
criminally liable for the profound constitutional issues at the
heart of the scandal. The inquiry ended abruptly when President
George Bush, after being defeated by Clinton, pulled the plug on
the prosecution by pardoning former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and five other former officials on Christmas Eve in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some inquiries have never gotten off the ground. Twice in the
last two weeks Ms. Reno has terminated 90-day preliminary inquires
with decisions that cleared Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of
wrongdoing in campaign fund raising. Her decisions made it highly
unlikely that either will ever be investigated by an outside
prosecutor for their role in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her recent decisions were consistent with her refusals over the
last two years to seek an outside counsel to investigate myriad
charges of campaign finance abuse, overruling both FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance unit. Each had concluded that the evidence required that
the case be sent to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, said last week that Ms. Reno's decision was
probably the ``final nail in the coffin of the independent counsel
law.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans complain that Ms. Reno has set the standard too
high in the campaign finance case, Democrats complain she has set
it too low in the case of lower-level Clinton administration
officials, who have been its most frequent targets. A case in point
is the investigation of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
over the relatively small issue of whether he lied to the FBI about
how much money he paid his former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   So for whatever reasons recently, the law has been toothless in
cases of possibly serious violations of campaign finance laws but
has been used aggressively to investigate gifts of sports tickets,
payments to a mistress and whether Clinton lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet. Ms. Reno has one more independent counsel
decision. On Nov. 30, faced with a decision on whether to seek an
outside inquiry of Harold Ickes, formerly Clinton's deputy chief of
staff, Ms. Reno got a 60-day extension. At issue is whether Ms.
Ickes lied about his activities on behalf of the teamsters' union
in a labor dispute with a California walnut processor.

GIFTS OF THE HEART MAY MEAN A KIDNEY

<P>
   David Patterson has a dilemma over a gift he wants to give
that's a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who is serving 12 years in California State Prison
for burglary and drug convictions, gave a kidney to his daughter,
Renada, three years ago, but the kidney failed. Now Patterson, 38,
wants to give his daughter, who is 16, his remaining kidney and go
on dialysis for the rest of his life, possibly a shortened one.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a living organ is no simple choice. Not only does it have
its physical components, it can be emotionally taxing for both the
giver and the recipient. For many recipients, the organ is the gift
of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Patterson's case, physicians are consulting ethicists and
lawyers on whether the organ transplant violates the Hippocratic
injunction to ``first, do no harm.'' The question may be mooted if
tests show that Renada has developed proteins that would cause her
to reject her father's other kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Living donors account for approximately 17.5 percent of
transplanted organs. But of the 3,695 kidney transplants from live
donors last year, the overwhelming majority came from a family
member or spouse. Studies show that donors fare quite well with a
single kidney, and that their life spans are not shortened.
</P>
<P>
   But when a relative needs an organ, the potential for subtle and
not-so-subtle coercion on a donor in the immediate family is so
great that some doctors feel compelled to offer that member an out,
sometimes giving the impression that the potential donor is not a
good match.
</P>
<P>
   Organ transplants can cement relationships or complicate them.
In Minnesota two years ago, Dorothy Zauhar's brother donated a
kidney to her fiance, Richard McNutt, who later broke off the
engagement and married a nurse in the transplant unit. The Zauhars
sued, alleging ``theft by swindle of a body organ.'' McNutt's
attorney, who denied the allegation, said his client considered the
kidney ``a gift.'' The judge dismissed the case but ordered McNutt
to pay Zauhars' hospital bills.
</P>
<P>
   The motivations of donors who are willing to donate beyond their
family circle are viewed skeptically. One such donation gave new
meaning to the phrase, ``I gave at the office.'' Nancy Nearing, a
42-year-old Virginia mother of two, recently donated a kidney to
her boss, Art Helms, a manager for Applied Management Systems in
Rockville, Md. But she was first interviewed by psychiatrists and
ethicists, who wanted to be sure that hers was a personal gift, not
a professional investment.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships swirling around gifts have long been a
favorite subject of anthropologists. In his famous 1922 study of
Trobriand Islanders, Bronislaw Malinowski studied gift exchanges,
noting that the rule of reciprocity does not underlie every gift to
the same extent. Describing a spectrum ranging from ``pure gifts''
to ``barter,'' Malinowski said that the closer the social ties the
greater likelihood of a pure gift.
</P>
<P>
   Such concepts have been transferred to organ transplants. The
ethos of organ and blood donation in America is premised on the
giving of gifts. It is a federal crime to buy or sell organs for
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   But few gifts come with no strings attached. The medical
sociologists Renee Fox and Judith Swazey refer to the ``tyranny of
the gift'' in ``The Encyclopedia of Bioethics'' (Free Press, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   The authors write, ``The donor has made the utmost gift; the
recipient has received something that is inherently unrepayable.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to these pressures, transplant professionals often
try to shield the identity of the deceased donors from recipients
lest any social or emotional entanglements arise between donor and
recipient families. The National Marrow Donor Program, which
maintains records on more than 3 million potential donors, strives
for a middle ground. If both the patient and donor wish to meet
after a year, the group will arrange a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some donors become very concerned about how a recipient
fares. One kidney donor committed suicide a few years ago after
sinking into a deep depression when the recipient became ill.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients themselves have their own issues. Earlier this
year, Kevin Harris, who received a kidney from his former college
roommate, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' ``I feel so
unworthy, so completely unworthy of that gift from him.''

   Like a grand piano-sized floral arrangement at a mob funeral,
historical respect has finally been laid before the memory of
Charles (Lucky) Luciana, who changed his surname to Luciano as a
rising young mafioso because he somehow thought it was easier to
spell. Last week, Time magazine included the original Godfather,

into a centrally supervised criminal syndicate that became known as
the Mafia, on its list of the 100 ``most influential business

   Luciano, enthused Time, ``used Standard &AMP; Poor's as much as

of people.''

   Whatever his recipe for success, Luciano was undoubtedly the

<P>
   In many ways, the FBI's file on Frank Sinatra, released last
week, said as much about the agency as it did about the singer. The
descriptions of his effect on teen-age girls were particularly
intriguing, as they shed light on the mindset of the G-man of 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So disturbed was one agent, L.B. Nichols, by the rapture of the
bobby-soxers that he recorded these observations on May 14, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   _ IRVIN MOLOTSKY
</P>
<P>
   `` As a symptom of the state of mind of many young people, I
wish to call to your attention the following incident that occurred
in Detroit last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra arrived in Detroit around midnight and a group of
bobby-soxers were waiting for him at the airfield. He eluded them
and they then congregated at the stage door of the Downtown Theater
where he was scheduled to give his first performance around 10:00
a.m. on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The line started forming at around 2:00 a.m. The police started
challenging girls who appeared to be under 16 and tried to send
them home. However, I have been told there was a long line of mere
kids, many of whom carried their lunches, and they remained in line
until the theater opened. Truant Officers started checking the
lines early in the morning and were berated by the girls.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread indignation on the part of numerous
individuals that I came in contact with and a severe indictment of
the parents of the girls. One individual went so far as to state
that Sinatra should be lynched. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In a note, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover offered this thought:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra is as much to blame as the moronic bobby-soxers.''

   In many ways, the FBI's file on Frank Sinatra, released last
week, said as much about the agency as it did about the singer. The
descriptions of his effect on teen-age girls were particularly
intriguing, as they shed light on the mindset of the G-man of 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So disturbed was one agent, L.B. Nichols, by the rapture of the
bobby-soxers that he recorded these observations on May 14, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   _ IRVIN MOLOTSKY
</P>
<P>
   `` As a symptom of the state of mind of many young people, I
wish to call to your attention the following incident that occurred
in Detroit last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra arrived in Detroit around midnight and a group of
bobby-soxers were waiting for him at the airfield. He eluded them
and they then congregated at the stage door of the Downtown Theater
where he was scheduled to give his first performance around 10:00
a.m. on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The line started forming at around 2:00 a.m. The police started
challenging girls who appeared to be under 16 and tried to send
them home. However, I have been told there was a long line of mere
kids, many of whom carried their lunches, and they remained in line
until the theater opened. Truant Officers started checking the
lines early in the morning and were berated by the girls.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread indignation on the part of numerous
individuals that I came in contact with and a severe indictment of
the parents of the girls. One individual went so far as to state
that Sinatra should be lynched. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In a note, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover offered this thought:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra is as much to blame as the moronic bobby-soxers.''

   NEW YORK _ On Dec. 2, a US Airways passenger jet landing at La
Guardia Airport came within 50 feet of a corporate plane preparing
to take off. It was one of three times in the Northeast this month
in which planes came too close together, which might lead
peak-season passengers to wonder what's going on up there. A lot:
air traffic nationally and in the Northeast has never been more
congested.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the National Geographic Society mapped the skies above
New York on a typical afternoon for its ``Historical Atlas of the
United States'' and identified about 45 aircraft flying below
14,000 feet, which included most planes headed to or from the three
major airports. Now, The New York Times has taken a more panoramic
snapshot that shows far more traffic overall.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying map shows the New York region's traffic at 6
p.m. on Oct. 8. The planes at lower altitudes were under the
control of the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, in
Westbury, N.Y.; the ones at higher altitudes were directed by the
New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has helped air traffic controllers keep pace with
greater congestion, but a controller's job remains highly
stressful. Controllers complain about unreliable and aging
equipment; experts say the Federal Aviation Administration must
find new technology or face gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   If the controllers make a mistake or their computers break down,
an onboard system can warn passenger plane pilots of impending
collisions. Last week, a British Caledonian Boeing 767 and a Delta
L-1011, both bound for Europe, came within a mile of each other
over Long Island, apparently because of computer error, but their
pilots were warned by the on-board anti-collision systems.

   The president's refrain today is: Don't impeach me; censure me.
But back in 1834, the argument was the other way around: Don't
censure me; impeach me.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of President Andrew Jackson's written protest
to the Senate against its 26-20 censure of his effort to scuttle
the national bank. In effect, the president was admonishing
legislators for running roughshod over the Constitution. (Does that
ring a bell? Some things never change.)

   ``The resolution of the Senate is wholly unauthorized by the
Constitution, and in derogation of its entire spirit. It assumes
that a single branch of the legislative department may for the
purposes of a public censure, and without any view to legislation
or impeachment, take up, consider, and decide upon the official
acts of the Executive. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is only in the exercise of its judicial powers, when sitting
as a court for the trial of impeachments, that the Senate is
expressly authorized . . . to consider and decide upon the conduct
of the President. . . .

<P>
   The Constitution declares that ``the President, Vice President
and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from
office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery or
other high crimes and misdemeanors''; that the House of
Representatives ``shall have the sole power of impeachment''; that
the Senate ``shall have the sole power to try all impeachments''; .
. . (and) that ``no person shall be convicted without the
concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The President of the United States, therefore, has been by a
majority of his constitutional triers accused and found guilty of
an impeachable offense, but in no part of this proceeding have the
directions of the Constitution been observed.

   The impeachment, instead of being preferred and prosecuted by
the House of Representatives, originated in the Senate, and was
prosecuted without the aid or concurrence of the other House. The

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a huge plateful of large and complex corporate
mergers to review and a host of major civil enforcement cases
against corporate America's biggest names, antitrust officials are
experiencing a renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials report that they have filed a record number of
challenges this year to mergers and other anti-competitive
practices and have collected record amounts in civil fines and
other penalties.
</P>
<P>
   They have stretched some old antitrust theories and applied a
few new ones _ such as now routinely requiring every merger
examination to include a look at how the proposed deal may affect
product innovation and development. Their targets have been a Who's
Who among corporate powerhouses and include Microsoft and Intel,
Mastercard and Visa, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust is a highly political discipline, and it tends to
ebb and flow,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the
University of Iowa College of Law and the author of a leading
treatise on the subject. ``It's flowing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the renewed vigor is a consequence of two related
economic trends: the deregulation of certain industries and the
unparalleled wave of business mergers and acquisitions. In the
fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission, the two main agencies that enforce U.S.
antitrust law, examined 4,728 proposed mergers, more than at any
other time, and three times as many deals as in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the merger-and-acquisition wave, the agencies are
now reviewing five of the largest business transactions in U.S.
history: the proposed $80 billion acquisition of Mobil Corp. by
Exxon, the $62 billion purchase of Ameritech by SBC Communications,
Bell Atlantic's $52 billion acquisition of GTE, AT&AMP;T's $32 billion
purchase of Tele-Communications Inc. and British Petroleum's $48
billion buyout of Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   However the agencies rule on those deals _ they can seek to have
them blocked or modified, or they can simply approve them _ their
aggressive view of the law has already made them a central force in
setting economic policy in a wide range of industries left
untouched by other policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into a vacuum created by the deregulation of such
industries as airlines and telecommunications, they have
restructured or blocked numerous multibillion-dollar mergers and
joint-venture agreements that once fell under the purview of other
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the airline industry was deregulated in
the late 1970s, they filed a lawsuit two months ago to prevent a
big airline merger, one involving Northwest Airlines' acquisition
of Continental.
</P>
<P>
   But through such civil suits as the Microsoft case, they are
also evolving into the role of overseeing emerging areas of
enterprise like the Internet, and through challenges of proposed
mergers involving large and small research and development
companies, they are playing an important role in arranging the
corporate landscape in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these trends, some experts said that the vigorous
enforcement was still less aggressive than at other points in
history, such as the 1930s and the 1960s, and noted that the new
vigor was not a consequence of any significant Supreme Court
victories involving the nation's competition laws or any major
revisions of the guidelines that are used to scrutinize mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly, there have not been any major doctrinal
changes,'' said George Priest, a professor of law and economics at
Yale University. ``They are using some different theories, and they
are trimming some proposed mergers back in order to facilitate
them. But they are also sometimes bringing cases without
articulating a clear theory or vision about what they are trying to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, said that antitrust enforcement ``reflects a point of
historic convergence involving a commitment of deregulation and
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The essential component of that confluence is active antitrust
enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Clinton administration's enforcement record
is a marked departure from those of Republican predecessors. During
the Reagan administration and to a lesser extent under President
George Bush, the antitrust division and the FTC were backwaters
that suffered from severe staff cutbacks. Particularly under
Reagan, they followed a laissez-faire philosophy that found little
value in broad enforcement of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude was that everything was self-correcting,'' said
Robert Pitofsky, an antitrust professor and former dean at
Georgetown Law School, who is now the chairman of the FTC. ``But as
time has gone on, we've seen how wrong that was.''
</P>
<P>
   The two agencies continue to suffer from staff shortages, having
never recovered from the cutbacks in the '80s. Because of the large
number of mergers, they have been forced to undertake a kind of
regulatory triage, delaying and thinly staffing civil enforcement
inquiries in order to complete merger reviews under the deadlines
set by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the agencies are doing things that have not been
done in a long time, if at all, using novel legal theories and
stretching more conventional ones.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, recognizing that research in many emerging
industries is ultimately more important than the products they may
make, the officials have ordered the redrawing of mergers of
companies that are in nascent research-and-development stages,
years away from production.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving the merger of the Swiss-based drug giants
Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, the FTC required the sale of patents and
technological know-how involving their pioneering research in gene
therapy for various diseases, even though the companies did not
expect to bring any such products to market for years.
</P>
<P>
   With greater frequency, they have also taken a more concentrated
look at the effect of a merger on new companies rather than the
older, more conventional analysis that looks at whether a merger
has a likelihood of promoting collusion and oligopolies in a wide
range of industries from retailing to military contracting.
</P>
<P>
   This ``theory of unilateral effects'' was first articulated by
an economist in 1929. But it was never widely used by regulators
because it was thought to be too difficult to gather market data.
With technological advances, such as the use of price scanners in
stores and the proliferation of powerful personal computers, it has
become easier to manipulate data and apply the theory.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Hovenkamp, ``is more aggressive
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also challenging mergers involving so-called vertical
integration _ a supplier buying a manufacturer, or a manufacturer
buying a wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   At the FTC, officials restructured four important mergers in the
last year either in whole or in part because of questions of
improper vertical integration.
</P>
<P>
   One such case involved the $10 billion purchase of Energy Group
PLC of Britain, which produced about 15 percent of the coal in the
United States, by Pacificorp, a leading Western utility.
(Pacificorp itself agreed last week to be acquired by Scottish
Power PLC for nearly $13 billion in equity and debt.)
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust officials required the divestiture of certain coal
mines that would have enabled the new combination to raise a
rival's generating costs, and as a result, the wholesale price of
electricity in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the officials forced TRW Inc. to sell a
Pentagon engineering business as a condition of its $975 million
purchase of BDM International in order to satisfy concerns that the
deal would not put TRW in a position to favor itself as a
competitor for ballistic-missile contracts.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ For nearly two months now, the 7,500 workers who
punch in every morning at Iran Tractor Manufacturing Co. have found
themselves with almost nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly line has all but shut, starved of raw materials
that the government can no longer afford to import. Tractor sales
have plummeted; most customers are struggling to make ends meet.
Only the promise of a paycheck keeps workers showing up, but last
month most got just half their $130 wage.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's economy is growing sicker by the day. The price of
Iranian oil, the export lifeblood, has dipped below $10, a
25-year-low that has forced the government to slash imports, dig
deep into reserves and postpone payments on foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the consequences have been sharp: rising prices,
plunging productivity, stagnant economic growth. And in their quest
for further remedies, Iranian leaders seem dwarfed by the country's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government is not capable of solving the economic
problems, the economic problems could ultimately overwhelm the
government,'' said Rahim Oskui, a prominent private economist.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, the situation has not yet rebounded against
President Mohammad Khatami, who seems almost as popular as when he
was elected 19 months ago. But with prices rising, the currency
falling and production at factories grinding to a halt, there is
clear discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say there are no easy solutions to what Khatami has
called Iran's ``chronic illness.'' And as he and his rivals weigh
the hard choices that remain after two decades of economic
mismanagement, a widespread sense of urgency has left them
increasingly exposed.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's third-ranking oil exporter, behind Saudi Arabia
and Norway, Iran possesses a blessing and a curse. Even as its
population has soared, more than doubling in the last 20 years, its
oil earnings have kept afloat a bloated, centrally controlled
economy that enjoys little foreign investment and spends $11
billion a year on subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But that has also allowed Iranian leaders to shrug off the depth
of their dependence on oil, which still accounts for 80 percent of
the country's foreign currency earnings. And even as the plunge in
prices has caused oil revenues to tumble, from more than $19
billion in 1986 to about $10 billion this year, Iranians still seem
to find it hard to accept that big changes might be required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an economic model in Iran, and that is why we
lack economic security,'' said Ramazanpour Nargessi, a member of
the conservative-dominated Parliament who is sympathetic to
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until late last month, even Khatami, who has coupled his
calls for greater political openness in Iran with vaguer calls for
economic change, had in fact done virtually nothing to address the
country's economic ills. His only real proposals had been stopgap
measures to address a crisis that has been partially of his
government's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has often acknowledged that Iran's economic problems are
considerable. He has said he hopes to encourage foreign investment
and to ``break the monopolies'' held by government-affiliated
foundations, which control as much as 40 percent of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never spelled out whether or not he hopes to shrink
the Iranian government's role in an economy only about one-fifth of
which is in private hands. And he appears torn, Iranian analysts
say, between an appreciation for free-enterprise and a commitment
to what he calls social justice.
</P>
<P>
   The budget that Khatami's government drafted a year ago was
based on the assumption that oil prices would average $17.50 a
barrel _ a guess so wildly optimistic that even the supportive Iran
News has said it ``inflicted irreparable harm on our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Khatami has zeroed in on the costly,
wasteful gasoline subsidies that allow Iranian motorists to fill up
for just 12 cents a gallon, a price lower than anywhere else in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponents in the conservative-dominated Parliament have
vowed to block him on any price increase, saying a price increase
would be too burdensome for ordinary Iranians to bear. Economists
and other experts see the stalemate as a worrying indication that
political rivalries could get in the way of any quest to put Iran's
economy on a solid long-term footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be too much fear and too much inertia,'' a Western
diplomat said of the prospects for fundamental change, ``because
any tinkering with the system now in place is bound to have social
consequence for the population at large.''
</P>
<P>
   To many economists, including Fereydoun Barkeshii of the
semi-official Institute for International Energy Studies, the gas
subsidy is far and away the most onerous example of the distortions
that riddle Iran's economy. With it, the price Iranians pay for
gasoline is about one-third what it costs the country to produce
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Iran's wealthier neighbors in the Persian Gulf sell gas at
a higher price, so a good bit of Iranian gasoline makes its way
there, to a tidy smugglers' profit. Iranian refineries cannot meet
the outsized demand, so that Iran must import gasoline, at market
prices, at a cost of more than $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Oil Minister Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh has said that a cut in
subsidies represents ``the only way to reduce domestic consumption
and decrease imports.'' But critics led by Ali Abbas-Pour, a
conservative member of Parliament, have objected to any price rise
on the ground that it would contribute to inflation, already
running about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without such support, the only kinds of emergency measures for
which Khatami has so far won approval include those that are mostly
smoke-and-mirrors, like the ``forward selling'' of more than $1
billion of oil still in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran is still expected to face major budget deficits, this
year and next year, forcing it to turn to a central bank willing to
print more money. Its problems have been compounded by its
restrictions on most imports, which have left factories without the
raw materials they need to generate any significant revenues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the country's bill for food and other vital imports and
for payments on foreign debt is still expected to exceed the $13
billion in foreign currency revenue that Iran is expected to earn
this year from its oil and non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, after dipping heavily into its foreign exchange
reserves, Western diplomats say, Iran halted payments in late
September of the $5.9 billion it owes this year to Germany, Italy
and Japan, part of a debt package that has already been rescheduled
once, in 1993. The government is now negotiating with banks in
those countries in hopes of stretching out those payments further,
but no one has been able to rule out the prospect that it might
have to declare a formal default.
</P>
<P>
   As one way to ease financial pressure, some Iranians inclined
toward a freer market have specifically proposed that the
government begin to sell shares in state enterprises to private
investors _ a first step toward reversing the nationalization that
was a centerpiece of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have decentralized their economies are heading
toward success,'' said one such advocate, Assadollah Asgaroladi,
vice president of Iran's chamber of commerce. But despite his vague
comments in the same spirit, Khatami and others in government have
not yet shown any willingness to embrace such a campaign. Any real
move toward privatization would require a political challenge to
the powerful bounyads, the government foundations that were set up
with holdings confiscated from the shah and now operate without
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The foundations are controlled by pillars of a conservative
establishment opposed to Khatami. Although they have been the
targets of fierce criticism by some of Khatami's supporters, they
are seen by others in Iran as important legacies of the revolution
that should not be swept away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no sign that Khatami is really ready to make
tough economic decisions,'' a Western diplomat said. ``But unless
he does, there is a danger that things could get much worse, and
that what he has done to make Iran more open could begin to seem
less consequential.''

ITALY LOCKED IN STALEMATE WITH TURKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ On a June evening five years ago, a squad of
Kurdish rebels arrived at a village in southeastern Turkey and
marched to the home of a young man who had just decided to quit the
rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   By quitting, the former guerrilla had violated a central tenet
of the movement, which is called the Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK. It demands that all its fighters commit themselves to serve
until ``victory or death.''
</P>
<P>
   The defector was not at home when his erstwhile comrades
arrived, so instead they killed his mother and five brothers and
sisters, ages 4 to 13. Later the New York-based group Human Rights
Watch asserted that this action and dozens like it ``were not
committed by rogue units or commanders, but were PKK official
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder and leader of the Kurdish rebel movement, Abdullah
Ocalan, was arrested last month in Italy, and Turkey is demanding
that he be returned here to face trial for the 1994 massacre and
dozens of others committed by his troops. Italy refuses to return
him, because its Constitution forbids extraditing prisoners to
countries where they might face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Italian leaders have little desire, though, to put Ocalan on
trial in Italy. Officials in Germany, where prosecutors say the
Kurdish group has used killings and arson to support lucrative
heroin-smuggling operations, are also reluctant to try him. Both
countries fear that the Kurdish rebels' supporters would erupt in
violent anger against any government that seeks to prosecute
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Italian and German leaders have proposed sending
Ocalan to an international court. Ocalan has seized on the idea,
evidently seeing it as a way to turn the table on his Turkish
pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to go before an international tribunal made up of
independent judges to decide whether we or the Turkish government
are responsible for the escalation of armed conflict that has led
to thousands of deaths on both sides,'' he told an interviewer last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot accept a trial of Apo as a person,'' he said, using
the pseudonym by which he is widely known. ``The argument over a
trial must be related to the war in Kurdistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan suggested that an independent panel be asked to examine
the Kurdish problem and then decide who should be tried for human
rights abuses. ``It could be me or members of my party, or Turkish
officials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These proposals have outraged Turkish officials and many
ordinary Turks. They believe Ocalan is seeking to escape
responsibility for savage killings by putting the Turkish army into
the defendant's chair instead of sitting there himself.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy that could have political benefits for Ocalan.
Groups like Human Rights Watch that have accused him of crimes
against humanity have also been strongly critical of the Turkish
military.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that an international tribunal
would be ``simply a forum to politicize the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian and German premiers have tried to transfer the
prosecution to a European forum, but this can only aggravate the
situation, intensify the conflict with Rome and create a situation
which is even harder to manage,'' Cem said. ``Ocalan's trial in an
international court will be nothing other than a comedy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides Turkish objections, there is another obstacle to the
idea of bringing Ocalan before an international court, either alone
or with co-defendants. No such court exists. More than 60 countries
agreed earlier this year to create one, but it will be years before
it begins to function.
</P>
<P>
   Although tribunals have been set up to try accused war criminals
from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, they have no broader
mandate. The International Court of Justice in The Hague,
Netherlands, which is widely respected for its prudence and
sophistication, accepts only disputes among nations and is not
equipped to try individuals.

IN FRANCE, LE PEN FEUD HAS RIGHT IN UPHEAVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Nine months ago the National Front, for years the most
powerful far-right movement in Western Europe, turned French
politics upside down: It lured moderate conservatives into regional
political alliances that had previously been anathema.
</P>
<P>
   Now the party is in disarray after its leader, the irascible
Jean-Marie Le Pen, 70, threw out the man who was behind its drive
for right-wing respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Megret, the 49-year-old architect of the new policy, was
Le Pen's principal deputy until Wednesday, when he broke openly
with the party patriarch after months of subterranean dissension
and called for a special party convention in January to thrash out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen then dismissed Megret, had bodyguards evict Megret
loyalists from their offices in the party's headquarters, in
suburban St.-Cloud, and said there would be no convention. He said
he had been the victim of ``subversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Megret, whose wife, Catherine, is the mayor of Vitrolles, on the
outskirts of Marseilles, countered, ``The National Front does not
belong to anyone.'' This in itself was considered an affront by Le
Pen, who founded the National Front in 1972 and has said, echoing
an aphorism of Louis XIV, ``I am the National Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall Megret opposed Le Pen's plan to have his wife,
Jeanne-Marie, lead the party's ticket for European Parliament
elections next June if he could not do so himself. Megret thought
that as Le Pen's deputy, he should step in. Le Pen quickly
countered that Mrs. Le Pen would run if he wanted her to.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Versailles has convicted Le Pen of assaulting a
Socialist politician there who was running against Le Pen's
daughter during French legislative elections last year. The court
suspended his right to vote or run for office for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month another court reduced the sentence to one
year, suspended, but Le Pen has appealed to the highest court and
can run for office next spring if, as is almost certain, his appeal
is still pending then.
</P>
<P>
   A German court is also investigating him for describing the Nazi
gas chambers in World War II as ``a detail of history'' in a speech
in Munich, a possible violation of a German law that forbids
trivializing the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Megret said earlier this year that he could not deny that Le Pen
had said such things, but insisted that such views were not part of
the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen, in a rare national television appearance, said recently
that it was his opponents in the party who were racists, not he. He
added that he would indeed head the ticket next June, and that he
hoped it would win about 20 percent of the vote, placing 21 members
in the European Parliament to fight plans to submerge Europe's
nation-states in federalism. The party won 11 seats in the last
elections, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen ran for the French presidency in 1995 and won 15 percent
of the vote, as the party does routinely nationwide. It made even
stronger showings in suburbs of cities like Paris and Strasbourg,
which have high concentrations of immigrants from Turkey and North
Africa. The party platform promises to send such people back to
their countries of origin if it ever wins power.
</P>
<P>
   Until Megret and his moderate strategy came along, it seemed
unlikely that the National Front would ever run the country. But
Megret, a former Gaullist, succeeded last spring in getting
conservative leaders in five of the 22 regional assemblies to
accept support from the National Front to stay in power after the
Socialists gained ground in regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   These conservatives, who defied President Jacques Chirac and
others, were later expelled from their own parties, which have been
trying to make a comeback ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the National Front that is at war with itself, with Le
Pen claiming victory over what he described as an ``attempted
putsch'' and Megret saying he had enough support among the party's
50,000 members to mandate the special convention he wants to hold.

 UNDECIDED, AND FEELING ALL THE WEIGHT OF WORRY AND HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president has not called and the speaker-elect
has told him to vote his conscience. But the considerable pressure
on Rep. Michael Forbes, one of maybe a dozen Republicans still
genuinely undecided on impeachment, is subtler than that, and in
the end, mostly internal.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been en route to Israel with President Clinton
this weekend, along with at least one other Republican
fence-sitter, fellow New York Rep. Rick Lazio. Initially, he
accepted the president's invitation, then backed out at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is sitting among the empty boxes in his bare-walled
new congressional office on a Friday night _ Hey, how come nobody
told him the subway rumbles right beneath his floor? And he is
wondering how to make the decision he fears will haunt him in old
age.
</P>
<P>
   Roughing out the arguments, pro and con, he sounds less like
Hamlet than Tevye: On the one hand, party elders have suggested
that defectors will not get so much as a new stop sign in their
districts, and who needs that? On the other, he says, impeachment
is ``very, very serious stuff. And I can't shake this thing inside
me that says this is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he just spent two years on the outs with his party.
Forbes was the first to break ranks and announce that he would not
support Newt Gingrich for speaker in 1996 because of ethical
violations. A pariah within his caucus, Forbes was on his way to
legislative oblivion before his friend, the Speaker-elect Robert
Livingston, reprieved him. And only recently, Livingston made the
rehabilitation complete, naming him to a minor leadership post as
one of the speaker's four assistants.
</P>
<P>
   So why jeopardize this new status? Already, the conservative
magazine Human Events has put him on a list of Republicans branded
the ``pro-perjury caucus.'' And a few days ago, someone leaked an
item to The Washington Times showing that he contributed money to
Democrats in last month's elections. (He says he was in charge of
raising about $700,000 for Livingston's political action committee,
which handed it out to other Republicans. But Forbes also
personally gave $1,000 each to two Democratic friends, Reps.
Loretta Sanchez of California and William Pascrell Jr. of New
Jersey.)
</P>
<P>
   When it is pointed out that it sounds like he thinks the true
vote of conscience is a vote against impeachment, he says that is
not necessarily the case. He has a 19-year-old daughter and says he
does believe that Clinton's behavior with Monica Lewinsky amounted
to the sexual harassment of a young woman only a few years older.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was despicable,'' Forbes said, taking a swig of
Diet Coke. ``You had an immature, impressionable kid, albeit an
aggressive pursuer, but a kid. Even though she apparently agreed to
all this, she was a child, and that is gnawing at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, on yet another hand, he genuinely likes the
president on a personal level, and that counts for something, too.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was a Gingrich acolyte with great enthusiasm for the
Contract With America when he was elected in 1994. But he has
steadily been getting more moderate and now tends to agree with
Clinton on some issues. At the president's invitation, he flew on
Air Force One to an event in the Hamptons last summer on the
patient bill of rights they both support and was clearly wowed. He
thinks a lot about the phrase, ``punishment to fit the crime,''and
wonders if impeaching Clinton would be ``overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, constituents in his district on New York's
eastern Long Island seem just as divided. Everywhere he goes at
home, he is stopped by people with strong opinions one way or the
other. When they say, `I'm sure you'll do the right thing,'' he
does not ask what that might be. He notes that the half of voters
in his swing district who support him would hate a vote against
impeachment, but as of Friday, calls were running incredibly close,
with 2,233 lobbying for impeachment and 2,235 against it. Among the
callers was his wife, Barbara Forbes, who had phoned to voice her
support for impeachment, and told the staff member who answered
that she was calling as just another constituent. And another,
apparently; she called more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes laughed that his wife had already won one round in the
decision-making process, helping him to see why, after some
flip-flopping, he should skip the trip to Israel with the
president. In the end, he says, he stuck around mostly because he
did not want to miss celebrating his son Sam's first birthday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But on the far trickier question of how to vote, he goes on
worrying about literally dozens of things: the verdict of history,
how an impeachment might affect the stock market, and his party's
future, as well as Clinton's. And his own: if he votes against
impeachment, he suspects he will have a tough time running for the
Senate one day. That there will be no censure option, he believes,
makes things even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   He even worries about looking like he is enjoying his worrying,
still mindful of the teasing he took two years ago from colleagues
who thought he was milking his ethical objections to Gingrich a
little too obviously. And as a result, he has mostly been laying
low in recent weeks, even turning down an invitation to go on
``Meet the Press'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He says he did not find the debate in the Judiciary Committee
particularly helpful. In the end it did not sway him one way or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   And he does not plan to decide until he absolutely has to, after
calling a couple dozen friends and supporters on Long Island this
weekend. And though, as of Friday night, he appeared to be leaning
ever so slightly against impeachment, he denied that that meant
much: ``I've been on both sides of this,'' he said. ``Over and
over.''

   The shame of it all.
</P>
<P>
   So began Morris' plea for votes for his proposed ordinance to
ban the construction of new drive-through windows in Atlanta, the
national leader in what Morris refers to as ``autodependency.''
Under his bill, the city would effectively declare an end to more
convenient but bloodless car-bound transactions at banks, fast-food
eateries, dry cleaners, pharmacies, liquor stores and cappucino
cafes. In Atlanta, you can even drive through for chitlins.
</P>
<P>
   To Morris' thinking, autodependency in Atlanta is responsible
for dirty air, traffic congestion, obesity, global warming,
respiratory illness, an epidemic of pedestrian deaths and the
deterioration of community. The Atlanta Regional Commission, a
coalition of local governments, has concluded that Atlantans drive
an average of 33 miles a day, more than residents of any other
major city, and 52 percent more than people in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After debate, and some lobbying by bankers and burger barons,
the Council rejected Morris' admittedly modest proposal by an 8-5
vote. But the measure spoke to the desperation of this city, and so
many others, trying to control problems like air pollution and
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Atlanta has been on the go for nearly 30 years,
emerging unscathed from the civil rights movement. And after more
than doubling its population in that period, to 3.1 million, it
suffers from severe traffic and environmental woes. The area's
leaders, including Gov.-elect Roy Barnes, are increasingly
concerned that ozone days and creeping traffic are becoming an
intractable part of Atlanta's international profile. A poll of
Atlanta business and political leaders this year showed that air
quality had replaced crime and public education as their greatest
concern.
</P>
<P>
   With no mountains or oceans to block Atlanta's growth, farmland
and forest have been swiftly paved into nondescript exurbia. And
despite the relentless expansion of the road system, drivers have
come to expect delays any time and anywhere. The recent addition of
high-occupancy-vehicle lanes on the three Interstate highways
converging in downtown Atlanta have had little noticeable impact.
</P>
<P>
   The city's air quality is considered so hazardous that federal
financing for new highway projects has effectively been frozen.
Studies have found that more than half of the nitrogen oxides in
Atlanta's air comes from cars, and environmental officials project
that pollution will worsen in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Atlanta was founded as the terminus of the Western &AMP;
Atlantic Railroad in 1837, transportation has been central to its
character. Although a few in-town neighborhoods, like Midtown and
Virginia Highlands have retained a pedestrian charm, the area's
suburban design and personality have largely made it a driving
city. While the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's
trains are clean and efficient, its service area remains limited.
Many of those who do take the trains commute to the stations by
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Several smaller cities, including Burbank and Sierra Madre,
Calif., and Carrboro, N.C., have imposed limits on drive-through
windows in recent years, although usually to preserve their
character rather than to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Morris understood that his proposal to ban the construction of
new drive-throughs fell somewhat short of a panacea. Robert King,
president of the Georgia Hospitality &AMP; Travel Association, called
it ``a Band-Aid on a blowout.'' It is not even clear that an idling
car at a drive-through pollutes any more than a car that is stopped
and then started again. But with the hundreds of competing
governments in the metropolitan area flailing in their efforts to
improve air quality, Morris felt it was time to do something,
anything, to get Atlantans out of their cars, to show some
determination to change the city's culture.
</P>
<P>
   He also understood that his measure would cause inconvenience,
especially for the elderly, the handicapped and parents of young
children. But he recalled that it was not so long ago that the
culture deemed it inconvenient to toss soft-drink bottles and
litter into trash cans rather than into rivers and gutters.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters noted that the city and its suburbs had to start
somewhere. ``Everyone says that they're supportive of cleaning up
the air,'' said Councilwoman Debi Starnes. ``Everyone says that
they're supportive of making our city and the world more pedestrian
friendly. And everyone says that they realize that in order to
accomplish those two objectives that we're going to have to do a
lot of little and medium things. There's no one big thing that will
solve these problems. And almost every time one of these little or
medium things comes up, people say, `Well not this little or medium
thing. This won't make that much difference.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the measure failed, with its opponents
lauding Morris' intentions but condemning his methods. They argued
that the ordinance would place an unreasonable burden on
businesses, would put Atlanta at a competitive disadvantage with
surrounding jurisdictions, would undercut its tax base and would
inconvenience the disabled. Black members of the Council opposed it
unanimously, with many arguing that it would stifle badly needed
development on the city's predominantly black south side.
Councilman Derrick Boazman took a shot at Morris' moralizing by
observing that he had not noticed any donkeys or electric cars in
the City Hall garage that day.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, not surprisingly, found the outcome a bit frustrating.
``Atlanta is known for its rah-rah pro-business attitude,'' he
said. ``And the pursuit of the almighty dollar tends to overwhelm
good public policy.''

   ATLANTA _ Opening a debate here Tuesday night, City Councilman
Lee Morris wanted to make one thing clear. ``I don't think
drive-throughs are evil,'' Morris said. ``And I don't think that

pathetic dependency: ``Uh, I use them myself _ because they're

<P>
   In the early 1980s, as many South American countries were
preparing to switch from military to civilian rule, they were
hugely encouraged by Spain's recent passage from dictatorship to
democracy. Just seven years after Francisco Franco's death in 1975,
Spain had elected a socialist government, while its handsome young
prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, had become a political pinup
throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Less attention was given to a key reason for Spain's successful
transition: Still carrying the scars of civil war and repression,
Spain had decided to address its future by turning the page on its
past. There was no question of punishing the abuses of the Franco
regime. And even then, a military revolt in early 1981, albeit
defused by King Juan Carlos, was a chilling reminder that true
reconciliation would take time.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, Spain served as something of a model for much of
Latin America _ and, in a particular irony, for Chile. In 1990 the
region duly adapted Spain's gradual transition to its own
circumstances. But now it finds itself at odds with Madrid over a
Spanish prosecutor's efforts to punish the former Chilean dictator,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, for crimes allegedly committed up to 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In most Latin American countries, ``borron y cuenta nueva'' _
``wipe the slate and start afresh'' _ was the preferred approach.
Only in Argentina did some former junta members end up in jail
because only in Argentina was a military regime forced out of
office (after defeat in the 1982 Falklands war). Elsewhere,
including Chile, armies ceded power slowly and reluctantly and,
while special commissions issued ``Never Again'' reports on
assassinations, disappearances and torture, those responsible were
rarely charged.
</P>
<P>
   It seems all the stranger then that Spain should now be trying
to extradite Pinochet to Madrid to face trial for the genocide,
terrorism and torture of Spanish nationals under the rules of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old general, who was arrested in London in October
at the request of a Spanish judge, appeared before an English
magistrate Friday for a preliminary hearing into Spain's
extradition request after his claims to immunity were rejected.
Thursday, he was formally indicted in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The case has caused a storm in Chile's relations with both Spain
and Britain, with Pinochet sympathizers calling for reprisals and
warning that his trial could destabilize Chile's new democracy.
Even the country's center-left coalition government has urged that
the former dictator be released, hinting unconvincingly that he
might even be brought to trial once home. And, of course, Chilean
conservatives have remarked that Spain is trying to do to others
what it did not do to itself.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps stranger twist is that while Spain is now being
applauded by center-left governments and human rights groups for
daring to apply international humanitarian law, this new status is
hardly relished by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. Indeed, his
conservative government repeatedly argued before a Madrid court
that Spain had no jurisdiction in the case, although its challenge
was finally rejected by a panel of Spanish high court judges. Last
week the government said it ``wholly respected'' the legal process;
in private, officials said they would prefer it if the general just
flew home.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's position is not difficult to understand. In the 1980s,
Spain's relations with Latin America were essentially political and
cultural as both sides reached out for international respectability
after years of authoritarianism. But when Latin America's economies
opened up in the 1990s, with many government-owned enterprises
becoming privatized, Spain's focus changed. Suddenly, Spain saw the
region as one big business opportunity. With a rush of investment
in telecommunications, banking, electrical energy, airlines, book
publishing and other areas, Spain's annual direct investment in
Latin America grew to $4.7 billion in 1997 from just $155 million
in 1990, according to the Madrid-based Institute for European-Latin
American Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Chile, which has had the region's fastest economic growth this
decade, was a particularly enticing target for Spanish business
interests. Last month, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
estimated that Spain has some $7 billion worth of direct investment
in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With so much in the balance, then, the last thing that Spain
wants is to be seen to be pulling rank, playing the colonial
master, interfering in the region's affairs in the manner of, well,
the United States, the country that moved quickly to expand its
influence in Latin America after Spain was chased out in the 19th
century. Having left its linguistic and cultural stamp on Latin
America, Spain now prefers to be thought of more as friendly
brother than overbearing mother.
</P>
<P>
   And much of Latin America is keen to reciprocate. It was charmed
by Gonzalez and it routinely mobs King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia
on their frequent visits. It was disappointed when Spain's entry
into the European Union in 1986 did not multiply Latin American
exports to Europe. But Spanish investment still has the singular
advantage of not being American.
</P>
<P>
   Will all this be disturbed by the maverick Spanish judge,
Baltasar Garzon, and his audacious moves against Pinochet? In Chile
perhaps it will be upset temporarily, above all if the extradition
process in Britain drags on for many months. ``The current
situation is going to complicate our lives somewhat from a
political viewpoint, depending on how things play out,'' noted
Rodolfo Martin Villa, chairman of the Spanish utility Endesa, which
has bought a 32-percent share of Enersis, Chile's main distributor
of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Latin America, Spain seems unlikely to be much
affected. Because of Washington's record of intervening politically
or militarily in the region, most Latin American countries react
nervously to threats to their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the people who are now presidents of several Latin countries
themselves spent time in either jail or exile while military
regimes were in power. At a regional summit last week, they stated
their belief that international law should apply to ``crimes of
international transcendence.''
</P>
<P>
   More relevant, perhaps, with democracy well entrenched in the
region and no imminent perils of military takeovers, Latin American
governments are today far more concerned about managing their
troubled economies than reliving the ideological confrontations of
the 1970s and 1980s. ``Latin America needs capital and Spain has
capital,'' the Spanish writer and sociologist Amando de Miguel
noted, ``so even Chile needs Spain. That's why I don't think
reprisals are very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Latin American officials and diplomats look to the
future, they have a concern that is more immediate than whether
international justice should be applied to Pinochet or other
retired generals with brutal human rights records in, say,
Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   It is what can be done to prepare a peaceful transition to
democracy in the region's last remaining undisguised dictatorship,
Cuba. And there, Spain's original model of ``borron y cuenta
nueva'' may again prove useful.

IN MEXICO, RIVAL PARTIES REACH ACCORD ON BANK AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After nine months of debate that strained Mexico's
maturing democracy and threatened to destabilize the financial
system, the government and a major opposition party have reached
full agreement on reorganizing a $61 billion bank bailout that had
become an example to taxpayers of spectacular corruption favoring
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout discussion utterly dominated Mexican politics this
year, becoming the first opportunity for opposition parties voted
into new positions of power in 1997 to question the government's
past economic performance, force it to admit errors and change its
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The National Action Party, or PAN, a conservative opposition
group, decided to accept an eleventh-hour resolution with the
government to signal to Mexican bankers and debtors and
international investors that the opposition will not push partisan
politics at the expense of the nation's financial well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party reached the bailout deal late Friday with
the government's party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI. The proposal was immediately voted out of a congressional
committee and is expected to be approved by the full lower house of
the Congress later Saturday. Approval by the Senate is pro-forma
because the PRI holds a majority there.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the delegates from the National Action Party
who blinked in a standoff _ which had stalled the discussions for
weeks _ over the resignation of Guillermo Ortiz as head of the
central bank. The party's leaders were insisting that Ortiz leave,
because they argued that he had violated the Mexican Constitution
when, as finance minister, he cobbled together the first bailout
program in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The National Action Party lawmakers settled for language in the
bill that puts some pressure on Ortiz to resign in coming months
but does not require him to do so right away. Ortiz is a close ally
of President Ernesto Zedillo, and the government staunchly refused
to consider letting him go now.
</P>
<P>
   The complex legislation sets up a new agency that will absorb
roughly $36 billion of the debts carried by the current bailout
program, known as the Bank Fund for Savings Protection. Unlike the
fund, the new agency will be able to issue fully guaranteed bonds
for trading on international markets to raise capital. Banks will
be required to pay higher quotas to the new agency to help with
interest and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   The entire portfolio of the fund is being scrutinized by
international auditors. Loans found to be fraudulent will be
returned to the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes a program that will cost about $4
billion over five years of new assistance for mortgage holders and
other debtors who were wiped out when interest rates soared over
100 percent during the 1995 economic meltdown.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the government blundered badly at the outset of the
debate, it came out surprisingly well. Finance Minister Angel
Gurria failed to anticipate the explosive issues behind the bailout
and thought he would easily persuade Congress to transform the
billions of liabilities on the Bank Fund's books into public debt.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal in March initiated the accusations by the
opposition that the government had used the banks and the bailout
to shore up its corrupt cronies and finance the 1994 campaign of
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But the government stuck to technical arguments while the
interest costs of the bailout continued to multiply. Meanwhile
damaging rifts opened between the National Action Party and the
other main opposition party, the Party of the Democratic
Revolution, which accused the National Action Party of catering to
the government. The Party of the Democratic Revolution will vote
against the bailout reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution took out full-page ads in
major Mexican newspapers in recent days denouncing the government
and the National Action Party as ``traitors'' to Mexican
wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
   The formula that saved Ortiz has to do with the board of seven
members that will govern the new agency, to be opened in March
1999. One seat will go to the head of the central bank, but the
bill specifically bars Ortiz from occupying it, because of his role
in the original bailout. Another official, Eduardo Fernandez
Garcia, the head of the National Banking Commission, is also
barred.
</P>
<P>
   The agency can function with the two seats empty, but PAN
deputies argued that the situation would grow increasingly
uncomfortable for Ortiz and Fernandez and would eventually force
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Several government officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, agreed with that prognosis. They said that the bruising
debate had done critical damage to Ortiz's political standing,
although not to his reputation as a financial manager.

PHILIPPINES' HERO OF THE POOR NOW HELPS THE RICH
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Joseph Estrada won a smashing victory
seven months ago in the Philippine presidential election as a
champion of the poor. But today, diplomats, business people and
politicians say, Estrada is mainly benefiting the rich, the very
people he inveighed against on the hustings.
</P>
<P>
   Some people here fear that under Estrada's relaxed style of
leadership, the Philippines is drifting back into corruption and
cronyism, a hallmark of the country's deposed dictator, Ferdinand
Marcos, and an occasional weakness of his successors, Corazon
Aquino and Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in June, Estrada has helped nudge one of his
main campaign contributors into the top job at San Miguel Corp.,
the biggest company in the Philippines. He has worked to rescue
Philippine Airlines, which is controlled by another wealthy
supporter. And he paved the way for a politically connected Hong
Kong company to acquire control of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Two recipients of Estrada's aid were notorious cronies of the
late Marcos: Eduardo Cojuangco, scion of one the most powerful
Filipino families, who now runs San Miguel, and Lucio Tan, an
ethnic Chinese billionaire who controls Philippine Airlines and is
considered the richest man in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we are watching and worrying about,'' said
Guillermo Luz, executive director of the Makati Business Club,
which represents corporate interests. ``Because it's not just the
old cronies who are coming back. It is the practice of cronyism
that is coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, nobody is comparing Estrada to Marcos, who awarded
vast monopolies to trusted supporters and is suspected of looting
billions of dollars from the Philippines during his 20-year rule.
But Estrada's actions are raising eyebrows even in a country where
high-level corruption is as familiar as the gaily painted jitneys
that carom through the streets of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been rooting for him to succeed,'' said Sergio
Osmena, a member of the Philippine Senate who was jailed by Marcos.
``But sometimes you neglect moral principles in paying back
debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the fears of resurgent cronyism is the strange case of
Imelda Marcos, the widow of Marcos. After denying for more than a
decade that she and her husband plundered the country, Mrs. Marcos
unexpectedly announced on Monday that she intended to sue several
Marcos cronies to recover more than $12 billion in assets that her
husband amassed during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own practically everything,'' Mrs. Marcos said in an
interview with The Philippine Inquirer. Her admission left
officials here flummoxed, since they have spent more than a decade
fruitlessly prosecuting the Marcos family.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Estrada denied that the president was engaged in
Marcos-style cronyism. They said his critics were distorting
well-intentioned gestures by Estrada to undermine his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, crony capitalism only thrives in an
autocratic or dictatorial government,'' said Edgardo Espiritu, the
finance secretary and one of Estrada's closest advisers. ``In a
system that is democratic, everyone must compete in a field that is
supposed to be level.''
</P>
<P>
   Espiritu acknowledged that Estrada had befriended some powerful
tycoons. But he added: ``You may be a friend of the president, you
may be a friend of politicians. But if you want to survive in the
field, you have to be efficient, and you have to be ready to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's ties to wealthy businessmen contrast with his careful
cultivation of an image as friend of the common man. Even on
screen, the 61-year-old former actor often played Robin Hood
characters.
</P>
<P>
   With his generous paunch, garbled diction and Elvis
Presley-style coiffure, Estrada put off many affluent, educated
voters. But those same qualities made him a hero to poor voters,
who referred to him by his nickname Erap, which is a play on the
Tagalog word for friend, ``pare.''.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, rank-and-file voters believe Estrada is looking out
for them. The president's approval ratings are among the highest of
any Filipino leader and have not been damaged by charges of
cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dedication to the poor will be unwavering,'' Estrada said
in an interview last month at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit meeting in Malaysia. ``But I would say that although we are
pro-poor, we are not anti-rich. We are pro-business because I
believe business leads to growth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, political strategists here said Estrada's campaign was
financed by some very rich business people, notably Tan and
Cojuengco. It is difficult to determine exactly how much they
contributed because laws on disclosing campaign contributions are
riddled with loopholes. But several political experts said Tan was
the largest single donor to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that he has easy access to the president. During the
summit meeting in Malaysia, Tan hovered at the back of the room
while Estrada gave interviews to the foreign news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``He owes Lucio Tan a lot of favors,'' said Alexander Magno,
president of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, a research group
in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Tan has been struggling for months to rescue Philippine
Airlines, the nation's flagship airline, which he took over in 1994
and which is $2.1 billion in debt. Estrada has plunged into the
rescue effort, brokering an agreement between the airline and its
union, and trying to attract foreign carriers to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada insists that the government will not bail out Philippine
Airlines, but he also says he will not allow the nation's flag
carrier to fail. As a result, he is likely to grant a request from
Tan that would tighten restrictions on rivals and make it harder to
compete with Philippine Airlines. And the government is trying to
line up public and private bank loans for Tan's company.
</P>
<P>
   At San Miguel, the giant beer and beverage company, the
government's role was less direct. Cojuangco had been frustrated
that he could not take control of the company even though his
family owned 20 percent of its shares. A Philippine court had
denied him the right to vote the shares because of charges that his
family got them unlawfully during the Marcos regime.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Estrada took office in June, however, the court
finally allowed Cojuangco to vote his shares. He soon persuaded
other stockholders _ including the government, which owns 27
percent of the shares _ to support his effort to oust the chairman.
Sen. Osmena said Estrada's advisers pressed other shareholders to
accede to Cojuangco.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts contend that although the Marcos-era
cronies are making a comeback, the Philippines now has more
vigorous institutions, like the Legislature and the news media, to
blunt their influence.
</P>
<P>
   However, at a conference here on Dec. 4, the former American
ambassador to the Philippines, Nicholas Platt, warned that
Americans were reluctant to invest because of a perception that
cronyism was on the rise. Platt said investors were particularly
skeptical of the Philippine courts, which have failed to convict
either Mrs. Marcos or her husband's associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philippines is a forgiving society, an engaging trait to
many,'' Platt said. ``But international investors ask whether they
will get a fair hearing or a rapid resolution when involved in a
dispute here.''

INNER-CITY KID FINDS OUTDOORS UP HIS ALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been some wild ride the kid's been on the
past few months _ going from the asphalt streets of his
neighborhood to the dirt horseback trails of Mammoth Lakes, then
back again to get ready to ride down Colorado Boulevard on
horseback in the 1999 Tournament of Roses parade.
</P>
<P>
   A heck of a ride for a 12-year-old city kid who until last June
thought the great outdoors was shooting hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Camping? Horseback riding? Backpacking in the wilderness? Forget
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Bellamy was no urban cowboy. Anything outside his
well-traveled route from home to school to the rec center and YMCA
every day was wilderness to him.
</P>
<P>
   Then one weekend this summer, he and about 40 other neighborhood
kids spent the weekend camping out overnight at the Sepulveda Rec
Center. The next thing you know, Felix Bellamy is getting ready to
climb up on a horse New Year's Day and go riding down Colorado
Boulevard in a parade that was seen on TV last year by an estimated
425 million people in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's great outdoors just expanded a little.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids just stick out, Mike Hogan says. This kid sticks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix really got into all the stuff we were trying to teach
our neighborhood kids about camping and the outdoor life that
weekend in June,'' said Hogan, director of the Sepulveda Recreation
Center. ``You could just see the excitement in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the WOW _ Wonderful Outdoor World _ program
for the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, saw the
same excitement in the kid's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the look they were searching for to make the world a little
more far-reaching and interesting for city kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope to reach some of them, show them there's something
beyond video games and hanging out on the streets,'' says Mary
Braunwarth of the Recreation and Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how Felix and the other seven kids were chosen for the
equestrian unit in the parade,'' she said. ``They were the most
wide-eyed going through the program.''
</P>
<P>
   From that June overnight camp-out at the neighborhood rec
center, Felix was invited to attend a weeklong camp up at Mammoth
Lakes in late August, where he backpacked in the wilderness with
kids from other rec centers.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who had the same look in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Felix jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode mules and horses, and learned all sorts of great stuff
that was fun, once I got the hang of it, and wasn't so sore
anymore,'' he said Friday. He was preparing for another practice
session, riding horseback on cement streets to duplicate the
conditions of Colorado Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about how better it is out in the wilderness with
all the trees, and how different it is in the city with all the
things going on on the streets,'' Felix said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends think I'm lucky, and so do I. This is exciting,
getting to be in the Rose Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for the kid if you watch the parade on TV or
attend it in person. Felix will be one of eight riders following a
mule train.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department's entry
this year, playing on the theme of eight city kids getting the
chance to take a wilderness trip to a national park.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that more inner-city kids will take advantage of
great programs like WOW so they'll have their outdoors expanded,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Riding with Felix will be David Tamayo and Devin Mills from the
Valley Plaza rec center; Melvon Broussard, Jarone Sanford, Shanta
Shield and Reniya Ware from the St. Andrews rec center; and Marisa
Milani from the Sunland rec center.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's become an official urban cowboy, I asked Felix
whether he wanted to be a full-fledged cowboy when he grew up?
Maybe move to Wyoming?
</P>
<P>
   The kid shook his head no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an environmental lawyer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids just stick out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A touch of dignity and a heavy dose of uncertainty
surround the capital on Saturday, as what seems to be the only city
in the United States that takes impeachment seriously looks toward
a House vote on articles calling for President Clinton to be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   While few are predicting the result with much confidence, there
is one area of agreement _ that the outcome depends on a dozen, or
20, maybe even 30, undecided members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where broad generalizations break down _ as they
have throughout this 11-month agony. The best example came Friday,
when Clinton's latest apology speech was dismissed as a failure,
because he did not say ``I committed perjury'' or ``I lied'' or
even ``I did not tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said they might have been won over by such a
confession, and were disappointed. But that hardly proves that
other lines in the speech, the greater level of expressed sorrow
and even the apology for putting the nation through this mess, did
not matter, either by persuading some other member or by keeping
someone on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   For this process is now in a singular stage, where hundreds of
White House officials and reporters and politicians deal with a
speech heard by several million people, and no more than 30 of the
potential listeners matter.
</P>
<P>
   They are individuals, and even friends who know them well do not
know just what will move them when they have to vote this week. For
some it might be an admission; others may still be wrestling over
the strength of the evidence, or whether the offenses alleged
actually rise to a level demanding impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious example is Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, who said after the
speech that he was disappointed Clinton did not say, ``I didn't
tell the truth under oath.'' But, Ney said, ``It didn't alter me in
any direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ney really seems to be worrying about how he ought to vote, a
position that leaves him vulnerable to a clamor from the right,
which generally approves his conservative voting record. To him
this is a solemn occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The committee seemed to be grappling with solemnity on Saturday,
too, after days of debate in which opposing arguments were
ridiculed as ``smokescreen'' or ``shell game.'' On Saturday
morning, Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's Democratic senator-elect,
said an abuse-of-power count was so broad that its terms could
apply to George Washington, and every president since him.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble of North Carolina, sometimes a fierce
attacker, insisted, ``I'll have knots in my guts next week when I
cast my vote,'' and added, ``I don't take this lightly at all.'' He
said the last time he felt an issue so heavily was nearly eight
years ago when he voted to send U.S. troops into combat in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But while the committee's often petty and almost always partisan
and personalized consideration of the question may be weighed in
history _ no Barbara Jordans were heard last week _ it probably has
no impact whatever on what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   By now most members of the House have made up their minds on
charges, either on the evidence or on their sense of political
survival. In the insular world of the House of Representatives, few
members really have to fear the other party. Among the Republicans
re-elected last month, for example, only 10 won with 52 percent or
less of the vote. Among the Democrats, only five did.
</P>
<P>
   But there are real risks in going against your own party. One is
the din of complaint from old supporters. Another is a possible
primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
   So the focus comes back to those 30 or fewer truly undecided
members _ most, but not quite all of them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders seem sure that defections will be few
enough so they will win the impeachment vote. They are plainly
trying to build momentum with a series of announcements from
members who say they were previously undecided. Some were; some
were just unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   They count on pressure from the Republican base, and sometimes
use the argument that the vote is really inconsequential because
the Senate will ultimately acquit the president.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House and the Democrats, the issues are more
complex. Their target is 11 more Republican defectors than
Democrats who desert the president (or 10 if no one finds the
convicted congressman, Rep. Jay Kim of California, and gets him
back to vote).
</P>
<P>
   This White House has always had dismal relations with House
Republicans and knows few of them well. It is hard to find a way to
approach them directly.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some careful hopes among those involved in
preserving Clinton's presidency from impeachment and trial.
</P>
<P>
   One belief is that most of the people who say they are undecided
really are.
</P>
<P>
   The second, more dubious hope is that Speaker-designate Robert
Livingston of Louisiana will have to confront a group of
fence-sitters demanding a chance to vote for censure, and arguing
that without one they _ and with them the Republican majority _ are
at risk in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the White House and its allies to shout about the
unfairness of denying the House a censure vote, starting on
Sunday's television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their hopes are even more uncertain. They think the
public will be alerted by the committee votes, angrily discovering
that the impeachment that pundits so easily dismissed after the
elections is real after all.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that such a suddenly intense unhappiness
will be communicated to members. Once again, just as with the issue
of how Clinton described his dubious statements about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky on Friday, this is not something that can be
measured on a national scale. If three old friends come up to one
wavering Republican after church on Sunday and are furious about
impeachment, that could decide one vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's expectations about the country's mood have
proved wrong all year long _ and the polls that show the public
does not want Clinton thrown out do not reflect much intensity.
Except among African-Americans, it is hard to locate pockets of
dedication to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument to be used _ and perhaps by the president if he
is heard from again before the House vote _ is that the country and
the Congress should not be distracted from real business by the
debilitating experience of a Senate trial, with the undertone that
the exercise is pointless since everyone knows how it will come
out.
</P>

   Abbe Lowell, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic counsel,
raised that idea on Thursday when he said impeachment would ``doom
the country to additional months of this ordeal and government
paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that a trial would last months, although no
one ever got rich betting on the Senate to do things quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But it might take it a while to get started, because several
serious procedural questions have not really been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
rattled off a list of those questions on Saturday morning, like a
rules change to explicitly allow the Senate to conduct other
business along with a trial, questions over whether there would be
limits on evidence and numbers of witnesses or the time of
cross-examination, and whether a select committee could be given
some of the Senate's tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
explained last week that he and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
Republican leader, ``are not preparing anything, but that's because
we're not trying to decide what the House would do.'' He said
action, even open discussion ``would be premature and it assumes
things that we don't want to assume'' _ meaning a vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he and Lott would ``talk quickly about what we
would have to do'' if there was a vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch offered a solution, too, to the problem of a drawn-out
trial when 45 Democratic senators could almost certainly deny the
Republicans the two-thirds majority required for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although for months the House Republicans' biggest problem has
been finding a way to put the impeachment genie back in the bottle,
Hatch said the rules make it clear ``that the Senate could at any
time say `We have heard enough''' and end the trial without a
verdict. That, of course, takes one back to the historic difficulty
the Senate has in doing things quickly.

for Sunday, Dec. 13, moved Saturday in the `a' category (unless

<P>
   This final budget eliminates SPEED-LIMITS-REVIEW and adds
AIR-GRIDLOCK-REVIEW, IMPEACH-JACKSON-REVIEW,
ATLANTA-DRIVETHRU-REVIEW and SPAIN-LATIN-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Nothing about an impeachment trial
would be logical, by ordinary legal standards. It would be part law
and part politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by
ancient Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. An
in-depth look at what to expect in such a trial. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-JACKSON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The president's refrain today
is: Don't impeach me; censure me. But back in 1834, the argument
was the other way around: Don't censure me; impeach me. A look at
Andrew Jackson's argument against presidential censure.
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's children are being buried
in an avalanche of toys. It's partly a function of demographics:
There are fewer children and more adults to dote on them. Fueling
the trend are TV's ceaseless shilling of merchandise, guilt on the
part of working, often absentee parents, clevermarketing of toys as
learning tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid
transfixed by a toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent.
Now some professionals fear children are being simultaneously
overstimulated and desensitized by a deluge of misguided love. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   BOYS-WOES-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's getting harder and harder to
be a boy. No one's calling for affirmative action for boys just
yet. But given the fact that girls are becoming an ever-larger
majority at most American colleges, many educators are beginning to
think that boys should get more attention. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA-DRIVETHRU-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ A look at a proposed
ordinance to ban the construction of new drive-through windows in
Atlanta, the national leader in `autodependency.' Under thes bill,
the city would effectively declare an end to more convenient but
bloodless car-bound transactions at banks, fast-food eateries, dry
cleaners, pharmacies, liquor stores and cappucino cafes. By Kevin
Sack.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT-COUNSELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Complaints about the
independent counsel law are coming at a critical time: The statute
is due to expire next year, and Democrats and Republicans are
lining to up declare that, after two decades, the law intended to
keep politics out of corruption cases should be allowed to die. By
David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   ORGAN-DONORS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Organs: The ultimate gifts.
Studies show that donors fare quite well with a single kidney, and
that their life spans are not shortened. But when a relative needs
an organ, the potential for subtle and not-so-subtle coercion on a
donor in the immediate family is so great that some doctors feel
compelled to offer that member an out, sometimes giving the
impression that the potential donor is not a good match. By David
Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-LATIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Spain served as a model for its
former Latin American colonies in its transition from dictatorship
to democracy by starting off on a clean slate without
recriminations for the past. Now though, in attempting to put
Chile's ex-dictator Pinochet on trial, Spain is trying to do to
Chile what it did not do to itself. By Alan Riding. (moved in `i'
category).
</P>
<P>
   MAFIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today's bookshelves are crowded with
self-help books from celebrated tycoons. If one had been written by
the infamous Mafia boss Charles `Lucky' Luciano (who was recently
honored as one of Time magazine's most influential business
geniuses of the century), here are some of the lessons it might
contain. By Joe Sharkey.

   Arms Inspections Yield Mixed Results in Iraq
</P>
<P>
   After a week of surprise inspections in Iraq, United Nations
arms inspectors will most likely give the Iraqis a mixed report
card this week when no-notice searches end and the Security Council
begins to decide whether Saddam Hussein has cooperated sufficiently
to qualify for a broad review of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has said it will wait for the report from Richard
Butler, the head of the inspection commission, before making any
decisions about military action if the Iraqis are found to be in
serious breach of agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has not complied fully. It barred inspectors from the
ruling party offices and refused to disclose the location of some
biological material that was moved during a break in inspections
last month and was suspected of being part of an illegal arms
program.

   Charges in Army Sex Case

   A former two-star general who served briefly as the Army's

stemming from ``improper relationships'' he had with the wives of
four subordinate officers.

   The case, which also included charges that he lied to cover up

even though one of the women had already filed a complaint against
him.

   Clinton met with 48 members of Congress from both parties to

   An All-Star Game is a midseason breather, an extravaganza that

<P>
   The researchers began by gathering cow cells from a

lined its fallopian tubes, they created embryos that they put in
surrogate mothers.

   Joseph Stanley Faulder was 30 minutes from a lethal injection in

Canadian counsel after his arrest in 1977 on charges of murdering
an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   International convention requires that people arrested in a
foreign country be given that right; Texas officials said they did
not realize that Faulder, who had a Texas driver's license, was
from Canada.

   Human rights groups expressed concern that failure to observe

</P>
<P>
   Japanese scientists say they have cloned a cow with a success
rate at least as good as obtained with test-tube fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers began by gathering cow cells from a
slaughterhouse, picking up tissue from a cow that had just been
killed. Using cells that clung to the cow's eggs and cells that
lined its fallopian tubes, they created embryos that they put in
surrogate mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers gave birth to eight calves that were genetic
replicas of the dead cow. Four calves died at or shortly after
birth. The remaining identical quadruplets, the scientists say, are
alive and well.

   Canadian's Execution Halted
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder was 30 minutes from a lethal injection in
the Texas death chamber when the U.S. Supreme Court delayed his
execution. Faulder is a Canadian and his government had appealed
for his life because he was not allowed to seek assistance from the
Canadian counsel after his arrest in 1977 on charges of murdering
an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   International convention requires that people arrested in a
foreign country be given that right; Texas officials said they did
not realize that Faulder, who had a Texas driver's license, was
from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups expressed concern that failure to observe
the treaty might lead to abuse against Americans arrested abroad.

   Police Searches Curbed
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court weighs the competing interests of the
police and ordinary citizens these days, the police usually come
out ahead. So a decision that a speeding ticket does not
automatically allow the police to search a car was notable.
</P>
<P>
   The justices overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court in Iowa,
where a law authorized police to conduct a full-blown search
whenever they issue a traffic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The 1983 law was the only one of its kind in the country, but
had the court upheld it, the idea would undoubtedly have spread.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist said there was no justification for
the search; once a driver is stopped for speeding, he said, all the
necessary evidence of the offense has been obtained.

   Harmonizing by Cell Phone
</P>
<P>
   There's a subtle change in the air at pop and rock concerts
these days. Since the 1960s, matches and lighters have been a
concert staple, held aloft by thousands of audience members during
sentimental ballads or while waiting for encores. But with smoking
no longer allowed at many arenas and concert halls, some of which
even confiscate lighters and cigarettes at the door, pop concerts
have been growing dark.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a new kind of luminosity has been emerging: the green
glows and flashing red lights of cellular phones. At concerts
around the world, especially in cell phone-friendly cities from Los
Angeles to Hong Kong, audience members can be spotted holding the
gadgets in the air like surrogate lighters.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not trying to make a connection with other members
of the audience, as their brethren were doing with their flames in
the late '60s and '70s. Instead, they are making a connection with
someone else _ sometimes a friend stuck at home who wants to hear
the music, sometimes even with their own answering machine at home.
And sometimes they're just bored and trying to catch up on work or
kill time.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some in the concert business are wondering whether
the cell phone will become as intrinsic to pop concerts as spilled
beer, loud volumes and souvenir T-shirts in the years to come.

   Put 'Em Up, You Man of Letters

<P>
   What is art?
</P>
<P>
   No, no, that's far too grand a question. Try this one: If
literature is caught entertaining, should it be tossed
unceremoniously out of the clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   Or this: Can a man who wears cream-colored suits write real
literature?
</P>
<P>
   The topic, of course: Tom Wolfe's new best-seller ``A Man in
Full,'' which has prompted a testy debate lately among the literary
elite.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike, in The New Yorker, wrote that in spite of its
``grand ambition,'' the novel ``still amounts to entertainment, not
literature.'' And Norman Mailer, in The New York Review of Books,
pronounces that ``it begins to promise that he is ready to become a
great American novelist,'' but that ``at the highest level, it's a
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that they were putting him down as a mere journalist,
Wolfe countered, ``You have to come up with things that unaided
imagination doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And he asked, in cream-colored puzzlement, why ``those old
bones'' would try to shoot down his book.
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed? Updike's own books have clearly proved highly
entertaining to many readers, but that surely doesn't disqualify
them as literature. (Entertain, the dictionary says, means ``to
hold together.'' An entertainer is ``one who shows hospitality.''
But that doesn't mean literature is supposed to fall apart and show
you the door.)
</P>
<P>
   And if Mailer, as a member of the literary elite, is entitled to
judge what reaches ``the highest level,'' a question still arises:
How does one join the literary elite?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe C.P. Snow had the answer when he said that Cambridge dons
are not distinguished men, but merely men who confer distinctions
on each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton donned his peacemaker's cloak and
flew to the Middle East Saturday as his aides grappled with the
ever-more-imminent prospect that he will face trial next year in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left behind a capital in wintry disarray, gripped by a
pervasive sense of sadness, of once-shining hopes thwarted, with
more grievous divisions than ever between the two parties and
legislative business stalled.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Judiciary Committee debated a fourth article of
impeachment to stand alongside the three that it voted on Friday,
House leaders began preparations for a vote on them by all 435
members next week, probably on Thursday. Chances for a House vote
on a resolution of censure, the alternative preferred by Democrats,
appeared dim. One White House official said, ``Impeachment by the
full House is starting to look inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of Saturday's session, Republicans on the
committee sought to narrow substantially the reach of the fourth
article. It had originally dealt with allegedly widespread abuses
of power, but Republicans argued for the removal of most of those,
leaving only one major charge, that Clinton had falsely or
incompletely answered many of the 81 questions that the committee
submitted to him earlier in its proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article as originally constituted had been considered
the weakest of the four, with the poorest chance of winning
approval in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen members of Congress, some of whom have not yet
decided how to vote on impeachment, accompanied Clinton as he left
Andrews Air Force Base aboard Air Force One in the pre-dawn
darkness. It therefore seemed probable, if rather bizarre, that the
president, always formidable in one-on-one situations, would seize
the opportunity do some lobbying on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will be able to inject any adrenaline into the
flagging Middle East peace process is another question. He is to
meet with both Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the very best of times, the Middle East has proved a
minefield for U.S. presidents. In this, the worst of times for his
presidency, Clinton is taking his own minefield with him, and it is
not clear how much influence he retains there, if any, given his
situation at home.
</P>
<P>
   The president is due back in Washington before Thursday's vote
in the House. Only Andrew Johnson among Clinton's predecessors has
ever faced such a humiliating and perilous roll-call, and he may
try once again to make a statement that would swing enough moderate
Republicans to his side to avoid impeachment. But his closest
advisers said they did not know what more he could say, beyond
another expression of his regret and contrition.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried that on Friday afternoon, to no avail.
Republicans looking for an admission from Clinton that he had lied
were disappointed; most agreed with Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio that
``the president did not say nearly enough.'' The advisers said
there was no chance he would ever do so, if what the moderates were
insisting upon was an acknowledgment of a crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Impeached by the House, Johnson escaped conviction by the Senate
by a single vote, but he was enfeebled by the process. If
impeached, Clinton is expected to survive in the Senate by a wider
margin, given the close partisan division and the requirement for a
two-thirds vote to convict. But the widespread fear in Washington
is that he, too, would be crippled, with almost two years left to
serve on the second term he won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   True to his long-standing promise to try to wrap things up by
Christmas, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, gaveled the panel to order shortly before 10 o'clock
Saturday morning _ an unusual hour for a Capitol Hill committee
meeting, especially on a Saturday. With the 10-week inquiry nearing
its end, and three articles already approved, Saturday's session
had a bit of the air of afterthought, however momentous its
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hyde and Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the incoming
speaker, were said by staff members to be opposed to allowing a
censure resolution to reach the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Their strategic calculation was this: if members reluctant to
vote for impeachment but determined not to let the president escape
without punishment were given the chance to vote for censure, they
would not cast their votes for the more severe measure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to push for censure on Saturday, and they
resumed the attack on the majority Republicans at the start of the
session despite the Republican move to narrow the scope of the
proposed article by excluding abuse of executive privilege and
false statements to White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who will have a chance to vote in
the Senate trial as a new member of that body next year, said one
part of the original fourth article was ``the greatest reach of
all, the most absurd thing'' in any of the allegations that had
been lodged by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That was the charge that by lying to the American people in
speeches on television Clinton had committed an impeachable
offense. If he had, Schumer said, every president since George
Washington had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts restated the Democrats' case
that Republicans were starting a process ``designed to kick the
president out'' in the full knowledge that the Senate would never
do so. That course of action, he said, demeaned the constitutional
process as well as the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde rebutted him, quoting the late Rep. Barbara Jordan of
Texas, who in the committee's proceedings against Richard Nixon
almost 25 years ago said that ``the House accuses, the Senate
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's job, Hyde insisted, was simply to decide ``whether
there was enough evidence to warrant a Senate trial,'' not fully to
weigh the evidence itself.

   TARRYTOWN, N.Y. _ From his perch greeting customers at the Main
Street Cafe in the heart of the quaint downtown here, Paul Janos
found the House Judiciary Committee's party-line votes to impeach
President Clinton surprisingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Janos, a candidate for mayor of this Hudson River village of
11,000 people 25 miles north of New York City, has himself stood
square in the middle of squabbles between his fellow Republicans
and Democrats, not over a sex scandal, but over the more mundane
questions of how to develop the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see what happens with partisan politics in a small village
like this,'' said Janos, 43, who grew up here and opened his
bustling restaurant six years ago. ``I can't even imagine what it's
like in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that a lot of people are tired of it, myself included,
but what's right is right, what's wrong is wrong,'' Janos said of
Clinton. ``I don't think he should be exempt. I'm afraid of what
the market reaction would be, though. I wonder, in the scope of
things, is it worth the turmoil?''
</P>
<P>
   As the Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment, the
seriousness of the situation began to sink in around this historic
village, where red plastic bags reading ``Season's Greetings''
covered the parking meters downtown, encouraging shopping by
eliminating the cost of parking.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, like Janos, complained that the Monica Lewinsky
scandal had dragged on too long and the investigation had cost too
much, comparing the endless publicity to that of the O.J. Simpson
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But people in this media-saturated region have refocused on the
matter in recent days, and a number said it is time for Clinton to
go, even as they worried that impeachment might be the wrong way to
achieve this or would threaten the nation's high-flying economy and
strong position in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With its landmarks and legends, from the Rockefeller mansion to
Sleepy Hollow, Tarrytown is a quiet place with views of the Hudson
and the Tappan Zee Bridge. Commuters pour off Metro-North trains at
the 108-year-old Victorian train station, some heading to the
million-dollar estates on the hill, others to row houses and
condominiums they bought for $200,000 to be near good schools.
</P>
<P>
   Children kick a soccer ball down Main Street, as civic groups
meet at the Masonic Hall. It is a place of thoughtful suburban
parents struggling with what to do about Clinton, who earned 55
percent of the village's vote in 1996, and carried it with 52
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fluctuating all day long,'' said Claudia Smith, a
trademark lawyer, as she waited at the YMCA for her son, Evan
Davies, 5, to finish swimming lessons. ``I'm torn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I read about it, the more I change my mind about how
serious this matter is,'' added Ms. Smith, who said she was tempted
to stay in the car on Friday afternoon to listen to the Judiciary
Committee debate on the radio. ``It's not just jokes about the
dress anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the snickering has stopped and the bickering has begun.
At the hardware store, a man with a couple of divorces under his
belt said the president should be ousted, while his friend said the
scandal was just about sex, nothing significant.
</P>
<P>
   At the Y, a Democratic mom was denouncing the tactics of the
Republican congressional majority as absurd, when a Republican mom
butted in to echo the call for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Main Street Cafe, a group of retired school employees
from York, Pa., who stopped for lunch at the end of a five-day bus
tour were remembering the impeachment vote against President Nixon
a quarter-century ago and differing over whether men can be
expected to say no when tempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a government crime,'' said John Markish, 71, who
said he had been propositioned practically every Saturday night
while playing bass in a dance band as a young man. ``The same way
your father might do it, or your neighbor might do _ except there's
no Senate investigation of your neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Dice, 73, a former school secretary, said, ``It's a crime
against his family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And society,'' added Dee Verostic, an accounting teacher, who
said she retired after hearing one too many stories about students
having sex in the stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Verostic suggested that Clinton be shunned, like the
practice in Amish country, with his face banned from every
newspaper, and perhaps be forced to wear a sweatshirt with a big
letter on it, as in ``The Scarlet Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans, Miss Verostic and her friends voted for
Clinton and had hoped that with his ideas for education and the
elderly, he would be the best president they had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure it out,'' she said, ``why good sense doesn't go
with intelligence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All around the village, people were shaking their heads at the
same question, calling Clinton a jerk and worse, saying they could
not trust him and wished he and the whole scandal would go away.
They said they would have readily forgiven the president had he
stood up and admitted wrongdoing in January when the scandal
surfaced, but they were none too anxious for another apology now.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman representing the region is Benjamin Gilman, who
has not disclosed his position on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have been shutting out the issue. Darron Copeland, a
tax accountant from Stamford, Conn., who plunked down $500 at
Tarrytown Art and Antiques Co. for a rust-colored egg chair from
the 1960s, said he would rather watch the History Channel than 30
seconds of political commentary these days.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Ferguson, president of the local Chamber of Commerce,
said people had clapped when she changed the channel from the
hearing in the waiting room of the hospital where she had been to
visit her father.
</P>
<P>
   But others were following the committee's hearing closely. Janos
said he had been persuaded that Clinton should be punished, when
the Republicans called witnesses who had been imprisoned for
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Royston, who was shopping for a surprise for his wife at
Whimsies Incognito, mentioned David Schippers, the Republicans'
chief lawyer, by name.
</P>
<P>
   Though he found Schippers' argument for impeachment convincing,
Royston said he favored censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a slap on the wrist, he said. ``It's going to be
with him for history. Long after he's dead, they'll say, `That's
the guy who was punished for this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Goldberg, the fourth-generation owner of Goldberg's
Hardware, which opened in 1904, worries more about business than
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take him out of office, it could hurt me right here,''
Goldberg, 31, said, patting the pockets of his jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him get a divorce from his wife,'' Goldberg said,
suggesting, like several others, that Clinton face the consequences
of his actions in court, as a private citizen, after his term ends.
``Don't take him out of executive office and disrupt the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But others think it is too late, with the country already
woefully disrupted, not to mention embarrassed. The retired school
employees suggested comparing a list of legislation passed by this
Congress and the hours politicians have spent in front of
television cameras talking about the president.
</P>
<P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Leaning forward on a lectern, a brilliant
smile on his mustachioed face, Husam Khader chose to make a pointed
political joke during a recent meeting of the Palestinian
Legislative Council. Khader, a legislator from Nablus, exasperated
by the council's impotence, proposed a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we declare Yasser Arafat the god of Palestine?'' he
suggested, referring to the president of the Palestinian National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The moment spoke volumes about how far Palestinian society has
come in the last five years and how far it has to go. On the one
hand, Khader was speaking from the floor of the democratically
elected Legislature, engaging in debate that allows for barbed
humor aimed at the Palestinian leader. On the other, his words
conveyed a central frustration for those involved in the building
of the Palestinian state: Arafat's viselike grip on the reins of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a serious, deep yearning for democracy,'' said
Eyad Sarraj, who runs the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, a
nongovernmental organization. ``The problem is that Arafat is
untouchable. He is a holy symbol, while right now we could use a
mere mortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an interesting thing has happened on the way to
statehood, a journey that for many Palestinians crosses a major
threshold with the visit of President Clinton to Gaza on Monday. As
the Israelis have come to realize with great alarm, the
Palestinians view Clinton's visit, starting with the flight into
the new Yasser Arafat International Airport, as a diplomatic
endorsement of their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Arafat's best efforts to suppress them, the fledgling
institutions of democracy, some mandated by international
agreements, have taken on a life of their own. And this has
significantly altered the mind-set of a clan-based society that
lived under occupation for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   After 1993, when the interim peace accord was reached in Oslo,
many symbols of sovereignty emerged: Palestinian flags, Palestinian
license plates, Palestinian passports (accepted by 80 countries),
Palestinian Coca-Cola and, two weeks ago, the new airport in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos that had reigned, particularly during the seven years
of Palestinian uprising, began to recede. Schools and hospitals
were refreshed, restocked and operated continuously. Traffic
policemen appeared at busy intersections, roads were paved and
telephone lines run into villages. A night life sprang up in
Ramallah, and in Nablus, a fledgling Palestinian stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, perhaps, were the new democratic
institutions: the Palestinian Legislative Council and the
Palestinian Supreme Court, both stipulated by the Oslo accords, and
a burgeoning, quickly ubiquitous press corps, together with a host
of dissident weeklies.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact of these institutions created an appetite for
authenticity on the part of some of the legislators, justices and
journalists who participated in them. There were sharp divisions
between those who had grown up under Israeli occupation, observing
the model of Israeli democracy, and those who had only recently
returned from exile in the more autocratic Arab nations. But those
who craved authentic institutions wanted what amounted to too much
too soon, or sooner than Arafat was prepared to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready for democracy,'' said Rawiya Shawwa, a
legislator from Gaza and an outspoken columnist for the newspaper
Al Quds. ``Our struggle for independence was built on coalitions.
We made decisions by voting. And we had this neighbor, our
occupier, with a democratic lifestyle. We experienced their
demonstrations, and their media, and their freedom of saying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appetite for authenticity went largely unfulfilled. The
legislators passed many laws that were not implemented; the judges
issued many court orders that were ignored; the journalists either
censored themselves, faced rebuke and arrest, or found their
newspapers closed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Arafat gave much power to the half-dozen
security organizations he created like a small army around himself.
</P>
<P>
   After Khader proposed his bill to deify Arafat, several
legislators and journalists laughed aloud, and some stared ahead
with widened eyes. One representative jumped him, demanding an
apology, and Khader sardonically congratulated his beefy attacker,
saying that Arafat would witness his loyalty while reviewing the
videotapes of the meeting. The entire incident was expunged from
the minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to trick myself into thinking that we have
institutions, laws and rules,'' Khader said. ``It's tempting. We go
through the motions. We argue, we bargain. We have procedures and
votes and lobbyists of a kind. Yes, the council dances beautifully.
But in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Palestinians, with a relatively sizable intellectual
elite, international help and the model of Israel, have moved more
quickly and closer toward developing democratic institutions than
any of their Arab neighbors, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting to see,'' said Joseph Alpher, director of
the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``What they have done in
the last five years is more democratic than any Arab society. It's
a limited democracy, or guided democracy, under the very firm hand
of Arafat. But it has potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Fayez Noureldin, a Gaza-based photographer for Agence
France-Presse, hit one of the first bumps on the road to the
limited democracy. During a heat wave two years ago, he took a
picture of children trying to drag their donkey into the ocean for
a bath. The photograph ran in publications around the world.
Palestinian officials were furious. They thought he was trying to
make the Palestinians look asinine, literally. He was arrested and
roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   But a nascent union of local journalists ran to his defense.
High-ranking Palestinian officials released him, apologized and
punished the arresting officers. And such ham-handed clampdowns
became less frequent, giving way to a more subtle dance between the
journalists and the authority. They have developed a relationship
based on the understanding that there are limits to the freedom of
expression, but that these limits are constantly shifting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the Oslo peace agreement, the news media blossomed in
numbers, with two new daily newspapers, a handful of new weeklies,
three new radio stations and 15 new television stations. The very
act of covering events beside their Israeli and foreign colleagues
proved an education, making the Palestinian journalists _ already
experts at linguistic subterfuge from years of dealing with Israeli
military censors _ yearn to operate freely.
</P>
<P>
   But the three dailies are tightly controlled, and tend to be
timid since they can face censure for such things as burying a
small article that reflects well on Arafat. The leading paper is
the veteran publication, Al Quds, which is privately owned but
closely allied with the Palestinian leadership. And of the two new
dailies, one is financed by the Palestinian Authority, and the
other run by an adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it can be surprising to see what is tolerated, especially
in small weeklies or monthlies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a rights group put a paid insert into newspapers about
torture in Palestinian prisons, complete with gory photographs _
and a government advertising permit.
</P>
<P>
   A monthly magazine, People's Rights, subtitled, ``Building the
rule of law in Palestine,'' routinely runs harsh articles about
corruption and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Gaza was being scrubbed for Clinton's visit, which
the Palestinian Authority officially considers extremely important,
editors at the major newspapers were snipping criticism from their
columns. Yet the paper of the Islamic Holy War movement, Al
Istiqlal, printed these words of welcome: ``American President Bill
Clinton, who is known as Monica's secret lover, is about to visit
our noble and beloved Gaza. With his vulgar presence, he will
desecrate its pure soil that has been saturated for more than 50
years with the blood of our holy martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   When the mandated elections were held for president and
Legislative Council in 1996, some 86 percent of Palestinian adults
turned out to vote. More than half of the 88 council members came
from Arafat's Fatah party, and one of his right-hand men, Ahmed
Querei, or Abu Ala, became speaker of the House. Still, there
remained about 29 independent legislators, including some members
of Hamas, the Muslim fundamentalist organization. And some Fatah
members behaved more independently than their leader liked.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the legislators took their mission quite seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In two years they passed about 20 laws, often stopping to
research a point of procedure, to inquire how the Israeli
Parliament would handle it. It took them almost two years to draft
a constitution, gingerly constructing clauses about the protection
of civil liberties and human rights. One passage, about the terms
of succession for a president who lost the confidence of the
council or became incapacitated, was stricken because the
legislators were timid.
</P>
<P>
   But only 12 bills were signed by Arafat; the constitution still
sits on his desk. A law ordering municipal elections was ignored,
as was the one to hold elections for a new Legislature at the
expiration of its term next May. Few laws have been carried out,
but one that will be stands out: a bill to raise the salary of
civil servants. Because so many Palestinians are employed by the
authority, it is considered an important step toward raising the
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the very nature of their enterprise, the legislators
accomplished the critical task of altering the terms of public
debate. Some grew more outspoken, especially on the issue of
corruption within the Palestinian Authority. They felt themselves
powerless when their demands to weed out corrupt officials were
ignored, but if Arafat did not listen, the Palestinian people did,
through the media coverage of the Legislature. Some felt both
informed and emboldened by the public discussion, but others
criticized the council for caving in, for acting as a rubber stamp
for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they're just there for decoration,'' said Sarraj
of the Gaza mental health program. ``There's no separation of
powers between the executive, the legislative and the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Legislature, the Palestinian high court tried to shut
out the pressure from Arafat and develop a rule of law. But it was
impossible. If a judge went too far _ as in the case of Amin Abdel
Salam, the former chief justice of the West Bank, who demanded the
release of some students in detention _ he was dismissed. Others
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   One Palestinian rights group, which used to monitor Israeli
violations, counts 27 ignored court orders. The total issued is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our leaders ignore court orders, then our people will,
too,'' said Samir Muhsen, a lawyer and journalist, ``and before we
know it, they'll start taking the law into their own hands. Is that
the way we want to inaugurate our Palestinian civil society, with
chaos?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ignored court orders demand the release of Hamas
members who are being detained indefinitely without charges. And
that is where the Israeli interest in having Arafat clamp down on
terrorism comes into play, countering any encouragement Israel
might have offered toward developing democratic institutions in
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians, even those pushing at the edge of the
permissible, accept that it is only after Arafat leaves what
appears to be his lifetime office that things will change. And, in
a surprising comment in Ramallah last week, Arafat made that time
seem not so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll live one year or two years,'' he said at
a meeting with the Washington-based Institute of Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   That makes many Palestinians, and some international experts,
worry about the fledgling character of the democratic institutions
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can they handle a transition of power in what are likely to be
horrendous circumstances?'' said Alpher of the Jewish committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shawwa, the Gaza legislator, wonders if Palestinian society
needs more time to prepare even for statehood, let alone a change
of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is maybe we are not ready for a state,'' she said.
``Maybe we should wait until we have genuine institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The freedom with which she speaks can be confusing to those who
equate such public conversation with a more mature democracy. But
to many it only indicates that Palestinian society is not the
monolithic entity usually portrayed to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the world is concerned, only they _ the Israelis _
have public opinion,'' Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian and
council member, said.

   WASHINGTON _ Picture this for high drama:
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators are in their seats. In the well of the Senate
is a defense table. President Clinton may or may not be at the
table, but his lawyers are, on the edge of their chairs. Facing
them, at a prosecution table, are Rep. Henry Hyde and a few of his
Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   High on the dais, Chief Justice William Rehnquist leans forward
in the presiding officer's chair and reads solemnly into the
microphone from a slip of paper handed up to him by the Senate
parliamentarian: ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent,
William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty? The clerk will
call the roll.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, as their names are called alphabetically, the
senators rise behind their desks and utter the first words they
have spoken about the matter in public session since the
impeachment trial began. No speeches. No explanation. Just
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the way the trial will end _ probably sometime next
summer _ if a majority of the members of the House of
Representatives vote this week to impeach the president on the
accusations recommended by the House Judiciary Committee, and if
the Senate goes forward with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in and around Congress think it will never get that
far _ that somehow, though no one can say just how, the Senate will
avert a drawn-out legal process that could tie up the country for
months. That might seem logical, since no one imagines that the
Senate will come close to obtaining the two-thirds majority needed
to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ not just Republican opponents of the president but
also steadfast guardians of the Senate's prerogatives like Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., _ believe that the Senate would be obligated to
try the president if the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing about an impeachment trial would be logical, by
ordinary legal standards. This trial would be part law and part
politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by ancient
Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. In the history of
the nation, there have been only 13 such trials (one of a
president), and only 7 convictions (all of federal judges). The
only trial of a president, in which Andrew Johnson was acquitted by
one vote, was 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all of academia, in all the library stacks, in all the
cubicles and carrels of the Capitol, there is no reference book
that spells out what the impeachment trial of a president would
look like in 1999, and there is no person who considers himself or
herself an absolute authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to know about a Senate trial of a
president is how much we do not know,'' said Walter Dellinger, a
constitutional scholar and former acting solicitor general. ``We
don't know whether it can be confined in a rational way or whether
it will get out of control and take on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider these anomalies:
</P>
<P>
   _ The rules _ 26 of them _ would essentially be those written
for the Johnson trial in 1868. In that era, there were only 54
senators, in session only a small part of the year and working with
quill pens under gas lamps. But Senate rules are so hard to change
that it is unlikely these would be tinkered with in any meaningful
way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Constitution, the chief justice must preside. (The
Founding Fathers realized it would be a conflict of interest for
the vice president to preside over the Senate in an impeachment
trial of a president.) The chief justice could be overruled on any
matter by a majority vote of the senators. But if a tie vote
occurred, he would cast the tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Senate rules, the senators, who think nothing of
speaking for hours on the most mundane topic, would not be allowed
to speak during the trial. To question a witness, they could pass a
note to the chief justice, who would pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   _ All witnesses would testify and all evidence would be
presented in public _ presumably on television, no matter how
salacious and how embarrassing. But the senators' deliberations
would be in closed session. No senator would be allowed to speak
for more than 10 minutes in these sessions on preliminary matters.
When the final verdict was debated, 15 minutes would be allotted
each senator, again behind locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott insists he is making no plans
for a trial, and there is no evidence to the contrary. To plan
before the House votes to impeach, he says, would be presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly anyone who has examined the impeachment process
believes that a trial could be concluded in ``three days to three
weeks,'' as Lott suggested in a recent television interview. Alan
Baron, a Washington lawyer who was special impeachment counsel
during the trials of two federal judges in the 1980s, figures that
if the Senate takes up the case in early January, a trial might be
completed by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are,'' Baron cautions, ``on the edge of a real seismic
event.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have to be given a month or two to prepare for the
trial, Baron said. Then, he said, there would be months of
pre-trial activity.
</P>
<P>
   The first question to be answered would be whether a vote of
impeachment by the lame-duck 105th Congress would be sufficient for
the Senate to conduct a trial in the new Congress or whether the
new House (with a smaller Republican majority) would have to
impeach the president all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist would rule first on this. His ruling would be subject
to reversal by the senators. Because this is a constitutional
question, the matter would doubtless go next to the Supreme Court _
where the chief justice, of course, presides.
</P>
<P>
   (Paradoxically, Rehnquist comes as close as anyone in the
country to being an expert on impeachment trials. In 1992, he
published a book, ``Grand Inquests,'' on the two most famous
impeachment trials, both of which ended in acquittal _ the Johnson
trial in 1868 and the trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase
in 1805.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, motions on other questions would arise. What standard of
proof would be required for conviction _ ``beyond a reasonable
doubt'' as in a criminal trial; ``preponderance of evidence,'' as
in a civil trial, or something completely different? What is the
definition of perjury, the accusation in the first two articles of
impeachment recommended last week by the House Judiciary Committee?
What rules of evidence would apply? For instance, would hearsay
evidence be allowed? Would the president's lawyers and senior
advisers be protected from testifying by attorney-client privilege
and executive privilege? If misconduct by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr can be proved, should the case be dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a Clinton trial, scores of witnesses would have
to be interviewed and documentary evidence would have to be
reviewed. The prosecution could not rely, as the House Judiciary
Committee did, solely on Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be similar to those in
courtrooms. There would be opening statements, presentation of
witnesses and evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals
and closing arguments. The witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp
and the rest _ would testify in public, under oath, and would be
subjected for the first time to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution would be supervised by a team of congressmen,
called House managers, led by Hyde. They would function like
district attorneys who oversee cases but leave the courtroom work
to assistants. The organization of the prosecution's case,
questioning of witnesses and opening and closing arguments
presumably would be handled by prosecutors hired from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense would also be conducted by a team of hired
lawyers. Because his defense in an impeachment trial is one of the
president's official duties, the cost would be borne by the
government. The president could choose whether to appear at the
trial and whether to testify himself.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference from a courtroom trial, of course, would be the
nature of the jury. Senators would not represent an impartial jury
of the president's peers. Unlike an ordinary jury, the senators
would decide questions of law as well as fact. And the verdict, no
doubt, would turn more on politics than on evidence. Under the
Constitution, it would require a two-thirds vote of the senators
present to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The other big qualification to keep in mind is that under the
Senate rules, the trial could be abandoned at any point by a
majority vote. This is how a plea bargain might occur. The senators
could agree to stop the trial if they decided to censure or
otherwise punish the president instead, and if the president agreed
to accept the offer, as he indicated he would on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the question of a Senate impeachment trial was
seriously considered was in August 1974, after the House Judiciary
Committee had voted to recommend the impeachment of President
Richard M. Nixon. The Senate voted to direct its Rules Committee to
examine the procedures and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nixon resigned. Whatever thought had gone into the matter
was quickly shelved.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment committee eased into its final day
with a sense of political hangover, a somber wistfulness at having
irrevocably done the deed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House Judiciary Committee quietly sipped coffee
in the hearing room doorways Saturday morning and munched muffins
at their microphones, as the Republicans' fourth and final article
of impeachment loomed on a gray day. For the Democrats, there was
no sign of optimism as they proffered their last-ditch attempt to
substitute censure as a more merciful and inviting solution for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time permitting,'' the Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry
Hyde of Illinois, said of the chances for considering the
Democrats' hope as he gaveled the committee to order 40 minutes
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a game,'' said Sen.-elect Charles Schumer of New
York as the Democrats quickly re-stoked their anger at the
impeachment bill. ``There's just a lot of poorly drawn verbiage
here saying: `We want that man out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking about the proceedings all week was a Democratic warning
that the Republicans may be putting their House majority on the
line in the next election by pressing the unpopular impeachment
vote. ``Beware,'' the Republicans were cautioned by Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif.. ``Next election, the voters will be out to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, the bluntest distinction between Watergate and
the effort to impeach President Clinton was stated by Howard Coble,
R-N.C., who noted that the Republicans are in the congressional
majority this time while the Democrats were in 1974. ``It's a lot
easier to throw grenades than to catch them,'' Coble said with some
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh history needs fresh souvenirs. And so the committee kept
the gavels moving the way ceremonial flags briefly wave over the
Capitol, the better to create them in volume, the same way that
pens are wielded by the fistful at a presidential bill signing.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Democrats, these symbolic hammers of law and
order, however, had a macabre aspect in being brandished at a far
grimmer event, the committee's presidential impeachment vote, and
so an explanation was in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are to be given to people for what purpose I don't
know,'' Hyde lightly announced. Privately, Democrats joked that
they might serve as prizes at Republican fund-raising dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see me up here banging away, don't worry,'' Hyde said.
``I'm just trying to use the ceremonial gavels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bang went the gavel, and on came the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The avuncular chairman remained unflappable through the debates
on the articles and the voting on Friday. ``We're nearing the end,
folks, let's take a deep breath,'' Hyde announced rather
contentedly at the 12-hour mark on Friday, as if driving a school
bus through a rainstorm with a spitball fight being waged about
him. He preferred to laugh when he could, even if the joke was on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I swing to Frank,'' he said, genially offering debating
time to Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and formidably
fast-witted debater.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your swinging my way,'' Frank
responded, and laughter exploded in the room at what was taken as
Frank's allusion to the well-known fact that he is gay. Finally
laughing loudest of all, Hyde tried a wordplay of his own by
invoking the standard command for parliamentary calm _ ``Regular
order!'' _ with the emphasis on regular.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Frank uses humor as an arresting rhetorical device and in the
impeachment debate he complained repeatedly that the committee had
not made an independent investigation of the evidence in accepting
and reshaping the allegations of Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel. ``We're just the piano players sending it upstairs,'' he
said, referring to the Senate's need, should impeachment be
approved by the full House, to conduct a full-scale trial of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Democrats lost battle after battle in attacking the
impeachment articles, but they showed some strong lawyerly
fighting. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., was particularly tireless. He
initiated one promising contest that put the Republicans on the
defensive, when he noted that precise quotations and details of
Clinton's alleged perjury were not cited in the articles, the way
they would be in a normal criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole subject is revealed for the farce it is,'' Nadler
complained.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, in one of the many instances of the ghost of
Richard Nixon being summoned forth, responded that the Watergate
impeachment articles had been just as nonspecific when they were
approved. ``This is not an indictment,'' Hyde responded, ``This is
an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler lost the battle but he was not done. He moved from
outrage to mockery in dealing with another charge cited as grounds
for impeachment by David Schippers, the Republicans' chief
investigative counsel: that the president furtively signaled Ms.
Lewinsky when he gave her a souvenir teddy bear, ``symbolizing
strength,'' that she must remain silent about their intimacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he kidding?'' Nadler said. ``For nonsense like this, we're
going to overturn the votes of the American people? I think the
bear was a warning by the president that the stock market was going
to tank and she should put all her money in bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   As laughter swept the hearing room, Nadler said, ``That's as
logical an inference as any other.''

EUROPE DELAYS DECISION ON EX-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Leaders of the 15 European Union countries on
Saturday put off until next year decisions on changing budget and
decision-making procedures to prepare for the admission of formerly
communist nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this wasn't the summit where we were going to
resolve these issues,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said their commitment to expansion to the east
remained undiminished, though apparently some politicians from
nations aspiring to join the union had their doubts when they met
the current leaders Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have stopped thinking in terms of the immediate
future,'' said Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France, who like
other leaders described that attitude as realistic.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day summit meeting in the Hofburg Palace, seat of
the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, the leaders said they would
meet again in February and March and try to resolve most of their
differences by their next regularly scheduled summit meeting in
Cologne next June.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany said, changes
to Europe's costly agricultural subsidy program, widely held to be
untenable when countries like Poland with tens of thousands of
small farmers will come in, would take longer than the next six
months, when Germany will hold the European Union's rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural subsidies program is projected to cost more
than $50 billion a year in the next decade unless the system is
changed, according to the European Commission in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of keeping the new Europe affordable, the rich
countries that will have to pay for it had hoped to get agreement
on a spending limit. But they were blocked by Spain, Greece,
Portugal and other countries that get back more in European support
funds than they pay in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The European leaders said they would intensify talks with the
leading candidates for new membership _ Hungary, Poland, Estonia,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus _ early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements on admission terms are expected to take several
years, with preliminary talks with five other countries _ Romania,
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria _ also getting under way
in earnest next year.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and France, both with center-left governments, also
pushed through a summit-meeting commitment to a ``European jobs
pact'' next year, aimed at bringing the average European Union
unemployment below the current 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition from Spain and Britain watered down a commitment
sought by German and French leaders on binding government targets
for creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Britain argued with Spain against too much state
intervention, the European leaders agreed to coordinate economic
policies and work on general job goals closely next year after a
common currency, the euro, is introduced in 11 member countries.
</P>
<P>
   European Union leaders sounded one note of alarm Saturday _
about the imminence of a potential year 2000 problem for computers.
</P>
<P>
   They called for a special meeting in Brussels, Belgium, to
discuss the effects it could have on transportation, energy and
water-supply networks.

   WASHINGTON _ In theory, the independent counsel statute was
supposed to be a legal traffic light, blinking red and green at the
crossroads of law and politics. It would stop frivolous charges
against high-level officials, but serious accusations would be
waved on to an outside prosecutor. In recent days, however, the
statute's already overloaded circuitry seems to have blown a fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the law are coming at a critical time: The
statute is due to expire next year, and Democrats and Republicans
are lining to up declare that, after two decades, the law intended
to keep politics out of corruption cases should be allowed to die.
Last week an independent bipartisan commission that included Howard
Baker, the former senator and Reagan administration chief of staff,
and Griffin Bell, the former Carter administration attorney
general, issued a report saying the law doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of breakdown seems to be everywhere. In big-name
independent counsel cases, like Kenneth Starr's $33 million
sex-and-lies impeachment investigation of President Clinton, or
less pricey prosecutions, like Donald Smaltz's unsuccessful $17
million case against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy,
prosecutors seem to be ending up in bitter controversy or
humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And even when a scandal seems like a natural candidate for an
independent counsel, involving allegations of serious violations of
federal election law and accusations against a president and vice
president, the law doesn't seem to apply _ at least in the hands of
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years about 20 independent counsels have been appointed
(some ended their tenure after brief inquiries that were never made
public) to investigate charges against both Republican and
Democratic presidents, Cabinet officers and lesser officials. At
the moment, five independent counsels are still in operation, in
inquiries focused on Clinton and four current or former Cabinet
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic critics cite Starr and Smaltz as prime examples of
what the statute can produce: overzealous inquisitors operating
with limitless budgets and without the usual constraints on Justice
Department prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The critics complain that Starr and Smaltz seemed to be obsessed
by playing cat and mouse with a single quarry, in the process
bullying witnesses and spending years fruitlessly pursuing
investigative trails that career prosecutors would have dropped in
months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course many of the Democrats who are now complaining about
Starr were silent when the Republicans assailed Lawrence Walsh's
four-year independent counsel investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair. But even that inquiry largely failed to hold anyone
criminally liable for the profound constitutional issues at the
heart of the scandal. The inquiry ended abruptly when President
George Bush, after being defeated by Clinton, pulled the plug on
the prosecution by pardoning former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and five other former officials on Christmas Eve in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some inquiries have never gotten off the ground. Twice in the
last two weeks Ms. Reno has terminated 90-day preliminary inquires
with decisions that cleared Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of
wrongdoing in campaign fund raising. Her decisions made it highly
unlikely that either will ever be investigated by an outside
prosecutor for their role in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her recent decisions were consistent with her refusals over the
last two years to seek an outside counsel to investigate myriad
charges of campaign finance abuse, overruling both FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance unit. Each had concluded that the evidence required that
the case be sent to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, said last week that Ms. Reno's decision was
probably the ``final nail in the coffin of the independent counsel
law.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans complain that Ms. Reno has set the standard too
high in the campaign finance case, Democrats complain she has set
it too low in the case of lower-level Clinton administration
officials, who have been its most frequent targets. A case in point
is the investigation of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
over the relatively small issue of whether he lied to the FBI about
how much money he paid his former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   So for whatever reasons recently, the law has been toothless in
cases of possibly serious violations of campaign finance laws but
has been used aggressively to investigate gifts of sports tickets,
payments to a mistress and whether Clinton lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet. Ms. Reno has one more independent counsel
decision. On Nov. 30, faced with a decision on whether to seek an
outside inquiry of Harold Ickes, formerly Clinton's deputy chief of
staff, Ms. Reno got a 60-day extension. At issue is whether Ms.
Ickes lied about his activities on behalf of the teamsters' union
in a labor dispute with a California walnut processor.

</P>
<P>
   So for whatever reasons recently, the law has been toothless in
cases of possibly serious violations of campaign finance laws but
has been used aggressively to investigate gifts of sports tickets,
payments to a mistress and whether Clinton lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet. Ms. Reno has one more independent counsel
decision. On Nov. 30, faced with a decision on whether to seek an
outside inquiry of Harold Ickes, formerly Clinton's deputy chief of
staff, Ms. Reno got a 60-day extension. At issue is whether Ms.
Ickes lied about his activities on behalf of the teamsters' union
in a labor dispute with a California walnut processor.

CHRISTIANITY IN AFRICA: THE GOOD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Nearly every morning for the last eight days
at the University of Zimbabwe's campus, several hundred worshippers
have gathered under a large sea-blue tent to sing and pray before a
15-foot teakwood cross adorned with a large carving of the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing conveys to many participants at the Eighth Assembly
of the World Council of Churches one of the most significant
challenges within Christianity these days: its rapid growth in the
developing world, and in Africa in particular.
</P>
<P>
   At some point early in the 21st century, ``Africa may have the
largest Christian population of any continent,'' the Rev. Konrad
Raiser, the council's general secretary, said in an interview.
``Therefore people have been talking about a shift in the center of
vitality from the north to the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and others have all claimed
significant growth in Africa. The World Lutheran Federation says
membership in Lutheran churches in Africa grew by two-thirds in
seven years, to 9.1 million in 1997. During the last two decades,
the Vatican says, the number of Roman Catholics has doubled, to
more than 100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation varies from country to country (Anglicans
claim great growth in Nigeria, Lutherans in Tanzania, for example);
numbers can be quite general, and not everyone here agrees which
church is growing most rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Some detect significant growth among new denominations known as
African-instituted churches, which have been founded by independent
African religious leaders and may embrace beliefs like the ability
of believers to prophesy under divine inspiration. At the current
assembly, the council admitted one African-instituted church, the
Harrist Church from Ivory Coast. It claims 100,000 members and
takes its name from a Liberian missionary, William Harris, who was
active early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Others here said church growth was greatest among charismatic
congregations that have sprung up in the cities and attract people
with high-energy services offering physical and spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have followed Christianity's growth in Africa often
say it has been aided by urbanization, economic uncertainty and the
search for a broadly encompassing spiritual outlook _ factors
frequently cited in the growth of Islam as well.
</P>
<P>
   Others say some churches have grown by embracing African forms
of worship, sacred music and dance, and by moving away from styles
linked with former colonial rulers _ a process several African
theologians say must become widespread if the faith is to
strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Owdenburg Mdegella, a Lutheran from Tanzania, said that
in his country, ``most of the Protestant churches have developed
their own liturgy, their own music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So even the people who thought the church was of a distant
aspect think the church is part of their society,'' he said, adding
that he had composed hymns himself.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity's growth in Africa, and a similar expansion in
parts of Asia, present a challenge to the ecumenical goals of the
council, which was founded 50 years ago largely by European and
American clerics to advance the cause of unity.
</P>
<P>
   As the council celebrates its jubilee year, said Raiser,
questions of doctrine and institutional structure that preoccupied
leaders of European and North American churches seem less
significant than questions of national identity, and of class,
cultural and ethnic differences among the churches of the world.
</P>
<P>
   At its founding in 1948, the council had 147 member churches.
Now the council _ which assembles every six to eight years _ has
339 Protestant and Orthodox Christian member churches, most from
Africa, Asia and the South Pacific. (The Roman Catholic Church does
not belong to the council but sends observers.)
</P>
<P>
   Last July, when the world's Anglican bishops gathered in
Canterbury, England, for their once-a-decade Lambeth Conference,
prelates from Africa and Asia outnumbered counterparts from the
Church of England and the Episcopal Church in the United States.
The social conservatism that comes with this shift was illustrated
when many African and Asian bishops supported a statement that
criticized homosexual behavior as ``incompatible'' with Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   No similar debate is planned here, although gay Christian groups
and their supporters have offered several workshops on
homosexuality and the Bible. But another issue, the problem of poor
nations' international debt, which deeply concerns many church
leaders from developing countries, is on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some theologians here cautioned that the growth of Christianity
in Africa presents specific problems. In a speech at a plenary
session dealing with African issues, Mercy Amba Oduyoye, a
Methodist from Ghana, said: ``We have become heavily Chistianized.
Could we engage in influencing the shape of global Christianity or
at least develop our own distinctive African practice and
articulation of the faith?''
</P>
<P>
   Another theologian, the Rev. John Pobee, an Anglican from Ghana,
said in an interview that he avoided talking about membership
growth, which he said was occurring largely outside the mainline
Christian churches in his country, because he did not think it
necessarily represented a sign of spiritual strength. ``This growth
needs to be tested, not only in terms of width but in terms of
depth,'' said Pobee, who will begin serving as a bishop next year.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``there was once a vibrant Christian church in
Roman North Africa,'' which produced one of greatest Christian
theologians of all time, St. Augustine, but which largely
disappeared with the coming of Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   For the current growth to endure, he said, the faith must be
presented in accord with African needs, as community-oriented and
socially involved. Worship services need to be engaging emotionally
as well as intellectually. ``We've got to learn to couch our
articulation of God in songs and in poems,'' he added.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The dwindling number of members of Congress who
remain undecided about impeachment have different views on what
President Clinton can still say or do to keep them from voting to
impeach him this week. Some want him to admit perjury. Some want
him to simply say, ``I lied.'' Some cannot really express what they
want, they just know they want something.
</P>
<P>
   But what they all agree on is that whatever they need, they have
not gotten it yet.
</P>
<P>
   And with that judgment, a rising tide of undecided members say
they are inclined to vote for impeachment, now that the president's
allies have presented his defense before the Judiciary Committee
and the president himself has addressed the nation to reiterate his
remorse about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I wish he had told the truth at the start of this
controversy, because chances are the nation would not be in this
mess,'' said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., a moderate, who
declared his intention to vote for impeachment just minutes after
Clinton's national address on Friday. ``The president has no one to
blame but himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton's allies say they still have hope of winning over
enough Republicans to block impeachment, it is clear their universe
of potential swing votes is shrinking fast. On Friday, at least six
previously undecided members announced plans to vote for
impeachment, and moderate Republicans say many more are leaning
toward jumping on the impeachment bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech was underwhelming,'' one moderate Republican from
the Northeast, who had been leaning against impeachment, said on
condition of anonymity following Clinton's five-minute address.
``It didn't do anything to change one vote. The brevity of it, it
was kind of like: `They told me I had to do this, so I'll do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who have been counted among the undecideds had
said they needed nothing less than a full admission from the
president that he perjured himself about his relations with Monica
Lewinsky. They did not get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as refuting the charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, I don't think they changed any minds,'' said Rep. James
Walsh, R-N.Y., who announced Saturday that he would vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the undecided camp had maintained before the
president's address to the nation that Clinton could have helped
restore his credibility by simply using the words, ``I lied,''
whether in reference to his statements to the public or his
testimony before a grand jury. They did not get that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has missed a number of important
opportunities to help rebuild his credibility,'' said Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., who left on a trip to Israel with Clinton Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lied on a number of occasions,'' Lazio said. ``And by
not being able to confront the reality of that, by not saying, `I
have lied, and these are the reasons I lied,' and by not explaining
to the American people that he knows the difference between a truth
and a lie in an honest and straightforward way, he has missed an
opportunity to rebuild his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the undecided members have expressed deep anguish about
the impeachment proceedings and seem to have spent recent days
groping for arguments that would justify breaking party ranks to
vote against it. Among some of those members, there was an almost
palpable disappointment with the president's speech on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, said he could see regret on Clinton's face
during the address. ``But I don't think he took the step many
people were anticipating,'' Ney said. ``He wouldn't say, `I didn't
tell the truth under oath.' I would say at this point, candor is
the best course. But I'm still up in the air on how I'll vote. I'm
disappointed, but I'm not holding it against him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ney comes from the kind of district that Clinton's allies had
thought would make him likely to oppose impeachment: It is a
Democratic district and voted overwhelmingly for Clinton in 1996.
House Democrats had targeted about two dozen other Republicans with
swing districts, including people like Lazio, Constance Morella of
Maryland and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, for lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a handful of defections from their own ranks on
impeachment, the Democrats calculate they will need to swing about
15 Republicans against impeachment; so far, they have five. A sixth
member who had expressed opposition to impeachment, Rep. John
Edward Porter, R-Ill., now says he has not ruled out voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   There are also, however, several moderate Republicans who have
been among the undecided who come from solidly Republican districts
and whose political futures would hardly seem imperiled by a vote
for impeachment. Yet many of them, too, say they are genuinely
pained by the historic vote facing them. One of them, Rep. Amo
Houghton, R-N.Y., announced his opposition to impeachment last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why so many moderate Republicans feel torn about the
matter, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said, ``It's the very
nature of the beast. A moderate tends to be a person, and I plead
guilty to this and don't apologize to anyone, who recognizes that
on most issues there is more than one side. The moderates
agonize.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he is looking for contrition from the president,
but that ``no single word'' could help him decide. ``It's important
in my mind to look at it and evaluate it and make a judgment on
what he is really saying,'' Boehlert said. ``Is this a classic
finesse, or does he really mean it? I don't know how you judge
that. I know how I judge it.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members raised the bar much higher. Rep. Mark Foley,
R-Fla., who is leaning toward impeachment, said Clinton might have
to admit having committed crimes and then throw himself on the
mercy of Congress to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In that situation, Foley said, Congress might respond like a
lenient judge and say, ``I could have given you 20 years, but I'm
compelled by your remorse, your recognition of the crime and I see
fit to reduce that.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few undecided members acknowledged what some of the
president's allies have been saying: That there is almost nothing
the president can do or say anymore to change minds. ``I don't
think there is anything that the president could say that will sway
the vote anymore,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. ``It is up to
us to sift through all the mountains of information, to digest the
process of the last week and really do some soul searching.''

AGENCY SAYS STIFFER U.S. PRACTICES THREATEN REFUGEES EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BARBARA CROSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A senior official in charge of protecting
refugees said that tougher qualifications for asylum in both rich
and poor countries are threatening the lives and safety of
displaced people almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, director of international protection for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, said at a news
briefing Friday that the challenge to his office was ``the most
severe that we have faced in decades.'' He singled out the United
States as a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said the refugee agency was lobbying governments and
private organizations in the United States and around the world to
reconsider newly restrictive policies on asylum and ``to to try to
mobilize a reinvigorated, expanded, renewed coalition in support of
the refugee protection system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very worried that this fragile system can only work
effectively if it has proper support, particularly from states, but
also from the public in general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said that millions of refugees were being boxed in
between tighter asylum policies and immigration laws in the
industrialized nations and the countries of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   In the richer countries, he said, there is ``increasing
restrictiveness to admission of asylum seekers and refugees and the
mixing up of refugees and illegal migration, drug trafficking,
terrorist issues to the detriment of asylum seekers.'' This was
compounded, he said, by ``a generally increasing noninternational
approach to the protection of refugees, in some cases going so far
as legal restrictions on the refugee definition and applying the
refugee convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I am afraid to say that that approach is reflected also in
this country, in the United States,'' he said. ``Our main donor,
our main supporter, with a proud history of refugee involvement,
has in place some of the most severe restrictions in its history,
which affect asylum seekers and refugees trying to enter the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The poorer nations have taken a cue from the policies of the
United States and Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many countries of the developing south have said enough is
enough,'' he said. ``Countries of Africa, Asia and elsewhere who
have hosted refugees _ large numbers, many millions for many years
_ are starting to say: `The burden is not equally shared. We are no
longer prepared just to have our borders open.' So we have an
export value also of negative practice from the developed regions
to the south to the detriment of asylum seekers and refugees in
many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning again to the United States, McNamara said that
immigration officials here were often out of line with
internationally accepted procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expedited removals from U.S. airports do not, in our view,
meet the minimum standards of due process, in many cases,'' he
said. ``Immigration officials doing those determinations, which may
affect the future well-being of those individuals, are not
necessarily trained adequately to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara, who was in New York as part of events this week
marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, was also critical of American detention practices,
including the mixing of asylum seekers with criminals and the
treatment of women and children. He called on the United States and
other governments to adhere to international conventions they have
signed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, marking Human Rights Day at the White House,
President Clinton announced new procedures for dealing with
children in asylum cases. The move was welcomed by advocates of
better refugee protection, led by the New York-based Women's
Commission for Refugee Women and Children, an organization that
worked with the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service to
develop the new guidelines.

 &HT;    Quiet man brought UT's first Heisman back home
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It should be no surprise that the entire living
room showcases the trophy, for this home on the northern outskirts
of Tyler is the house that Heisman built.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall to the right is a photo of Earl Campbell hugging his
mom at the award ceremony in New York 21 years ago. On the wall to
the left is a tapestry of Jesus. On the opposite wall, facing the
trophy, is a framed photo of Campbell holding the Heisman with his
former coach, Darrell Royal.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of such decorative embellishment, the focus of
attention is the corner of the room, the Heisman corner, where the
bronze statue stands on a 4-foot-tall, ivory-colored pedestal. A
chandelier above it showers the trophy with light, reflected by the
two wall-sized mirrors that meet in the corner behind it. At the
foot of the football altar are dozens of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   It makes a statement, no question about it, this Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who built the house had the idea to display it like
that,'' said the owner's mom, Ann Campbell. ``Earl told me he was
going to build me a house I'd be comfortable in, and that the
Heisman should stay in his home place. As long as I live, this will
be the home for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Earl Campbell won the 1977 Heisman _ awarded each year to
the best college football player in the country _ Ann Campbell had
raised her family in a wooden shack on this rural road, a few
winding miles behind the smoke of the Tyler Pipe plant. Her husband
had died of a heart attack when Earl was 10.
</P>
<P>
   As the sixth-oldest of 11 children, Earl wasn't even considered
the best football player among the seven Campbell sons, but he was
the first to play for integrated schools. He was also, everyone
agrees, the one who was least interested in working the rose-bush
crop that was the impoverished family's means of subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: If it wasn't for football, Earl would
have starved to death,'' said his brother Tim, a year younger and
one of the twins (Steve is the other) who also played for the
University of Texas Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Campbell vowed that if he ever made something of himself in
football, the first thing he would do was buy his mother a house.
Sturdy brick, it was built just a few yards from where the shack
previously stood, alongside the two-lane blacktop that is now known
as Ann Campbell Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl has always been kind of a quiet guy, a slow-acting guy,''
said his mom. ``He was never outgoing like the twins. He could have
easily forgot about us, but he never felt like he was any better
than his brothers or sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of guys who won the Heisman who were (jerks),
and nobody remembers anything about them now,'' said Tim. ``If
you're an upstanding member of the community and carry yourself the
way you should, people remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The other trophy Two hundred and thirty or so miles southwest of
the Campbell home is another Heisman, a duplicate. It serves as the
silent greeter for those who enter the University of Texas football
offices, behind the south end zone of Royal Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This Heisman makes a different sort of statement. Encased on a
mahogany stand with a rotating base, it looks like it belongs in
the most elegant corporate boardroom or the swankiest
expense-account steakhouse. What it says to the prime beef among
Longhorns recruits is that you, too, could be like Earl Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky had better get ready, because once you get it,
everything changes,'' Earl Campbell said, anticipating that tonight
Williams will become the second Heisman Trophy winner in Longhorns
football history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your name is never the same,'' Campbell said. ``Heisman is
included in whatever you do, for the rest of your life. If he tries
to do everything that people want him to do, there's not going to
be a lot of time for Ricky. Even at age 43, there are always people
tugging at Earl: Earl do this, Earl do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the glass wall of Campbell's office as special assistant
to the athletic director (or Longhorns football ``ambassador,'' as
he describes his role), a visitor can see that duplicate Heisman
over his shoulder, rotating slowly. Though it provides a constant
reminder of the glory season of 1977, Campbell pays it no mind.
Whatever the changes that Heisman wrought, it is quite likely that
no Texan has been less impressed with the football accomplishments
of Earl Campbell than Earl Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fit the number 20 that everybody used to see,'' he
said, referring to the jersey retired by the Longhorns to honor his
exploits, the one framed on the wall of the office he shares with
Royal. ``They think that guy should be flashier. And I'm a
no-socks, laid-back, T-shirt and shorts guy. A guy who talks real
slow. I don't go out; I don't party. Things that people wouldn't
think make me very happy. It's not the high-rolling lifestyle, but
I can have more damn fun over a beer and a country music song. The
only time in my life when I'm by myself is when I'm in my
Suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   Some time alone that he hadn't anticipated occurred earlier this
fall, when Campbell was hospitalized for six weeks after he was
diagnosed with a congenital spinal condition that, by all rights,
should have prevented him from playing football. Suffering from
spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal, he now realizes
that every tackle left his mobility in far more jeopardy than he
had ever suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just God's blessing that I was never hit just right, and
it's also God's blessing that I made it to the hospital when I did,
because if I had waited any longer, I might have been paralyzed,''
Campbell said. ``If I'd ever had a real physical, with MRIs and all
the stuff you go through now, I probably never would have played
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Running to glory ``I think Earl might have been the last one to
have absolutely won the Heisman on the field,'' said Fred Akers,
who replaced Royal as Longhorns coach in 1977 and tailored his
offense to highlight Campbell. ``Today, it's much more publicized;
the hoopla starts at least a year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Earl is that he was very, very good on
the days that we had national TV coverage. He just kept getting
better and better and better. You'd watch him and say, 'My God, how
could anybody do that?' It wasn't just one explosion; there were
five or six explosions on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal made Campbell his prime recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him in the state high school playoff game (in which
Campbell's undefeated John Tyler team beat Reagan for the 1973 4A
championship), it was a man against boys,'' Royal said. ``He ran
over high school kids, and people said, 'Well, he won't do that in
college.'
</P>
<P>
   ``After he ran over them in college, people said, 'He won't do
that in pro ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran over them there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are plenty of differences between Campbell and
Williams _ Earl is as country as East Texas, Ricky as sunny as San
Diego; Earl bulled through people, Ricky glides over and around
them _ Campbell recognizes some amazing parallels. Both initially
played fullback in college before switching as upperclassmen to the
showcase slot of tailback. Both saw their Longhorns suffer dismal
seasons their junior year, only to transcend all expectations with
a new coach as seniors. Both trampled all over Texas A&AMP;M in their
climactic rush to the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the season, nobody was even thinking about the
Heisman,'' recalled Tim Campbell. ``And then when Earl won it, if
you'll pardon the expression, all hell broke loose, all over the
campus and on Guadalupe.''
</P>
<P>
   A Campbell career The irony of Campbell as reluctant celebrity
is that celebrity has provided his livelihood ever since he retired
from professional football in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He extended his Lone Star legend with a stellar career as a
Houston Oiler, followed by a swan song season as a New Orleans
Saint. A No. 1 draft choice in 1978, he was rookie of the year, a
two-time Most Valuable Player, a four-time All Pro and a Hall of
Famer selected during his first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Following Campbell's retirement, he returned to Austin from
Houston at the behest of the UT Athletic Department, where he
serves as a high-profile symbol of an illustrious past. His
assignment as special assistant makes him available to recruits and
athletes when he stops by once a week or so, without otherwise
making much of a demand on his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the business that I do is with UT people,'' Campbell
said. ``I think it speaks very highly of the University of Texas
that if you do the right things and keep your hands clean, you can
always go home.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was approached by a couple of businessmen to start
Earl Campbell Foods, which sells ``pretty close to a million
dollars worth of sausage a month,'' according to Campbell. The
company also sells other items ranging from fajitas to
chitterlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl's a responsible businessman,'' Royal said. ``He handles
the PR mainly, and he's very diligent about showing up where he's
supposed to be, and on time and staying and visiting and signing,
and doing what he's supposed to when he's promoting that sausage
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's spending the morning at UT, the afternoon at his
Sixth Street office of Earl Campbell Foods or the entire day with
business associates on the golf course, being Earl Campbell isn't
simply his identity. It's his job.
</P>
<P>
   A bladder message UT can bless a weak bladder for bringing
Campbell to Austin. Recruited by coaches from coast to coast, he
had narrowed his options to two: Royal at Texas or Barry Switzer at
Oklahoma. As a believer in signs and serendipity, he decided to let
nature run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I went to bed and prayed that if I got up to use the
bathroom during the night, I'm going to come to the University of
Texas,'' Campbell said. ``And if I slept through the night, I would
go to Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Switzer was known for enjoying an easy relationship with
African-American athletes, the Longhorns carried a stigma of
integrating belatedly and grudgingly. Campbell had thrilled to the
televised exploits of Roosevelt Leaks, whose junior season had made
him a strong Heisman contender and who would be a senior teammate
of the freshman from Tyler. But as far as Campbell could see, Leaks
was pretty much the whole show, one of the few African Americans
and easily the best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember people taking bets when I was in Tyler,
after I had signed to come to school here, that I wouldn't make
it,'' Campbell said. ``Because this guy Darrell Royal was supposed
to be such a racist. I figured that he was a man and I was a man.
And he was going to have to go a long ways to convince me that he
was a racist, because I was going to make a hell of an effort to be
a friend to him.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recruitment, Royal had already won a more important
friend: Ann Campbell. Earl's mom simply didn't trust Switzer, who
kept taking Earl for walks outside the house, out of Ann's earshot.
Royal had nothing to hide, and he told Ann that she didn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really ashamed of my house and everything, and when
Royal came, he sat on the foot of my bed,'' Ann Campbell said.
``And he visited with me and said, 'I want you to know, I was
raised in a shack. You don't have anything to be ashamed of.' He
said Earl would have to apply himself to his books, but that UT
could be a help to him, and that he could be a help to UT.''
</P>
<P>
   The top recruit said he ``came to school here because I like it,
it fits me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come from a family with wealth of any sort, except
for love,'' he said. ``I didn't have a lot of clothes, and you can
wear the same pair of pants here for a week. If you don't bother
nobody, nobody's going to bother you. The only thing that really
bothered me was people looking at me when I walked across campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Because you were big? Or black? Or because you were recognized
as an athlete?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of all of them,'' he replied. ``When I came to
the university, racism was at the point where there was a lot more
publicity about UT not wanting blacks here. Winning has a way of
hiding that, or putting it to the side. Everybody probably thinks I
was the main guy on our football team the whole four years. I
wasn't the main guy. The guy who kept our whole football team
together was an offensive lineman named Rick Ingraham . And he was
a white guy, from Westlake of all places. Every Saturday in the
huddle, Rick Ingraham would say, 'We're going to win the Heisman
for Earl. Let's go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell helped blacks feel more welcome at UT, Royal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roosevelt Leaks was our first black star, and he had
tremendous influence as well, and following right behind him came
Earl,'' the former coach said. ``And Earl certainly has his
African-American friends, but he has a helluva lot of white friends
as well. He just mixes and mingles with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell credits his success to UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like that guy from the Dominican Republic (Sammy Sosa) saying
everything he has he owes to baseball, everything I have I owe to
the University of Texas,'' said the football star turned sausage
king. ``I've met Who's Who in America because of going to school
here, and this was way before pro football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out beautifully,'' said Royal, reminded of how he
had promised Ann Campbell that her son and the university could do
each other some good. ``I know of plenty of situations since Earl
has been out of school where his contacts with the university have
been helpful to him. And goodness knows what he meant to us.'' A
Campbell courtship Once upon a time, a boy and a girl fell in love
at first sight and knew that they would stay together forever. If
you don't believe in fairy tales, you'll never accept the courtship
of Reuna and Earl Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It began on the first day of ninth grade, which was also the
first day that busing for integration came to the Tyler school
system. If not for that, a poor country boy such as Earl Campbell
might never have crossed paths with Reuna Smith, an African
American who lived in a more privileged part of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first day, when he stepped off the bus, there was this
halo over his head,'' said Reuna (pronounced like Rene). ``I'm from
what Earl would call a basically middle-class home, and I think he
was embarrassed when he met me, because of my home, the things that
my family had. He has always been a nice young man; that's what I
called him back then. You could tell he was a devoted athlete,
because he worked very hard at it. We weren't allowed to date until
the 10th grade, and I felt like he did not want me at his home.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Reuna remained in Tyler while Earl was in Austin with the
Longhorns and then in Houston with the Oilers, she says they never
broke up or gave serious thought to a future without each other.
Even so, she was surprised by Campbell's spur-of-the-moment return
to Tyler on Valentine's Day 1980. He had hired a limousine to drive
him from Houston, and he was carrying a ring in his pocket when he
asked Reuna's father for his daughter's hand in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, 'What are you doing home?' '' Campbell
recalled. ``And I said, 'I left something here years ago, and I
came back to get it. I want to ask Reuna if she'll be my wife.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years of marriage and two sons who are following in the
football footsteps of their daddy _ 16-year-old Earl Christian II
(who goes by Christian) plays for Westlake High, and 12-year-old
Tyler Christian for Hill Country _ the Campbells maintain that they
have never had so much as a serious argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife will tell you it does no good to argue with him,
because if she argues, he just leaves,'' Earl said.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course!'' Reuna said with a laugh. ``You want somebody to
say something, and he's not that way. It's not that either one of
us is perfect, but I guess we have that understanding that has
bonded us together. It's all good. He is just a special guy, a good
husband and a great father.''
</P>
<P>
   When the boys play football, their father is a lot more likely
to miss the game than their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm around, I think I'm more of a distraction than
anything,'' he explained. ``I want my children to do their own
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want the focus to be on him,'' Reuna said. ``When
Earl comes, he tries to remain anonymous and go to the end of the
field or sit on the opposite side. You know, the mom is always the
best cheerleader, anyway.'' Weakness well hidden Though Campbell
appeared invincible on the field _ the irresistible force, the
drive that would not be denied, the player who once ran into Bevo
and saw Bevo go down _ he discovered this fall that his spine is so
weak that he should never have played football.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned over a lack of feeling and control in his feet, he
drove himself to Houston, where upon his arrival he couldn't even
get out of his car. Two operations and resulting complications left
him hospitalized there for six weeks; he has yet to risk a round of
golf, after more than two months of convalescence.
</P>
<P>
   For the Campbells, the toughest part was the realization that
their sons might suffer from the hereditary condition, and that, if
so, they would no longer be able to participate in the sport they
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to tell our boys that they couldn't play
football,'' said Reuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God they don't have it,'' said Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Winner's new world ``You ought to be doing an article on Ricky
Williams,'' said Campbell. ``I'm old, can't move no more.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two weeks and a couple dozen phone calls before Campbell
would consent to sit for an interview. Once he began talking, his
gruffness began to thaw, his game face to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Among those he keeps at arm's length, the media in particular,
he is often considered difficult at best. By contrast, those who
get close to him seem to remain close forever, unanimous in their
opinion that Campbell is as fine a man as Heisman has ever chosen,
and that winning the Heisman didn't change him one bit.
</P>
<P>
   What changed was Campbell's world, a world that was bigger and
more demanding than he had ever envisioned in Tyler. This world
expected him to be more than the slow-talking, easy-going country
boy who resisted the dazzle of the spotlight. It expected him to be
comfortable in his celebrity, a polished package, suave and
articulate. It expected him to handle constant demands on his time
with amazing grace. It expected him to be as accessible and
accommodating with the media as he naturally was with children. It
expected him to be something he wasn't, now that he was Earl
Campbell, Heisman winner. What the trophy confirmed for Campbell
was that he could run, but he couldn't hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very careful doing interviews about Ricky,'' said
Campbell, who has been besieged by such requests over the course of
Williams' Heisman run. He said he has declined 150 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm jealous of him or anything, but I wouldn't
want to say anything to hurt his chances,'' Campbell said. ``I
don't wear my hair like he does, but outside of that, he looks like
he could be my son. He'd better get ready, because it's going to
get tougher. He's such a great guy. I know Ricky understands this,
but winning the Heisman isn't an 'I' thing. It's the whole team,
for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   And if a trophy for Williams gives Campbell some company, all
the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing needs a twin,'' said Campbell, finally
acknowledging the Heisman behind him. ``It's been sitting there for
20 years by itself.''

 &HT;    Santa says Nintendo 64 and PlayStation have computer games beat
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Things would be different if I were Santa.
First, I'd introduce a more fit, sleeker Santa. One who didn't
smile as much. I would take advantage of modern fabrics and be more
of a Gore-Tex Tommy Hilfiger meets Calvin Klein kind of jolly old
elf. Reindeers would be replaced by a natural gas-powered,
atmosphere-friendly magic sleigh. Lastly, I wouldn't ever deliver
another PC game again.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. This Santa would go totally console. If the kids
wanted video games for Christmas, hello Nintendo 64 and
PlayStation, goodbye PC and Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages are clear. With a new PC costing at least $2,000
(and most new PCs souped up solely so we can play games on them),
the $130 price point for both consoles is very attractive. Even if
you have a computer, a microchip or RAM update, which is required
if you want to play the newest and coolest games, costs about $500.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with Nintendo 64 and PlayStation there is no crashing of
the system, no updates to make and no $100 joysticks to buy. The
consoles have even taken away the headache of having to check
gaming sites daily for patches so that your game works properly.
With Nintendo and PlayStation, all you do is drop the game in,
attach to your television and play. Easy.
</P>
<P>
   So with that in mind, this Santa has made his list, checked it
twice, picked all the games that I think are nice. Console Santa is
coming to town!
</P>
<P>
   Best all-around games
</P>
<P>
   These are for the best of the best girls and boys. But note: Not
all of these games are for kids. Console Santa says check out the
ratings on the back before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metal Gear Solid''_ If I were really Santa, Christmas might
not happen because of this game. I have spent an embarrassing
amount of time on this title. Konami's two-disc game has a deep,
addictive story line. You are Solid Snake enlisted by a top secret
government agency to stop the launch of a nuclear missile. While
this is a shooter game, it is also about stealth. PlayStation,
$49.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' _ One of the most
anticipated titles for the Nintendo 64 since, well, the last
``Zelda.'' I actually saw a grown man throw a tantrum in a
videogame store because they had sold out. You are Link and must
save the peaceful land of Hyrule from the King of Thieves. This is
very immersive, time consuming and makes a great gift if you never
want to see your kid again. Nintendo 64, $59.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddworld: Abe's Exodus'' _ The sequel to the freaky
``Oddworld: Abe's Oddyssey.'' This latest version boasts a two-disc
adventure in which you, as the ``so ugly he's cute'' Abe, must stop
the Glukons from using your people's tears for beer. It's an odd
world indeed. PlayStation, $49.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parasite Eve'' or ``Xenogears'' _ You can't go wrong with
either of these games from the makers of ``Final Fantasy.'' Both
are incredibly cinematic role-playing games. While the fighting
takes place in a semi-boring turn-based environment, both games are
``must haves'' for any good gamer boy or girl. PlayStation, $49.99
(for each).
</P>
<P>
   Best shooter games
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of talk about violence being inspired by
videogames. One look at a couple of these games and that revelation
is not surprising. But hey, what can Console Santa say? They're
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turok II: Seeds of Vengeance'' _ This is one of the most
advanced, goriest shooters for the Nintendo 64. You are Turok and
with an arsenal including a grenade launcher, shotgun and chainsaw,
you wreak havoc on dinosaurs and people alike. Nintendo 64, $64.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'' _ Ever thought of yourself as a
Jedi warrior? Well, now you can prove yourself to the Alliance.
``Rogue Squadron'' puts you to the test in this first-person
shooter. In this game you'll fly in your X-Wing and battle the
nastiest of the At-At Walkers. Nintendo 64, $54.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenchu: Stealth Assassin'' _ Not a shooter in the truest sense
of the word but stands up to all the others in this category. In
``Tenchu'', you are a ninja using every traditional weapon possible
to attain your honor. Throwing stars, crossbows and poison rice
balls are just a few of the tools you'll use as you take on the
title of a stealth assassin. PlayStation, $49.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colony Wars: Vengeance'' _ The new incarnation of Psygnosis'
hit space shooter adds a complex story line and more detailed
graphics. In the game, you must defend your home planet from a band
of savvy, bloodthirsty marauders. The game remembers your actions
and, as a result of them, plays one of six endings. PlayStation,
$44.99.
</P>
<P>
   Best sports games
</P>
<P>
   A great gaming alternative for kids are the sports games. The
only violence you'll find in these titles is the occasional
``roughing the passer'' call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool Boarders 3'' _ For all the ``sweet shredders'' out there.
``Cool Boarders'' includes competition and trick modes along with a
wide selection of boards and gear. This game is definitely the best
snowboarding simulator available and should appeal to any and all
fans of skiing down a mountain on one wide board. PlayStation,
$44.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``NFL Quarterback Club '99'' _ This definitely has the best
graphics of any of the football games. With its sharp players, you
get to see every bone-jarring, earthshaking hit. Season modes and
head-to-head are both available. Nintendo 64, $64.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA Live '99'' _ Electronic Arts once again proves it still
makes the best sports games out there with its rim-ringing ``NBA
Live.'' One highlight of this game is the facial expressions the
computer-animated players have when they foul or get fouled. You
can watch Dennis Rodman blow his stack as he commits the fifth
foul. Cool. PlayStation, $44.99, Nintendo 64, $59.99.
</P>
<P>
   Best kids games
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for games that are fun for everyone, this is
Console Santa's best for the little ones and the big ones alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glover'' _ What do you get when you cross a wizard's magic
with the Hamburger Helper glove? You get cute little Glover,
everyone's favorite hand covering. Of course, with the good comes
the bad. As Glover, you must battle your evil twin brother (an evil
glove) as you try to bring peace to your kingdom. Nintendo 64,
$59.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' _ Based on the hit movie. You are the
haphazard, quick-witted Flik, the ant. In the game you are trying
to save your anthill from spiders, grasshoppers and other crawly
critters. The game contains some of the best graphics anywhere and
includes parts of the movie. PlayStation, $44.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crash Bandicoot: Warped `` _ Crash is back with another
mind-twisting adventure. In this latest installment, you are able
to fly planes, get extreme on Jet Skis and ride on the back of
tigers. Join him as you travel through time and help him solve the
nail-biting problem of how to stop Dr. Cortex once and for all.
PlayStation, $44.99.

 &HT;    Lipstick a history, glossed over
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wax on, wax off.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to be more specific, beeswax, carnauba, paraffin, ozokerite,
microcrystalline and candelilla.
</P>
<P>
   This is just some of the goo that gives lipstick its stick,
according to authors Meg Cohen Ragas and Karen Kozlowski in the
recently released Read My Lips, a cultural history of the painted
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Cleopatra slathered henna on her lips to woo the
boys, most women haven't been content without a little color _ even
though lipstick was once outlawed, first for being provocative,
then for being poisonous. And even though a '96 survey by Shiseido
Cosmetics revealed that 54percent of men say women should ditch the
stuff because it's messy.
</P>
<P>
   A clean collar over a gorgeous gal? Come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lipstick is to the face what punctuation is to a sentence,''
says designer Diane Von Furstenberg (who carries a silver bullet of
MAC ``3-D'' in her purse). ``It says a lot about the intent of `the
author.'''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot about personal style. A mouth coated with Cover Girl
clear gloss speaks as loudly as one lacquered with L'Oreal
``Drumbeat Red.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire makeup industry developed around lipstick,'' says
Jean Ford Danielson, co-founder of BeneFit Cosmetics. ``Not around
eye shadow or cheek color, but lipstick.''
</P>
<P>
   (Danielson, by the way, named one of her lipsticks ``But,
Officer'' because she'd just gotten out of traffic school, notes
Read My Lips.)
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's today's collagen-fueled fetish for large lips, a
la model Esther Canadas, who pouts in DKNY ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years they've become very desirable,'' says model
Tyra Banks in her book Tyra's Beauty Inside &AMP; Out. ``I know a lot
of women who have spent a fortune trying to plump theirs up with
cosmetic surgery, so if you are blessed with full lips, make the
most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With lipstick, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is a salute to the totally tubular cosmetic that
started it all thousands of years ago. And to a future so bright,
we've gotta wear shades _ of ``Spice,'' ``Vamp,'' ``Toast of New
York,'' ``Cherries in the Snow''...
</P>
<P>
   LIPSTICK: IT WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY
</P>
<P>
   69-30 B.C. _ Cleopatra paints her lips with henna and carmine.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth century _ Lip rouge is the rage among prostitutes and the
lower class in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   13th century _ Lipstick becomes fashionable among all classes,
but society gals prefer bright pink to the masses' less
sophisticated earth-tone red.
</P>
<P>
   17th century _ In Paris, even nuns are spotted with painted
mouths (heavens!), and lipstick is denounced by the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   1770 _ British Parliament passes a law condemning lipstick and
stating that women who use makeup to seduce men into marriage can
be tried for witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   1781 _ The French slather on about two million pots of lip rouge
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1800s _ Repressed Victorians press red crepe paper to
their lips to create a rosy glow (although the rich could sneak off
to Paris for a pot of lip pomade by Guerlain, the first company to
produce commercially successful lipstick).
</P>
<P>
   1860s _ Makeup becomes more accepted around the world, and
cosmetics experts, called ``enamelers,'' pop up en masse.
</P>
<P>
   1897 _ The Sears Roebuck catalog offers 50-cent rouge, ``a
harmless preparation for giving color to the cheeks and lips.''
</P>
<P>
   1915 _ Maurice Levy designs the first American lipstick in a
sliding metal tube.
</P>

   TIPS FROM THE PROS
</P>
<P>
   TYRA BANKS: ``I prefer flavored lip gloss to any kind of
lipstick. Sometimes people say, `Tyra, that shiny lip gloss look
went out years ago,' but I like it, and I'm gonna keep on wearing
it. When I was younger, my friends and I bought every flavor _ from
watermelon and strawberry to bubble gum, and I guess I haven't
outgrown that. If you want a look that's a little more
sophisticated, you can always layer on lip gloss over lipstick. I
don't believe in lipstick rules.''
</P>
<P>
   TYRA'S TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Beware of in-store testers. If there aren't individual samples
available, ask the salesperson if she keeps alcohol at the counter.
Have her disinfect the tip of the tester, then wipe with a tissue
before you try it out. If there's no alcohol, your best bet is to
test the color on the back of your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Don't smack your lips together because that tends to make the
lipstick go outside your lip line.
</P>
<P>
   CINDY CRAWFORD: ``Lipstick is the one thing I sometimes get
trendy about. Not only is it quick and easy to change, but trying
on different colors is fun. I'm a firm believer that lipstick
should match your mood and not your clothes. Everything else can
remain unchanged _ your dress, hair, other makeup _ but add a new
lipstick and nothing feels quite the same. A change of lipstick can
transform the face, and in the process, your whole attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   CINDY'S TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Makeup artists often create their own lipstick by combining
several shades. Buy a pill-per-day box from a drugstore and insert
cut-off pieces of lipstick in each little compartment to create
your own colors.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid getting lipstick on your teeth, stick forefinger in
mouth, close lips around it and pull finger out. Any excess should
come off on your finger.
</P>
<P>
   To change a creamy gloss to a matte color, simply blot with
loose powder. Or you can separate a tissue, press one layer on your
lips, and apply powder on top of the tissue _ a doubly whammy.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBI BROWN: ``If I had to teach someone just one thing about
lip color it would be this: Find a lipstick that looks good on your
face when you're wearing absolutely no makeup. This is the magic
color that will make your skin, hair and eyes look their best. By
definition, it will be a lip-toned color _ somewhere in the range
of brown-pink, nude, beige-pink or rosy brown.''
</P>
<P>
   BOBBI'S TIPS
</P>
<P>
   A lip brush is necessary when applying deeper shades _ red,
plum, burgundy _ any color that's in big contrast to your natural
lip tone. A brush allows a richer, more accurate application of
color.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a lip pencil that's the same color as your lipstick or
one shade darker. For longer-lasting color, use a soft lip pencil
to fill in entire lip before applying lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the vampire look. Even if dark lips are the trend, fair
women almost never look pretty in purple or nearly black lipstick.
It's too high a contrast to their skin tone. (Women with darker
skin, however, can pull this off.)
</P>
<P>
   KEVYN AUCOIN: ``I guess I've always been fascinated with
lipstick because of its candylike appearance. I remember climbing
on our bathroom counter and opening the medicine chest in search of
my mom's orange lipstick. I decided to take a bite, and the waxy
texture yielded not a single iota of orange taste. I've learned a
lot about lipstick since then.''
</P>
<P>
   KEVYN'S TIPS
</P>
<P>
   For longer-lasting color: Put powder over the first coat of
lipstick, then apply another coat.
</P>
<P>
   To blot lips more evenly, separate a two-ply tissue and use one
sheet at a time. Blot lips, then reapply lipstick, then blot again.
This absorbs excess oil and leaves the pigment.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to reshape the mouth, a bit of concealer covering
the natural lip line will help make the finished shape look more
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   THE EYES HAVE IT: WHAT COLOR LIPSTICK SHOULD YOU WEAR?
</P>
<P>
   Beauty guru Gale Hayman _ co-founder of Giorgio of Beverly Hills
and creator of her own makeup line _ says eye color is your best
clue:
</P>
<P>
   Blue/gray eyes: Choose lipstick colors with blue or mauve
undertones, neutrals with rose and mauve undertones, light pink to
fuchsia, peaches and reds (light to dark reds with blue
undertones).
</P>
<P>
   Brown eyes: Choose colors with yellow, orange or brown
undertones, orange to terra cotta, corals and reds (medium to dark
reds with yellow or brown undertones) and warm neutrals. No mauve
or blue undertones.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel/green eyes: Choose colors with burgundy or brown
undertones, neutrals with brown or rose undertones, medium pinks
with rose undertones and reds (light to medium with brown
undertones).
</P>
<P>
   A LIPSTICK LEXICON
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is, different types of lipstick are like different
types of paint finishes:
</P>
<P>
   Creme _ The most popular finish for its balance of shine and
texture. Added oil provides a tad more sheen than matte, but not as
much glisten as gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Gloss _ Lots of emollients (like oil) mean high shine, low
color. Because it's made with softer wax, it's likely to be
packaged in a pot instead of a stick. A more natural alternative to
creme and matte.
</P>
<P>
   Liner _ Contains less emollient and more wax than regular
lipstick so is used to outline the mouth and help prevent lipstick
from ``bleeding'' onto the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Long lasting (i.e., Revlon's ColorStay brand) _ Lipstick that
can survive a kiss or cup of coffee because it contains silicone
oil, which acts as a sealer.
</P>
<P>
   Matte _ Heavy in wax and pigment but light in emollients, matte
provides a lot of texture without shine. Usually wears longer than
average lipstick. Today's versions are less cakey and dry, thanks
to added moisturizers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer _ Subtle formula with a lot of oil and a medium amount of
wax. Similar to a gloss but with a little more color.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmer _ The '90s version of the '70s frost. Extra glimmer
comes from mica or silica particles (or even ground fish scales).

 &HT;    The Prince of Animation?
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jeffrey Katzenberg crooks his index
finger to meet his thumb, forming a zero.
</P>
<P>
   He has just been asked, for the umpteenth time in his trek
across the country promoting ``The Prince of Egypt,'' how many
people are waiting for a feature-length cartoon about the story of
Moses and the Jews' exodus from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Zero, he indicates again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to do a study to know that,'' says the
bespectacled, smartly tailored movie studio executive as he fields
reporters' questions at a trendy Miami Beach hotel. ``We didn't
have to go out and ask anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He raises his voice, suddenly amused by the thought of such a
survey. ``All those people who are interested in an animated Bible
story, raise your hand.'' Pause. ``Anyone? Any takers, anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, the ``K'' of DreamWorks SKG, the upstart production
company that he partners alongside director Steven Spielberg and
record producer David Geffen, is betting his reputation as an
animation prophet on ``The Prince of Egypt.'' After leaving Disney,
where he shepherded such blockbusters as ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King,'' but was refused the job of president and
chief operating officer by Chairman Michael Eisner, Katzenberg
desperately wants to beat his former colleagues at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he releases his $70 million animated remake of ``The
Ten Commandments'' in more than 1,000 theaters worldwide _ as he
will Friday _ and moviegoers shrug?
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old college dropout can recall with great clarity
the moment the idea struck, soon after DreamWorks was founded in
October 1994. ``Steven and David and I were talking about what my
larger goals were for animation,'' Katzenberg says. Having worked
for years in a Mouse Factory where you could make any type of
cartoon, as long as it was a fairy tale, he yearned to stretch into
new territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to Steven that day, `I'd like to do a movie like
`Raiders of the Lost Ark,' a big action hero story. I'd love to do
a science fiction action movie, like `Terminator 2.' And I said,
`I'd love to do something with sort of an epic scale and the
personal intimacy that David Lean did in `Lawrence of Arabia.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And as soon as I said that, he said, `Good, you ought to do
`The Ten Commandments.' It was his idea. I didn't sell him, he sold
me,'' says Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ after four long years caused by DreamWorks' start-up
pains, labor-intensive animation by 380 artists and extreme efforts
to consult a raft of experts _ he has to sell the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story of Moses is one of the most remarkable
stories of all time,'' he says with practiced delivery. ``It has
been told and retold and retold again for 3,000 years.'' It's the
tale of a Jewish baby raised by Egyptian royalty, until he learns
his true heritage and persuades the pharaoh Rameses II into letting
him lead his people out of bondage to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The lively, serious and spiritual Prince of Egypt is hardly a
warm and fuzzy cartoon. But, curiously enough, it began with
elements of the box office-tested Disney formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started making your typical animated film,'' concedes
Brenda Chapman, one of the movie's three directors. ``We had a
kitty for Rameses, we had dogs for Moses, we had a sidekick valet
comic character for Moses, a confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we screened the first act, probably six months or so into
the project, we realized _ y'know what? _ we didn't want to make
the wacky Moses movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how jarring it was,'' says Katzenberg of the
comic shtick.
</P>
<P>
   Before it ever got to full animation, revisions were made in the
direction of reverence. ``A camel is like the funniest animal
you'll ever see, and we had this great camel,'' says co-producer
Penney Finkelman Cox. ``But you know, the story had this integrity,
and we couldn't violate it.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Disney animated features, the voice talent includes some
of Hollywood's bankable stars. Val Kilmer is cast as Moses, pitted
against Ralph Fiennes as Rameses. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Moses'
wife Tzipporah, while Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum are his
sister and brother, Miriam and Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   To Katzenberg, the voices were a critical element, because they
had to invest the characters with enough feeling to stop moviegoers
from thinking of them as cartoons. ``We didn't need this talent
because they're superstars, we needed them because they're the
best,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then an appropriate, anti-Disney visual style was devised, an
angular, adult look which suggests live action. ``What we came to
call it is a painted reality, a painted realism,'' says Katzenberg.
``It's either a painting that's been brought to life, which is the
way I choose to describe it, or it's life that's been painted. I
hope that 20 seconds into that movie, when those characters start
talking and moving, you actually relate to them as human beings.
You don't think of them as cartoony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' takes 3-D computer graphics imaging
further than previously possible. ``We used state of the art visual
tools that weren't even available four years ago,'' beams
Katzenberg. ``They were designed for this movie, to allow our
camera to go in and see, so you as the audience are not standing
outside looking, as you are with a traditional cartoon. When you
move around those characters like we do, at the marketplace with
Miriam and Moses and Aaron, they come to life, they become
dimensional to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The dimensional look was necessary to match a dramatic,
involving storyline. Sometimes that meant diverging from the Bible
or filling in events it never specified. ``For instance, nobody
knows what the relationship was between Moses and Rameses in the
palace,'' notes Katzenberg. ``Maybe they were raised as brothers.
Maybe they weren't.'' So the screenwriters felt comfortable
building their tale around a friendly sibling rivalry that grows
into a chasm once Moses realizes he is a Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age years of Moses and Rameses are skipped in Cecil B.
DeMille's 1956 epic movie, which Katzenberg ordered his filmmakers
to avoid. ``You'd either try and do something different from what
they did, to make sure that you were different, or it leaves an
image in your mind that you don't know how to get away from,''
explains Katzenberg. ``It is incredibly corrupting on both
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg gets high marks from the movie's creative team for
his involvement. ``He's got a really good story sense, which is
unusual for an executive,'' says Chapman. ``That's a huge reason
why I came over from Disney to work with him, because I grew to
respect his judgment. His strength, I think, is being able to stand
back and look at the whole and make a general statement of what's
not working for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points throughout the movie's development, Katzenberg
invited some 685 experts, scientists, theologians, scholars and
faith leaders to view the work-in-progress. ``We went out and spent
an unbelievable amount of effort and resources getting this to the
point where it was faithful and it was accurate,'' says Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   These visitors were questioned extensively about what they saw
in the film, particularly for erroneous details. In an early
version, Moses stomped on a glass at the end of his wedding
ceremony. It was a great visual representation of a Jewish ritual,
but an anachronistic one, Katzenberg learned. The ritual symbolizes
the destruction of the first temple, which occurred a thousand
years after the life of Moses. Out it went from the film.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that had never seen eye-to-eye watched ``The Prince of
Egypt'' and found themselves suddenly in accord. ``At one point, we
got the leadership of the Conservative, the Reformed and Orthodox
Jewish faiths in a room together,'' says Cox. ``And they said
they'd never been in a room together, they've never agreed on
anything, except the way they responded to the movie. They were so
overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has arisen over these seeming attempts to gain
endorsements from religious leaders, ranging from Vatican cardinals
to the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Although DreamWorks spent millions to
avoid any group taking offense _ as happened with Disney's Aladdin
and Pocahontas _ Katzenberg is still bracing for protests. ``I
would actually be kind of surprised if it didn't,'' he says.
``Wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg is certainly taking precautions against pranks
embedded in the film, as happened in other animated features. ``We
literally had a team of five or six people whose job it was to go
with a magnifying glass and look at every frame of everything in
this movie,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if The Prince of Egypt is so mischief-free and biblically
reverent that it might be suitable for toddlers, they were never
the target audience. ``I wouldn't take a 4-year-old to this movie,
because I just don't think they'll understand it,'' says
Katzenberg. ``I think some of the complexities of the story, some
of the ideas and stuff, they'd just go over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie carries a PG rating, which the filmmakers expected all
along. ``Jeffrey has often said he would have asked for it if he
hadn't gotten it,'' adds Cox. ``Because we felt it's appropriate to
say, `Parents, you need to evaluate this for your children.'''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you sell the movie to grown-ups? ``It's a challenge,
because we have to convince a huge number of people who think, `Oh,
animation. That's a kiddie flick. That's a cartoon','' says Cox.
``It's not just for kiddies and the parents that they drag along.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, how do you sell a cartoon without the traditional
marketing tie-ins? ``There's no merchandise, no toys, no lunch
pails,'' says Katzenberg, who says ``Red Sea shower curtains'' and
the like would have been inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he has approved not one, but three CDs of the movie's
Stephen Schwartz songs (including a big Whitney Houston-Mariah
Carey duet) and a library shelf of books inspired by the movie. And
a deal has been struck with Wal-Mart stores to sell a gift package
of a book, a recording and two tickets to ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   And Katzenberg is doing a lot of publicity globe-trotting,
something you rarely see from studio executives, but crucial to
promoting what he admits is a difficult movie. If ``The Prince of
Egypt'' helps break Disney's hammerlock on the animation market,
that will be an extra bit of satisfaction for Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   His legal battle with Disney over severance pay gained him a
judgment _ though not yet a payment _ estimated to be more than
$100 million. And Disney officials tried to dilute his reputation
and downplay his contributions to its animation successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit to having a couple of months that were very hard
for me on a personal level, not understanding how you could give as
much of yourself to someone and to an organization, and then have
them try and kill you,'' Katzenberg says.
</P>
<P>
   He genially claims that he's not a vindictive man. But he knows
the effect a successful movie would have on Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you, nothing will pain them more _ nothing _ than
if this movie went out and did a trillion dollars. For somebody who
wants them to get some religion, that would do it.

 &HT;    Anthologies of 2Pac, Bone Thugs dispense with the usual
throwaway tracks
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There isn't a hip-hop album out there that
doesn't have at least two or three throwaway tracks on it. It's
part of hip-hop's singles-driven philosophy. Rather than creating
unified albums, rappers concentrate on singular blasts of energy
and rhythm that make one song stand out. Inevitably, though, some
tracks even fail to stand up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why greatest-hits albums work so well for hip-hop
artists, and why new compilations from Tupac Shakur and Bone
Thugs-n-Harmony qualify as each artist's definitive effort. For
Cleveland's R&AMP;B-flavored Thugs, ``The Collection, Vol. 1'' serves
as a grab bag of the various singles, soundtrack contributions and
worthwhile oddities the quartet has offered since its 1994 debut.
For 2Pac (Shakur's rap moniker), ``Greatest Hits'' proves that the
slain West Coast hip-hop icon wasn't just immortalized after his
1996 murder _ he had found his place in history long before it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams,'' Shakur
reminds us of his real-life situation on ``God Bless the Dead,''
one of two previously unreleased tracks on the two-disc, 25-track
collection. With the opening call-out, ``Rest in peace to my
brother, Biggie Smalls,'' and several other references to the
rapper better known as Notorious B.I.G. _ who was slain six months
after Shakur _ ``God Bless the Dead'' proves 2Pac to be a prophet,
a walking ghost or just another rapper too caught up in gangsta
posturing. Indeed, ``Hit 'Em Up,'' which came out before Shakur's
death and includes all kinds of inane threats to Smalls and the Bad
Boy Records crew, suggests the latter.
</P>
<P>
   2Pac's ``Greatest Hits'' is hardly all about gangstaism, though.
Shakur had a softer, vulnerable side that, along with the charisma
he demonstrated as an actor, made him beloved by millions.
``Unconditional Love,'' ``Keep Ya Head Up'' and, of course, ``Dear
Mama'' all show this. What's more, he and his production crew
created some of the best hip-hop sound-spaces this side of Public
Enemy, with ``How Do U Want It,'' ``2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted''
and, especially, ``California Love'' offering the proof here.
</P>
<P>
   With tracks from all seven of his albums, including the Makaveli
disc, 2Pac's ``Greatest Hits'' truly is the best of one of the best
there ever was. Or, if you buy the rumors (see related story) the
best there still is.
</P>
<P>
   Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's ``The Collection'' is certainly less
monumental or called for, but for fans of the fast-rapping,
slow-grooving foursome, it offers a condensed version of the
quartet's widespread appeal. Clearly, it's easier to get through
than last year's two-disc ``Art of War,'' from which the fiery
``Body Rott'' is taken. Original versions of ``Foe the Love of $''
(featuring the group's late mentor Eazy E), ``Crossroad'' and ``1st
of Tha Month'' show the Thugs' unique rap power and strong grooves,
while ``War'' (with Henry Rollins) and ``Thuggish Ruggish Bone''
demonstrate their adventurous spirit. Best of all, there's nary a
throwaway between them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the least likely musical pairings pay the greatest
artistic dividends. Take ``River Man,'' the cello-shaded
centerpiece of ``Shades of Bey.'' It was written by Nick Drake, a
fragile British folksinger who died in 1974 at age 26 from an
overdose of anti-depressants. Almost a quarter of a century later,
it is given exquisitely sonorous voice by an African American jazz
singer in his late 50s, whose style fell from fashion around the
time that Drake's creative star was rising.
</P>
<P>
   Though Andy Bey hadn't recorded as a band leader in more than
two decades before his re-emergence in 1996 with ``Ballads, Blues &AMP;
Bey,'' this superb follow-up finds him making up for lost time.
There's a tragic sense of life at the heart of his bittersweet art,
a tender sadness that suffuses his romantic balladry _ a
recognition that desire, like life itself, is a flicker.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to conjure a deeper shade of blue than that expressed
through Bey's reading of Billy Strayhorn's ``The Last Light of
Evening (Blood Count),'' where the midnight of the soul offers the
faintest hope of dawn. From the time-stopping elegance of Duke
Ellington's ``Pretty Girl (The Starcrossed Lovers)'' to the sensual
persistence of the Brazilian-tinged ``Like a Lover'' and ``Drume
Negrita,'' the subtle spareness of the arrangements makes Bey's
limber, supple baritone and unearthly falsetto sound all the
richer.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with Bey's sophisticated balladry and the
supper-club bluesiness of his piano playing, the two up-tempo cuts
sound more like scat-and-jive exercises that skirt the emotional
surface, as Thelonious Monk's ``Get It Straight (Straight, No
Chaser)'' mainly provides a workout for the rhythm section and
``Believin' It (Half &AMP; Half)'' leaves the singer a little
breathless. Yet the album as a whole is so deeply reflective of
life's experience that it seems that Bey's hiatus from recording
was well spent; it's hard to imagine the Andy Bey of the '60s or
'70s achieving anything this profound.

This year our enthusiastic volunteers share their favorites among

   `Celebrity Caricature in America'
</P>
<P>
   By Wendy Wick Reaves
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Press, $45
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of caricature can savor a handsome sampling from
America's golden age of that pointed art in ``Celebrity Caricature
in America,'' a hardback catalog of a wide-ranging 1998 exhibit
from the National Portrait Gallery. More than 300 illustrations and
a lively text by curator Wendy Reaves trace the art from the end of
the 19th century to the middle of the 20th, including masters such
as Al Frueh, Ralph Barton, Al Hirschfeld and, perhaps the greatest
of all, Miguel Covarrubias. It's a well-crafted collection that
captures the brilliance of the art as well as the spirit of the
times.

<P>
   Prestel, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be an architectural expert to enjoy this
coffee table book, which takes a look at the most significant
designs of this century. Through drawings, stunning photography and
essays, readers get insight into the stories behind the buildings,
from the original ideas to the technological innovation that
created them. A few notables include the World Trade Center in New
York City, Sears Tower in Chicago, village of Seaside in Florida,
Peace Center in Hiroshima, and Guggenheim Museum in Spain. The
essays are not always flattering _ sometimes the architecture is
highly criticized _ -- ut the buildings chosen are spectacular in
their own way.

   If you've ever toured Bayou Bend, the home of the late Miss Ima
Hogg in Houston, you will appreciate this book. But you may not
appreciate it any more than those who have never been inside but
long to know more about American furniture and art, and the
discerning taste of this unique individual. Miss Hogg, the daughter
of a Texas governor, bought her first piece of colonial American
furniture in 1920 and collected Americana for more than 50 years.
Read this richly illustrated catalog of her collection, and
discover paintings by John Singleton Copley and Gilbert Stuart,
metalwork by Paul Revere, and lovely quilts by unknown artists.
More than 1,100 items in all; a treasure.

what the English teacher ordered. The 4,500 color images are very
helpful (e.g. _ a silicon crystal, Japanese quail, a lacrosse
field). There are even photos of binding knots like the timber
hitch and gastropods such as the great pond snail. This is a keeper
volume for anyone, any age.

   `Perennial Gardens for Texas'
</P>
<P>
   By Julie Ryan
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas Press, $27.95 (paperback)
</P>
<P>
   For gardeners who love the annual reappearance of shoots and
buds, there's nothing quite like the perennial garden. But Texas,
with its numerous climatic zones, isn't the easiest place to design
and plant a garden that will flourish year in and year out.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Julie Ryan steps in. With regional analyses,
detailed charts, beautiful photos and a wealth of description, the
Dallas writer and photographer provides high-quality guidance for
novices and green thumbs alike. It's a book that any serious
gardener would welcome warmly.

   This 240-page revised edition provides the most up-to-date
geographical information on the vast continent that has undergone
several changes since 1981. The book's 96 maps are the heart of
this atlas, but there is considerable text on the 55 nations'

   `America's Lost Treasure'
</P>
<P>
   By Tommy Thompson
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Monthly Press, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the California Gold Rush madness, a mighty ship
loaded with fortune sank off the Carolinas in a nasty hurricane.
The 1857 tragedy, which claimed 425 lives, was America's worst
peacetime sea disaster. It also swallowed the contents of a gold
mine, impossible to recover.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, engineer extraordinaire Tommy Thompson assembled a
crew of scientists, engineers, explorers and historians determined
to reclaim the national treasure. Thirteen years later, Thompson
has captured the eerie beauty of a golden harvest in 8,000 feet of
water with the newest photographic technology. Loaded with more
than 250 photos and illustrations, Thompson's accounts of the
successful mission should appeal to a diverse audience, whether
they read the best-selling ``Ship of Gold'' or not.

   `The Complete Bible Handbook'
</P>
<P>
   By John Bowker
</P>
<P>
   DK Publishing, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   No other text has had so great an influence in the world as the
Bible, says John Bowker, professor of divinity at Gresham College
in London. In addition to being a source of religious history, the
Bible has been an inspiration for literature, music and art. Yet,
for all its popularity, it is not easy to understand. Hence the
need for for commentaries like Bowker's handbook, an impressive
500-page book packed with 500 color illustrations and glossaries of
people and places.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into Old and New Testaments and references, with an
extensive bibliography, the nondenominational book is succinct,
easy to use and attractively designed. In addition to commentaries
of familiar biblical passages, there are specific discussions on
birds and plants in the Bible, women in ancient Israel, burial
practices, trade and travel in New Testament times, and maps of
biblical sites as they are today.

   `Bruce Springsteen: Songs'
</P>
<P>
   By Bruce Springsteen
</P>
<P>
   Avon Books, $50
</P>
<P>
   Fans will be delighted with ``Songs,'' which holds the complete
collection of Springsteen's recorded album lyrics over 25 years. At
the beginning of each section, Springsteen writes about the
thoughts and experiences that led him to create his works of art.
He discusses searching for tone, the atmosphere in the studio and
being inspired by authors (Flannery O'Connor) and film (Terrence
Malick's ``Badlands''). Plenty of personal photographs dot the
book, as well as reproductions of handwritten sheets where he
drafted songs or titles.

</P>
<P>
   By Maria Longhena
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $60
</P>
<P>
   In this book, the author presents the glory and collapse of
several civilizations that flourished in Mesoamerica between the
middle of the second millennium B.C. to the 16th century. It
includes not only the Olmecs, Mayas and Aztecs, but also several
other cultures that developed highly sophisticated art forms,
writing systems and complex mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the illustrations that are the forte of this coffee
table book. With beautiful images of arch-- eological sites and
findings, the pleasure of flipping through the pages is
indescribable. The drawings that reconstruct cities and temples
provide an insight into these people who left us with an incredible
wealth of artifacts that assure us of their significance in
history.

   Star Wars fans can't wait until May, when ``Episode I: The

Until then, they have to satisfy themselves with the trailer for

but probably aimed at adults, the shiny, glossy, slim volumes are
packed with photographs and diagrams fans will adore.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that band playing in the cantina in ``Star Wars?'' You
can find out the name of the band _ Figrin D'An and the Modal Nodes
_ as well as the names of all their instruments (ploong sounder,
peel rod, fanfar, kloo horn). And anybody who used to play with
X-wing fighters as a kid will like the cross-section of the plane,
containing everything from the proton warhead to the laser cannon.

   `Values of the Game'
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Bradley
</P>
<P>
   Artisan, $30
</P>
<P>
   Forget the NBA lockout. Forget the selfishness and greed that
has crippled the best players of the sport. In ``Values of the
Game,'' ex-Knicks star Bill Bradley explains why basketball still
matters. In 10 essays complemented with photographs of past and
present NBA legends, Bradley reflects on such values as teamwork,
discipline, passion, courage and imagination. His musings mix the
insight of a two-time NBA champion with the eloquence befitting a
Rhodes scholar and former U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world full of unrealized dreams and baffling
entanglements, basketball seems pure,'' Bradley writes in his
introduction. ``We know, of course, that it isn't. It has its own
share of greed, violence and obsession with the culture of
entertainment. Yet even in the midst of these distractions, there
is still the game.'' Amen.

   This book is outstanding both in text and illustrations.
Ambrose, author of ``Undaunted Courage,'' provides a shorter, but
informative, text about the Lewis and Clark expedition from St.
Louis up the Missouri River to the mouth of the Columbia River, and
return. There are reproductions of Karl Bodimer paintings of the
Indians, copies of maps by William Clark and others, and perfectly
composed and lighted photographs of scenes along the explorers'
route in 1803-1806. A treat for the mind and the eye.

</P>
<P>
   By Kraus Reichold and Bernard Graf
</P>
<P>
   Prestel, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   The ability to translate a vast array of feelings and emotions,
state of mind and sensibilities through the arrangement of colors,
brush strokes and shapes is the gift of the artist. Since time
immemorial people have painted on cave walls, tree bark, house
walls, paper, canvases.
</P>
<P>
   In this book, Kraus Reichold and Bernard Graf review the history
of painting, and to some extent the history of ideas, through
representative art works. The authors provide an opportunity to art
lovers and history aficionados alike to appreciate the importance
of the artwork and its creator. Spanning the history of art from
cave paintings to Andy Warhol, this coffee table book is a
beautiful source of entertainment and information.

<P>
   Introduction by John Updike
</P>
<P>
   Artisan, $50
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between cartoon and fine art lies the weird and quirky
world of William Steig. You can witness his evolution as an artist
in this volume, which reproduces more than 400 illustrations in
black-and-white and color from Steig's 70-year career. (He's
currently 90.)
</P>
<P>
   I loved his New Yorker covers and cartoons, sent Christmas cards
made from his designs, and read to my children ``Sylvester and the
Magic Pebble,'' for which he won the Caldecott Award. I find the
pictures in this book endlessly entertaining, the text interesting.

elephant, the mixed-up Amelia Bedelia, Madeline the schoolgirl, and
Alexander, the boy who had a ``terrible, horrible, no good, very
bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Are your old copies of ``Harry the Dirty Dog'' by Gene Zion
(1956) or ``A Chair for My Mother'' by Vera B. Williams (1982) worn
and tattered beyond use? You'll find ``Harry'' and ``Chair'' here,
too, spiffed up and begging for your lap again.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman has selected read-aloud favorites for this keepsake,
taking care to offer a nice balance of stories for a variety of
ages. Included are most of the books' original illustrations,
created by sterling talents such as Maurice Sendak, William Steig,
Lane Smith, Jan Pienkowski and Mercer Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of scope, breadth and quality, this 305-page volume
truly is a treasure. And if you enjoy compilations, you also might
consider ``A Family Treasury of Myths From Around the World'' by
Viviane Koenig, illustrated by Koenig, Veronique Ageorges and
Daniel Henon, translated by Anthony Zielonka. (Harry N. Abrams,
ages 9 and up, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   Striking, original art enhances this collection of 10 myths.
</P>
<P>
   Also new in stores:
</P>
<P>
   _ AGES 4-8: ``Music Over Manhattan'' by Mark Karlins,
illustrated by Jack E. Davis (Doubleday, $15.95). The text is flat
and twice as long as it needs to be for this ditty about Bernie
learning to play the trumpet. On the other hand, the art is
bursting with wit, personality and zany relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ AGES 8 AND UP: ``Laura's Album'' by William Anderson
(HarperCollins, $19.95). Anyone who treasures the ``Little House''
books should know about this dandy addition for the bookshelf.
Historian Anderson has combed public and private collections to
assemble an intimate 80-page biography based on the life of Laura
Ingalls Wilder. It turns out that Wilder was a pack rat who saved
everything from church programs and greeting cards to childhood
drawings and routine personal correspondence. The scrapbook-style
layout, filled with rare photographs and mementos, makes this a
real gem for fans.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALL AGES: ``A World of Words: An ABC of Quotations'' by Tobi
Tobias, illustrated by Peter Malone (Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard, $16).
The alphabet is treated to glorious illustrations and 26 quotations
from famous writers. For example, ``P'' is for ``Pocket,'' and the
quote is from D.H. Lawrence: ``You love me so much, you want to put
me in your pocket.'' The illustration is of a girl sharing her
orange with a kangaroo mama, who in turn shares it with the 'roo in
her pocket. Among the quoted: Shakespeare, J.R.R. Tolkien, Carl
Sandburg, Edna St. Vincent Millay and e.e. cummings. And this from
Joel Chandler Harris on the ``F'' is for ``Fire'' page: ``Youk'n
hide de fier, but w'at you gwine do wid de smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ALL AGES: ``Bridges Are to Cross'' by Philemon Sturges,
illustrated by Giles Laroche (Putnam, $15.99). Learning about 15
exceptional bridges is less interesting than the magnificently
detailed ``paper sculpture'' illustrations of the bridges. The
artistic technique results in a vibrant three-dimensional look.

 &HT;    The 3 faces of news
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Viewers who flip from one network newscast to
another often see the same stories in the same order _ sometimes
with the exact same footage.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday at 5:30 p.m., ABC, CBS and NBC all began
their newscasts with updates about the impeachment hearings. Next
up was a story about this year's deadly hurricane season. On all
three newscasts. At the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference on most nights seems to be the anchors
introducing the stories. On ABC the ever-poised and
camera-comfortable Peter Jennings perches on a stool before a video
wall. On CBS, clench-jawed Dan Rather sits behind a desk looking
intently into the camera, while on NBC the easy-going Tom Brokaw
stands or sits before another, bigger video wall.
</P>
<P>
   Are the network newscasts, from which a vast majority of
Americans get their daily dose of news, really all the same except
for the famous men who front them? The short answer is yes, but the
long answer is there are some subtle and some not-so-subtle
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust of much of our commentary has been sameness,'' said
Janine Jackson, research director of Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting, a media watchdog group that monitors print and
electronic news reporting. ``Not every day, but generally we've
been struck by the similarities. There's not one that's
significantly better or worse. Each has certain features that are
good or not-so-good, but as far as the whole newscast, we don't see
one as standing out.''
</P>
<P>
   But viewers who flip from one network to another are likely to
see subtle differences. Rather, who often refers to himself in the
old-fashioned journalistic style as ``this reporter,'' likes to
give his newscast a newspaper feel. Sometimes he'll introduce a
story with, ``The headline this hour ...'' Jennings, perhaps
because of his clipped Canadian accent, comes off as cooler and
more conversational, while Brokaw seems like a laid-back insider.
The personalities of the anchors seem to spill into their
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Peterson, a typical viewer who is a retired flight attendant
and sports shop owner from San Marcos, has been watching ABC's news
for several years because she likes the way Jennings ``delivers the
news. ... He seems a lot more friendly and comfortable'' than the
other guys. She used to watch Brokaw but switched because she
didn't like his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought he seemed cocky,'' Peterson said. ``He didn't
seem warm or friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Ortiz, executive producer of ``The CBS Evening News,'' says
his anchor's characteristics are ``absolutely'' stamped on the
newscast. ``Dan Rather's personality and influence are all over
this broadcast. He's constantly reading, researching, reporting and
suggesting stories. He's very much engaged in helping steer the
broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tyndall Report, a weekly analysis of network newscasts by
former journalist Andrew Tyndall, supports the sameness theory of
network news in the top half of the programs but discounts it in
the second half. Tyndall also discounts the anchors' influence on
the substance of their respective newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These newscasts have all gone through different journalistic
styles over the years when the same anchors were in position,''
Tyndall said. ``There was a time when NBC was heavy on political
coverage, CBS had more lifestyle features and ABC was the leader in
foreign coverage. I'm sure Peter would like to continue to lead in
foreign coverage, but the fact that that no longer happens is
evidence that he doesn't have that much influence.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS now has slightly more foreign news than ABC and considerably
more than NBC.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do the three newscasts stack up today in terms of
content? Tyndall's research has shown that the first half of the
programs on all three networks is basically the same, dictated by
the major national and international news of the day. The three
programs tend to have the same top story lineups. For example, all
three networks focused on the Monica Lewinsky scandal this year,
with NBC covering it the most and CBS covering it the least.
</P>
<P>
   Features vary in style
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not talking about enormous differences,'' Tyndall
said. ``We're talking about tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyndall's analysis found that the main content differences among
the three newscasts comes after the second commercial, ``when the
features come in and the individual style of the network comes
out.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, Tyndall found, has more hard news all the way through its
newscast, including the second half. CBS's only designated feature
segment is the nightly ``Eye on America,'' which explores topics
related to current news stories, such as a recent piece on a family
that sued its HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to make it feel like a hard news broadcast,''
Ortiz said. ``But it can't just be a machine-gun wire service. It
has to show some thought, analysis and context. That's where 'Eye
on America' comes in. It helps us get the length of airtime to
develop a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Although all the networks have faced budget cutbacks and layoffs
at their foreign bureaus, Ortiz said CBS has fought hard to keep
foreign news on the newscast. And they do so despite surveys saying
viewers aren't particularly interested in foreign news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think viewers are interested in coming away feeling like
they've had some kind of authoritative report on the world around
them,'' Ortiz said. ``Most of that's going to be national, but we
do think it's important to find interesting foreign stories. It's
not necessarily the winning edge, but it does distinguish us from
the fare viewers see on our affiliates' local newscasts.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tyndall, NBC's ``Nightly News'' has more features
than the other newscasts, and they're showcased in regular segments
such as ``In-Depth,'' ``The Fleecing of America'' and ``In Their
Own Words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not skimping on the major stories,'' Tyndall added.
``Before the second commercial, NBC is covering hard news, but in
the bottom half, they overwhelmingly do features on the minor
stories, a lot of them lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings too close to call
</P>
<P>
   NBC News overtook ABC News in the ratings last year after an
eight-year dominance by ABC. But now the two find themselves in a
ratings race that's too close to call most weeks (ABC eked out a
win in November), and CBS is not far behind. NBC's executive
producer David Doss believes his broadcast's treatment of the news,
including special features, is a big reason people watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think of it in terms of features,'' Doss said. ``Our
'Fleecing of America' segments are investigative pieces about how
taxpayers' money is squandered. Tom Brokaw has an expression we all
use here, and that is we're not doing the news because it interests
the newsroom but because it's of vital interest to our audience.
... There are so many places for people to get information now that
it doesn't serve any real purpose for us to tell them what they
already know. So, we try to provide more context and explain what
it means, how it affects their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' according to Tyndall, has more
hard news than features but not as much hard news as CBS. ABC's
features in the second half of the broadcast tend to be ``more
abstract, things on the economy, high-tech stuff and the coming
millennium. They're more futuristic.'' Regular feature segments
include ``Close-up,'' ``It's Your Money'' and ``Reality Check.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another quirky thing about ABC is that their human interest
features often go to sports,'' Tyndall said. ``Perhaps because of
their tie-in to ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   With subtle differences in content and anchor style, one may
wonder what prompts viewers to choose a certain network newscast.
Some people instinctively watch the same network for years, while
others may change from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important factor turns out to be the local newscast
that airs before the network news,'' said Larry McGill, director of
research for the Media Studies Center, an education-based group run
by the Freedom Forum. ``The network newscast rating tends to be
close to the local lead-in. Typically all the network news can do
is gain or lose up to 5 percent of its local lead-in. Because the
network newscasts are all seen as similarly credible, it's an easy
decision for people to continue watching one network.''
</P>
<P>
   If people do switch, however, it's usually because of an anchor
preference. A survey in 1997 conducted by the Freedom Forum's
Newseum in Arlington, Va., found that NBC's Brokaw was favored by a
small majority, followed by Jennings and then Rather.
</P>
<P>
   ``All are usually seen as equally competent, knowledgeable and
experienced,'' McGill said. ``If anything differentiates them, it's
a perceived attractiveness and a more generalized likability.''
</P>
<P>
   The last big shift in network news viewing habits came about
when top-rated CBS slipped a couple of years after the
hard-charging Rather replaced the avuncular Walter Cronkite in
1981. Today the three newscasts are so close in the ratings that
half a rating point _ a mere 620,000 viewers _ separates them.
</P>
<P>
   CNN a distant fourth
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans still do watch evening newscasts. On an
average weeknight, 23.7 million TV households watch one of the
network news programs. Although there has been some audience
erosion in the past decade, it is minor compared to the losses in
prime-time entertainment. During a breaking news story, like a
plane crash or natural disaster, lots of people turn to CNN, but
for a regular news diet, they watch ABC, CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks' performance that has stayed potent the longest
and resisted erosion from cable the best is the network news,''
McGill said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have drifted away from the evening newscasts may have
done so for reasons other than journalistic style or content.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is we don't have as much of an attention span,''
McGill said. ``We're used to the fact that there are lots of
alternatives, so people are less patient in sitting through a
newscast. Another factor is we live in times when the need to
follow the news is not as pressing. We don't have a Cold War, and
we're not worried about some cataclysmic event. We can be kind of
blase and fill our time with amusements. That's why you see
newscasts going to more entertainment hooks, like the
Clinton-Lewinsky story that has been played up so much. It has all
these soap-opera elements.''
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of news hounds, dinner is always preceded by a
wrap-up of the day's events, brought to us by a member of the
likable trio of Tom, Peter and Dan.

 &HT;    Romanian trying to open country's libraries, society
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ She was born into a closed society, blacklisted
by the communists, scorned for studying foreign cultures and
repeatedly denied a passport. Her mission now: push her native
Romania to become more open.
</P>
<P>
   How do you change a country?
</P>
<P>
   Fulbright Scholar Hermina Anghelescu has ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Anghelescu, a doctoral student in library science at the
University of Texas, sees public libraries as a reflection of the
societies they serve. The more open a nation's libraries, the more
open the society.
</P>
<P>
   Romania has been struggling with openness since communism fell
in 1989. The country, along with its libraries, has a long way to
go, she said. Could she help the libraries advance by sharing her
knowledge of American libraries?
</P>
<P>
   That has been her goal since coming to UT in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a master's degree and with work under way on a
doctorate, Anghelescu asked the National Library of Romania in 1995
to host a training workshop for librarians. She had worked there
and was expected to return after her studies abroad. She would find
the money and organize a U.S. delegation of scholars and
professionals to teach Romanian librarians to be more professional
and to make their collections more open, more modern and easier for
the public to use.
</P>
<P>
   The library gave the go-ahead. But when she won a $15,000 grant
to make it happen, officials said no. She contacted other Romanian
libraries to see if they were interested. None responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the blue I receive an eight-line fax from the National
Library announcing that I was no longer affiliated with them. I was
fired,'' she wrote in her journal in June 1995. ``That was a common
strategy employed during the communist regime to let Romanians
living abroad know that they had become persona non grata.''
</P>
<P>
   She got the grant extended and solicited more Romanian
libraries. Two stepped forward in 1996, and Anghelescu has
coordinated training workshops each of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here is that she basically taught her country
about library science and she taught us about her country,'' said
Teresa Sullivan, UT's dean of graduate studies. ``It took a student
to put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   `A noxious element'
</P>
<P>
   It has not been easy to work with a country that blacklisted her
parents because they were well-to-do and were not members of the
Communist Party, Anghelescu, now 42, said. Romanian officials
remain skeptical of her and have intercepted mail to her mother,
including Christmas cards, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called a noxious element. If you were not a peasant, you
were not `of healthy origin,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents lost their property after World War II and moved in
with her father's parents. About the only thing they didn't lose
was her father's precious books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up surrounded by books,'' she said. ``My father had a
private library, 4,000 volumes. I remember sometimes my mother was
kidding with him, `If you were to choose between me and your
library, what would you choose?' I was just a little girl, and my
father would say, `My library.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hermina didn't realize he was joking. She knew he loved his
books, and the love was contagious. At age 7 she was reading so
well her parents hired a private tutor to teach her English and
French. She is fluent in both and also speaks Italian.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college in 1979, she used her language
skills to get a job at the National Library's international
exchange division.
</P>
<P>
   One night, she went to a Canadian exhibition in Bucharest
without reporting to her boss that she would be near foreigners.
Afterward, the secret police accosted her and ordered her to write
down everything that had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the mistake of breathing the same air with the Canadian
ambassador at the Canadian exhibition,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The police were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they would put me in prison,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. But the government constantly denied her a
passport. It considered her a defection risk.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to America
</P>
<P>
   She didn't get one until 1990, the same year she was named
international relations officer at the National Library. The
American cultural attache urged her to apply for a Fulbright
scholarship, which pays for Americans and foreigners to study
abroad. She won the prestigious scholarship and chose UT, attracted
by its national reputation in library science.
</P>
<P>
   She has been amazed by the school's support of her work and its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This library is wonderful,'' she said, strolling the aisles of
the Perry-Castaneda Library, one of the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libraries in Romania have closed stacks,'' she said, brushing
fingertips across the books. ``What we have here are open stacks.
That's an American concept.''
</P>
<P>
   She is sharing such concepts at the Romanian seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The workshops have made a difference, said state librarian
Robert Martin, who has taken two of the trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've expanded the horizons of the librarians who
participated, opened up new frontiers for them and given them new
ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Davis, a UT professor of library science and history,
considers the trips with Anghelescu, his teaching assistant,
highlights of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good lesson for us in humility,'' Davis said. ``We may
have a lot of resources in this country, but they've got a lot of
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The librarians in Romania are eager to learn, and UT faculty
have responded by paying their own way the past two trips, said
Brooke Sheldon, a library science professor and former dean of the
college.
</P>
<P>
   Serving her country
</P>
<P>
   Anghelescu ``is imbued with the essence of our profession, which
is service,'' Sheldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Anghelescu, a single mother of a 16-year-old, expects to
graduate in May. She can stay in the United States another 18
months, but after that, her student visa requires her to spend two
years in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   She said she will continue her work with the librarians but
worries she won't be as effective.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian officials ``like me when I come and go,'' she said.
``They don't like me when I stay there and teach American ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she leaves, she won't give up her mission. She loves her
country and blames ``the system'' for her painful past, not the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 28 years, and I have encountered a lot of
international students,'' Davis said. ``But I have not known any as
eager to return the benefits ... to her own country.''

 &HT;    HEALTH: Sickle cell patient gets cord blood transplant
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Medical history unfolded at Egleston Children's
Hospital on Friday at noon with the world's first cord blood
transplant for sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   As a syringe of dark, red blood plunged into the intravenous
line of Keone Penn, relatives and friends bowed their heads in
prayer and talked of miracles, cures and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   They also gently told the center of attention to wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Keone. God's working it out just like we said. Wake up
and see your miracle happening,'' said Beverly Kennedy, a close
friend of Leslie Penn, Keone's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Keone was sleepy from 10 days of chemotherapy to kill his
unhealthy bone marrow, and painkillers. But he awoke long enough to
help pediatric nurse practitioner Ellen Olson squeeze stem blood
cells into his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will know in three to four weeks if the transplant has
taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the transplant itself is kind of anticlimactic,''
admitted Leslie Penn. ``It's just a bag of blood dripping into
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the procedure work, it could help many severely ill
children with sickle cell anemia who do not have a relative with
matching bone marrow, as in the case of Keone.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow is the spongy liquid inside bones where blood cells
form and mature. The experimental procedure poses great risk
because the patient's immune-fighting white cells are wiped out,
leaving him open to infections.
</P>
<P>
   Since infancy, Keone has suffered numerous infections and a
stroke at age 5. He's received monthly blood transfusions the past
seven years. Without a transplant, doctors feared he would suffer a
second stroke or further complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protocol is ahead of its time,'' said Dr. Angela Ogden,
one of the Emory specialists treating Keone. ``But he's not your
typical sickle cell kid. Taking the additional risk ... is
acceptable in his case, until we know that umbilical cord
transplant will work for sickle cell. If it does, we can offer it
to kids with less severe disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Centerville boy, a seventh-grader at Gwinnett's
Shiloh Middle School, received the equivalent of about eight
tablespoons of stem cell blood. It came from an anonymous woman who
consented to have her placenta and umbilical cord donated to the
New York Blood Center.
</P>
<P>
   Rich in stem cells that grow into the three components of blood,
cord blood has been used in nearly 600 procedures around the world
in patients suffering from leukemia and other immune and genetic
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has never been tried on sickle cell disease, which
affects 70,000 people nationwide, most of whom are
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One hoped-for result of Keone's cord blood transplant is that
his blood type will slowly change from O to B, which will signal
the transplant is taking hold. His donor's type was B.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time. That's the next step,'' said Olson. ``The average is 28
days from the time we give them the stem cells until they form bone
marrow and start growing. What we'll do now is watch him for fevers
and put him on antibiotics.

 &HT;    HEALTH: Sickle cell patient gets cord blood transplant
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Medical history unfolded at Egleston Children's
Hospital on Friday at noon with the world's first cord blood
transplant for sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   As a syringe of dark, red blood plunged into the intravenous
line of Keone Penn, relatives and friends bowed their heads in
prayer and talked of miracles, cures and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   They also gently told the center of attention to wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Keone. God's working it out just like we said. Wake up
and see your miracle happening,'' said Beverly Kennedy, a close
friend of Leslie Penn, Keone's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Keone was sleepy from 10 days of chemotherapy to kill his
unhealthy bone marrow, and painkillers. But he awoke long enough to
help pediatric nurse practitioner Ellen Olson squeeze stem blood
cells into his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will know in three to four weeks if the transplant has
taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the transplant itself is kind of anticlimactic,''
admitted Leslie Penn. ``It's just a bag of blood dripping into
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the procedure work, it could help many severely ill
children with sickle cell anemia who do not have a relative with
matching bone marrow, as in the case of Keone.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow is the spongy liquid inside bones where blood cells
form and mature. The experimental procedure poses great risk
because the patient's immune-fighting white cells are wiped out,
leaving him open to infections.
</P>
<P>
   Since infancy, Keone has suffered numerous infections and a
stroke at age 5. He's received monthly blood transfusions the past
seven years. Without a transplant, doctors feared he would suffer a
second stroke or further complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protocol is ahead of its time,'' said Dr. Angela Ogden,
one of the Emory specialists treating Keone. ``But he's not your
typical sickle cell kid. Taking the additional risk ... is
acceptable in his case, until we know that umbilical cord
transplant will work for sickle cell. If it does, we can offer it
to kids with less severe disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Centerville boy, a seventh-grader at Gwinnett's
Shiloh Middle School, received the equivalent of about eight
tablespoons of stem cell blood. It came from an anonymous woman who
consented to have her placenta and umbilical cord donated to the
New York Blood Center.
</P>
<P>
   Rich in stem cells that grow into the three components of blood,
cord blood has been used in nearly 600 procedures around the world
in patients suffering from leukemia and other immune and genetic
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has never been tried on sickle cell disease, which
affects 70,000 people nationwide, most of whom are
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One hoped-for result of Keone's cord blood transplant is that
his blood type will slowly change from O to B, which will signal
the transplant is taking hold. His donor's type was B.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time. That's the next step,'' said Olson. ``The average is 28
days from the time we give them the stem cells until they form bone
marrow and start growing. What we'll do now is watch him for fevers
and put him on antibiotics.

 &HT;    A historic pony ride
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter whether you're a casual observer or an
enthusiast obsessed with the original pony car, there's only one
way to look at the 1999 Mustang: It's an enticing bridge between
the near-antediluvian 'Stang of the early and mid-'90s and the
totally rebuilt model coming soon into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This Mustang boasts refined engines, noticeably better
performance, styling updates that prevent staleness, and driving
characteristics that should manage to please both performance
addicts and just-transport-me drivers. Rev its nicely growly
engine, make sure the front wheels are in line with that visually
pleasing long hood, drop the clutch and this Mustang briskly
launches driving fun.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which inadvertently birthed the term ``pony car'' when it
introduced the 1964 1/2 Mustang, is marking time with the '99
models, but that doesn't mean they won't sell. The edgy styling,
increased horsepower for both V-6 and V-8 engines and interior
refinements should team with pricing to help the Mustang keep
annual sales convincingly above the 100,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-production test V-6 coupe arrived with a base price of
$16,995 that includes delivery. The V-6 convertible is based at
$21,595 with the V-8-powered GT at $21,395 and the convertible GT
at $25,395. Prices for the hopped-up Cobra Mustang _ a
320-horsepower tire-shredder _ will be announced early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Most option prices for the base and GT versions were still being
set at press time, but all-speed traction control will list for
$230 with a convenience package combining a six-way power driver's
seat, rear defroster, cruise control and front floor mats costing
$550. Although the '99 went into production Nov. 2, prices are just
now coming because the big advertising launch is to hit next week.
</P>
<P>
   There is some noteworthy irony packaged with the new Mustang. It
was only a few years ago that Ford was leaning toward easing out
the Mustang in favor of the import-fighting Probe. Now Ford is
catering to the Mustang faithful by introducing the '99 in
Nashville during a Mustang Club of America meeting and by
earmarking a $1.5 million donation as seed money for the $30
million Mustang museum, which will be built in metro Atlanta or
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the museum goes, the '99 Mustang will rate a
prominent place. Historians will point to that long hood and
trapezoidal rear that gives it a chunky, low-centered look and the
mix of rounded lines and creases and pronounce it ``good looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Older enthusiasts who'll remember driving the base V-6, which
gets its horsepower upped by 40 to 190 (the V-6 jumps from 225 hp
to 260), will recall how the switchable traction control permits a
bit of wheelspin during a high-revving start, but then cuts the
power or applies the rear brakes to put a stop to that nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will remember the nice feel of an air-conditioned
two-cockpit cabin with brown and gray plastic, good console drink
holders, storage and rounded dash, the high-end stereo with CD
player and controls centered between the driver and passenger, and
the body-fitting, easily adjusted bucket seats. The poor souls who
had to ride in the rear will still be whining.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomics are basically simple _ no clutter or redundancy
here _ and convenient, although the switch for the optional rear
defroster is mounted not with the heater/AC controls on the center
of the dash, but behind the left edge of the steering wheel.
Visibility is about as good as it gets in a coupe with sizable rear
pillars.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed shifter (a four-speed automatic is available) has
a solid feel not unlike that of expensive sport cars, the steering
has been tightened and given more feel and the V-6, despite a
willingness to rev to 5,500 rpm, is best enjoyed when its 220
pounds-feet of torque peaks at 2,750 rpm, which is particularly
useful in second and third gears.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: A new Mustang that's basically a solid
driver with a relatively flat ride, reasonable performance and a
good two-passenger cabin. It's a lot better than in the past, but,
Ford assures fans, certainly not all that it's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT THE NEW MUSTANG
</P>
<P>
   ``While the exterior garners the looks...it's what lurks under
the hood that appeals to pony car enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   _Detroit News
</P>
<P>
   ``As a point of interest to Mustang buffs, the '99 engines
outrank most of the power plants available on the Mustang of 35
years ago in terms of horsepower.''
</P>
<P>
   _Detroit Free Press
</P>
<P>
   ``The '99 is in indicator of where the Mustang is headed. The
entire line shifts away from the Mustang's muscular heritage, even
as horsepower is increased in both engines.''
</P>
<P>
   _AutoWeek magazine
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that its engines are livelier, Ford's pony car should be
an ever better value for 1999, especially the base model.''
</P>
<P>
   _Automobile magazine
</P>
<P>
   ``Odds are adults won't be happy in the rear seat, but
practicality isn't what this car is about.''
</P>
<P>
   _Consumer Reports
</P>
<P>
   ``Mustang trails Camaro and Firebird in the
performance-per-dollar department, but still sells better, in part,
because it's easier to live with day-to-day.''

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _ JERUSALEM _ Escaping Washington, but not the
prospect of impeachment, President Clinton flew to Israel Saturday
for a three-day visit in which he will once again try to rescue the
faltering Middle East peace process. A scene setter, wrapping in
Saturday events in the Middle East. (Kaplow/Deans, Cox News

   MIDEAST-PLO _ GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ The gathering that
President Clinton will face in Gaza Monday is a collection of
former guerrillas, terrorists, politicians-in-exile and Intifada
rebels. The Palestine National Council is sort of the defunct
Legislature of the PLO. Many will boycott, but the group, like
leader Yasser Arafat, illustrates the PLO transition from guerrilla
war to politics. And, if Rabin could shake Arafat's hand, Clinton
can too. ``We gave him our kosher certificate,'' says Israeli
political scientist Efraim Inbar. 700 words. (Cox News Service).

   MIDEAST-DEVELOPMENT _ GAZA or RAMALLAH Since the start of the
Oslo peace process, Palestinian per capita income has fallen at
least 10 percent. Economic growth has been stalled or negative.
Outside aid has indeed improved roads and sewers and the $3-4
billion in aid promised will help, but it will take more to apply
the theory that economic prosperity leads to peace. (Kaplow, Cox

society and economy truly begs the question: Are we building
Palestine? (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

<P>
   PALESTINIAN-CHARTER _ GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip The reason for
Clinton's visit is to witness the revision of the Palestinian
National Charter. What is that? Hasn't it already been revised?
And, why is it almost certain that this visit will not settle this
issue? (Because Israel has already said it does not agree with the
procedure that will be followed.) (Kaplow, Cox News Service). EDs:

   DAYTON-ANNIVERSARY _ SARAJEVO, BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA _ Three years
after the Dayton Peace Accords ended the ethnic war here, a lot of
progress has been made in the reconstruction of Bosnia. Bridges and
roads have been rebuilt, schools reopened, electric lines
re-connected. Food shortages are a thing of the past, as is the
systematic violence of the war. But the peace here remains tenuous.
The reason, and the result, is 1.1 million Bosnian refugees who
haven't gone home yet. The Dayton Accords, reached at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1995, divided Bosnia into two
states, the Serb Republic, and the Muslim/Croat Federation. The two
states are largely autonomous, each with the right to elect its own
president and parliament, maintain its own military and even
negotiate agreements with other countries. The Peace Accords
accomplished its most important goal, ending the war and the ethnic
cleansing that so horrified the world. But it has been unable to
undo the damage of ethnic cleansing. Bosnia is still sharply
divided along ethnic lines. And while enabling people to go home
wasn't the first goal of the peace plan, it remains the one that
cannot be achieved. That failure has confounded all other attempts
to rebuild Bosnia into a country that doesn't need international
peace keepers to keep it from tumbling back into war. (Nesmith,
Special to the Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   w/BOSNIA-FAMILY _ PALANKA, BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA _ Sevala and Suad
Pobric were supposed to move into their new house on May 1, 1992.
The young couple had spent their entire savings building the
four-bedroom house, their dream house, with plenty of room for the
family they wanted to raise together. But on April 28, a unit of
the Serbian Special Forces arrived in their hometown of Brcko and
the Pobrics, who are Muslims, had to flee. More than six years
later, they still can't go home. A Serbian family that fled
fighting in another part of the country is living in the Pobric's
house now. Sevala has met them, even had coffee with them. The
Pobrics, and the Serbian family occupying their house, are among
the more than one million Bosnian refugees who either aren't able
or aren't willing to return to their pre-war homes. They are all
survivors of ethnic cleansing and war. And three years after the
war ended here, they each represent a weakness of the fragile peace
here. (Nesmith, Special to the Cox News Service).

   PUERTORICO-STATEHOOD _ MIAMI _ Puerto Ricans go to the polls
Sunday (Dec. 13) to choose between statehood, independence, or the
current ``commonwealth'' status. Gov. Pedro Rossello is pushing
hard for statehood and has flooded TV and radio with
advertisements. The U.S. Congress refused to approve a bill earlier
this year aimed at unraveling Puerto Rico's complicated legal ties
to the United States. So in frustration, Rossello called a local,
non-binding vote in the hope it will spur Congress to act next
year. (Emling, Cox News Service)

The former dentist woke up Nov. 4 with the equivalent of a root

to lead a major expansion of the Republican majority in the House.
It didn't turn out that way, of course. Linder reflects on the
shocking turn of events that led to his mentor Newt Gingrich's exit
from Congress and Linder's return to the GOP's rank-and-file in the
House. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   INTERRACE _ Interracial marriage, banned by the Alabama
Constitution but rendered moot by U.S. Supreme Court rulings, will
draw scrutiny during the upcoming session of the Alabama
Legislature. A Montgomery lawmaker says he'll draft a bill to kill
the statute, and the majority of those who participated in a recent
survey favored dumping the archaic legislation. But at least one
state representative says he's still opposed to interracial
marriages. In South Carolina in November, voters decided to erase a
similar ban from their state constitution. (Manuel, Atlanta

<P>
   YAGER _ Once the out-spoken, publicity-hungry leader of a
clandestine empire established to hide the children of allegedly
abusive parents, Faye Yager is now a somewhat reclusive innkeeper
in a small mountain town in North Carolina. Yager, under increasing
pressure from a series of lawsuits and bounty hunters seeking a $2
million reward, bought a B&AMP;B in Brevard, N.C., this summer. But
trouble has followed her. Bounty hunters have harassed her and a
neighbor is suing her, claiming Yager is harassing her. (Williams,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   INSURANCE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ County mutual insurance companies
for decades have provided insurance to the highest-risk drivers _
at some of the highest rates. Consumer advocates for some time,
however, have worried that county mutuals, which have unregulated
rates, are being used by their regulated affiliates, to dump good
drivers who live in low-income or minority dominated area. Now,
analysis of industry-wide data shows even people in affluent areas
of Austin are getting insurance more often through county mutuals,
where their rates could be raised without repercussion or
oversight. (Elizondo, Austin American-Statesman)

   SMART-GROWTH _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin won the right to hold the

<P>
   TEXAS-JEWS _ Guacamole gracing the Passover plate, spurs for
making unleavened bread, and peddlers selling bananas are pieces of
Texas history not generally recorded in the annals of the Mexican
territory, the Republic and the state. This is Texas' Jewish
history, which dates back to the first Spanish explorers to step
foot on the land. Now, the stories of past and present-day Jewish
families are in ``Shalom Y'all - The Jewish Experience in Texas,''
a new exhibit at the Institute of Texan Cultures in San Antonio.
The institute is part of the University of Texas. (Perkes, Austin

   ELBERT-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ It is difficult to imagine how people
who had so little - those who were poor, retarded and isolated -
could be perceived as an ideal group to steal from, but state
officials believe that is exactly what happened in Elbert County -
for years. They allege that many of this county's most vulnerable
residents were systematically preyed upon by the very people
charged with their protection. They became vehicles for others to
attach life insurance policies to, and then collect on when they
died, sometimes of starvation and dehydration. A probe that began
here last February into allegations of insurance fraud has now
widened to include Social Security fraud, Medicaid fraud, misuse of
state funds and allegations of criminal neglect and abuse of
clients. Seven deaths are under investigation. (McCarthy, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   w/ELBERT-STATE _ ATLANTA _ The investigation of fraud and abuse
of the mentally retarded in Elbert County is not yet complete, but
findings in the case have galvanized the state to work to fill in
some large holes in its community care network. ``If there's any
good that came out of that situation, it's the fact that it was a
wake up call to all of us,'' said Carl E. Roland, head of the
Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse
for the Department of Human Resources. ``Going on trust and the
belief that people are going to do the best they can do, you can't
count on it. We better have some systems in place. You need
safeguards.'' (McCarthy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   w/ELBERT-SIS _ DECATUR, Ga. _ Ruby Lawrence Clark remembers the
Sunday evening in 1992 when Elberton resident Mary Arnold called
and said that her younger sister, Minnie Lawrence, 45, had died.
Arnold told her that Lawrence began choking on a chicken bone and
bolted from the table into a nearby field, where she died before
someone could reach her. Fact is, much of what Ruby Clark was told
was not the truth. Minnie Lawrence died after choking on a piece of
barbecued meat in the basement of Mrs. Arnold's home, where she and
two other retarded women had been left alone to eat. (Workers at
the day center Ms. Lawrence attended said they never left her alone
while easting because she had a propensity to choke). Close-up of
one case. (McCarthy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., is not unique among
members of Congress for having supported the Irish Republican Army.
But, as far as anyone can tell, he remains the only congressman to
have called himself the Oliver North of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   King is also not alone among Republicans in having publicly
criticized Newt Gingrich, the House speaker who is resigning. But
it seems fairly certain that he was the first to describe Gingrich
as ``road kill on the highway of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, King is not prone to moderation, at least not in
the verbal thrust and parry of politics, which he fondly calls ``a
contact sport.'' And he is at it again, loudly cajoling his fellow
Republicans, in his immoderate fashion, to dispose of President
Clinton's impeachment crisis in, of all things, a moderate way.
</P>
<P>
   King has emerged as the leading Republican voice in Congress for
punishing Clinton through some means short of impeachment. He has
become a familiar face on television arguing against his Republican
leaders, has been discussing strategy daily with White House aides
and has joined House Democrats in circulating a proposal for
censure.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a lonely effort. Although he contends that as many
as 20 Republicans are prepared to vote against impeachment this
week, he remains one of only five to have taken that position
publicly. And he is the most outspoken Republican in advocating
censure, a penalty many other Republicans say they favor but are
certain their conservative leadership will block.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows how this is going to play out,'' he said in an
interview from his Capitol Hill office last week. ``I may be looked
upon in a few months as the only genius in the Republican Party, or
the guy who never got it right. But I do think this is going to be
much more traumatic than people realize right now. Because the
country does not realize we are going through with impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   With the House moving inexorably toward that end, King has
framed his appeal in the starkest terms, telling his party mates
that they are driving themselves toward minority status by defying
what he sees as the public's deep animosity toward impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, this product of the most vaunted Republican
political machine in the country, the Nassau County Republican
Committee, says he is fueled by a profound distaste for the
``reform politics'' that he contends have criminalized the American
system with complex campaign finance rules and independent counsel
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we elect a Republican president, I just imagine some
left-wing group or some liberal Democratic foundation sponsoring a
lawsuit against the next president,'' he said. ``I just envision
payback time for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a New York City police detective, King talks in the
fast-paced mumble of a wisecracking officer on the beat. He does
not hesitate to take pokes at rivals, but also peppers his
conversation with self-deprecating jokes. Clearly, he has yet to
inspire fear among members of his staff, who broke into guffaws
recently when his train of thought ran off track, causing King to
say glumly, ``There was something brilliant I was going to say, if
I could only remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   After all of King's efforts against impeachment, many reporters
have taken to calling him a moderate, a label he despises. He is
proud to have received a 100 percent rating from the Christian
Coalition and is unabashed about opposing abortion, affirmative
action, bilingual education, gun control, the National Endowment
for the Arts and anything that smells like a ``good government''
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Goldwater said, `Moderation in the pursuit of justice is
no virtue,' and that's where I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The grandson of Irish immigrants, Peter Thomas King was born
April 5, 1944, in the Sunnyside section of Queens, two doors down
from the Celtic Cafe. He graduated from Brooklyn Prep and helped
put himself through St. Francis College in Brooklyn by unloading
trains in Manhattan's West Side rail yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of old-time Democrats, conservative in their
views, who moved from places like Sunnyside to Nassau County,''
said Rep. Thomas Manton, D-N.Y., who is close to King. ``They ended
up becoming Republicans there, but they still have a lot of
old-time Democratic values. Peter is in that group.''
</P>
<P>
   While earning a law degree from Notre Dame in the mid-1960s _ he
follows the football team with rapt attention _ King worked two
summers for Richard Nixon's Manhattan law firm, alongside another
law student named Rudolph Giuliani. (The two men are both
considering running for the Senate in 2000 and are not particularly
friendly.) King remains a fan of Nixon, keeping several photographs
of the former president on his office wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got the full credit that he was entitled to,'' King
said of Nixon, the last president to face impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In college, King wrote a paper defending Mayor James Walker of
New York City, who was forced to resign in 1932 amid corruption
charges. After law school, King worked briefly for the lawyer Roy
Cohn before getting a legal job with what Democrats consider a
modern-day Tammany Hall: Nassau County government. He later served
on the Hempstead Town Council and as Nassau County comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   He remains a staunch defender of political machines, contending
that they help middle-class people attain office. Without them, he
says, ``only rich people and wackos'' will go into the business.
</P>
<P>
   Though he grew up hearing stories about Irish heroes, it was not
until the late '60s that King became active in Irish politics. He
organized protests outside the Nassau Coliseum when a British
marching band performed there, helped raise money for IRA hunger
strikers and became something of a spokesman for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he was accused of supporting terrorism, including
helping to finance IRA arms purchases. King denies that, despite
his joking reference to himself as Oliver North. On his office
wall, King has a photograph of a 1994 Washington reception for the
prime ministers of Ireland and Britain in which House Speaker
Thomas Foley, who had leveled the terrorism charge, is stepping off
the reception line rather than shake King's hand.
</P>
<P>
   After he was first elected to Congress, King was a strong
supporter of Gingrich. But soon after the Republicans took control
of Congress in 1994, King said he began to feel that the party had
become anti-Northeastern in its outlook and oratory. A strong labor
supporter, he also worried that Republican officials were
needlessly antagonizing blue-collar workers and their unions _
something he says Ronald Reagan would never have done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, King accused the Republican leadership in Congress of
appealing to ``barefoot hillbillies.'' He says today: ``These were
guys who were making us a regional party. If I were in a national
leadership position, I wouldn't be saying things to offend people
in Mississippi or Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, King accused Gingrich of abandoning Republican
principles on issues like tax cuts and affirmative action, writing
an article in The Weekly Standard calling Gingrich ``road kill.''
The speaker was furious with King until later that year, when King
refused to join an attempted coup against Gingrich. But it took
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, King's fellow Long Island Republican, to
reconcile the two.
</P>
<P>
   As King tells it, he and D'Amato were in a Washington bar when
Gingrich strolled in. D'Amato waved the speaker over and said:
``You don't have to worry about King. He'll shoot you in the
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats say King has become a strong defender of the
president because Clinton is popular in New York and King is
positioning himself to run for the Senate in 2000. But King says
his defense of Clinton will probably only hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   He also worries that his outspokenness on impeachment could
cause friction between him and House Republicans, including some in
leadership. But in his affable way, King brushes such concerns
aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a small majority, so the Republicans will have to deal
with the cards they're dealt, and I'm one of the cards,'' he said,
referring to the Republicans' slim six-vote majority in the House
next year. ``Hope it's not the joker.''

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee's four articles of
impeachment contain only the barest hint of the long-running
investigation into the role of President Clinton and his wife in a
complicated Arkansas real-estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The only trace of the Whitewater investigation, almost a hidden
reference, is buried in Article III. That article, which involves
obstruction of justice, refers to allegations that Clinton tried
through his ``agents'' to find a job for Monica Lewinsky to help
secure her acquiescence in concealing their sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   That issue has nothing itself to do with Whitewater, of course,
but it is a reminder of how the investigation into the land deal
led in fits and starts to the sex-and-lies scandal that is at the
heart of the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to ``agents'' refers most prominently to Vernon
Jordan, a well-connected Washington lawyer and good friend of
Clinton. Jordan worked hard to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New
York City that she would find satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Article III contains the charge that beginning in December 1997
and continuing through January 1998, Clinton ``intensified and
succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in a
federal civil rights action brought against him in order to
corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chief Democratic counsel, Abbe Lowell, argued at
length on Thursday that Jordan's efforts were not designed to buy
Ms. Lewinsky's silence. Rather, he contended, the job search in
which Jordan aided Ms. Lewinsky began well before she had been
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, saw Jordan's efforts
in a different light. He used them as the justification for
expanding his Whitewater investigation to include the president's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, arguing that the job help
paralleled earlier efforts by the president's allies, including
Jordan, to provide help to an important Whitewater witness, Webster
Hubbell. After he was forced to leave the Clinton administration,
Hubbell received several lucrative contracts, some with the
assistance of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has contended in court papers that Hubbell has been
concealing important information about the Clintons' involvement in
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitewater figures only indirectly in the impeachment
articles, the other avenues of Starr's investigation are wholly
nonexistent. Starr told the Judiciary Committee last month that he
had found no wrongdoing on the part of Clinton or his wife,
Hillary, in dismissing a group of longtime employees in the White
House travel office or in the improper collection by the Clinton
White House of some 900 confidential FBI files, many of them on
prominent Republicans.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A soaking rain will fall near the coast Sunday from southeast
Virginia to eastern Georgia as low pressure moves northeastward.
The rain will be heavy at times and will be punctuated by a few
rumbles of thunder, especially across Georgia. More intermittent
rain will occur to the west in the foothills of the Appalachians
and the Tennessee Valley as a jet stream disturbance interacts with
a flow of moist Atlantic air.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front draped from the low pressure will cross Florida on
Sunday afternoon, accompanied by lines of showers and
thunderstorms. Some of the thunderstorms will be heavy with gusty
winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance moving into the Northeast will bring little more
than high cirrus clouds to dim the sunshine over interior areas,
while ample sunshine and mild readings grace areas of eastern New
England from Maine to Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to mostly sunny conditions will occur across the Plains
and central and southern Rockies as large high pressure remains in
control. It will be unseasonably mild with temperatures approaching
record maximums of 55 to 60 degrees from central Montana to
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty onshore breezes and heavy showers will occur in the
Pacific Northwest and northern California as a vigorous cold front
moves onshore. The rain will be most persistent near the coast.
Snow levels in the Cascades will lower to around 3,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California and the desert Southwest will be dry with a
few high clouds. Readings will be seasonably warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Season's Snow
</P>
<P>
   While sections of the Northeast are awaiting their first
measurable snow of the season, residents of Midland, Texas, had
several years' worth of snow Friday. Usually, the west Texas town
measures 4.4 inches in a typical year, but the snowstorm that
enveloped the western part of the state dumped 9.75 inches on
Midland, a 24-hour record and a new monthly record. In January
1985, nine inches fell in one month. The seasonal record of 13.9
inches, set in 1946-47, could be in jeopardy if a storm off the
West Coast takes a predicted similar path during this coming week.

U.S. HARDENS STANCE ON YUGOSLAV LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, trying to plot an eventual
endgame to its military involvement in the countries that once were
part of Communist Yugoslavia, is moving to undermine President
Slobodan Milosevic's tight control over Yugoslavia, senior U.S.
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have toughened their tone against Milosevic in
recent days and are openly supporting the democratic government in
Montenegro, a part of Yugoslavia that Milosevic has hinted he might
move against.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's political grip has weakened because of his
mishandling of the rebellion in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, U.S. officials say. But they flatly deny reports of some
covert or even overt new plan to oust Milosevic, saying that his
fate is up to the Serbian people. And he remains an important actor
in Western efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were speaking after a series of high-level
meetings of the administration's national security team, with the
special envoy Richard Holbrooke taking part by a secure video link.
</P>
<P>
   While they argue that the essence of U.S. policy _ support for
the democratization of the region _ has not changed, they concede
that the U.S. tone about Milosevic has hardened. ``There is a
generalized feeling now throughout the administration that
Milosevic is the problem in the Balkans, and less vital for the
solutions,'' a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels last Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called on the NATO alliance to find ``an appropriate way to support
the democratic aspirations of the Serb people,'' who ``have been
silenced and shackled far too long.'' Her spokesman, James Rubin,
said last week: ``Milosevic has been at the center of every crisis
in the former Yugoslavia over the last decade. He is not simply
part of the problem _ Milosevic is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But while urging democracy in Yugoslavia, the officials have not
called for Milosevic's removal and are wary of a further breakup of
the country, which is now made up of the dominant Serbia and
Montenegro. ``We're not supporting the secession of Montenegro,
which the Montenegrins themselves don't advocate,'' an official
said. ``That could produce another unraveling in Europe, starting
with the Bosnian Serb republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Milosevic's weaker position now, he withstood huge
rallies of 200,000 people calling for his ouster two years ago, and
today the democratic opposition is splintered badly, making its
repression easier. The officials are concerned that Milosevic could
be replaced by someone worse, like the fanatical Serbian
nationalist Vojislav Seselj.
</P>
<P>
   In September a slightly moderate Serb nationalist, Biljana
Plavsic, whom Washington supported, was defeated by a harder-line
Serb, Nikola Poplasen, in the Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has decided to do its best to protect Montenegro and
to revive support for a democratic opposition in Serbia itself,
even as Milosevic has moved to crush it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, the State Department welcomed a number
of Serbian democrats and news media figures who have been attacked
by Milosevic, including Slavko Curuvija, publisher of the newspaper
Dnevni Telegraf, which Milosevic shut down on Oct. 13 but which has
been revived and publishes from Montenegro. They also testified at
a hearing in the House before the Congressional Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has used the new U.S. oratory ``to circle the
wagons,'' a European diplomat noted, drawing closer to old cronies
and cracking down harder on the independent news media, much of
which has withdrawn to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes to roll out an explicit program at the
beginning of the year, the officials said, which will include aid
to independent news organizations, academic institutions and civic
organizations, many of which Milosevic has been trying to repress
in Serbia. Washington will also direct further support to
Montenegro, whose president, Milo Djukanovic, has been diverging
from Belgrade and Milosevic and providing safe haven for a number
of the news organizations and academic institutions that were shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been real progress toward democracy and economic
freedom in Montenegro, and we want to support them any way we
can,'' a senior U.S. official said. ``It's also a way to show the
Serbs in Belgrade, who are watching, that we are not anti-Serb per
se, which is what Milosevic always cries.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is currently spending about $15 million a
year, including $2 million for independent television, to promote
democracy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which includes
Kosovo. There, Washington hopes to help independent news
organizations in preparation for hoped-for elections for a local
parliament.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Also early in 1999, the administration will make public posters
and publicity for a new ``bounty'' of $5 million a head for the
capture of accused war criminals in the region, including Kosovo _
money pushed on the executive branch by Congress, in particular by
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who is chairman of the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets of such a bounty are the former Bosnian Serb
political leader Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander Gen.
Ratko Mladic. Both men have been indicted by an international war
crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia but have not been
arrested by NATO-led forces in Bosnia. The two men are believed to
be living now in Serbia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the details for such a bounty program are still being worked
out, especially with the Justice Department, officials say. It will
be run out of the office of Robert Gelbard, who is in charge of
carrying out the Dayton accords, and the secretary of state will
determine who qualifies for any reward.
</P>
<P>
   The administration continues to press negotiations to find a
political solution to the conflict in Kosovo, between the ruling
Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of the
province's population.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke and the chief U.S, negotiator, Christopher Hill,
have had difficulty getting a coherent political response from the
badly divided ethnic Albanians. The essence of the problem is that
the United States and the West want a solution _ enhanced autonomy
for Kosovo within Serbia _ that is favored by neither the Serbs nor
the population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, urged on by the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic
Albanian residents of the province want independence, while the
Serbs are reluctant to grant any real autonomy, let alone an
enhanced autonomy beyond the status Milosevic removed from Kosovo
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is currently circulating his fourth draft agreement
among the various parties, has been criticized by both sides. U.S.
officials say they do not expect quick success, but are still
pushing to find a political settlement before the spring, when the
Balkan thaw could produce new fighting in Kosovo.

 PIG FARMERS IN CRISIS AS PRICES COLLAPSE

<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ It is just after 7 a.m., and Rex Hoppes is
shuttling a herd of squealing pigs out of a long gooseneck trailer
and onto the loading dock at a bustling meatpacking plant here.
</P>
<P>
   On this cool wintry morning, Hoppes, a 34-year-old
fifth-generation farmer, has just driven an hour and a half
northeast of his farm near Des Moines to bring 22 plump hogs to
market. But as he watches a steady stream of giant 18-wheelers pull
in to unload thousands of additional hogs, he begins to sour. The
price he will get for his hogs is about as welcome as the frost
that has painted the surrounding fields a snowy white.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams, I wouldn't have believed we could have
gone this low,'' Hoppes said early last week. ``This is the lowest
I've ever sold hogs, and I hope I never see these levels again.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Hoppes was selling pigs or hogs _ the terms are used
interchangeably in the industry _ for $46 per hundredweight, or
about $118 for a 250-pound hog; the price on Dec. 8: $17 per
hundredweight or $45 a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1971 has the market for hogs slipped so low, and
economists say that with inflation factored in, hog prices stand at
their lowest level since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the crisis are simple, and yet devastating to
thousands of people who have staked their lives on hogs. Years of
soaring demand for pork products around the globe have led to
spectacular gains in production. This year, the nation's hog farms
_ many of which are now huge corporate operations _produced the
equivalent of a bumper crop of pigs, a supply so huge and unwieldy
that slaughterhouses are overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, meatpackers are no longer bidding up the prices of
hogs, and farmers _ who have plowed great sums into new hog
operations _ are facing devastating losses and the prospect of
financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most stressful time for a hog producer that I have
ever seen, and I have been on the scene for 50 years,'' said Glenn
Grimes, an emeritus professor of agricultural economics at the
University of Missouri at Columbia. ``This is going to break an
awful lot of farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the economy in this part of the country remains strong,
with unemployment at just 2.6 percent in Iowa, farmers throughout
the Midwest are beset with problems. Slowing demand from Asia and
large stores of grain have sent corn and soybean prices down 20
percent from a year ago. Meanwhile, the sense of crisis in the hog
industry _ a powerful engine of the nation's farm economy _ is so
sharp that the National Pork Producers Council has asked
meatpackers to further stretch their capacity, and the National
Farmers Union has petitioned Congress to hold hearings to
``investigate the devastating plunge in hog prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Iowa _ where swine are king and where the state elects a
pork queen each winter _ farmers are beginning to talk of shooting
pigs that are too costly to feed and too undervalued to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, hogs were once known as ``mortgage lifters,'' and
it was almost a cliche to hear farmers call hog stink the ``smell
of money.'' But the nation's leading hog state, where more than $12
billion a year in revenues and 94,000 jobs are at stake, is making
a reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the hog industry are wondering whether smaller
farms are doomed. Government officials are rushing to the aid of
farmers. The newly elected agriculture secretary in Iowa is
commissioning a blue-ribbon panel; the state attorney general is
conducting an investigation into whether hog farmers are being
cheated, and outgoing Gov. Terry Branstad is honking the horn for
federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '60s I was raising and selling hogs for the
prices they are right now,'' Branstad said in an interview. ``It's
pretty bleak. I bought a Ford convertible in 1963 for $1,725, so
you can see what happened to automobiles and what happened to hog
prices. I'd like to see pork go to the Food for Peace program.''
</P>
<P>
   The steep decline in hog prices has not yet reached the nation's
consumers, who continue to pay an average of about $2.20 a pound
for pork, about the same as a year ago, according to the federal
Department of Agriculture. Indeed, economists say that the spread
between the price farmers get when they sell to meatpackers and the
price of pork at the supermarket counter is at or near a historic
high. A pig that Hoppes sells for $45 yields as much as $331 worth
of pork at the supermarket, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   That is because retailers are reluctant to slash prices (partly
out of fear that a future increase might be more disturbing to
consumers). But they are offering more discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving product,'' said Paul Bernish, a spokesman at
Kroger Co., one of the nation's largest supermarket chains. ``But
if your question is why haven't our prices come down, that doesn't
generally happen. They don't go up when hog prices are up and go
down when hog prices are down.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who are losing $50 to $75 for every pig are not pleased
about the enormous profit imbalance. Nor are they optimistic about
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've farmed for 20-something years,'' said Craig Hill, a tall,
lean middle-aged farmer in Sandyville, Iowa, who sent 230 hogs to
the market last week at a loss of more than $14,000. ``I've had
droughts, I've had interest rates at 18 percent, I've had all sorts
of calamities. But these prices make me wonder whether I can stay
in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense among some farmers that something bigger is
amiss; the National Farmers Union thinks that the advent of large
corporate hog farms is squeezing smaller pig farmers out, and many
find it disturbing that meatpackers and retailers are ringing up
huge profits while producers face collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Hog production is up a record 10 percent this year, and since
late October more than two million hogs a week have entered the
nation's slaughterhouses. Plants are at or near capacity.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the overflow, meatpackers are lengthening their
hours. But expanding operations means hiring and training new
workers in one of the tightest job markets in decades. And packers
have just so much cold storage; the industry's motto has long been
``sell it or smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already operating as close to 100 percent as possible,''
said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman at IBP Inc. in Dakota City, Neb.,
one of the nation's largest packing plant operators. ``And yes,
there's no question we're making money. But ultimately, it's the
law of supply and demand. Pork processing margins in '96 and '97
were poor and that forced packers to close plants.''
</P>
<P>
   And so farmers, who must sell their hogs about six months after
weaning or risk producing a flabbier, less desirable hog, have
little choice but to sell at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers have an unstorable commodity and therefore no
bargaining power,'' Steve Meyer, an economist at the National Pork
Producers Council in Des Moines, said as he and two colleagues
lunched on pork tenderloin and grilled pork loin sandwiches.
``Right now, all the power's with the buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those within the industry concede that they overproduced.
Investments in new facilities, temperature-controlled rooms and
sophisticated breeding techniques created a boom in the number of
pigs produced and sent to market. The system has worked so well
that even though the number of hog operators has steadily declined,
to 138,000 today from three million in the 1950s, the industry will
produce a record 19 billions pounds of pork this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is talk about liquidations. But Meyer at the pork
council says that ``cutbacks now won't show up until the fourth
quarter of '99.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hoppes, who has pulled $40,000 out of a retirement
account to keep going, prospects are gloomy. Hog farming has been a
lifelong dream; he began showing hogs at the county fair as a
9-year-old. But pulling out of the packing plant in Marshalltown,
the boyish, blond Hoppes says that when he is thinking about his
wife, Joyce, and his two boys, 4-year-old Reid and 2-year-old
Grant, one question keeps playing in his mind: ``Why am I sticking
my neck out so far for this dying dream?''

KNIFE ATTACKS ON PET HORSES STUN A TOWN IN ARKANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Okla.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARLING, Ark. _ Sugar was the first horse to die. A 12-year-old
roan, her owner found her in her stall, dead of stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen days later, Haven, a gray six-year-old mare, was found
dead in a meadow not far from where Sugar fell. She, too, had been
knifed.
</P>
<P>
   Ten other horses survived attacks, probably because their
attackers were scared off by the shrill neighs and flailing hooves
of horses in terror, the police here say.
</P>
<P>
   The savagery and senselessness of the attacks, on three nights
over the past three weeks, would sicken people anywhere. But in
this town of 4,700 people in western Arkansas, where rodeo rivals
football in popularity, it is common to see horses grazing in
fenced lawns. A regionally renowned quarter-horse track is just
over the nearby Oklahoma border in Salisaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 25-year-old poodle that needs to die, and I can't
even think of putting her down,'' said Cliff Amerson, 71, at Big
A's Conoco station, where residents gather for coffee and
conversation. ``People around here might be mean to one another,
but not to animals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is,'' said Todd Barnes, 28, the owner of Big A's.
</P>
<P>
   The butchery brings to mind the play and movie ``Equus,'' in
which an emotionally disturbed youth uses a sickle to blind a
stable of horses. But the police say the assailants in the attacks
here _ two people are believed to be involved _ appeared to aim at
the throats of the horses with an unfathomable resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't trying to just maim the horses, they were going
for the kill,'' said Officer Victoria Harris, herself an
experienced horsewoman. ``They were aiming for the jugular vein.''
</P>
<P>
   The first attack was on Sugar at River Valley Ranch, a compound
of stables on the town's outskirts, on the night of Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen days later, a horse was found slashed but alive in
nearby Fort Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the morning of Dec. 5, 10 horses in three of River
Valley Ranch's stables, including Haven, were found hacked or
stabbed. The stalls were awash in blood, the police said, and the
surviving horses, reeling from pain and fear, could barely be
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Those effects remain. Last week, Terry Bailey comforted Mighty,
a 9-year-old registered quarter horse with pink skin stretched
against the stitches of the wounds she suffered in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day I've been able to catch her and pet
her,'' said Bailey, 37, a truck driver for whom horses are a family
affair. Two of the horses owned by Bailey and his wife, Ramona,
were stabbed in the attack last weekend, including Lee, a
4-year-old roan that Mrs. Bailey had raised from a colt and whose
sturdy neck is now marred by a seven-inch cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife cried so hard for two days that she couldn't talk,''
Bailey said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the adjoining stall, a gash oozed above the right eye of
Dixie, a 3-year-old chestnut. Watching intently from behind another
gate was Jasper, an 8-year-old paint whose sinus was shattered by a
blow to his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three days after the attack, every time Jasper breathed he
spewed blood,'' Bailey said. Veterinarians tend to the wounded
horses every day, administering antibiotics and painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty, who had won both stakes races he had entered, and Lee,
who was being trained for racing, were each valued at more than
$8,000. And although their wounds mean that neither is likely to
compete again, Bailey said, ``We'll keep them forever, no matter
what.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Myron LaMora of the Barling Police Department acknowledged
that, aside from a suspicious footprint, his 12 officers had been
unable to recover any physical evidence, knew of no motive and had
no suspects in the attacks, although they are convinced that all
are the work of the same offenders. And in at least two instances,
he said, false kindness calmed the horses before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought them feed before taking the knives to them,''
LaMora said.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar was owned by Officer Larry Croom of the Barling police, as
were two Shetland ponies, Pancake and Button, who were wounded in
the Dec. 5 attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other horse owners in the region, Croom said, ``are spending the
night in their barns, presumably armed.''

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT TO LEAD MACARTHUR FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, known for its
``genius'' grants, has named Jonathan Fanton, the president of the
New School, in New York, as its president.
</P>
<P>
   Fanton, who will succeed Adele Smith Simmons next September,
will earn about $400,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, based in Chicago, is one of the 10 largest in
the United States, with assets of about $4 billion and annual
spending of about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being president really fits with the things I've done all my
life,'' Fanton said in a telephone interview last week from the
foundation's headquarters in Chicago, referring to his work in
human rights, community development, education and the arts. ``It's
just a wonderful match.''
</P>
<P>
   John Corbally, MacArthur's chairman, said that the trustees had
been drawn to Fanton because of his ``deep concern for the healthy
development of communities and individuals,'' and that the board,
too, thought it was a good match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute agreement between his interests, his life's work
and his activities and the program activities of the foundation is
little short of amazing,'' Corbally said.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur is best known for the no-strings-attached ``genius''
grants ranging from $30,000 to $75,000 for five years. The dozens
of grants made yearly are bestowed on intellectual and creative
figures, with the focus on human and community development and
global security and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Fanton, 55, has spent his career in universities. Before moving
to the New School in 1982, he was a vice president at the
University of Chicago and associate provost at Yale, where he
earned his bachelor's degree and a doctorate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been active in a variety of foundations and nonprofit
organizations. He has been chairman of the board of Human Rights
Watch and co-chairman of its International Committee for Academic
Freedom. He is also a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and
other foundations.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the New School, formerly the New School for
Social Research, Fanton has shaped it into a leading educator in
the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which has 7,000 students, includes the Mannes
College of Music, the Parsons School of Design and the Actors
Studio School of Dramatic Arts, as well as traditional liberal arts
programs. Just last week, it announced a new partnership with the
Joffrey Ballet School that will allow students to study dance and
earn a bachelor's degree simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Under Fanton, the university's endowment has grown to $80
million from $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur seems to have a predilection for choosing college
presidents as chiefs. Ms. Simmons was president of Hampshire
College when she was chosen to lead the foundation a decade ago.
And Corbally, her predecessor as president, was president of the
University of Illinois before moving to the MacArthur helm.

COMMENTARY: HONOR IN A SHALLOW CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is too late for pettiness. It is too late for
partisanship. It is too late for slander. It is too late for
gossip. It is too late for polls.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late for everything that has characterized the ugly,
thoughtless, vengeful, casuistic debate of what is now, without
doubt, the greatest constitutional excruciation of our time.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for only one thing, and that is sobriety. All the
noise and the nonsense have ushered in a chilling moment of
gravity, for the president and the Congress and the country.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that, at such a moment, a sense of politics
would give way to a sense of history. But it is alarming how many
of the players in this great drama are still acting cheap and
chuckleheaded. The familiar old moves are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president and his henchlings do not seem
quite sobered up. They still believe that devious formulations and
dodges and smears will save them.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Bill Clinton emerged from the Oval Office,
from which he can no longer address the nation without the risk of
snickers, to offer another re-apology. We put hope over experience
and believed he would say something we had never heard.
</P>
<P>
   Experience defeated hope. He repeated his feeble words of
tactical ``grappling.'' Then he offered the uncommitted moderate
House Republicans a verse from ``The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.''
But did it have to be the one about the ``moving finger''? Why not
this one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed the Idols I have loved so long
</P>
<P>
   Have done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:
</P>
<P>
   Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,
</P>
<P>
   And sold my Reputation for a Song.''
</P>
<P>
   The apology was startling in its tepidity. The president seemed
like a practiced escape artist who knows how to pace himself. Why
give all the profound feeling before the committee votes? Dribble
out the best bathos for the House vote, and later for the Senate
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't only Clinton's re-calibrated penitence that made
you wonder. All week long his defenders have been retreating behind
the old insulting avenues of defense.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counsel came before the House Judiciary
Committee and said the president did not commit perjury because he
did not lie because he did not believe that he was lying.
</P>
<P>
   The satanic spinners of the West Wing, who cannot pause even at
this moment that should give pause, faxed around an old piece from
The Chicago Tribune recounting that David Schippers, the majority
counsel at the committee, once represented a porn star named Seka.
(He even took her to a Chicago White Sox luncheon!)
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats on the committee issued a statement asserting
that Monica Lewinsky's memory ``is impaired by prescription
drugs.'' The president regrets the pain he caused his family, but
his ex-girlfriend, the stalker, was on Effexor and Serzone.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Bill Clinton is pathologically incorrigible. He
couldn't stop himself from touching her, he couldn't stop himself
from lying about it, he couldn't stop himself from asking others to
lie about it, he couldn't stop himself from allowing the
ruthlessness to proceed, he couldn't stop himself from polling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   And yet,  &UR; he must be defended. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are trying to impeach Bill Clinton for being
Bill Clinton. But being Bill Clinton is not an impeachable offense.
Neither is perjury about sex, or about anything else that bears no
relation to a president's public duties. What Clinton did was a low
crime and misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Since Watergate, there has been a pendulum of partisan revenge.
And right now, Republicans want their payback for Watergate, for
Bork, for Iran-Contra, even for Woodstock. Like Kenneth Starr, the
Republicans are attempting to repeal the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cultural war at the heart of this political war, and
it accounts for the scandalous Republican refusal to react to
Clinton's offenses with any sense of proportionality.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to move beyond the surreal to the real. The
Republicans are doing something far more ominous than what Bill
Clinton did. He debased the presidency, but they are debasing the
Constitution.

<P>
   BIRNEY, Mont. _ In the 1970s, a rush for coal shattered the
quiet of eastern Montana. As giant shovels gouged the rolling
grasslands in search of the mineral, ranch families and communities
were torn as well, bitterly at odds over whether to accept the
windfall from coal companies and give up parts of their ranches, or
to join environmentalists and fight the assault on their way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Western soft coal has plummeted, to $5.90 a ton
from $12.50 a ton over the last 16 years, and the controversy has
quieted. But a battle over soft coal has surfaced again, this time
in the form of a proposed 117-mile, $385 million rail link to haul
the coal from south of this tiny town in the heart of one of
Montana's most isolated and beautiful areas, the Tongue River
Valley, to the main railroad at Mile City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got cold, hard market data that shows if the Tongue River
railroad can be completed by 2001, we can double the supply of coal
coming from Montana,'' said Michael Gustafson, president of the
concern formed to build the link, Tongue River Railroad Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson predicted the rail line would bring the opening of new
strip mines. The state now produces about 28 million tons of coal a
year, all of it from this area.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clean Air Act forces Midwestern utilities to use
low-sulfur coal, a fuel that burns more cleanly than hard coal, to
meet standards that go into effect in 2000, Gustafson said,
Montana's vast reserves of such coal will grow invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line would bring startling change to an area where
stillness is broken only by cattle lowing or an occasional
tractor-trailer hauling livestock. Gustafson envisions the line
being used by as many as 18 trains a day, each with 125 cars _
about a mile long _ filled with coal pulled by two 4,000-horsepower
locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear it 20 to 30 miles away,'' said Randy Knutson,
chairman of the United Transportation Union, which represents
railroad workers. ``The horns are piercing. It will be an
overwhelming presence.''
</P>
<P>
   The union opposes the new rail link because it says some 30
railroad jobs would be lost on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe,
which now serves this area. But the Burlington Northern's link to
Mile City is on a 294-mile route, 177 miles longer than that
proposed by Gustafson.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new link say the existing line makes the new
one unnecessary. Gustafson counters that the shorter route would
greatly reduce the price of the coal.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against the new railroad has been a long one; the rail
link was first proposed in 1986. But despite lawsuits and lobbying
by the Northern Plains Resource Council, a coalition of ranchers
and environmentalists based in Billings, the Tongue River Railroad
may soon be barreling down on this quiet corner.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer some ranchers here were served with papers notifying
them that the railroad would begin exercising its right of eminent
domain, granted by the federal and state governments, and would be
coming to survey their land. Gustafson said he hoped to begin
construction next spring. Several ranch families vowed to continue
their fight in court.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the Tongue River Valley, ranchers say, will be
unbearable. ``It's already split the community,'' said Irv
Alderson, a 68-year-old rancher whose spurs jingled softly as he
fried up a pan of venison steaks and potatoes. ``There's people who
don't speak to each other anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tension is especially difficult in a place where neighbors
depend on each other if they get stuck in the mud, or a grass fire
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the valley needs the money the railroad construction
would bring, because beef prices have dropped. Though the Tongue
River Valley is a sprawling chunk of real estate where ranches are
measured in sections, or square miles, there are only 56 landowners
along the river, with at least 29 of them opposed to the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   The closest town is Birney, which is anywhere from a mile to 15
miles for many families, and it has dwindled to fewer than 50
people. The grocery here closed in the 1980s, and the one-room
schoolhouse has just 16 students. The nearest sizable town,
Sheridan, Wyo., is an hour-and-a-half ride, when the gravel road is
not clogged with mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of people in a world of hurt,'' said Jay
Nance, a rancher north of Birney, who is a member of an economic
development committee. He endorsed the railroad, saying: ``The
world is bigger than my ranch. I would like to see something that
will keep my kids around here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the valley is also part of the ancestral homeland of the
Northern Cheyenne, whose reservation lies just a few miles to the
east. They gather plants for medicine and ceremonies here. And the
railroad would bisect the site of the battleground of what the
Indians call the Battle of Wolf Mountain, the last battle fought by
the Sioux and Cheyenne before they surrendered in 1877.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still eat deer, still eat pheasants,'' said Freda Standing
Elk, who lives in Birney Village, a small Cheyenne settlement seven
miles from Birney. ``We still use the hide to make buckskin
dresses, to make moccasins.'' The trains could drive off the game,
she said, ``and we could lose all that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeanie Alderson, who with her two sisters and father, Irv, is a
partner in the Bones Brothers Ranch, which straddles Hanging Woman
Creek, says she worries about several things: grass fires started
by sparks from trains, weeds that might be carried in to grazing
land and the fact that cattle and horses would have to cross high
railroad embankments to reach the Tongue River, the only source of
water. ``I had a fellow call me to tell me what a nightmare it is
to have a railroad for a neighbor,'' she said, looking out at
several quarter horses in a corral near her home. ``He had 24 show
horses killed by a train. He said it was a quarter-million-dollar
loss and a year later he hadn't got a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the road in a deep canyon carved out by the Tongue River,
Bill Musgrave has other concerns. He said he could not sell his
ranch because buyers feared the effect of a new railroad. On a walk
through one of his pastures he pointed to a series of towering,
rugged hills. ``They want to obliterate the tops of those hills and
use the dirt to fill in between'' for the railroad bed, he said, on
more than two miles of his land.
</P>

   ``They're letting on like they can mitigate all this but they
can't,'' he said, referring to erosion and other environmental
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson bristles at the criticism. ``I've been cast as a
speculator and a promoter,'' he said. ``All kinds of names have
been thrown at me. But I'm a creative entrepreneur and I feel
strongly I've tried to do it right. I'm frustrated but I've made a
concerted effort to work with those people.''

COMMENTARY: THE CAPITOL HILL MOB
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about the will of the people, the democratic process and
the good of the country. The extremists in the Republican Party are
trying to bludgeon their way to an impeachment that hardly anybody
wants and nobody needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the government and perhaps even the economy are thrown into a
tailspin as a result _ well, so be it. The fanatics of the right
are willing to pay any price, bear any burden, to hammer the man
they hate above all others, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no champion of the president, but I know a lynch mob when I
see one.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with the sins of Clinton, the right-wingers believe
with their idol Barry Goldwater that ``moderation in the pursuit of
justice is no virtue.'' (Goldwater's views on fooling around in the
workplace are, nevertheless, not helpful to his spiritual
descendants. Laurence J. Peter, author of ``The Peter Principle,''
quotes the late senator as follows: ``I think any man in business
would be foolish to fool around with his secretary. If it's
somebody else's secretary, fine!'')
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans thought the campaign to impeach Clinton had been
derailed by the Democrats' strong showing in the November elections
and Newt Gingrich's decision three days later to relinquish the
speakership and leave Congress. There was a general feeling that if
the president hadn't been punished enough, the country certainly
had. It was hoped that Monica-all-the-time would give way to
Monica-every-now-and-then.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody forgot to tell Tom DeLay. DeLay is the onetime
exterminator from Sugar Land, Texas, who has emerged as the
Republicans' chief pro-impeachment fanatic. He's the Republican
whip, the man who rounds up the votes in the House. Nothing short
of impeachment will satisfy him. He is adamantly opposed to the
House even  &UR; considering &LR;  a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a sense of how extreme DeLay can be, consider his
approach to the environment. He believes the Environmental
Protection Agency is the ``Gestapo of the government.'' He believes
that DDT is A-OK. Not harmful. He is not bothered by threats to the
ozone layer. When the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to the
discoverers of the link between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone
depletion, he mocked the award as the ``Nobel Appeasement Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of work in this bizarre drama is Rep. Bob Barr, a
Republican from Georgia who has long been recognized as an
impeachment fanatic and was widely regarded as a crank.
Nevertheless he is on the Judiciary Committee and voted Friday for
impeachment. That same day The Washington Post ran a story in which
Barr acknowledged being a keynote speaker this year at a meeting of
the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist group
that is worried that blacks will exterminate whites by infiltrating
their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may wish to put the sordid Lewinsky saga behind them,
but if the GOP fanatics get their way and Clinton is actually
impeached by the House, the very opposite will happen. The issue
will become bigger than ever, overwhelming everything else in the
government for months and months to come.
</P>
<P>
   A trial of Clinton in the Senate, presided over by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, and with star witnesses like Monica Lewinsky and
Linda Tripp and Vernon Jordan, will make the O.J. Simpson story
look like a warm-up act. It will seem like Monica-forever-and-ever.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government would come to a halt. Any semblance of
legislative bipartisanship would vanish. There would be no
possibility of an agreement on Social Security, no patients' bill
of rights, no serious federal initiatives on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would poison every relationship,'' said a Capitol Hill
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``You'd have to consider the legislative year
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street executives fear the stock markets would be adversely
affected and the long economic expansion could be undermined.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Bill Clinton has demeaned the presidency.
There is no defense for his actions or his lies. But the voters
have chosen him twice by substantial margins and they stand behind
him still. It is not up to the hatchet men of the Republican Party
to undo that.

EDITORIAL: THE MISUSE OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 13:
</P>
<P>
   With the House now headed for a vote on impeachment, it is
essential to cut through the constitutional distortion that
developed during the Judiciary Committee debate. One of the most
dangerous notions is that impeachment by the House is an acceptable
functional substitute for censure _ the equivalent of a stinging
grand-jury indictment or a rebuke that can be passed in
anticipation that the Senate will not remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee and GOP leaders like Tom DeLay, who has
filled the leadership vacuum left by the inaction of the designated
speaker, Robert Livingston, have been hawking this idea. The same
constitutional heresy pops up in the more thoughtful but equally
mistaken Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. Attempting to head off the
popularity of a true censure resolution, he argues that impeachment
is simply ``the ultimate censure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are right, of course, that use of impeachment as a
signal of condemnation distorts the evidentiary and punitive cycle
envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution. They clearly
intended for impeachment to pass the House only when its members
wanted to remove the president, not simply to scare or punish him.
By suggesting that impeachment could be used to rebuke the
president or to send a signal about the primacy of law, the
Republicans are defining impeachment down, to borrow from Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's warning about ``defining deviancy down.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using impeachment as a symbolic punishment is
contradicted by the language of the Clinton impeachment articles
themselves, as approved by the Judiciary Committee. Each concludes
with the statement that President Clinton's conduct ``warrants
impeachment and trial, and removal from office. . ..'' The
Republicans feel justified in misusing the impeachment process
because they have the sorry task of coping with a president who has
defined down the standards of presidential responsibility. The
Constitution, with its proper emphasis on high crimes and
misdemeanors, does not specify how to deal with the low antics of a
rogue chief executive like Clinton. But it does provide the room to
craft a punishment short of impeachment by the House and removal by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of both public opinion and the Constitution,
censure is still the preferred way to punish Clinton. But he left
Washington Saturday without offering meaningful assistance to those
who are trying to save him from being the second president to be
impeached by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   By putting his own semantic roadblocks in the way of censure,
Clinton is giving new meaning to political self-destruction. He is
daring a Republican congressional majority that should not be
dared, and in the case of the House Judiciary Committee, he is
diverting attention from its misapplication of the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks ago Henry Hyde and other Republican leaders grandly spoke
about the importance of avoiding partisan division if the Lewinsky
case ever came before the House. They were right then, and wrong
now to manipulate the Constitution in their pursuit of Clinton. If
the Republicans will allow a censure resolution to be placed before
the House, and if Clinton will finally give up his evasions and
admit that he lied under oath, this matter can be fairly and
properly concluded with the censure of the president.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It is not a mirage, which might be expected in this city
of man-made islands and cruise ships that resemble floating
metropolises. Brightly painted wood-frame houses sit on stilts in
the middle of Biscayne Bay, as if a relic of old Florida were
making a final, defiant stand just east of glassy, downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Stiltsville, as the group of privately owned homes is known, was
for decades a raucous sea village with a night life that attracted
local luminaries and gossip columnists. It evolved into a quiet
hamlet of 7 houses where the main activities of the more than 100
homeowners who visit on weekends _ as many as 70 people jointly own
one of them _ are boating and watching sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come here to get away from the world,'' said Gail Baldwin,
an architect who owns one of the houses with two partners. ``You
come out here just to be with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, however, the leases that allow residents to keep
the stilt houses on the bay are scheduled to expire, and homeowners
may have to pay to have the homes torn down. For two years,
residents have been negotiating with officials at Biscayne National
Park _ Stiltsville is inside the park _ to have their 25-year
leases extended. No agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep their homes, residents are seeking to have
the site designated as a historic district in the National Register
of Historic Places. Although such an honor would not have the force
of law in preserving Stiltsville, the residents believe that park
officials are more likely to spare such properties. Homeowners are
working on a proposal expected to be submitted by year's end. Then
the National Park Service, which oversees the National Register,
will have 45 days to make a decision on the registry request.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups object to the existence of personal
property, to which the public does not have access, on public land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is having these small, private preserves within a
national park,'' said Karsten Rist, the president of the Tropical
Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to the preservation of Stiltsville may be
the area's short history. Except in rare instances, National
Register guidelines require that structures be at least 50 years
old to qualify for historic status. Threatened by hurricanes and
surrounded by saltwater and the scourge of termites, the earliest
Stiltsville homes are no longer standing.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Webster, a historian hired by the homeowners to help
prepare their application to the National Register, argues that
residents of Stiltsville and events that took place there go back
more than half a century. ``Even though the buildings are
relatively new, the site itself represents a lot of history, a
period of human activity,'' she said. ``It's a big part of the
folklore of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The first record of a structure in the shallow, clear flats of
the bay, where waters are rarely deeper than 10 feet at high tide,
is from the 1930s when a local fisherman named ``Crawfish'' Eddie
Walker built a one-story home out of a barge that had been grounded
on the bay. Soon, the idea caught on and other structures,
including homes and bars, were built.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s Stiltsville had earned a reputation as a watering
hole for the affluent, who prized its tranquillity. Former Florida
Gov. LeRoy Collins wrote to his friend, Jimmy Ellenberg, whose
house at Stiltsville he frequented during this period, ``When the
time comes when I say so long to this life, I hope the great beyond
seems a lot like your cabin in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the floating nightclubs soon offered gambling and strip
shows that provoked police raids. In 1965, state regulators curbed
Stiltsville's freewheeling ways. New building codes were enforced
and owners were required to sign leases and pay rent to the state
for the use of the bottomlands. In the years that followed, fires
and hurricanes destroyed 18 structures out of the 27 standing at
the district's peak.
</P>
<P>
   Though smaller, Stiltsville nevertheless became an icon. It
appeared as an exotic hideaway in the television show ``Miami
Vice.'' Later, it served as the backdrop for ``Skin Tight,'' a
detective novel written by Carl Hiaasen, a columnist for The Miami
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been an intriguing and romantic place,'' said
Hiaasen, who opposes the demolition of the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the properties will be worthless to the homeowners if
the buildings are demolished, the owners say that financial gain is
not their primary motive for keeping them, given that the constant
need for repairs and renovation long ago made Stiltsville an
unprofitable venture. Rather, they say, the value is sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hole for money that you've got to throw down every
year,'' said Christopher Knight, a lawyer who owns one of the
houses along with three partners and estimates that each of them
spends $5,000 a year on its upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the worst investment I've ever made in my
life,'' Knight said, ``but if you grew up in south Florida, for
those that like the bay, Stiltsville is the ultimate attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of historical designation say that the small number of
houses and the possibility that salt water and bad weather will
eventually destroy Stiltsville have quieted their objections.
</P>
<P>
   The residents are undeterred. Baldwin, who has reinforced his
structure with concrete pilings and added tempered windows, which
many homes do not have, to his wooden shutters, proudly notes that
his house survived Hurricane Andrew, Miami's litmus test of storms,
more or less intact.
</P>
<P>
   When thunder strikes, Baldwin concedes, he gets apprehensive.
But on a balmy, clear day, when schools of jellyfish and stingrays
dance by in near perfect unison, all concerns vanish and he can
bask in Stiltsville's most popular pastime: relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sit and read and have dinner and watch football,'' he
said. ``Food. A lot of it stems around food.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Jack Farris, a novelist, playwright and retired professor of
English, died on Nov. 26 at a hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was
77 and had recently moved to Rockville, Md., from Lockesburg, Ark.
 &HT;    The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Anna.
 &HT;    Throughout his teaching career, Farris published poetry and
fiction, including five novels. His novel ``Me and Gallagher''
(1982) dealt with the vigilante movement in the Montana Territory
in the 1860s.
 &HT;    Another novel, ``Ramey'' (1951), about the struggles of a
Depression-era family, was turned by Farris and Abby Mann into a
screenplay for NBC in 1974, ``The Greatest Gift'' (the pilot for
the series ``The Family Holvak'') with Glenn Ford. Farris' play,
``Into Thy Narrow Bed,'' was first produced at Circuit Playhouse in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1981.
 &HT;    His other novels were ``A Man to Ride With'' (1953), ``The
Abiding Gospel of Claude Dee Moran Jr.'' (1987) and ``Keeping the
Faith'' (1990).
 &HT;    Born in Forest, Texas, Farris grew up in Arkansas and spent six
years in the Navy, including service during World War II in the
South Pacific. He graduated from Ouachita Baptist University in
Arkadelphia, Ark., in 1949 and earned a master's degree at the
University of Michigan a year later.
 &HT;    He taught at several colleges before joining the faculty at
Southwestern, now Rhodes College, in Memphis, in 1961 as a
professor of English. He retired in 1984.
 &HT;    In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Steve, of
Camden, Ark.; a daughter, Carrie, of New York, and six
grandchildren.

   Louis Delgado, 55, Playwright Who Overcame Addiction
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Louis Delgado Jr., a playwright who wove his
experiences with drug addiction and his life on the street into his
work, died on Dec. 1 at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn.
He was 55 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was diabetes-related liver failure, said Ed Vega,
president of the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center in Manhattan,
where Delgado's latest play, ``Juanita's Trip,'' recently completed
a three-week run.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who was born in the Bronx, overcame 23 years of
addiction and of damaged family relationships by turning to
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up in the Tombs 15 years ago with my eyes practically
out of my head,'' he told a reporter for The New York Times in
April, recounting his time in jail. ``I had to decide if I wanted
to die a junkie or get my life together.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a series of plays whose underlying theme was hope,
reconciliation and understanding. ``A Better Life,'' for example,
focuses on the relationship between two hospitalized men from
disparate backgrounds who shared the bond of HIV. In ``Tony and
Son,'' a father leaves his son and ultimately seeks a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he won an Obie for ``El Cano,'' which has run at
Repertorio Espanol in Manhattan for three years. The play centers
on a blond, blue-eyed Puerto Rican living in the continental United
States who denies his culture so he can gain acceptance in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's last work, ``Juanita's Trip,'' is based on the family
of his companion, the actress Marilyn Cruz. His health failing, the
playwright made a cameo appearance in every performance at the
Velez Cultural Center except on the final night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of man who would say in his interviews, `If I
can do it, anyone can,''' said Veronica Caicedo, who directed and
produced several of his plays. ``He was just a powerful force,
struggling always for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who had served in the Air Force, was also a program
director at Damon House in Brooklyn, a therapeutic community for
recovering addicts. In addition to Ms. Cruz, he is survived by a
daughter, Lisa, of New Jersey, and three sons, Louis, of Naples,
Fla., and Stephen and Daniel, both of New York.

SPORTS COLUMN: MACHO MOMENTS BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The letters used to come by the dozens, grown men, football
fans, thanking Jim Burt for providing them the impetus and courage
to kiss their sons.
</P>
<P>
   They would tell him he had made it all right to shower a young
boy with love in public. Some would claim they had always thought
this was ``a woman's thing'' to do, a ``gay thing.'' Until they saw
Burt, a strapping nose tackle, a Super Bowl champion, handle his
5-year-old namesake as he would a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would say things like, `When we saw a macho guy like you
do it ...,''' Burt said from his Bergen County, N.J., home. ``I
remember thinking, `I can't believe this.' I couldn't believe men,
fathers, could actually think that way. I always thought the macho
thing to do was hug your kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 12 years ago, it made for poignant fourth-quarter
television, as the Giants were blowing the Denver Broncos into
Super Bowl oblivion in Pasadena, Calif. ``Take the pads off, you're
done,'' Burt recalls Coach Bill Parcells telling his core
defenders, and him thinking that if he was going to enjoy the
remainder of his defining athletic event on the sideline, his
firstborn was going to be right there with him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon little Jimmy was down on the field, slapping palms with
Lawrence Taylor, 5 yards onto the actual playing field as the game
wound down at the far end. Then he was on his father's shoulders,
which is where most of us remember him, can still picture him, even
though he is now 5 feet 11 inches, 225 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all kind of vague in my mind,'' 17-year-old Jimmy Burt
said of his wild Rose Bowl ride. ``But it's all in there,
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Materially, there is little resemblance between the teen-age
lives of father and son. Jim Burt, now 39, makes a living as the
proprietor of a limousine service, and he also has a seat on the
New York Stock Exchange. He raises two children with his wife,
Colleen, in an upscale suburb, but he grew up in Buffalo, a
blue-collar kid whose Christmas vacations were spent braving the
blustery winter aboard his father's truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a Pepsi distributorship,'' Burt said. ``My brother and
I were out there with him. We knew the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt went to the University of Miami on a football scholarship,
and his son already has a three-quarter scholarship offer to the
same school. Except the younger Burt's deal is for baseball, and
his father would rather he go someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him go to Harvard,'' Burt said, proud to say
that his son, with a 97 average and 1400 board score, is wanted in
such high academic places as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Burt is an all-state center fielder at Bergen Catholic,
where he has also anchored the football team's defense from his
linebacker position. Four years running, he has gone to school, to
practice, to the gym to lift, to the batting cage to hit. His
father could see in him a familiar determination, a common grit,
and something more, what Jim Burt called ``a work ethic four years
beyond my own maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a ball was hit, a weight was lifted, every page of
homework had to be done. ``That's my wife's influence,'' Burt said,
laughing. ``We call her the warden.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also realizes that no child can be forced to achieve at
that level if it isn't coming from deep inside. His son has
evolved. Burt has watched him make the same football hits he did,
and as good as that feels, nothing compares to the instant an
offspring's life comes sharply into focus as one that is caring,
and smart.
</P>
<P>
   And this brings Jim and Jimmy Burt to what was most likely the
boy's last football game, two Friday nights ago, a scholastic title
showdown at, of all places, Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jim Burt has relished standing on the sideline,
helping out when he could along with his former teammate, George
Martin, whose son, Aaron, has been the team's star receiver. But
football is not forever, and it isn't always the destined path for
a football player's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is the ultimate bonding game, and if he were a couple
of inches bigger, he could play at a Miami,'' Burt said. ``But he's
got his own stripes to earn. I just didn't want to see him finish
up on a sour note, after all he's put into it. I wanted him and the
other kids to have this one, so when they are 50 years old, it'll
feel like yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The way, he might have said, 1986 still feels to him.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent for Bergen Catholic that night was St. Joseph's of
Montvale, two parochial powerhouses, a rematch of last year's St.
Joe's victory. The score this time was 35-9, the result reversed,
the game essentially over by the fourth quarter, but not ending
fast enough for Jim Burt.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd of about 16,000, he sat behind the bench, near
midfield, with his wife and 9-year-old daughter, Ashley, and so
many others who knew young Jimmy when he was that wide-eyed kid
atop the Super Bowl wave. Only now he was the one celebrating on
the field. He was the one working his way up to the stands,
climbing the rail, reaching out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for everything,'' he told his father. ``Thank you so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a hug, a kiss, some tears.

a bridge he began building 12 years past.

ADULTERY ALONE OFTEN FAILS TO PROMPT A MILITARY PROSECUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Rear Adm. John Scudi had been more discreet _ if
the rovings of his heart had not drawn witnesses and whispering _
he might still be sitting quietly behind a desk at the Pentagon,
his career, reputation and pension intact.
</P>
<P>
   If the transgressions attributed to him were merely sexual, and
not entwined with other accusations of wrongdoing, he probably
would not be under house arrest at the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But what triggered the Navy's investigation of Scudi, and what
he was found guilty of early this month at an administrative
hearing, was not adultery alone. It was a pattern of deceit and
denial, of steering $150,000 in military contracts to his mistress
and then lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the fact, Navy officials said, that people working
around him caught a whiff of that corruption, compelling the Navy
to make clear its disapproval. In addition to 30 days of house
arrest and a fine of about $7,000, Scudi agreed to early retirement
at a lower rank, with a reduced pension.
</P>
<P>
   Scudi's case refocused attention on the military's widely
criticized, thoroughly scrutinized prohibition against adultery, a
rule that also factored into charges filed by the Army earlier this
month against Maj. Gen. David Hale, a two-star general.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of both officers shed further light on the
circumstances under which military officials are most likely to
take disciplinary action against men and women accused of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some rhyme and reason to these things,'' said Col.
Frank Moran, who is retired from the Air Force and is the executive
director of the Boston Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Moran and other experts on military law say that accusations of
adultery trigger investigations and punishment principally when the
adultery is flagrant enough to jeopardize the morale of a unit or
operation, when the people involved or the spouses of the people
involved hold different ranks, and when there are other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some rules of the road,'' said Susan Barnes,
a Denver lawyer who specializes in military issues that concern
women, ``the main one being that adultery is rarely made a part of
a court-martial unless there are other, more serious charges.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that military prosecutions of adultery are
even-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes and several other people who monitor the military
justice system said that women were often treated more harshly than
men. For example, Navy officials declined to subject Scudi to a
court-martial and possible prison sentence, choosing instead to
hold a closed-door administrative hearing. Air Force officials, on
the other hand, were on a course to put 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn through
a court-martial on charges of adultery, giving false statements and
disobeying orders until she publicized her case.
</P>
<P>
   Facing intense criticism and charges of sexism, Air Force
officials ultimately agreed to abandon the court-martial and to
grant Lt. Flinn, the nation's first female B-52 bomber pilot, a
general discharge last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another inconsistency suggested by a comparison of the cases of
Scudi and Lt. Flinn is that high-ranking officers sometimes draw
more lenient treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commanders are more prone to be sympathetic toward
high-ranking officers, because these are their friends,'' said Mike
Powell, a former lieutenant colonel in the Marines and a lawyer who
defends officers and enlisted people accused by the military of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The initial treatment of Hale supported that assessment.
Although the wife of an officer under his command had filed a
complaint saying that he had coerced her into a sexual
relationship, Hale was allowed to retire in February, seemingly as
a way of avoiding further investigation and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Only after those circumstances came under public criticism did
Army officials switch courses, charging Hale with 17 counts of
misconduct, including adultery, making false statements and
obstructing justice. Hale could face a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those discrepancies, experts said, there are certain
truths connecting many of the cases in which military officials
prosecute adultery, whether those prosecutions proceed to an
administrative hearing or court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials take particular exception to behavior that threatens
the orderly hierarchy of rank or smacks of the abuse of a position
of power, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Flinn had an affair with the husband of a female airman who
held a lower rank. Rear Adm. Ralph Tindal, a Navy officer who was
put under house arrest and was coaxed into early retirement in 1995
for offenses including adultery, was accused and found guilty in an
administrative hearing of engaging in an affair with a female
enlisted aide directly under his supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said that investigations and prosecutions of
adultery tended to go forward almost exclusively when someone
around the officer or enlisted person in question had lodged an
actual complaint, which happened in the cases of Scudi and Lt.
Flinn. Such a complaint suggests that the adultery is conspicuous
and may threaten the authority or respect that the person is able
to command.
</P>
<P>
   Several military officials and experts on military law said that
one reason no punitive action was taken against Gen. Joseph
Ralston, an Air Force officer who was briefly considered last year
for the position of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was that
the adulterous relationship to which he had confessed occurred more
than a decade earlier; and Ralston did not lie when confronted with
rumors about it.
</P>
<P>
   But his career did suffer. After his admission became public, he
was essentially forced by public pressure to withdraw his name from
consideration for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One big factor is the notoriety of the thing,'' said John
Jenkins, the associate dean of the law school at George Washington
University and a retired Navy admiral. ``The adultery has to bring
discredit to the military, and Ralston's case is a perfect example
that if nobody knew about it at the time of the event, there was no
discredit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was referring to the frequently overlooked fact that
under military law, adultery in and of itself is not a crime; for a
case to be prosecuted, it must be proved that the adultery
tarnished the reputation of the military or compromised good order
or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Although Defense Secretary William Cohen emphasized those
conditions in proposing new guidelines last summer to regulate and
limit prosecutions of adultery, the conditions have existed for
more than four decades. The new guidelines _ which are still under
review _ merely spell out in detail the kinds of situations that
meet the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also underline what several military experts said
had long been the case: by and large, military officials are not
interested in ferreting out adulterers or taking a stern moral
position against adultery. When Navy commanders make condoms
available to sailors docking in a port of call, for example, those
sailors are not grilled about their marital status, Navy officials
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that
Scudi had drawn scrutiny first and foremost because of
improprieties in the awarding of contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 9 out of 10 cases, adultery cases aren't investigated
beyond the preliminary stage,'' said Robert Maginnis, a senior
policy adviser for a conservative political group and a retired
Army colonel. ``They have enough to do just keeping operations
moving along.''

EDITORIAL: A MAGNIFICENT FOREST DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., N.Y., Vt.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   What is perhaps most exhilarating about the $76 million
agreement to save about 300,000 acres of forests and wetlands in
New York, Vermont and New Hampshire is the quality of the land
itself. Almost a third of the vast acreage to be sold by Champion
International would become a vital preserve, protecting wildlife
and watersheds, as well as areas of surpassing natural beauty.
These lands feature 13 mountain peaks in New Hampshire, sensitive
wetlands and river frontage in northeastern Vermont and 29,000
acres within New York's Adirondacks that include one of the most
majestic boreal forests in the country. These woods also serve as
habitat to dozens of creatures from the showshoe hare to the
amazing carnivorous sundew plant that dines on some of the northern
forest's most irritating insects.
</P>
<P>
   The other two-thirds of the land, more than 200,000 acres, would
include ``working forests'' where, ideally, controlled logging is
balanced against preservation and such recreations as hiking,
skiing, mountain biking and snowmobiling. In some of these areas,
forest lovers will gain access to miles of lakes, rivers and
waterfalls that have been within private properties for over 100
years.
</P>
<P>
   Masterminding this complicated agreement is a nonprofit
conservation group in Virginia called the Conservation Fund, one of
several such organizations trying to preserve massive tracts of
forest land that are rapidly being sold off by timber and paper
companies. What is still at risk for this sale, however, is the
Vermont part of the package, where federal, state and private
sources must still come up with about half of the $26.5 million
required.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire parcel, the smallest of the three, is
important but not vital for the deal. New York state is the most
prepared of the three to complete its share of this bargain _
thanks to preservation bonds authorized by voters two years ago and
a strong endorsement by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 144,000 acres in New York, logging would be allowed on
110,000 acres, under state rules that should insure trees are not
cut faster than new ones can grow. Using $24.9 million of the 1996
Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act, New York would buy ``conservation
easements,'' or agreements from logging companies to limit cutting,
and would also purchase the 29,000 Adirondack acres outright to be
protected under the state's ``Forever Wild'' law. The state still
must decide whether this parcel, most of it in the northern and
western sections of Adirondack Park, deserves extra protection as a
wild forest area, with some roadways, or as a wilderness area,
where no vehicles are allowed, even mountain bikes. Included in the
remaining 5,000 acres are a 1,000-acre hunt club that stays intact
and a parcel outside the park that will be sold without state
easements.
</P>
<P>
   While the states and the environmentalists will need to monitor
carefully these ``conservation easements,'' the entire plan, which
has the support of most major conservation groups, is vastly better
than some of the other possibilities for these forest tracts as
timber companies put their lands up for sale under pressure from
stockholders. Compare these efforts with the tragedy in Maine,
where this year alone more than 2 million acres of forest have been
sold, with less than 2,000 acres set aside for preservation.

YOSEF KAZEN, 44, RABBI WHOSE WEB SITE REACHED MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (lb) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yosef Kazen, a Hasidic rabbi who pioneered the use of
the Internet as a powerful recruiting and educational tool for the
Lubavitch movement, died Dec. 1 at New York Hospital. He was 44 and
lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said Moshe
Kotlarski, his brother-in-law and the development director at the
Lubavitch World Headquarters in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Hasidic branch of Judaism is rooted in the mysticism of
18th-century Eastern Europe, but the Lubavitch movement has long
used modern means to propagate its teachings, and Kazen staked a
claim in cyberspace in the late 1980s, before the World Wide Web
existed.
</P>
<P>
   An early user of computer bulletin boards, he was inspired by
the notion of adding a 24-hour Web site to the movement's worldwide
network of outreach and study centers. He digitized and made
thousands of documents available on the Web, including an English
translation of the Tanya, a seminal text of Jewish mysticism, and
the writings of Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, the Lubavitcher
spiritual leader, who died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of the Web's popularity, Kazen's Internet site,
Chabad-Lubavitch in Cyberspace, served as a model for other Jewish
organizations, which created their own educational Web sites.
Visitors to www.chabad.org can read articles on science and
Judaism, listen to religious melodies and browse a gallery
displaying the work of Hasidic artists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to building a Jewish library on the Web, Kazen
sought to create an online congregation and to answer questions by
e-mail, operating first from his own basement and later from a
cramped office at the Lubavitch headquarters. His Internet
activities varied from helping to organize a Passover service held
on a boat near Antarctica to dispatching kosher recipes to Jews
living far from centers of Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   Kazen developed automated responses to the most frequently asked
questions and responded personally to some messages, like the
e-mail from a student in New Mexico who wanted to know whether it
was permissible to smoke marijuana on the morning of the Sabbath.
``I wrote him back that, within Judaism, the concept is that the
prayer itself gives you the high,'' the rabbi told Jeff Zaleski,
author of ``The Soul of Cyberspace'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   In his last months, Kazen kept a laptop computer in his room at
New York Hospital so he could continue his electronic
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Kazen was born in Cleveland and grew up there in a
Yiddish-speaking household, the youngest of seven children of
Russian immigrants. He became a rabbi at the United Lubavitcher
Yeshivoth in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy-set man with a carrot-colored beard, he was also at the
forefront of the more traditional Lubavitch outreach programs,
which include the ``Mitzvah tanks,'' the vans and trucks that
dispense both prayer books and tefillin (boxes containing
scriptures worn during prayer).
</P>
<P>
   He saw distinct advantages in adapting new technologies to an
ancient purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy in a black hat and tefillin comes to you, and you
have the stereotype,'' Kazen said in an interview in The New York
Times in 1994. ``When you go to the Internet and you read about
Judaism, you go straight to the intellect and the stereotypes fall
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazen is survived by his wife, Rochel; six children, Raizel,
Michoel, Shmuel, Elchanan, Peretz and Sarah; his parents, Rabbi
Zalman and Shifra Shula Kazen, of Cleveland; and six sisters,
Esther Alpern of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Devorah Alevsky of Cleveland;
Henya Laine of Brooklyn; Bluma Weinberg of Kansas City, Kan.;
Rivkah Kotlarsky of Brooklyn, and Rochel Goldman of Johannesburg,
South Africa.

ENRIQUE MARTINEZ, 72, DANCER AND DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Enrique Martinez, a ballet dancer and rehearsal
director at American Ballet Theater who staged the classics for
ballet troupes in North and South America and in Europe, died on
Nov. 17 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He
was 72 and had lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was hepatitis, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was born in Havana, where he received his ballet
training; his teachers included Alicia Alonso and Igor Schwezoff.
He was offered a contract with American Ballet Theater after Lucia
Chase, director of the troupe, saw him performing with a Cuban
company. He joined the New York troupe in 1947 and remained with it
until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez started in the corps de ballet and moved up to soloist
before becoming a ballet master, ballet director and assistant
director of American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for a serenity that did not fail him even when
tested by the most volatile of ballet stars. In 1968, Martinez
created a sunny, good-natured production of ``Coppelia'' and became
associated with that ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez choreographed and staged the classics for companies
including the National Ballet of Cuba; the Duesseldorf Ballet;
troupes associated with La Scala in Milan, Italy, and the opera
houses of Rome and Helsinki, Finland; the Milwaukee Ballet, and
companies in Atlanta, Denver, Detroit and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s and early '90s he directed and helped organize
ballet companies in Mexico; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Caracas,
Venezuela. His most recent productions, created in the late 1990s,
were stagings of ``Coppelia'' for the Atlanta Ballet and companies
in Canada and France.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two brothers, Jose and Rodolfo, and a sister,
Teresa, all of Virginia Beach, Va.

LIVINGSTON SAYS HOUSE CENSURE VOTE `NOT VERY LIKELY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMOND, La. _ Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker of
the House, diminished the likelihood Saturday that the full House
would have the choice of voting on a censure resolution when it
considers the impeachment of President Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would allow the full House to vote on censure even
if the Judiciary Committee voted, as expected, against it,
Livingston told reporters here: ``Not very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, he has been deliberately ambiguous about whether he
would allow such a vote. As one who strongly respects the committee
system, Livingston has been at pains to avoid sounding as if he
were interfering with the Judiciary Committee. But pressure is
building on him to take the reins of impeachment as the matter
heads to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also gave his strongest hints of his own views,
suggesting that President Clinton's apology to the nation on Friday
was not enough to influence his own vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief talk with reporters before he gave the commencement
address at Southeastern Louisiana University, Livingston, a former
criminal prosecutor, evinced a clear displeasure with Clinton.
``The president has his own actions to justify,'' he said. ``I will
not seek to give him counsel at this late date. A year has gone by
and we've concentrated on little other than his actions in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, judging by the reaction of his colleagues to the
president's newest expression of regret, issued from the White
House on Friday, ``it doesn't appear that it's made a big
difference.'' Asked if it made a difference to him, he said, ``I
anticipate that it won't make a great deal of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements, although vague, were the most revealing
Livingston has given so far on his personal attitude in the weeks
since he became the speaker-elect.
</P>
<P>
   Other than responding to these questions, Livingston seemed to
revel in his distance from Washington this weekend, even as the
Capitol has become gripped by the impeachment spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered a commencement speech Saturday that was void of any
reference to the goings-on. Rather, he painted a self-deprecating
portrait as a kind of knockabout who achieved what he has by having
a lot of luck and a good mother. He said he was not much of a
scholar or an athlete and was even a bad golfer who a few years ago
managed to pitch himself into a lake in a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   He told the students that from today on, they should make the
right choices, ``not sell out for money or betray my friends or my
conscience or my religious convictions,'' adding: ``If you make the
wrong choices, if you do take that short way out, you might get by
with it, but sooner or later, the piper's got to be paid and you'll
fall in the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said they offered Livingston the choice of
canceling his address because he had made the commitment months
ago, before he became speaker and before anyone knew that the
Judiciary Committee would be voting on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Clausen, president of the university, said she had someone
ready to fill in for Livingston, but ``he reminded me that he was
elected from this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure has been building in Washington for Livingston to step
into the breach. He has talked behind the scenes with Democrats,
including Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader,
and John Podesta, Clinton's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the 31 Democrats who voted earlier to
allow the Judiciary Committee to proceed with the impeachment
inquiry wrote a letter urging Livingston to allow a vote on an
alternative to impeachment when the full House takes up the matter
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston had left Washington for New Orleans on Friday by the
time the letter circulated. He has held a round of low-key events
here in his district and avoided direct mention of Clinton except
when asked. He said Saturday that he would not make any
recommendations about what the full House should do until he sees
the Judiciary Committee's report, which is expected to be available
on Wednesday.

THEODORA ABEL, 99, WHO STUDIED NEW MEXICO INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., R.I., Ill., Va., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Theodora Mead Abel, a psychologist who brought an
anthropologist's view to her study of the Indians of New Mexico,
died Dec. 2 at her home in Forestburgh. She was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Abel was a leader in cross-cultural psychological research,
which became her main focus after she retired from a career largely
in family therapy in New York, said Dr. Samuel Roll, a professor of
psychology at the University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Roll collaborated with Dr. Abel in studies of Mexicans and
Indians, including the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apaches, the Navajo,
and the people of the Laguna, Taos, Santo Domingo and other pueblos
in northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., Indians of several tribes gave her the
title ``grandmother'' as an indication of the respect they held for
her.
</P>
<P>
   The key to her success in therapy with Indian patients was her
understanding of the importance placed on a balance of life's
forces, and she often asked family members to join in the therapy,
Roll said.
</P>
<P>
   At age 98, Dr. Abel received the American Psychological
Foundation's 1997 Gold Medal Award for life achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Theodora Abel was born in Newport, R.I., and received her B.A.
from Vassar College in 1921, her M.A. from Columbia University in
1924 and her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   While a graduate student, she met and became friends with
Margaret Mead while they were lined up alphabetically to take care
of paperwork. Though they shared the same last name at the time,
they were not related. Decades later, Dr. Mead, by then known
worldwide for her work in anthropology, wrote the introduction for
Dr. Abel's book ``Culture and Psychotherapy'' (College and
University Press, 1975), written with Rhoda Metraux.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Abel taught at the University of Illinois and at Sarah
Lawrence College and later became the director of research at the
Manhattan Trade School for Girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she joined Letchworth Village psychiatric center in
Rockland County as a research psychologist. In 1947, she joined the
Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Manhattan, where she was
director of psychoanalysis.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ College football's most coveted prize looked lonely
in that trophy case. That's what the 18-year-old Californian was
thinking four years ago as he gazed at Earl Campbell's 1977
Heisman, kept behind glass at the University of Texas. His name was
Ricky Williams. He was a would-be Longhorn on a recruiting trip.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made his prospective coaches a promise right then and
there. Bring him to Austin and he would win another bronze statue
to go with Campbell's.
</P>
<P>
   He was cocky enough as a freshman to make ``heisman(AT)UT'' part
of his e-mail address, even though he was a blocking and
pass-catching fullback in a pro-style offense that first year. He
was hurt enough last year at not being invited to New York for the
Heisman ceremony _ despite being the nation's leading rusher in his
junior season _ that he thought of turning professional.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams returned for his senior year, and Saturday night at
the Downtown Athletic Club he was expected to receive what is
considered college football's highest individual honor, in what was
not expected to be a very close vote. His numbers are prodigious.
He owns all or part of 16 National Collegiate Athletic Association
Division I records, including most career rushing yards _ 6,279 _
which Tony Dorsett held for 22 years until Williams' final game of
the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest achievement, however, may be expanding the
perception of how a Heisman Trophy winner looks and acts. He looks
like an art student off the field with the dreadlocks, the stud in
his tongue and the four tattoos, the most colorful being the Mighty
Mouse on his arm. But on the field, Williams is a 6-foot-1-inch,
225-pound bulldozer who prefers to use his 4.3-second speed in the
40-yard dash to run over defenders, rather than around them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a gifted athlete who spends summers as an outfielder
in the Philadelphia Phillies organization, but whose eventual goal
is to put an education degree to work teaching elementary school.
He speaks engagingly of the evolution of the reggae star Bob
Marley, but is just as enthusiastic while discussing the legacy of
Doak Walker, the 1948 Heisman winner whom Williams befriended a
year ago and helped comfort during his paralysis after a skiing
accident. Walker died this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Williams even wants to change what the Heisman Trophy means.
Told that the trophy was college football's greatest individual
honor, Williams shook his head vigorously in dissent. ``I
disagree,'' he said. ``It's a team award.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't become a finalist without the effort and hard work
of the whole team. The best part of this whole season is that I was
part of a Texas team that won eight games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas teams in Williams' freshman and sophomore years were
better, but this year's Longhorns _ 8-3 and Cotton Bowl bound _ are
his favorite. He decided to return for his senior year last January
after a lunch with the new coach, Mack Brown, and a moving
experience at his church in San Diego over the Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who built a national power at North Carolina, assured him
only that the Longhorns would be disciplined and committed to
reversing the 4-7 record of the year before. Not a word was said
about the number of carries Williams might get or a push for the
Heisman Trophy. It was what Williams wanted to hear; he had come
into Texas with a 10-2 Sugar Bowl team, and wanted to come out with
a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bishop Joel Trout delivered a sermon at the North Park
Apostolic Church that straightened Williams up in his pew. It was
about the grass not always being greener on the other side. ``It
made me think that I was pretty happy where I was,'' Williams said.
``Why would I need to get more when I really don't need it, and
risk being unhappy?'' He liked school. He liked his frequent visits
to children's hospitals and elementary schools. He liked being a
Longhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot about life, about football, about dealing
with people,'' he said. ``You really do grow up in college.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Texas began the season 1-2 after blowout losses to UCLA
and Kansas State. Entering the season, Williams acknowledged that
any Heisman hopes he had were compromised by what most considered a
rebuilding year for Texas. He even lamented that the Heisman had
come down to recognizing ``the best player on the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, the three other players who would become
Heisman finalists _ all quarterbacks _ gained momentum that
threatened to knock Williams out. UCLA's Cade McNown was leading
comebacks and amassing 3,130 yards and 23 touchdowns as the Bruins
maintained a perfect record until the final week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Kansas State's Michael Bishop was putting up terrific
numbers: 2,844 yards and 23 touchdown passes, 14 more touchdowns on
runs _ until the Wildcats' perfect season was ruined in the Big 12
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's Tim Couch, a junior, went overland for 4,275 passing
yards and 36 touchdowns in an all-out passing attack dubbed Air
Raid.
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns quietly regrouped, reeling off six straight
victories, because Brown turned Williams' Heisman campaign into a
team crusade. They upset Nebraska, 20-16, in Lincoln behind
Williams' 150 yards and a touchdown-saving tackle he made on an
interception, which turned the game around. Cornhusker fans were so
impressed that many stayed to give Williams a standing ovation as
he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns beat Oklahoma in a game made more poignant by
Williams, who received permission to wear No. 37 _ Walker's number
_ at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, where the Southern Methodist star
played his home games.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime in a tight game against Oklahoma State, Brown
apologized to Williams for abandoning the running game to ride the
hot hand of the freshman quarterback, Major Applewhite. ``He told
me that we talked too much about his individual records,'' Brown
said. ``Then he went over to our offensive coordinator and told him
to keep throwing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns won, 37-34, Applewhite threw for a school-record
408 yards, and Williams rushed for 90 yards _ 42 of them on the
game-winning drive. Afterward, Brown asked his players to stand up
if they wanted Williams to win the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They jumped to their feet,'' said an emotional Brown. ``I mean
everybody. It was the neatest thing I've seen. This has been a
magical year.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the afternoon Williams broke Dorsett's
record, in the last game of the season against a blood rival, Texas
A&AMP;M, at Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium. He came in needing
63 yards. He told Brown that since the record run would be replayed
for years, he wanted a long one. One with style.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first quarter, Williams burst 60 yards, first
inside, then out. The record fell with Dorsett cheering on the
sideline and thousands of Longhorn-hating Aggies reluctantly
clapping along. Williams ended the day with 259 yards, and the
Longhorns ended it with a 26-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Ricky has called his own shots everywhere along the
way,'' Brown said. ``I never will doubt him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was likely that the Heisman voters didn't, either. Whether
they knew about that day four years ago in the Texas trophy room or
not, it looked like Williams would give Campbell's trophy a twin.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Underneath all the snide wisecracks and sour
insults, all the sweeping oratorical flourishes and allusions to
history, the debate Saturday between Republicans and Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee boiled down to a nitty-gritty
deconstruction of the precise meaning of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To many Republicans, voting for articles of impeachment against
President Clinton was a recommendation essentially that lawmakers
in the full House and Senate consider removing him from office. To
many Democrats, it was an unequivocal and unwavering endorsement of
his expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Republican chairman of the
committee, compared the panel's role to that of a grand jury in a
criminal case, and even leaned on the words of a Democratic
congresswoman from Texas who voted for articles of impeachment
against President Richard Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to agree with Barbara Jordan, who made the point
that the House accuses and the Senate convicts,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said: ``This is not sending the
Senate a questionnaire. This is a statement the president should be
thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument frequently delved into a legal and etymological
analysis that sought to clarify an unquestionably hazy concept and
word. Impeachment receives scant definition in the Constitution,
which accords it only a few scattered lines of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument also betrayed deep partisan suspicions and
bitter partisan rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted that by defining impeachment as a suggestion
instead of a command, Republicans were seeking political cover for
actions at odds with those expressed by a majority of Americans in
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what we have people now trying to do is to have their cake
and eat it too, to impeach the president and begin the process of
expelling him, while denying that that's what they're doing,''
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We have had people say: `Well, wait a minute. We are
not really throwing the president out. Wait a minute, we are not
really doing much more than sending this to the Senate.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as much as anybody in this room can do to kick the
president out and undo the last election,'' Frank continued. To
suggest otherwise, he said, ``degrades the Constitutional
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in response, said they were in fact abiding by the
letter and law of that process. Like Hyde, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-
Texas, invoked Ms. Jordan's statements from the 1974 hearings into
Watergate to support that point.
</P>
<P>
   Smith quoted Ms. Jordan as saying that ``It is a misreading of
the Constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to
vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be
convinced that the president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution doesn't say that,'' Smith read aloud,
continuing to quote Ms. Jordan. ``In establishing the division
between the two branches of the Legislature, the House and the
Senate, assigning to the one the right to accuse and to the other
the right to judge, the framers of the Constitution were very
astute. They did not make the accusers and the judges the same
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., concurred with that
assessment. ``So what we are doing here is making a determination
that the offenses that the president is accused of are serious
enough to warrant a trial in the Senate on that issue,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The partisan enmity that had turned the hearing room so tense on
Friday carried into Saturday, even as the drooping expressions and
strained voices of committee members betrayed their exhaustion at
the end of a grueling week that thrust them into the spotlight of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Republicans of being motivated less by the
belief that Clinton had committed specifically impeachable offenses
than by a desire to be rid of a president they simply did not like.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Chairman and members, this does sometimes, to some
people, begin to take on the appearance of a coup,'' said Rep. John
Conyers Jr., D-Mich. ``It's frightening. It's staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said that if it were a coup, it would be a
particularly pointless one. ``Now should the Senate decide to
remove the president from office, and we're a long ways away from
that, Gore will become president,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore is a man of very similar views to Mr. Clinton, and
the president and the vice president have bragged about how well
they get along and how much they agree,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``So
there's not going to be an abrupt change in the policies that the
president of the United States advances, whether that president be
Mr. Clinton or the president be Mr. Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Along those same lines, Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., recalled,
``In the waning hours last night, one of my friends on the other
side implied that we on this side were trying to get rid of the
president and being vengeful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no lynch-mob mentality over here,'' Coble said, ``and
for the benefit of the gentleman who said that last night, I've had
knots in my gut all week because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, expressed similar anguish,
along with befuddlement and regret over the failure of Republicans
to be moved by Clinton's public apologies for what she called ``a
tawdry, adulterous affair'' with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now sit to remove this president,'' she said in a grave
voice. ``We now sit to tell our children, our grandchildren that
there is no redemption.''

COMMENTARY: IMMIGRANTS FIND A TRUTH ON THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. _ Louis B. Mayer he is not. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In a nondescript strip mall here, George Jacob from Kerala state
in India has just opened a theater that shows two first-run Indian
films every night. It is testimony, of course, to the
suburbanization of Indian immigrants _ 110,000 live in the 25
counties ringing New York, 20,000 more than in the city itself _
but testimony also to the plucky, seat-of-the-pants ingenuity of
newcomers like Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mayer, the Warner brothers and the Jewish immigrants who
invented Hollywood, Jacob did not come to movies as a fine-arts
connoisseur. Mayer dealt in junk before he opened the Massachusetts
theater that became the germ of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But he had an
immigrant's visceral feel for the hungers, pains and loneliness of
a nation of immigrants and guessed that movies could provide relief
by sweeping people into imagined worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob, who operates an Indian grocery and video store in nearby
Nanuet, has those instincts as well. He wants to put compatriots in
touch with their homeland, with the ways of the parents, brothers
and sisters they had to leave behind. He also wants to help them
show their Americanized children the homeland's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a major issue we're confronting here, because you're
trying to impose the old cultural values in different
circumstances,'' said Jacob, whose family name has been Anglicized
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Jacob, who has the slight build and mustache of
Groucho Marx but is far more bashful and British-mannered, has a
story not atypical of other suburban Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital administrator, he immigrated 15 years ago to marry
his wife Saramma in a match arranged by their parents. Settling in
East Hartford, Conn., he worked as a mental-health administrator.
Then two years ago he needed to find something for his newly
arrived brother, so he started the video store and grocery.
</P>
<P>
   The store eventually stocked 10,000 Indian videotapes in four
languages and brought home to Jacob how important movies were as a
link to the old country. His instincts were cunningly grounded in
marketing principles: Prospering Indians were gravitating to the
suburbs and many newcomers were settling there to be close to jobs
at computer firms and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he took a leap, signing a lease on a shuttered twin
cinema. He liked its ample parking. ``Our Indian ladies are very
afraid about night, so they want to park very close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weeknight at his Maveli Cinema, Jacob took money at
the box office, then ushered patrons to seats. The projectionist
sold Indian snacks like peanut sweet balls and fried jackfruit to
the sparse crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For one moviegoer, Renu Kurian, a software engineer in Yorktown,
who left her mother and sister behind, the blithe romances and
domestic dramas remind her of the tight ``togetherness of
families,'' something she brought her 7-year-old, Rachel, to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrinmoy Mallik, a 27-year-old software programmer in
northern New Jersey, they relieve the emptiness of bachelorhood by
recalling love affairs back home.
</P>
<P>
   The films are laced with splashy musical numbers designed to
delight the subcontinent's vast poor populace just as Busby
Berkeley movies entertained Depression-era Americans. The stories
are often about lovers plotting to skirt arranged marriages without
wounding their parents. Shown here, where such marriages are a
touchy generational issue, the movies can start conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Now about the Louis B. Mayer part. The restless Jacob already
produces an Indian cable show in Rockland County. On vacation in
India, he met with a television executive to explore satellite
broadcasts. Then he talked with a producer friend about making
films based on the lives of Indians in the United States so
moviegoers in India can get a sense of how their kin are faring.
</P>
<P>
   The producer ``wants to make a movie about a fellow who came
here and succeeded and a fellow who came and didn't succeed,''
Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow who succeeded need only turn to Jacob as his model.

LUCK HELPS PUT STANFORD IN TITLE GAME  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ The Stanford Cardinal, a team that had never won
in six trips to the tournament before this season, will challenge
Indiana for the national title in college soccer Sunday at Richmond
University Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (18-4-2) has reached the title game with a
well-organized defense and a great deal of luck, which reached a
high point in Friday's 1-0 semifinal victory over Maryland. Lee
Morrison's header bounced off the post and off Beckett Holenbach of
Maryland before crossing the line in the 29th minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to the finals of any tournament, you need some luck,''
Coach Bobby Clark of Stanford said. ``We're very fortunate to get
to the final because Maryland is a great team and gave us more
problems than any team we faced all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's biggest challenge will come Sunday against an Indiana
team that has few weaknesses. The Hoosiers (22-2) are strong and
balanced from T.J. Hannig in goal to the last forward on attack.
They are quick, strong and fast. More important, unlike Maryland
against Stanford, Indiana can translate their opportunities into
goals.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two seasons, Indiana has been the team with the
best credentials in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament's semifinals. The Hoosiers went into the semifinals
undefeated last year and lost in overtime to UCLA, the eventual
champion. In Friday's semifinals, they played a Santa Clara team
that had defeated them all three times in previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers said they learned a great deal from last year and
they proved it with a one-sided 4-0 victory, the first time a
defensive-minded Santa Clara has yielded four goals in six years.
The Hoosiers are focused and determined to match their national
championship accomplishments of 1982, 1983 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana proved its worth even more last Sunday in its 2-1
quarterfinal elimination of Clemson, the top-ranked team in the
country. Even though that was a physically and mentally draining
effort, the Hoosiers have stayed focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys know what needs to be done,'' Coach Jerry Yeagley
said of a possible letdown by his Hoosiers after the victories over
Clemson and Santa Clara.''

WHITE HOUSE AIDES APPEAL FOR VOTES AGAINST IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House aides grimly set about the task
Saturday of securing 218 House votes to prevent the impeachment of
President Clinton on four grave charges of presidential misconduct
reported by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Aides spent the day reaching undecided members of the House and
marshaling legal and political arguments against impeachment. There
was neither hope nor pervasive gloom among White House officials,
only a sense of unreality and a determination to do everything in
their power to save Clinton from the ignominy of being only the
second President in history to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left for Jerusalem early Saturday with no further
comment on the impeachment votes beyond his latest statement of
contrition delivered on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But a political ally who spoke with the president on Friday
night, after the Judiciary Committee approved three articles of
impeachment, said that Clinton was in a state of ``disbelief''
about the week's events.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not think he would lose his job, Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., said in an interview. But he has not yet
reconciled himself to the strong possibility that the House next
week will impeach him and plunge the country into a period of
constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president knows ultimately the position of the Senate is
against impeachment,'' Torricelli said. ``I don't think he is
weighing the possibility of ultimately being removed from office.
He is more focused on the fact that he will be distracted from his
responsibilities and the nation will be engaged in a protracted and
divisive legal struggle in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not making telephone calls to members of Congress
from Air Force One en route to Israel, aides said, but they did not
rule out his using free time on the four-day journey to contact
members. Two undecided Republican moderates, Reps. Rick Lazio of
New York and Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, were among the 13 members of
Congress accompanying the president on the Middle East trip.
</P>
<P>
   The White House strategy boiled down to two central elements: to
provide any wavering members of the House a detailed legal defense
of the president, while driving home the point that a vote to
impeach and remove Clinton from office would have dire effects not
only on the nation but on the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The president's allies are reminding members that the likelihood
that the Senate will not convict Clinton does not lessen the import
of next week's House vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them that a vote for impeachment is not a
statement of principle or a way to punish the president,'' one
senior aide involved in the president's defense said Saturday. ``A
partisan vote for impeachment would not remove the president but
would mark this Congress in history and plunge us into a God-awful
spectacle of tying all three branches of government in knots for
months over allegations of sexual infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the White House special counsel who is
coordinating the anti-impeachment effort, said the committee's
deliberations this week have been unfair and deeply partisan, and
have alienated the American people.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded Congress again of what the public has been saying in
polls since the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the members of the House of Representatives to
approach this grave and solemn duty with an open heart, with an
open mind, and with a full appreciation of the desires of the
American people,'' Craig said. ``For in the end, the American
people will make the final judgment about whether the impeachment
of this president is in the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   White House political advisers began making naked political
appeals to undecided moderate Republicans to try to sway their
votes, arguing that a public that opposes the removal of Clinton by
a wide margin would not soon forget their votes and would punish
them at the polls in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time believing that a great and storied
political party is this hellbent on its political destruction,'' a
senior White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   White House polls taken late this week showed no slippage in
support for the president, aides said. Clinton's job approval
rating is at nearly 70 percent and two-thirds of Americans oppose
his removal from office, according to an official familiar with the
poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been absolutely zero change through all of this,''
the official said. He said that only about 25 percent of
respondents believe that the House will actually impeach the
president, based on what they have seen so far of the case against
him. ``They are going to be angry if Congress proves them wrong,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said House Democratic leaders have told him there is
no way to predict how the House will vote on the impeachment
resolution at the end of next week. White House officials are
operating on the same assumption, although they are prepared for
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're hurtling toward a partisan impeachment, but
there definitely are enough undecideds to result in a different
outcome,'' one top presidential aide said. ``This reminds me of
Rosemary in the movie `Rosemary's Baby' waking up and seeing chaos
all around her and saying, `This is no dream, this is really
happening.'''

JOHNSON VS. PARCELLS: A BATTLE OF COMMANDING COACHES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They are the only coaches in pro football who receive as
much attention as the teams they run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about me and Jimmy Johnson,'' the Jets' Bill
Parcells told the news media as he prepared _ or rather got his
team to prepare _ to face the Dolphins Sunday night. Parcells was
suddenly so retiring that he even said that he had posed for a
picture for Sports Illustrated only on the condition that they not
put him on its cover. When they did, he said the magazine had
broken a promise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, try as he might, it has been impossible to deflect
attention from these two commanding coaches.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the ruins of a 1-15 record in 1996, Parcells has
prodded the Jets into playoff contention, with a 9-4 record and a
share of first place with the Dolphins in the American Conference
East Division.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson has turned the Dolphins almost upside down, stamped
them in his image, brought in younger players, and energized them
again. First he did it with the Tom Landry's Cowboys; now he has
done it with Don Shula's Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder these are two coaches with tremendous respect for each
other. Parcells recognized Johnson's talents in his first woeful
season in leading the Cowboys to a 1-15 record in 1989. ``I told
other people that he was a good coach,'' Parcells recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when Parcells was out of football and
Johnson's Cowboys were 3-1 early in the season, Johnson asked
Parcells for advice on how to prepare for Super Bowl week. That is
how confident Johnson was, and how much respect he had for
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   How could the two have known then that they would become
dominant figures in another conference _ one that symbolized a
different brand of football but now, with New England and Buffalo
only a game behind the Jets and the Dolphins, features the tightest
four-team race in the National Football League?
</P>
<P>
   In Parcells' nearly two seasons at the Jets' controls, they have
produced the same record as the Dolphins: 18-11. The Jets' record
over the span is even better than the Patriots' team Parcells left
after 1996. New England is 17-12.
</P>
<P>
   A Jets victory against the Dolphins would send them into the
playoffs for the first time since 1991. It would also put them in
this favorable position: they would need to win only one of the two
final games to capture their first division championship since they
were in the American Football League back in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Parcells were once the crowned heads of the National
Conference East, which seems like a generation ago. Each won a pair
of Super Bowls. Then Johnson battled Jerry Jones in Dallas and went
into television. He was coaxed back into coaching when the
Dolphins' owner, Wayne Huizenga, gave him complete control of the
team in 1996, along with the league's highest coaching-general
manager salary of $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells chafed under the restrictions he endured at New
England. He had joined the Patriots after having gone into
television following his second Super Bowl victory with the Giants.
But Parcells lost the total control he had been promised; the team
was sold to Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets offered him everything he wanted, and gave him even
more money than Johnson, at $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both Johnson and Parcells have been concerned with the push and
pull that coaching had on their lives. Parcells gave up coaching
the Giants, in part, because of health concerns. He has had three
heart procedures in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   During his television days, Johnson once recalled: ``When I was
coaching, I had a very difficult time handling a loss, a difficult
time breaking away. I lived three blocks from the office, and every
day I was in town, I was there. Winning football games was what I
thought about when I went to bed and when I woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars is in the rare position of having played for both
coaches. Now the Jets' fullback, Byars played briefly under Johnson
before being cut after four games in 1996. Byars has refused to
talk about Johnson, saying with a smile, ``It'll be in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   But before this game and this clash between coaches and teams,
Byars reflected on life under both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both coaches say, `I need you to get to the other side of the
wall,''' Byars said. ``Jimmy will say, `Go through the wall to get
to the other side.' Bill will say, `Through the wall over the wall,
under the wall, around the wall, just make sure you're on the other
side by 12 o'clock.' With Jimmy it's, `There's no other way.' Bill
is more adaptable than people give him credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' punter, John Kidd, has also played for both men. He is
the Dolphins' record-holder for highest career punting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as their philosophy in running a team, basics,
discipline, no-excuses, get the job done or get out _ it's the
same,'' Kidd said. ``Both guys are perceived by fans as being
gruff, intimidating. People see them on television. But both of
them have very positive personalities. Jimmy allows himself to be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noticeable difference to me is this team, with guys from
New England and Pepper Johnson from the Giants. There's a sense of
loyalty. We just didn't get a lot of guys from Dallas. I don't know
what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd himself was cut by the Dolphins earlier this season
because, he believes, ``I missed two weeks of training camp and
with Jimmy's way of doing things, if you miss camp, you're in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most succinct assessment of the two was given
last year by a place-kicker named Joe Nedney, who had just been cut
by the Dolphins and was given a tryout with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it was like to go from Johnson to Parcells, he said,
``Like going to a parallel universe.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ZEBRAS ARE UNDER A LARGER MAGNIFYING GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What will pro football's zebras do Sunday? Will an official
signal a touchdown even if a ballcarrier has been stopped short of
the goal line? Will an official declare a pass complete even if the
receiver is out of bounds? Will an official confuse heads with
tails during the coin toss?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the zebras do or don't do surely will affect the
opinions of the eight general managers and coaches on the National
Football League's competition committee in their Tuesday conference
call to discuss the possibility of restoring instant replay for the
Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   An absence of game-turning embarrassments could cool the
controversy for now, postponing a ballot until the NFL meetings in
March.
</P>
<P>
   More game-turning evidence of the zebras' fallibility could
provoke a proposal that the 31 club owners would vote on soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren, the Green Bay coach, and Rich McKay, the Tampa
Bay general manager, are the co-chairmen of the competition
committee. It also includes two other coaches (Dennis Green of
Minnesota and Bill Cowher of Pittsburgh) and four other general
managers (Jerry Jones of Dallas, Bill Polian of Indianapolis, Mike
Brown of Cincinnati and Charlie Casserly of Washington).
</P>
<P>
   But with the zebras under a larger magnifying glass than ever
before, if it doesn't appear that there are at least the required
24 votes to suddenly restore instant replay for the playoffs, which
begin on the Jan. 2-3 weekend, the committee might not bother
proposing that all 31 clubs vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the Giants co-owner who is the NFL's most
respected club owner, has consistently voted no and is now, as he
said last week, ``absolutely opposed to rushing into replay.''
Several other clubs among the 21 that voted yes at last March's
meeting also are reported to be opposed now.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's telephonic discussion on Tuesday, with
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and George Young, its vice president
for football operations, listening in, isn't expected to involve
the merits of instant replay so much as the merits of suddenly
using it in the playoffs, presumably with some sort of coach's
challenge system, after not having used it throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposed coach's challenge system, a team would lose a
timeout if the call were not reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay has always been favored here, but a coach's
challenge system adds a different dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a controversial play occurs near a coach on the sideline,
or at least along his sideline, a coach usually won't be able to
tell immediately if an official's call should be challenged. Bill
Parcells, for example, couldn't see if his Jets quarterback, Vinny
Testaverde, was in the end zone last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells reacted to the incorrect call of Earnie Frantz, the
head linesman who, according to one CBS camera angle, appeared to
be trailing the play by a yard or two.
</P>
<P>
   Under a challenge system, a head coach on the sideline would
usually need to depend on his players or on an assistant coach
looking at a television monitor in the coaches' booth upstairs to
alert him as to whether a call should be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem right to ask a coach to suddenly adapt to a
challenge system in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When a challenge system was tested in this year's preseason
games, 10 calls were challenged. Seven were upheld (including a
down-by-contact call that wasn't eligible for review) and three
were reversed (including one that was incorrectly reversed and
another down-by-contact call that wasn't eligible for review).
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine teams that challenged a call in the preseason, only
Denver is assured of a playoff berth. Miami, New England,
Pittsburgh, Oakland and Tampa Bay are playoff contenders. Seattle
and the Giants are long shots, and Carolina has no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine clubs that voted no on instant replay at last
March's meeting, only Buffalo, Oakland, Tampa Bay and Arizona are
alive for the playoffs. Ralph Wilson, the Bills' owner, has said he
would vote yes for the playoffs, but Tampa Bay isn't sure. Bill
Bidwill, the Cardinals' owner, is still opposed. So, presumably, is
the Raiders' Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's doubtful that the NFL will restore instant replay
for the playoffs. Then again, what will the zebras do Sunday?

 &HT;    Oxford home to poets, novelists and writers of every ilk
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ I guess it's possible that Oxford's brightest
literary eras are all dead and gone. Think of Chaucer, Donne,
Johnson, Shelley, Arnold, Wilde _ all dead. Or think of more recent
figures such as Thomas Hardy of the dark and demythologizing ``Jude
the Obscure,'' or Evelyn Waugh and ``Brideshead Revisited,'' or
J.R.R. Tolkien and his otherwordly fantasies. Like many of the
other authors of more than 500 novels that have dealt somehow with
Oxford, these too have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it's amazing how many good writers live here even now.
Unlike lots of other old university towns, Oxford, with a
population of about 125,000, still attracts novelists and poets and
biographers who don't work at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Some are quite elderly and no longer receiving strangers _ such
as Iris Murdoch, who suffers from Alzheimer's. But they're part of
the place, even so. Some freeze a bit when confronted by a fan _ as
the novelist Ian McEwan did one morning on the street when I
recognized his face from a photograph and shook his hand and said
hello. (He was wearing a lime-green woolen sweater and wore steely
round spectacles and a certain fashionable gauntness.)
</P>
<P>
   Some put a stranger off _ as the mystery writer Colin Dexter did
when I phoned and invited him to lunch, and he replied grumpily
that he found food a bore. But even Dexter agreed to meet a few
weeks later; and even the steely McEwan was friendly over the
phone. The point, though, is that they live here. And so do scads
of other English writers, such as the poet James Fenton and the
``historian of the present'' Timothy Garton Ash and the travel
writer Redmond O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Still others keep popping up, meanwhile, such as the novelist
Julian Barnes, who went to Oxford and who said in his novel
``Flaubert's Parrot'' that there'd been enough books about Oxford.
I once saw him at the Oxford bookstore in Buckhead, and I saw him
again lately at a restaurant here in Jericho (an Oxford
neighborhood that Hardy made famous, as Dexter has again a century
later).
</P>
<P>
   The place is like that _ sort of twisty and braided and
intricate (as the Oxford poet Gerard Manley Hopkins might have
said). And in fact an excellent new book by John Dougill, ``Oxford
in English Literature,'' points out that literary Oxonians are
still so prominent in Britain that reviews of their books fill the
pages of literary reviews that are likely to be edited by Oxonians
and written by them too. ``Indeed,'' Dougill says, ``charges have
been made of an Oxford 'literary mafia' with a stranglehold on the
nation's culture'' _ even now, a good century after the heyday of
church, empire, Culture and the ruling class.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't know if there's a mafia or not. But I have noticed
that the fine writer A.S. Byatt, who lives in Oxford, has included
a story by her fellow-resident Ian McEwan in her new ``Oxford Book
of English Short Stories,'' which I see has hit the shelves in time
for Christmas not far from Byatt's own new book of short stories,
``Elementals.'' And when I recently bought a paperback of the
murder mystery ``An Instance of the Fingerpost'' _ written by the
Oxford novelist Iain Pears, and set in 17th-century Oxford _ I
noticed a blurb of praise on the novel's cover by P.D. James,
another successful mystery writer who happens to own a house just
yards away from Pears' house.
</P>
<P>
   James was born here (she went to Cambridge, by the way) but most
other modern Oxford writers moved here. Some came for family
reasons (marriage to an academic, for example, as Iris Murdoch is
married to the English critic John Bayley) but, whatever their
motives, they tend to find the place congenial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for sort of historical reasons,'' McEwan told me
after he won this year's Booker Prize (Britain's most prestigious
literary award) for his novel ``Amsterdam,'' which includes the
most hilarious sendup of journalistic Brits since Waugh's
``Scoop.'' McEwan has two teenage sons by a previous marriage in
school here, although his present wife (a journalist) lives in
London. (Maybe I shouldn't have asked.)
</P>
<P>
   The schools are excellent, he said; that's one reason writers
like to keep their families here. ``And Oxford is a marvelous place
for teenagers,'' McEwan added. ``You can get around the whole place
on a bike rather than the subways.''
</P>
<P>
   So he figures he'll stay here while the kids are in school.
``And I think I'll probably return one day to London.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more. ``I guess most of my friends who live in Oxford
are writers,'' McEwan said. He mentioned Fenton (who was elected
Oxford Professor of Poetry a couple of years ago after the poet
Seamus Heaney's five-year term expired) and another poet, Craig
Raine, and Ash, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good place to work,'' McEwan went on, describing his
street, Park Town, as ``incredibly quiet.'' It's also within
walking distance of green open country to the east, where a stretch
of never-farmed bottomland along the River Cherwell has been
preserved, and to the west, where cattle and horses graze in Port
Meadow along the narrow River Thames. ``So that's a real delight,''
said the writer whose books are rich with fateful scenes involving
long walks. Contemplative walks are personally important to him; in
fact, they're ``central to writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course the city's glorious architecture is very ``easy on
the eye,'' McEwan added; and presumably the endless crowds of
tourists haven't ruined it for him.
</P>
<P>
   One day I went to lunch at Gee's, a pleasant pseudo-Victorian
greenhouse on Banbury Road, with Felicity Bryan, a former
journalist who claims to be the only literary agent in Oxford. Her
reading of why so many writers live in Oxford sounded very much
like McEwan's: It isn't a scene for writers, but it's literate,
bookish and a nice place to live. (Bryan herself lives in a
beautiful former rectory in suburban Kidlington.) She spoke of how
French and German publishers like to visit Oxford (which can be a
very good thing for a writer's foreign sales); of the novelist
Angela Huth, who wrote the book that became the movie ``Land
Girls'' and who doesn't like Oxford (several feminists and many
socialists have felt the same way: Oxford still retains more than a
bit of the old, elite men's club); of Oxford historians and
scientists and a cookbook author, Raymond Blanc, and a literary
biographer named Lyndall Gordon, who just came out with a new book
on Henry James.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Bryan herself think of Oxford? ``I don't think
Oxford's that wonderful, really. It's a rather smug place, and a
bit sleepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan showered me with names and phone numbers. And between
those and the bookshops, between chance conversations and the
oddities of sightseeing (where did Robert Burton sit as he pondered
the next weird paragraph of his great ``Anatomy of Melancholy?''),
I soon felt overwhelmed, half drunk, out of my depth. Dozens of
living writers lived just a few blocks away. And if bits and
currents of literary Oxford's past put me off (such as its taste
for fantasy and orthodox Christian theology and political reaction
and social exclusivity), I kept hearing other things about Oxford
writers that made me eager to read more Peter Levi, John Wain,
Thomas Warton, Joyce Cary, Kingsley Amis _ practically ad
infinitum.
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief, one foggy recent morning, to wake up and
realize it was time to sit down in a popular nondescript pub, the
Dew Drop Inn, in bourgeois Summertown, with the excellent mystery
writer Colin Dexter.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter's novels about the beer-drinking, Wagner-loving Inspector
Morse _ who has redefined Oxford for millions around the world via
a series of TV dramas starring John Thaw _ do have their
traditionally Oxonian features, including an intellectual and
melancholy hero, and a harsh impatience with the modern world.
There are also dons afoot, and floods of arcane information (Dexter
studied the classics at Cambridge, as the fictional Morse did at
Oxford) and crossword puzzles and other links with many crime
novels spawned by Oxford in the decades since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways the Morse novels are realistic, current and
occasionally crude. They deal with cops, jealousy, lust, drugs,
fraud, murder, ugly buildings, tedious encounters _ and more than a
few classes and cultural backgrounds. They reflect the new
(literary) Oxford of most other late-20th century writers around
here, as well as the older more eccentric Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter got to the pub at noon and sat down at the back of the
big room with his first pint of bitter. He's shorter than Thaw's
Morse, and not handsome, and he wore a scruffy blue denim shirt and
cardigan, and he was certainly famous but he looked just like any
other 68-year-old guy in a bar. He told me to sit down on his
right, where he wore a hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many mystery writers live in Oxford, I asked. And not
just Dexter (whose novels and associated cultist paraphernalia fill
entire displays in the local bookshops) but also other writers,
whose books cover nearby tables with mysteries by Pears, James,
Antonia Fraser, Dorothy Sayers, Michael Dibdin, Edmund Crispin and
others. Why?
</P>
<P>
   The same old reasons, he said; the place is pleasant and
literary and ``overqualified.'' But Dexter didn't really agree with
my thesis. He said Oxford used to be full of best-selling crime
writers such as Dick Francis and Michael Innes, ``but they've gone
off to tax havens and so on.'' Or they've died. Michael Innes was
the mystery-writing pseudonym of the distinguished literary
historian J.I.M. Stewart, author of books on Joyce and Eliot as
well as 20 serious novels and more than 50 mysteries. Dexter added
that two former editors of a local weekly newspaper, The Oxford
Times, were fine mystery writers, ``and I used to set crosswords
for the Oxford Times, so that makes three of us from that paper
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He's an old-fashioned crime writer in the sense that he likes
his books short. He was asked to review ``An Instance of the
Fingerpost,'' but when he found out how long it was he declined.
``I'm a very slow reader. I mean a long massive book is all right
if it's Gibbon or Proust or someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he writing another Morse?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bullied to write one more Morse book, and then I'm
finished. I've had enough of Morse.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he kill Morse off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Dexter said. ``I think it's about time that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He might write one TV play, but apart from that he feels his
work is done. ``I always promised myself I'd write a book on
Housman'' _ the succinct poet of ``A Shropshire Lad'' who flunked
his final exams at Oxford but went on to become a distinguished
Latinist at Cambridge as well as a poet. But John Bayley wrote a
book on Housman that Dexter said was ``really the sort of thing I
would have loved to have tried.''
</P>
<P>
   He still reads Latin, and he spoke of Ovid. ``The `Amores' are
beautifully gentle. And so clever. Such a clever man Ovid was.'' He
called the translation of Ovid's ``Metamorphoses'' by Ted Hughes
``brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   For a plain-spoken man he sounded very generous in his comments
on other writers, and he seemed to veer away from commenting on
Oxford, which he said was ``stuffed'' with writers. But he kept
reverting instead to his own, older tastes _ to Aristotle and
mystery writers and quirky scholars and public speakers in the
House of Lords who might not be democrats (he's a Blair man
himself) but who still can speak with wonder and authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great admirer of the minor poets of the late 19th
century,'' he said _ people like Dowson and Flecker. Also Tennyson,
Hardy, Kipling, Swinburne, Yeats, Arnold. There were later poets,
he supposed _ Auden, Spender and MacNeice in the '30s (all at
Oxford, he might have added) _ but they didn't mean as much to
Dexter.
</P>
<P>
   The pub had filled up by now, and I said into his good ear that
I'd just read something by MacNeice and wanted to read more. Dexter
stared out into the room, lively with young people from the nearby
language schools on Banbury Road. I thought I must have bored him.
But he was just remembering. And after a moment he began reciting
at length from MacNeice's eminently declaimable poem ``Autumn
Journal.''

   Nobody in the pub seemed to notice, although I must say he
declaimed very well. What a delightful man! And what a pleasure it
was to be listening to such a good and unpretentious Oxford writer
recalling some poets he really liked.

 &HT;    Puerto Rico votes on its future, with statehood a popular option
 &HT;    WITH STATEHOOD-BOX
 &HT;    By Shelley Emling
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In Puerto Rico, a television advertisement shows a young
mother sitting in the sunny back yard of her Florida home,
expounding the virtues of U.S. schools and the U.S. job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With statehood, things will be just as good in Puerto Rico as
they are here in the United States,'' she says to the camera in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, paid for by a political action committee, is
just one tiny part of the battle being waged for votes in today's
referendum on Puerto Rico's future.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the U.S. Army wrested the Caribbean island from
Spain, voters will go to the polls to decide whether they want the
U.S. territory to become the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to happen, Puerto Rico would be the only majority
Hispanic state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello called the vote
in July in a gamble designed to push the U.S. Congress to address
what he claims is an outmoded relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The vote doesn't bind the United States to do anything, although
President Clinton has said that Congress should honor the results
and take up the issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Congress will address this issue because it's the
right thing to do, and also, if it doesn't, it won't play well with
Hispanic voters across the United States,'' said pro-statehood
Puerto Rican Sen. Kenneth McClintock.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot is even formed as a petition that calls on Congress
to act.
</P>
<P>
   It offers four alternatives: statehood, independence, the
current ``commonwealth'' status and free association. The last, on
a ballot for the first time, would allow Puerto Rico to be
independent while retaining some ties to the United States, making
it similar to the former U.S. territories of Palau and the Marshall
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth box allows voters to pick ``none of the above,'' a
choice the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party is pushing as
a way to protest the definition of commonwealth that appears on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The party claims that the ballot is biased toward statehood by
implying that U.S. citizenship and other federal benefits will not
be safe under the current commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   Congress granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in 1917 and
made the island a commonwealth in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   During the last nonbinding referendum in Puerto Rico, held in
1993, nearly 49 percent of voters chose to retain commonwealth
status, while 46 percent opted for statehood. About 5 percent of
voters favored independence.
</P>
<P>
   Most Puerto Ricans believe the push for statehood has picked up
steam in recent years, an assertion confirmed by recent newspaper
polls that show statehood as the leading choice among voters.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of registered voters released this week by the San Juan
Star newspaper showed statehood edging out ``none of the above'' by
49 percent to 45 percent. Free association received 3 percent of
the vote, independence received 2.4 percent of the vote, and the
current commonwealth status was favored by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill by
just one vote mandating the first-ever federally authorized
plebiscite allowing Puerto Ricans to vote on their future.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have given Congress at least 10 years to
decide whether to grant statehood to Puerto Rico if a majority of
voters had opted for that choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal was stalled in the Senate, forcing Rossello to
call his own nonbinding plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) said that the movement for
statehood won't be over even if statehood fails to win a clear
majority.
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted statehood would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would send a strong message to the Congress that
we need to move the process along,'' said Burton, who's in Puerto
Rico for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does take up the issue next year, as is expected,
statehood will be fought hard by many passionate critics, including
Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of English First, a Springfield,
Va.-based organization that wants to make English the country's
official language.
</P>
<P>
   He said Puerto Rican statehood would saddle U.S. taxpayers with
an impoverished, crime-ridden island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The option of statehood is like a fish left out in the sun,''
he said. ``The longer it is out there, the less appetizing it
becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Puerto Rico's per-capita income of $8,000 is
one-third the U.S. average and less than half that of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a boon?
</P>
<P>
   But statehood advocates argue that the island deserves a new,
fairer status. They say Puerto Ricans have been drafted and have
died for the American flag even though they can't vote for
president and have only one nonvoting member in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They also say statehood would provide an economic boon for
Puerto Rico the same way it did for Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth would double and investment would increase six
times over,'' said Alcides Ortiz, executive director of Puerto
Rico's Federal Affairs Administration, Rossello's office in
Washington, D.C. ``Plus, we'd have some say in Congress on
decisions that directly affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under statehood, Puerto Rico would gain two senators and six
representatives in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, commonwealth advocates worry that the
island's Hispanic heritage and culture would be discarded under
statehood, and that Congress would try to make English the dominant
language in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking territory where at least 75
percent of the population has a problem speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   The island is also a very conservative one, a place where
students in public schools are given five minutes to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth advocates also warn that Puerto Ricans would be
forced to pay a whole slew of new taxes, ranging from federal
income taxes to gasoline taxes, if statehood were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans currently are exempt from federal taxes, although
they do receive federal assistance _ about $12 billion in the last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under statehood, Puerto Ricans will die of hunger,'' said Luis
Munoz Marin, the first Puerto Rican governor and the father of the
commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, the issue of statehood has stirred heated debate
for decades among a population of 3.8 million people who enjoy
their own Olympic team and flag, but who also maintain strong
economic and personal ties to the United States.

 &HT;    A primer on Puerto Rico statehood
 &HT;    By Shelley Emling
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Population: 3.8 million; about another 2 million Puerto Ricans
live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Size: 100 miles by 35 miles; an area smaller than Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Both Spanish and English were made official languages
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment rate: 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Governor: Pedro Rossello; took office in January 1993 and was
re-elected last year; is pro-statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita personal income: about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Economy: Manufacturing-based; produces electronics, apparel, and
about half the prescription drugs in the United States; currency is
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Government: Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth. The
chief of state is the U.S. president. The head of government is an
elected governor. There are two legislative chambers: the House of
Representatives with 51 seats and the Senate with 27 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Politics: Local parties are neither Democrat or Republican, but
instead favor statehood, independence, or commonwealth. Puerto Rico
has one non-voting representative in Congress, who is currently
Carlos Romero Barcelo. Residents can't vote in U.S. federal
elections, nor do they pay federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Source: Puerto Rican government.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOICES:
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's vote, Puerto Rico residents will be asked to pick
from the following options for the island's future:
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth: Puerto Rico would continue as a U.S. territory and
maintain local self-government. Puerto Ricans still wouldn't be
allowed to vote in U.S. federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Free association: Similar to the former U.S. territories of
Palau and the Marshall Islands, Puerto Rico would be considered
independent, but with some ties to the United States. For example,
Puerto Rico would use the U.S. monetary and postal systems.
</P>
<P>
   Independence: Puerto Rico would become an independent nation.
Puerto Ricans would have their own citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Statehood: Equal standing as a U.S. state with guaranteed U.S.
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   None of the above.

GIANTS HOPE TO SLOW, BUT NOT STOP, THE PERFECT BRONCOS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants Coach Jim Fassel got a lot of
advice this past week when it came to devising his game plan for
defeating the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Play a conservative, ball-control style and shorten the game, he
was told. No, others suggested, you must accept that the Broncos
will score _ and then outscore them.
</P>
<P>
   Stop Terrell Davis, some said, and make John Elway beat you. No,
stop Elway, still others suggested, and reduce the game to its
basics _ a good defense against a good running back.
</P>
<P>
   Stop Shannon Sharpe. Stop Ed McCaffrey. Stop Rod Smith. Stop
Darrien Gordon, the punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Fassel said: Stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want you to choose your poison,'' Fassel said early in
the week. ``But you die anyway. Take the idea that you should
shorten the game and try to hang in there until the fourth quarter.
You can't do that with these guys, you'll just die a slow death
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some things we want to do defensively, but they
won't be gimmicks. The Broncos are too good for gimmicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fassel and his defensive coordinator, John Fox, have
faced a quandary: Because the Broncos are the National Football
League's most offensively versatile team, do you adjust your basic
defensive philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   Do you try to steer their offense toward the run or the pass
with your choice of defensive formations, or even try to outsmart
the Broncos with contradictory personnel groupings _ run defenders
in passing situations and pass defenders in running situations?
</P>
<P>
   It would appear the Giants are not interested in gambling too
often today. It could be a poison that brings the quickest death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't dictate the game to them,'' Fox said of the 13-0
Broncos, winners of 18 straight games. ``They have the flexibility
to do what they want to do. They have a tight end in Shannon Sharpe
who can play like a wide receiver and a wide receiver in Ed
McCaffrey who can play like a tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a quarterback who's a great thrower and runner and a
runner who is a great all-around player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are likely to make adjustments in their defensive
packages. The rookie safety Shaun Williams might fill the role
normally taken by the nickel linebacker, since the Giants' usual
nickel linebacker, Scott Galyon, is out with a broken leg. This
would give the Giants some flexibility in trying to cover Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel said Friday at Giants Stadium: ``Sharpe is too strong
for the defensive backs and too quick for the linebackers. How do
you defend a special guy like that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, Shannon is one of the smartest, most instinctive
football players I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking may be that Williams, who is considered a physical
safety, might offer a good matchup. He is also inexperienced, while
Sharpe is in his ninth season. The load may fall to linebacker
Marcus Buckley and safeties Sam Garnes and Percy Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   But as much of a problem as Sharpe will be, there is also
McCaffrey, a 6-foot-5-inch receiver who could be trouble for the
Giants' smaller cornerbacks. Four months after cornerback Jason
Sehorn's injury, this may be the week that the Giants miss the 6-2,
210-pound Sehorn the most.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn in man-to-man coverage on McCaffrey might have given the
Giants the flexibility to put eight men near the line of scrimmage
in an attempt to control Davis. And through all the analysis of
what the Giants will need to do this week defensively, ultimately
it seems to come down to stopping Davis first.
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel said: ``The mentality of most football coaches is that
if you can run the football on somebody, then run it. So whether
you have to put seven guys on the line to stop the run, or eight or
nine guys up there, eventually, you've got to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat ruefully, Fox added: ``The problem is that I've seen
them face an eight-man front and Davis just runs over the eighth
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he believes his defense matches up well with the
Broncos, so he is not over-thinking this week's assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't trick a team that hasn't scored less than 21 points
in any game and is averaging 33 and a half points a game,'' Fox
said. ``You're not going to stop them. There have been teams who
run real well or pass real well, but I'm not sure in recent years
that there's been a team in the league who does both as well as the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you've got to match up and try to beat them. Get up there,
get on them, our guys against their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel said: ``They're undefeated, playing for history and
the whole nation is watching. We're not exactly going to sneak up
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one last variable to the Giants' challenge, one that
might be to their advantage: a cold and blustery Giants Stadium
kind of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a typical Meadowlands December day _ cold and windy,''
Fassel said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos and Elway are used to inclement conditions in
Denver, but the swirling winds at Giants Stadium are unique, and
perhaps might prove disconcerting to Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings about what may be the only statistics that can be
cited to counteract the Broncos' huge practical advantage against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   In four career games at Giants Stadium from 1986 to 1994, Elway
threw three touchdown passes and four interceptions. He lost once
to the Giants and lost two of three games to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Giants are still decided underdogs. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON ARRIVES IN ISRAEL AS PALESTINIAN RIOTING LESSENS
 &HT;    EDS: This story will be topped following Clinton's arrival
ceremony, scheduled for 5:25 p.m. EST
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Escaping Washington, but not the prospect of
impeachment, President Clinton flew to Israel Saturday for a
three-day visit in which he will once again try to rescue the
faltering Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over impeachment raged Saturday on Capitol Hill,
there was relative calm in and around Israel after two weeks of
sometimes bloody clashes between police and Palestinian protestors.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, about a half dozen protestors were injured in
Bethlehem in the West Bank before Palestinian police quelled the
violence. The crackdown was seen as a sign that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will not allow demonstrations to mar Clinton's
scheduled visit to Bethlehem on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The protestors were not angry about Clinton's pending visit.
Rather, they were demonstrating against Israel's refusal to release
hundreds of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival in Israel, scheduled for about midnight
Saturday, marked the fourth time he has visited as president.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he will become the first American president to
visit Palestinian-controlled areas. He plans to visit the Gaza
Strip on Monday to attend a meeting of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and he goes to Bethlehem on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the brief violence in Bethlehem on Saturday, workers
unfurled 40-foot-long U.S. and Palestinian flags side-by-side on
the wall of the 1,600-year-old stone Church of the Nativity, the
site of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath and most stores and offices in
Israel were closed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
planned an evening meeting with his cabinet to prepare negotiating
positions for Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Netanayahu was coming off a bad week in which his
government was almost toppled, in part by former allies who oppose
the so-called Wye River peace plan that Clinton mediated in October
and was coming to salvage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is here to coax along the six-week-old peace plan, which
he brokered at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland but which the
Israeli government has frozen in light of increased unrest by the
Palestinians. Under the plan, Israel is supposed to continue
withdrawing troops from Palestinian areas in the West Bank while
the Palestinians clamp down on anti-Israel terrorists in their
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the violence in Bethlehem Saturday, there were only a
couple incidents of the isolated rioting that has occurred almost
daily for two weeks. In the West Bank, funerals were held for two
of the four Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers in the recent
riots. In the Arab section of east Jerusalem, Israeli riot police
with M-16 rifles were out in unusually large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say they are rioting because Israel is not
releasing enough prisoners from Israeli jails releases prompted by
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get our prisoners and our rights. If they don't let
them out we'll have an Intifada (uprising) with Clinton here,''
said Mahmoud Ismail, a 15-year-old in Bethlehem near where youths
had been throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ismail said he would join his neighbors in trying to see
Clinton when he visits the town on Tuesday.

BASKETBALL COLUMN: HEARD THE LATEST CONSPIRACY THEORIES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I were Oliver Stone, I'd be gathering material right now for
a new film on the National Basketball Association's plot to wreck
the season to save the game.
</P>
<P>
   I'd probably give the film a jokey title, ``Hoop Schemes'' or
``We Got No Game,'' so as not to scare off the Shaq and ``Space
Jam'' crowd who could wander into the theater by mistake. But this
would be a serious piece of work about a conspiracy so pernicious
it would need an Independent Referee to untangle.
</P>
<P>
   Once we nailed the NBA, we might move on to the National
Football League, although its resistance to instant replay is
pretty much the same issue: management keeping control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The really complicated stories of the week, Mike Tyson's
training camp as a psychiatric halfway house and the revelation
that those cute college kids are playing with point spreads again,
may have to be online stories, because psyches and souls are so
hard to dissect on screen without animation.
</P>
<P>
   First, basketball. Commissioner David Stern draws a salary in
the high seven figures because he is that much smarter than the
rest of us. He managed to take a struggling sport, a gambler's game
that had lost public confidence, and turn it into a hot
entertainment commodity.
</P>
<P>
   His was a simple genius; he moved the league away from mere
winning and losing, which is sport's traditional point-of-sale
strategy, and hustled it as a fashion show, an outpost of hip-hop,
a global export, a ``Cheers'' for deranged celebrities like Woody
Allen and Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern realized before the rest of us did that the NBA was in
trouble again. The NBA was becoming a mature product and its bad
boys were endangering its brand equity. Despite the minor market
correction of having Michael Jordan quit for a season, no new
transcendent crossover personality emerged. The league was on a
plateau and in jeopardy of rolling off its Just Do It edge.
</P>
<P>
   The mere superstars, Hakeem, Sir Charles, were simply old, while
the good (Grant Hill), the bad (Allen Iverson) and the ugly (Dennis
Rodman) were getting tired. Also, all those teen-agers who had been
signed out of special ed were simply not that interesting yet.
</P>
<P>
   Stern sensed the league needed a sabbatical. It had to let out
some air. The current Bulls market required a major correction.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, deep in a lockout siege. Some days the
possibility of even a postseason becomes more remote. There were
days last week when optimism rose like a trial balloon to see if
anyone cared beyond journeymen, like Charles Oakley, who need the
dough and are not getting younger. The fans, the ones expected to
rant and rave, have been acting strangely grateful for the time
off. What are they doing with their new leisure?
</P>
<P>
   One hopes they are not watching the women's winter pro league
and men's and women's college games too fanatically. Once fans get
intense about a sport, trouble follows.
</P>
<P>
   Every time college basketball spikes in popularity, ungrateful
athlete-scholars begin to wonder why they are doing all the heavy
lifting while the colleges and the coaches make all the money. Next
thing you know, some snake offers an apple in exchange for blowing
a layup. No big deal, assures the snake.
</P>
<P>
   Very big deal. Scandals divert coaches from what they are
supposed to do _ win games _ and force them to become father
figures, counselors, psychologists, baby sitters, in loco parentis,
heaven help us, teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, this will start happening in the women's
game. Once there was money to be made in women's college hoops, men
began pushing women out of coaching jobs. Now that is happening in
pro hoops as well. Before long, women basketball players will learn
to shave.
</P>
<P>
   The less said about Mike Tyson the better. Nevertheless, it is
to boxing's everlasting credit the way it senses the needs of its
mentally ill athletes to work out their problems with each other in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Football has shown much of the same sensitivity to its
performers' need for therapeutic violence, although it also
protects their right to be violent in private.
</P>
<P>
   A recent book by Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger, ``Pros and Cons:
The Criminals Who Play in the NFL'' (Warner Books), has estimated
that one of five NFL players has been charged with a serious crime.
The book has been ignored by the league, by the television sports
shows it controls, and even by the network magazine shows on the
networks that broadcast games.
</P>
<P>
   This is shortsighted. The book could get our minds off instant
replay, which is a terrible idea because it would take control of
the game away from the referees, who unconsciously make decisions
for the good of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Call it wishful officiating, which this year means wishing the
Jets win the Super Bowl and coach Bill gets to thank his sponsors,
God and Cadillac, for not locking him out.

 &HT;    Grieving woman left with doubts after disabled sister chokes to
death
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ga. _ Ruby Lawrence Clark remembers the Sunday evening
in May 1992 when she says Mary Arnold of Elberton called and said
her younger sister, Minnie Lawrence, 45, had died. Clark says
Arnold told her that Lawrence, one of three mentally disabled women
living in Arnold's personal care home, began choking on a chicken
bone and bolted from the dinner table into a nearby field, where
she died before someone could reach her.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 55, owner of a DeKalb hair salon, sits in the kitchen of
her suburban split-level. ``Why couldn't they reach her?'' she
asks. ``Something wasn't right about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark is not the only one with lingering questions. Six years
after it happened, the deaths of Lawrence and six other mentally
disabled adults in Elbert County are being re-examined, said
District Attorney Bob Lavender, to determine if neglect was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Official accounts differ from Clark's memory of what she was
told. Arnold declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to coroner's records, by the time medics arrived at
Arnold's personal care home that sunny May afternoon, Lawrence was
lying on the basement floor, the hunk of beef that choked her still
lodged in her throat. Her two mentally disabled roommates were also
in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   At Quali-tech, the day rehabilitation center that Lawrence
attended, workers who remembered her said she had a disorder that
led her to try to eat inedible objects. On the rare occasion when
lunch included meat, workers said they made sure to cut Lawrence's
portion into small bites and to monitor her eating.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Lawrence's death, coroner records say,
Arnold's adult daughter Margaret Burton told EMS workers that she
brought the women dinner _ squash, cornbread, beans and boneless
ribs _ in the basement at 3:30 and then went next door, while her
mother stayed upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   When Arnold found Lawrence in the basement, she ran and got her
daughter, who called EMS workers at 4:50 p.m., records indicate.
When they arrived a few minutes later, Lawrence had no pulse.
</P>
<P>
   According to records from the State Long-term Care Ombudsman's
Office, an advocacy agency for residents in personal care homes and
nursing homes, Arnold later told its inspector that she had sat
with the women while they were eating dinner but then had gone
upstairs for ice and returned to find Lawrence choking. She told
the inspector that she didn't know where Lawrence had gotten the
meat that choked her and that she had performed CPR.
</P>
<P>
   A photocopy of notes taken from a meeting with the Ombudsman's
Office show that center officials Lisa McKinney and Christine Wren,
along with former Region 3 Director Andrew McCollum, were among
those who met with the ombudsman. The notes say that ``Minnie
Lawrence _ did not require supervision while eating _ was allowed
to cut her own meat _ was allowed to be left unsupervised for short
periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Elbert Memorial Hospital, where Lawrence's body was taken,
the coroner's report said a doctor used forceps to remove from
Lawrence's trachea an inch-thick piece of meat, a little smaller
than a business card. The coroner ruled the death an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Lawrence grew up on a Greene County farm with their
parents and five other sisters and brothers. After Clark and her
siblings left Greene County, Lawrence continued living at home in
the country. In the late 1960s, Lawrence was raped, says Clark, who
was then living in California with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my mother passed, and Minnie went into (Central State
Hospital), she was never the same again,'' Clark says. The baby
Lawrence was carrying from the rape was delivered there, but Clark
doesn't know who adopted the baby. Lawrence remained in Central
State Hospital a few years, and then lived with an aunt and uncle
in Greene County after she was released.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, relatives could no longer care for Lawrence.
She entered the residential program of the Northeast Georgia Center
and was moved to Elbert County, where she was placed in Arnold's
home.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Clark and her family were in metro Atlanta. Her
husband's heart disease and the needs of her three children kept
Clark close to home, but she says she called about her sister
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I told Mrs. Arnold I was coming to see Minnie, she'd
tell me she was going to take Minnie and the other children on a
picnic or a field trip,'' says Clark, who admits to feelings of
regret and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell her I'd just wait till another time. My husband would
tell me to go on anyway, but I just never did. Now I wish I had.

 &HT;    `A wake-up call': Lessons learned bring about change
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBERTON, Ga. _ The state investigation of fraud and abuse in
Elbert County is not complete, but early findings have had a
galvanizing effect on state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any good that came out of that situation, it's the
fact that it was a wake-up call,'' said Carl E. Roland, head of the
Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse
for the Department of Human Resources. ``Going on trust and the
belief that people are going to do the best they can do, you can't
count on it. You need safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   DHR officials say the agency is devising policies aimed at
plugging holes in the community-based care network that has
developed in recent years as the preferred alternative to hospital
care. They are also working to put into place a review procedure
for all deaths and critical incidents, such as someone falling down
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the early 1990s, Georgia was a hospital-based
system,'' Roland said. ``We could tell you if someone skinned their
knee in a hospital but not if they got run over in the community.
We've got to have a system in which we can give assurances of
monitoring people.''
</P>
<P>
   This session of the General Assembly, the agency will ask for
$750,000 to be used statewide to pay for oversight and monitoring
of developmentally disabled clients. The agency also wants to build
into service contracts a requirement that all clients be evaluated
routinely by an outside monitor.
</P>
<P>
   While applauding these changes, many in the disability community
fault the state for continuing to focus on process instead of
outcome. They say DHR has devised a system in which issues such as
infection control and checklists take precedence over quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the Albany Association for Retarded Citizens
embodies a ``person-centered'' philosophy the state should seek to
replicate. A private, nonprofit agency that promotes the welfare of
the developmentally disabled and works to establish programs in
their behalf, the AARC serves 330 people in Lee, Mitchell and
Dougherty counties.
</P>
<P>
   One client is Emily Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other developmentally disabled Georgians, Wallace had
spent most of her life in institutions, moving from Bainbridge to
Milledgeville before returning to her native Dougherty County when
she was 34.
</P>
<P>
   There, she eventually moved into an AARC group home. Initially,
things didn't go well; her disrupting ``behaviors'' made her
parents think she needed to return to an institution, says AARC
Director Annette Bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling asked Wallace what she wanted and then, with her help,
drew up a step-by-step plan for attaining Wallace's goal of
independence. Wallace, 47, made steady progress: She developed the
skills needed for living in her own apartment; she fell in love;
and five years ago, she married Richard Wallace, 45, also an AARC
client.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Wallaces have their own house. Favorite videotapes
fill the den and a wedding photo hangs behind their bed. A plaque
over the kitchen table says ``Bless This Home with Happy Hearths.''
</P>
<P>
   They both travel on public transportation to their jobs. On
weekends, they may go out to dinner or to the movies. They visit
with friends and family. They're even saving for a Hawaiian
vacation, which they plan to take with Bowling and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   They reflect the philosophy driving the AARC, the Albany
Community Service Board, the Southwest Georgia Easter Seal Society
and other agencies in the Southwest Georgia Integrated Services
Network: Meet developmentally disabled people where they are and
help them get where they want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming a network client, every person needing help
first meets with a caseworker, along with a family member or
guardian, to decide appropriate services and programs. Once in the
system, clients offer criticisms or suggestions about the services
they're receiving or even ask for changes. One AARC client was
instrumental in having an employee fired, Bowling said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Albany CSB, the AARC offers various residential
possibilities, including group homes, semi-independent and
dependent apartment living, care provider homes _ in which a client
lives with a family _ and personal support homes. The organization,
which has a $1.5 million budget, owns two apartment complexes and
uses special funds to help clients, like the Wallaces, buy their
own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The AARC's policy-making board has numerous safeguards to
prevent problems from developing. Clients call Bowling or her
second-in-command, Kay Hiedt, at home, any time. Case managers
visit clients in their homes three or four times a week, offering
comments and suggestions, just as clients do. Members of the AARC
board also drop in, unannounced, throughout the day and evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have as many different eyes as possible looking at
things,'' Bowling says. ``We don't want to miss anything.

 &HT;    Quirky Mobile flexes its political muscle in Alabama
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Quirky compared to the rest of Alabama _ there are
Catholics and Mardi Gras here _ the Gulf Coast city of Mobile long
has been the state's political doormat.
</P>
<P>
   But after November's general election, the Port City seems more
like the Capital City. Mobile is hometown to Gov.-elect Don
Siegelman, Lt. Gov.-elect Steve Windom, Attorney General Bill Pryor
and Congressman Sonny Callahan, an assistant of incoming U.S. House
Speaker Bob Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new position for a city more akin to New Orleans than
Birmingham or Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unprecedented to have Mobile play the role it is now _
even during the antebellum period,'' said Wayne Flynt, a history
professor at Auburn University. ``It's certainly meaningful. It
would be like if Georgia politics were dominated by Savannah.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1860s, Mobile was the third largest port in the country,
behind New York and New Orleans, Flynt said. But railroad
construction the next 20 years shifted the economic and political
power base north to Birmingham and Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   That left Mobile something of a ``backwater'' town, said Flynt,
though the city re-emerged as a political participant _ but not a
significant player _ after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the city has struggled to claim its share of the
state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile in past years has not been progressive in moving itself
toward the center of the state and not being part of north Alabama.
Now, we're at the state table'' said Mobile Mayor Mike Dow, who has
overseen the construction of a new civic center and helped direct
the revitalization of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most ardent political debates every year in the state
Legislature swirls around highway funding, and Mobile nearly always
comes up short, said Scott Posey, government liaison with the
Mobile Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a little bit of isolationists as far as
government and politicians,'' Posey said. ``We've kind of kept to
ourselves and that's hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an Old South city, and like any Old South City, Mobile
wasn't big on change and didn't involve itself in a lot of the
debates over public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before rail lines, interstates and the Internet, Mobile might as
well have been four weeks away from Birmingham, not four hours.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Chris Pringle, a Mobile Republican and the former
minority leader in the state House, said the old joke with
lawmakers in his delegation is that from Mobile ``it takes two
hours to get to Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   But with transportation and communications growth, Mobile isn't
as far flung as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regionalism used to be a huge factor,'' said Gerald Johnson, a
former political science professor and currently a pollster for the
Alabama Education Association. ``But generally, regionalism has
lost its defining power.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobile state legislators will try to capitalize on having
friends in high places by pushing for public funding for the
Alabama State Docks, headquartered on Mobile Bay. Dedicated in
1928, the self-sustaining port generates annual revenue of roughly
$58 million _ including a profit totaling $13.5 million the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Gulf Coast, Alabama is the only state that does not
fund its port facilities, which are aging and need new construction
to keep up with places like Galveston, Texas, New Orleans and
Biloxi, Miss. The Alabama docks are run by annual revenue and a
combination of general obligation and revenue bonds. The facility
receives no money from the annual state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The docks, a key to the economy throughout the state and not
just Mobile, are near their annual debt ceiling at $12 million to
$15 million a year. The last general obligation bond was passed in
1990 for warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Bills that would secure state funding for new warehouses and
cranes are certain to be introduced in the March session of the
state Legislature. ``With the number of people from Mobile in
office, hopefully it will improve our chances,'' said Pringle.

STRESSORS ABOUND, MAKING CHRISTMAS THE SEASON TO BE ANXIOUS

<P>
   E-mail, voice mail, laptops and telecommuting lengthen work days
and make it possible to never leave work, reports the Conference
Board, a business research organization.
</P>
<P>
   'Tis the season to be jolly
</P>
<P>
   ``The added stress of holiday activities tips the balance of an
already busy lifestyle,'' says Betsy Vander Velde, president of
Heart of America Family Services, whose counselors are hearing more
clients complain of ``trying to do too much'' and encountering more
cases of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>

   Cookie baking. Shopping. Parties. Shopping. School pageants.
Shopping. A British study this year found that men's (not women's)
stress levels soared _ sometimes to levels found in fighter pilots
and police officers in danger _ after battling crowds of shoppers,
long lines and gift decisions.

   Layoff notices (instead of greeting cards) are going to
thousands of merger and downsizing victims around the country. The
fourth quarter is a traditional employee-layoff time as companies
prepare for new budget years, according to Richard Ornce, managing
director of Human Resource Management Corp. of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Fa la la la la la la la la
</P>
<P>
   Even people who are determined to hum through the holidays may
encounter stress at events as ``innocent'' as office parties.
Excess alcohol consumption, inappropriate sexual or aggressive
behavior, loose lips, even car accidents from drunk driving, can
have nasty boomerang effects, notes Sondra Meyer Raile, a human
resource consultant in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the sometimes awkward assemblage of family members
who _ for most of the rest of the year _ may have little to do with
each other. Archie Bunker and Meathead had nothing over some real
families, whose holiday dinner tables are marred by squabbles or
skittishness.
</P>
<P>
   As surely as ``Jingle Bells'' blares from mall sound systems,
stress shifts into higher gear for the holidays. But authorities
say tensions can be managed by planning ahead, organizing time
well, staying flexible, keeping good humor and having a clear
understanding that no one _ not even Super Mom _ can do everything.
</P>
<P>
   Some people try to ``do it all'' and feel resentful of those who
don't, notes Christine McAtee, a counselor at Heart of America
Family Services. These doers need help to set priorities, delegate
and relax, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Stress experts also recommend eating healthily, exercising,
taking private-time or meditation breaks and getting enough sleep.
And, they emphasize, be sure not to blow the budget.
</P>
<P>
   For many, that's easier said than done, particularly if
job-related setbacks, such as layoffs, are working double-time to
challenge self esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees who are laid off should not blame themselves _ or
anyone else _ for losing their jobs,'' Ornce advises.
Fourth-quarter layoffs often are due to business restructuring and
aren't a reflection of individual performance or capabilities, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that won't make it easier to wear a happy holiday face,
but it may minimize the chance of being debilitated by depression
or stress.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute of Stress in Yonkers, N.Y., monitors
different stressors according to the Holmes-Rahe scale, which
measures the magnitude of events. The stress of Christmas ranks as
high or higher than the stress of getting a speeding ticket, says
Paul J. Rosch, stress institute president.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research suggests, though, that the holiday itself might
not be the stress agent. The stress institute notes other
contributors:
</P>
<P>
   - Shorter daylight hours. The shortest day of the year falls
just a few days before Christmas. Less daylight contributes to
seasonal affective disorder, a cause of depression.
</P>
<P>
   - Overindulgence. Eating more or richer foods than usual at
parties, coupled with getting less exercise than usual because of
time or weather constraints, may contribute to ``holiday heart
syndrome,'' episodes of abnormal rhythms that tend to follow eating
or drinking sprees.
</P>
<P>
   - Altered sleep patterns. Heavy drinking, late-night parties or
gift-wrapping sessions may cause sleep deprivation that, in some
cases, manifests itself in headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The stress institute's publications also suggest that holiday
stress, sometimes called the ``holiday blues,'' could be a fairly
recent media fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1974, the Readers Guide to Periodical Literature did not
list a single article related to holiday depression,'' one of the
institute's newsletters notes. ``However, 10 years later, so many
had appeared that a separate subject heading for this had to be
created.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute for Healthcare Research issued a news
release this week stating that ``recent studies have shown that
spirituality can be a factor in the holiday blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosch, the stress institute president who also is a clinical
professor of medicine and psychiatry at New York Medical College,
notes, though, ``Although most research shows that religiosity and
strong faith are powerful stress buffers that can relieve
depression, other reports indicate that it can have the reverse
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Only partly in jest, the stress institute recommends that if the
holidays seem overwhelming, one might chuck tradition and
``consider taking a vacation to some sunny climate'' instead.

TALKS PROGRESS BETWEEN TWA, MACHINISTS UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Trans World Airlines on Friday reported progress in
federally mediated contract talks with its union Machinists, but
they have not yet reached a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to return to the negotiating table,'' said Jim
Martin, the TWA executive leading the airline's negotiators at the
talks in Florida. The latest round of talks began Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But union negotiators think no real progress was made, said
Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650 in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing bulletins that union negotiators provided to union
leaders around the country indicate that the airline continues to
seek wage and other concessions that workers are unwilling to give,
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely frustrating for our people,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped federal mediators would approve a 30-day
countdown to a potential strike instead of another round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, nothing is resolved until the last minute of the
last hour of the last day of the countdown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal mediators Friday did not indicate whether or when talks
would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists union represents about 16,200 mechanics,
passenger service employees and flight attendants in TWA's
22,000-member work force.
</P>
<P>
   TWA said that during this month's talks in Florida, the airline
and the Machinists reached a tentative agreement on more than 30
issues affecting mechanics and passenger service employees, but
none on issues affecting the airline's flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the airline offered employees a package that
included wage increases designed to lift TWA employees to 90
percent of industry parity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offers were similar in scope to the pilots' contract that
was ratified Aug. 31,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   That four-year settlement with the TWA unit of the Air Line
Pilots Association boosted pilots' wages to 90 percent of the
industry average from 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Machinists said at the time that they would not accept
a contract bringing their pay to 90 percent of the industry
average.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis-based carrier this week moved to upgrade its fleet
by ordering 125 new jets in the largest aircraft order in its
history.

PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD PUSH BANKERS INTO ROLE OF BIG BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The face of tyranny takes many forms. Its latest is a
set of proposed federal banking regulations innocuously
characterized as ``Know Your Customers'' rules.
</P>
<P>
   It's an article of faith among those who value what America
stands for that there cannot be political freedom without economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   This regulatory proposal is offered as a means to further crack
down on money-laundering criminals involved in the drug trade and
other illegal activities generating substantial amounts of cash.
What it is, in effect, is yet another attempt by the federal
government to transform private enterprises into Orwellian Big
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators in general and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in particular are reportedly being deluged with letters from
angry citizens protesting this threat to their financial privacy.
Their fears are well-founded because forcing bankers to become
undercover agents propels this society further down a slippery
slope that already invests too much power in governments.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the regulation is that it expands significantly
the types of private transactions that banks must report to federal
regulators. It calls for banks to determine customers sources of
funds, ``determine, understand and monitor normal and expected
transactions,'' and report any ``unusual and inconsistent''
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Such mandates are so ambiguous that banks may find themselves
disposed to report customers for even the slightest deviation from
normal activity just to stay on the safe side of the feds. In other
words, it makes bankers and their customers adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of such dangers, the proposed rules also require
banks to let federal regulators see private financial records
within 48 hours of a request, even without a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   This is the American way? Is it healthy for a democratic
republic to allow governments this sort of latitude to pry into the
financial affairs of its citizens? It would be difficult to justify
such power even if it were proved to be effective in fighting
society's most heinous criminals. Unfortunately, such expansions of
power have sometimes been found to be more a problem than a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Using banks as Big Brother has been typified in the past by
forcing them to report transactions of $10,000 or more. The
problem, as it usually is with one-size-fits-all regulation, was
the unmanageable volume of reports that mostly go unexamined.
</P>
<P>
   Author James Bovard, a prominent libertarian theoretician, noted
an example of how such laws backfire in a recent Investor's
Business Daily analysis of the issue. The CIA
employee-turned-traitor Aldrich Ames went undetected, Bovard said,
despite regularly receiving wire transfers of $50,000 and more from
his communist masters in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Although the spy's banks notified regulators of his
suspicious activity, the warnings were apparently overlooked
because the feds were distracted by the mountains of minutiae
created by the mass of routine Currency Transaction Reports.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here is that such laws not only are hazardous to
political and economic freedom, but also often impede rather than
enhance efforts to protect Americans from the real bad guys.

BRONCOS HAVE RISKY PLAYS AND A COACH WHO CALLS THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An example of Mike Shanahan's intellect, a hint of his now
infamous bravado, surfaced almost 20 years ago, long before his
amazing knack for coaching offensive football would lead the Denver
Broncos to the doorstep of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Shanahan was a 29-year-old coach at the University of
Florida, with a handsome mug and a mind like a nuclear physicist.
He infused a new level of sophistication into the offense: multiple
formations, new and dazzling plays _ and the courage to call them.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Florida was at home playing Southern California,
at the time a huge game for the Gators. With Florida at its own
5-yard line, Shanahan, the offensive coordinator, would make a
daring play call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Cal had them pinned and Mike called a slant play,''
said George Henshaw, now an assistant coach with the Tennessee
Oilers, who was the offensive coordinator for Florida State at the
time. ``Now that's a bold call, because if the pass is intercepted,
it's a touchdown.'' It wasn't. That pass from quarterback Wayne
Peace to wide receiver Dwayne Dixon went for 47 yards and was a key
play in Florida's 17-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A safe play would have been to run the ball, but he called for
the slant, it worked, and it turned the game around,'' Henshaw
said. ``You know what? Ninety-nine percent of coaches would not
make that call, but that's Mike. He had the smart play, and he
wasn't afraid to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was just getting started. Sixteen years later, his
Broncos playbook now resembling the Encyclopedia Britannica,
Shanahan has shown that smarts and guts do not fade with age.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Denver trailed Kansas City by three points in the
fourth quarter and faced a third-and-1 at the Chiefs' 24-yard line.
The safe call would have been to send running back Terrell Davis
diving into the middle for the first down. If that does not work,
then kick the tying field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That was Shanahan's first call. But after a timeout, he changed
the play from a Davis run to an end-zone pass to tight end Shannon
Sharpe. It was a risky move, because the Chiefs had played
man-to-man coverage on Sharpe with zone coverage behind it,
limiting him to zero catches to that point. But the play-action
pass to Sharpe caught the Chiefs by surprise and went for a
game-winning touchdown. Another successful Shanahan strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Any search for a reason the Broncos, the defending Super Bowl
champions, are 13-0 heading into their game with the New York
Giants on Sunday and flirting with the first perfect season since
the 1972 Miami Dolphins, starts and ends with Shanahan, the man
some in the National Football League simply call ``the genius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike will work harder than the next guy to find your
weakness,'' Dennis Green, coach of the Minnesota Vikings and a
friend of Shanahan, said. ``It may take him a minute, a day, a
week, a month, but he'll keep trying until he finds something on
your defense to exploit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan's plays are a combination of simplicity and elegance.
He will run them from three, four, sometimes more formations.
Defenses can't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   His nose for player talent is second to none. Davis, whose 59
touchdowns are the most in league history for a player in his
fourth season, was a sixth-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   His practices are crisp and efficient. He makes his offensive
players sprint an extra 30 or 40 yards after a catch or run, as if
they are running away from a defender in a game. That is why the
Broncos do not tire in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all of these things with Shanahan's great instincts and
play-calling courage, and it is easy to see why Denver has scored
30 or more points in 10 of 13 games this season, a team record, and
why a victory over the Giants would be the Broncos' 19th straight,
an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they are the reasons Denver has a realistic
chance to go 19-0 this season, something that has never been done
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has done the best coaching job this year, without a
doubt,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where did Shanahan get his football smarts? Even though he was
an offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Broncos
before becoming their head coach, as well as a head coach with the
Oakland Raiders, it was his three years with the San Francisco
49ers, from 1992-94, that made Shanahan the coach he is now and the
Broncos the team they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to hire him after he had been with the 49ers for one
year,'' said the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen. ``But I think the best
thing that happened to Mike and this organization was that he
stayed in San Francisco for a few more years. When I finally did
hire him, he was very well rounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who was offensive coordinator under George Seifert,
watched the way the 49ers practiced _ with no pads or heavy
hitting, so as to preserve players' bodies. The way they went after
free agents _ you can never have too many good ones. The way they
dealt with players _ treating them like men, not serfs.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Shanahan completely devoured the West Coast
offense. Then he added his own twists, like more deep passes. It is
no coincidence that when he was the coordinator, the 49ers led the
league in offense in consecutive seasons (1993 and 1994) for the
first time in team history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was always good with strategy,'' Green said, ``but after
being around that system, he just went into another dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said that he ``had a great background with the 49ers,
and I learned so much there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to incorporate what I learned with some things of
my own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan brought something besides ideas to Denver from San
Francisco _ he brought Neal Dahlen, one of the best player
personnel directors in football and someone NFL executives and
coaches refer to as ``Shanahan's secret weapon.'' Dahlen spent 17
years in the 49ers' organization, working with former coaches Bill
Walsh and Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bowlen trusts Shanahan, who has Bill Parcells-like
control of the Broncos' organization, he lets Shanahan sign any
player he feels can help the team. Dahlen helps Shanahan identify
whom to bring in.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan and Dahlen have made some solid free-agent acquisitions
in the 1990s: blocking fullback Howard Griffith, and defensive
linemen Keith Traylor, Alfred Williams, Neil Smith and Marvin
Washington. They traded for offensive lineman Tony Jones, and
snagged off the free-agent market key players like Ed McCaffrey,
Bill Romanowski, Bubby Brister and Harry Swayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person will say, `Why do you need Traylor and Neil
Smith? They are both good players, why do you need both?''' said
Green, also a former San Francisco assistant coach. ``Well, the
49ers stock players because they don't want to be good, they want
to be great. Mike brought that attitude to Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the players is half of the equation; the mind of
Shanahan is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan has taken the West Coast offense and expanded it _
flipped it on its head, really _ to the point where his offense and
the Vikings' are the most complex and unstoppable in the league.
</P>
<P>
   One week, Denver will feature a series of plays with two wide
receivers, one tight end and no backs in the backfield. The
following week, they will use the same plays, but with two tight
ends, one wide receiver and two backs.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan will take his base offense and throw in a dozen tiny
permutations, but get big plays from them. No other coach
manipulates his schemes and personnel to such extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Broncos' core running play, ``18 handoff.'' Opposing
coaches say no team executes its basic rushing play with such
precision, a testament to the focus Shanahan demands from his
players in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the Broncos are able to use the play so regularly
is that Shanahan runs it from a number of formations, keeping
defenses guessing. Davis has rushed for 1,654 yards this season,
with the bulk of them coming from ``18 handoff'' or a small
variation called ``19 handoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said: ``In the running game, we try to do some
different things to give defenses some different looks. We try to
be physical, but we're smart, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What has become a Shanahan trademark is the way he scripts the
Broncos' first 12 to 15 plays, something Walsh was known for. Doing
that enables him to probe a defense and see how it reacts, because
Shanahan is always looking for weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime San Francisco offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick, who
in 20 years with the 49ers has worked with Shanahan, Green, Mike
Holmgren, Walsh and Seifert, among others, said that Shanahan can
decipher what defenses are doing faster and more accurately than
any other coach he has ever been around.
</P>
<P>
   If Shanahan notices a team trying to stop Davis, he will call
plays for Sharpe. If Sharpe is double-teamed, Shanahan will to go
wide receiver Rod Smith, who in the last three weeks has 22
catches, or McCaffrey, the former Giants receiver who is a
dangerous deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of a game, the staff gathers information,''
Smith said. ``They may change things in the middle of a game, not
just at halftime like other coaches do. Then sometimes in a game,
we'll try things we've never practiced before. The staff trusts
us.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego coach June Jones, who lost twice this year to Denver,
said, ``Because of everything they do, that offense is as good as
I've looked at in the 20 years I've been around the league.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Chiefs game, Shanahan, dressed in a dark blue suit,
saw Sharpe in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great call,'' Sharpe said with a smile, referring to the
game-winning touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Great call, yes. But which one? In Denver's incredible season,
Shanahan has made so many.

 &HT;    Lawmakers' wilderness proposal falls outside her district
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Denver) is
writing legislation that would create as much as 1.4 million acres
of lower-elevation wilderness in Colorado _ none of which is within
her district.
</P>
<P>
   Third District Congressman Scott McInnis (R-Grand Junction),
whose district includes most of the lands in question, said he
hasn't been contacted by DeGette about her proposed bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which DeGette expects to introduce early next
year, could include Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness Study Area west
of Grand Junction. Two areas the U.S. Bureau of Land Management
will survey again this summer to determine if they have wilderness
attributes, Bangs Canyon and South Shale Ridge, could also be
included in the bill, said Jamin Spitzer, an aide to DeGette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, geographically (Colorado) is a large state, but
politically it is a small state,'' Spitzer said. ``In a small state
like Colorado, in terms of clout in Washington D.C., No. 1, you
work together and No. 2, you think about the impacts on all of
Colorado. Diana has a undying love for the state. Her dedication
and love isn't restricted to the political boundaries of the First
Congressional District.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said he doesn't know the details of DeGette's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their office has been very secretive about it,'' McInnis said.
``We can't get the details. We can't get them to tell us they will
do it. One of the courtesies of Congress is when you have a bill as
dramatic as what she would do, and it has tremendous consequences,
the thing is you extend the courtesy to the congressman whose
district it is in. None is in her district. In fact, it is a
playground for her district.''
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of wilderness involving mostly BLM lands has
been controversial for many years. Several areas, including Black
Ridge, have already been designated as wilderness study. An area
designated as wilderness study is one awaiting congressional action
designating it as wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM a month ago decided it wanted to restudy three areas in
western Colorado next summer to determine if those areas meet the
criteria necessary for consideration as wilderness study.
Vermillion Basin in the northwest corner of the state, Bangs Canyon
and South Shale Ridge will be part of that review.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness is the strictest public-use classification of public
lands. Hunting and grazing are allowed in wilderness areas, but
off-highway vehicles, mountain bicycles, timber cutting and mineral
extraction are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, for an area to be declared as wilderness, it
must meet the following criteria:
</P>
<P>
   _ It must be without permanent improvements or human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must be affected primarily by forces of nature, with the
imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must offer outstanding opportunities for solitude or a
primitive and unconfined type of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must have have at least 5,000 acres of land or be of
sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in
an unimpaired condition.
</P>
<P>
   It may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of
scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas near Grand Junction that could be included in
DeGette's bill include Sewemup Mesa, Dominguez Canyon, Dolores
River Canyon, Gunnison Gorge, Hunter Canyon, Demaree Canyon, the
Adobe Badlands and Little Bookcliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado currently has no designated wilderness below 9,000 feet
in elevation, according to the Montrose-based Western Colorado
Congress. The environmental group is part of the Colorado
Wilderness Network, an ad-hoc association of several environmental
groups working on the wilderness proposal.
</P>
<P>
   DeGette's work is based in part on a Colorado conservationists'
wilderness proposal floated in 1994, said Pete Kolbenschlag, Grand
Junction representative for the Colorado Environmental Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The conservationists' proposal spurred the BLM to do a roadless
inventory of BLM lands in Western Colorado that resulted in the
federal agency agreeing this fall to re-study Bangs Canyon, South
Shale Ridge and Vermillion Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Public comments submitted to the BLM about that review indicated
1,661 Coloradans favoring more protection with 660 against,
Kolbenschlag said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the activity and what we think to be tremendous
public support for our proposal, we thought it a good time to see
if anyone is interested in introducing legislation,'' Kolbenschlag
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Udall, a Boulder Democrat who was elected in November to
succeed retiring U.S. Rep. David Skaggs (D-Boulder), is interested
in the bill, as well, Kolbenschlag said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said DeGette has studied the issue for some time. He
said she is interested in finding a way to protect the remaining
wilderness-applicable lands before they are all gone.
</P>
<P>
   DeGette has been contacted by environmentalists, ranchers and
hunters who have all felt that without a comprehensive plan, the
state could lose the rest of its potential wilderness, Spitzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital to put as much work in the front end to figure out
a good strategy and a good starting point for discussion,'' Spitzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, though, said he is concerned that DeGette, while a
capable legislator, may not have sufficient knowledge of Western
Slope issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her bill will have a dramatic impact. I don't want to
underestimate, if it passes, it will have a dramatic impact on the
lifestyles of the Third Congressional District,'' McInnis said.
Those range from community economics and recreation to state and
federal water issues.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said at this point the map DeGette is using is in flux.
He said DeGette intends to continue discussions with people in
western Colorado, around Colorado and nationally before she drafts
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said she might want to take note of the way Skaggs
approached a wilderness proposal in McInnis' district. McInnis said
Skaggs' staff spent time working with McInnis on submitting a bill
to create the Spanish Peaks Wilderness in southern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to my colleague, she has very limited
experience in any of those fields,'' McInnis said. ``I'd be happy
at any point in time to sit down and talk about water, for
instance.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee completed action
Saturday on its bill of charges against President Clinton,
approving a fourth article of impeachment to stand alongside the
three it voted on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The final roll-call came a few hours after Clinton donned his
peacemaker's cloak and flew to the Middle East. He left behind a
capital in wintry disarray, gripped by a pervasive sense of
sadness, of once-shining hopes thwarted, with more grievous
divisions than ever between the two parties and legislative
business stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike contemplated the road ahead with
doubt and apprehension. Along with the rest of official Washington,
the president's aides grappled with the ever-more-imminent prospect
that he will face trial next year in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders prepared for a vote on the four articles
by the 435 House members next week, probably on Thursday. Chances
for a House vote on a resolution of censure, the alternative
preferred by Democrats, appeared dim. One White House official
said, ``Impeachment by the full House is starting to look
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved the fourth article, in considerably
watered-down form, by a vote along party lines of 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the president's special counsel, said in a
statement that ``the certain result'' of the committee's actions
``will be to divide the country, gridlock the government and defy
the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Nothing about this process has been fair. Nothing
about this process has been bipartisan. Nothing about this process
has won the confidence of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a session marred by harsh charges of bad faith and improper
pressure, Republicans with the backing of most of the committee's
Democrats substantially narrowed the reach of the fourth article.
It had originally dealt with allegedly widespread abuses of power,
but most allegations were removed, leaving only one major charge:
that Clinton had falsely or incompletely answered many of the 81
questions the committee submitted to him.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article as originally constituted had been considered
the weakest of the four, with the poorest chance of winning
approval in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
committee, became so exercised at one point that he exclaimed,
``This does sometimes, to some people, begin to take on the
appearance of a coup. It's staggering. It's frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   That produced an uproar among the Republicans. Rep. Ed Bryant of
Tennessee shot back, ``This is the orderly process of the
Constitution, not troops in the streets.'' His party colleague,
Rep. Howard Coble of North Carolina, said earlier, ``We are not a
lynch mob over here. I've had knots in my guts all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, one of the fiercest Democratic foes of
impeachment, accused the Republicans of showing insufficient
respect to Clinton, who, she heatedly reminded them, ``is still the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen members of Congress, some of whom have not yet
decided how to vote on impeachment, accompanied Clinton as he left
Andrews Air Force Base aboard Air Force One. It therefore seemed
probable, if rather bizarre, that the president, always formidable
in one-on-one situations, would seize the opportunity do some
lobbying on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will be able to inject any adrenaline into the
flagging Middle East peace process is another question. He is to
meet with both Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and make a number of public
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the very best of times, the Middle East has proved a
minefield for U.S. presidents. In this, the worst of times for his
presidency, Clinton is taking his own minefield with him, and it is
not clear how much influence he retains there, if any, given his
situation at home.
</P>
<P>
   The president is due back in Washington before Thursday's vote
in the House. Only Andrew Johnson among Clinton's predecessors has
ever faced such a humiliating and perilous roll-call, and Clinton
may try once again to make a statement that would swing enough
moderate Republicans to his side to avoid impeachment. But his
closest advisers said they did not know what more he could say,
beyond another expression of his regret and contrition.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried that on Friday afternoon, to no avail.
Republicans looking for an admission from Clinton that he had lied
were disappointed; most agreed with Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio that
``the president did not say nearly enough.'' The advisers said
there was no chance he would ever do so, if what the moderates were
insisting upon was an acknowledgment of a crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Impeached by the House, Johnson escaped conviction by the Senate
by a single vote, but he was enfeebled by the process. If
impeached, Clinton is expected to survive in the Senate by a wider
margin, given the close partisan division and the requirement for a
two-thirds vote to convict. But the widespread fear in Washington
is that he, too, would be crippled, with almost two years left to
serve on the second term he won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee raised that
prospect in arguing that impeachment without conviction was a
destructive idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president and the president after that and the
president after that,'' asserted Rep. Steven Rothman of New Jersey,
``will be looking over their shoulders every time they make a
controversial decision with a Congress that is controlled by the
opposition party.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his long-standing promise to try to wrap things up by
Christmas, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, gaveled the panel to order shortly before 10 o'clock
Saturday morning _ an unusual hour for a Capitol Hill committee
meeting. With the 10-week inquiry nearing its end, Saturday's
session descended almost immediately into more partisan wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three hours, the two sides had at each other,
despite Hyde's efforts to move things along. At one point his usual
civility slipped a bit as the speeches droned on, and he
complained, ``We've had everything from aardvark to Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hyde and Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the incoming
speaker, were said by staff members to be opposed to allowing a
censure resolution to reach the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Their strategic calculation was this: If members reluctant to
vote for impeachment but determined not to let the president escape
without punishment were given the chance to vote for censure, they
would not cast their votes for the more severe measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde relented to the degree of permitting committee debate
on censure. Democrats continued to push for a floor vote, to no
evident effect, with Rep. Thomas Barrett of Wisconsin insisting
that ``no member of this institution should be denied the chance to
vote his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Little of Saturday's debate dealt with the merits of the
Republican move to narrow the proposed article four by excluding
abuse of executive privilege and false statements to the public and
White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, it was
eventually approved by a vote of 29-5, with three members voting
``present.'' Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah, a Republican, voted
``no'' because he favored keeping the excised material in the
article, and four Democrats voted ``no'' to demonstrate their
opposition to the one remaining charge in the truncated article.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who will have a chance to vote in
the Senate trial as a new member of that body next year, said one
part of the original fourth article was ``the greatest reach of
all, the most absurd thing'' in any of the allegations that had
been lodged by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That was the charge that by lying to the American people in
speeches on television Clinton had committed an impeachable
offense. If he had, Schumer said, every president since George
Washington had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts restated the Democrats' case
that Republicans were starting a process ``designed to kick the
president out'' in the full knowledge that the Senate would never
do so. That course of action, he said, demeaned the constitutional
process as well as the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde rebutted him, quoting the late Rep. Barbara Jordan of
Texas, who in the committee's proceedings against Richard Nixon
almost 25 years ago said that ``the House accuses, the Senate
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's job, Hyde insisted, was simply to decide ``whether
there was enough evidence to warrant a Senate trial,'' not fully to
weigh the evidence itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., summed up his party's view by
saying, ``The House does not convict; it merely accuses.'' If the
Senate failed to convict, he said, the House's vote to impeach
would stand as a far more effective rebuke to Clinton than a mere
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is the scarlet letter,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., in a rejoinder typical of Democratic attempts to drive home
the seriousness of the current proceedings. ``Impeachment is the
removal of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank conceded that that was not literally true, but in the
House ``we hold the keys to this door,'' he said. Without the
articles, he suggested, there would be no House vote, and without a
House vote, there would be no trial.

POKER DEALING BECOMES A DYING SKILL IN ATLANTIC CITY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ It was just before midnight in the
perpetual fluorescent twilight of the Taj Mahal Casino poker room
when an uproar at a corner table grew so loud that three casino
managers ran over to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The game was seven-card stud; a player with a British accent was
holding eight cards.
</P>
<P>
   With his competitors angrily demanding an explanation, the
player with the extra queen blamed the dealer. Thomas Gitto, vice
president of poker operations, quickly scanned the scene and
noticed how the other players' cards had been splayed sloppily
around the table.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, a man in his 40s, sat silent, drumming his fingers
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him play,'' said Gitto, shaking his head. ``The dealer
made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Hollywood western, that kind of error would invariably lead
to a shootout, but in Atlantic City today, where poker dealing is
becoming a lost art, mistakes at the card tables have become all
too common.
</P>
<P>
   A change in New Jersey's strict gaming regulations last year cut
poker dealers' take-home pay by nearly 40 percent, sending many of
the most skilled dealers to better-paying jobs at Atlantic City's
blackjack tables or baccarat games or to poker rooms in Las Vegas
or Connecticut. Dealers who remain at Atlantic City's two
round-the-clock poker rooms say the pay cut has left them
demoralized. Casino managers complain that the strict regulations
enforced by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission have made it
that much harder for them to attract and retain skilled dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature recently passed a bill intended to
increase dealers' pay by letting them accept direct tips from
players, which tend to be more generous, instead of the current
system of pooling gratuities and splitting them among fellow
dealers. But Casino Control Commission officials say they fear that
such a system might encourage dealers to cheat, so Gov. Christie
Whitman conditionally vetoed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and the commission are now trying to forge a
compromise, but in the card rooms of Atlantic City, where the U.S.
Poker Championship is now being held, players say that unless some
change is made, Atlantic City will remain relegated to the minor
leagues of the competitive poker circuit.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's horrible here,'' said Layne Flack, 29, a professional
card player who flew from Los Angeles last week for the tournament.
``Half the dealers don't pay attention or know what they're doing.
If Atlantic City wants to get serious about poker, the commission
has to do something. If not, it's almost not worth the trouble to
play here.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over tipping policy has strained the complex
relationship between dealers and players, because nearly half of
the 3,000 people who play poker at Atlantic City casinos on any
given day are professionals who earn their living at the card
tables. Since poker was legalized in New Jersey, a new generation
of card players has become ensconced around Atlantic City: former
factory workers, secretaries, college students and the like have
migrated to the area, people who earn an average of $50,000 to
$100,000 a year working a 40-hour week in poker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers and players know each other by name or nickname,
socialize together in a handful of South Jersey bars, commute to
Atlantic City from the same neighborhoods in working-class towns
like Ventnor, Absecon and Egg Harbor. But most skilled players are
also stingy with tips. So when the chips are down, well, the
players aren't exactly eager to deposit them into the small plastic
tip boxes attached next to the dealers' seat at every table.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the players' luck is bad a lot of them blame the
dealer,'' said Okham Rathpakey, who has been dealing at the Taj
Mahal for two years. ``They swear at you or throw their cards. But
when they win, what do they do? Most of them throw you a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Poker players are so notoriously tight with their tokens,
especially compared to the free-spending gamblers who play other
games, that they have made poker dealers pariahs among other
Atlantic City gaming employees. When Atlantic City legalized poker
in 1993, state officials decided that dealers should be compensated
like their colleagues at the black jack or craps tables: Casinos
would pay an hourly wage ranging from $3.85 to $7.50 per hour
depending on experience; any tips from customers would be put into
a pool and distributed evenly among all gaming employees.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began when the other casino employees noticed that
poker dealers were being paid far more in tips than their players
were contributing. They lobbied state Sen. William Gormley, an
Atlantic City Republican, to sponsor a law that ejected poker
dealers from the communal-toke pool (casino employees call tips
``tokes,'' which is short for tokens). Instead, they were placed in
a pool strictly for poker dealers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City's 390 poker dealers already had to contend with
high-pressure, tedium, paper cuts, graveyard shifts and a humbling
form of repetitive strain injury that compels many of them to tote
seat cushions from table to table. So when the new law was enacted
in January, and their toke rate fell from $16 an hour to about $8,
nearly half of the Taj Mahal's dealers either quit or went out on
disability, Gitto said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the casinos have sought to soften the financial
impact on poker dealers by adding a dollar or two per hour to the
tip rate, Ms. Rathpakey said her take-home pay immediately dropped
from $450 a week to about $300. She has been forced to cut corners
to pay her bills and has had to curtail how much money she sends to
family members in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to work a second job as a cocktail waitress, but I was
too exhausted to keep doing it,'' she said. ``So now I just don't
buy as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Phillips, publisher of the web site Pokerwwworld, said
Atlantic City dealers have always been considered a cut below their
counterparts in other poker venues, and the drop in pay has made
matters even worse.
</P>
<P>
   To players, the dealers' lackluster performance means more than
just inconvenience and lost time; it means money. Skilled poker
players know they must wade through a lot of bad hands before
finding a hand worth betting. So in high-stakes poker, where
players compete for each others' money but pay the casino $16 an
hour to sit at the table, the best dealer is the one who keeps the
game moving as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm paying every minute I sit at that table,'' said Flack.
``So if I see 20 hands an hour I've got a lot more chances to win
than if I see 10 hands an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't more hands also mean more chances to lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought you were going to lose,'' Flack says, ``you
wouldn't be sitting at the table in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every other state with legalized poker allows players
to tip dealers directly, said Steve Radulovich, managing editor of
Card Player Magazine. Players say common sense, not to mention
sound capitalist theory, suggests that any dealer who is being
tipped directly would be faster and more courteous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is now, every dealer only gets a small portion of
each tip, so they don't really care what you put in,'' said Charlie
Indyg, an Atlantic City hotel owner who plays recreationally. ``But
if the dealer keeps it all, they'll deal faster, the players can
make more money, and they won't mind tipping more.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials have resisted adopting such a policy
because they fear it might encourage corruption, said Dan Heneghan,
spokesman for the casino commission. When New Jersey voters passed
a referendum to legalize gambling in 1976, state officials devised
dozens of regulations to prevent cheating and infiltration by
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The toke pool was intended to place distance between the bettor
and the dealer, especially in games like blackjack, where a dealer
plays with the casino's money and could conspire to help a player
by failing to collect a losing bet.
</P>
<P>
   But every Atlantic City gaming table is now kept under constant
video surveillance. Jack McClelland, who is running the national
poker championship, said that because poker players are betting and
playing against each other, ``it's like having eight sheriffs at
every table.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the casino commission, James Hurley, has
indicated that he might be willing to drop his opposition to the
bill to allow direct tipping, according to an aide, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the prospect of higher tips, Michelle Zames said her
days behind the card table are numbered. Last year, she had the
kind of magical experience most casino employees can only dream of,
when she was chosen to play a dealer in the film ``Rounders,''
which starred Matt Damon as a struggling poker player. But the real
world of the poker dealer is far more grind than glitz, Ms. Zames
said, so she has since taken the entrance exam for the Atlantic
City Police Department and is awaiting an opening on the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing glamorous about dealing,'' she says. ``It's
like working at a factory. Same people every day, same thing over
and over. Or like a gym, one that doesn't smell so bad. So people
ought to at least be paid fairly to do it.''

 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football fans will tell you that winning is all about
intangibles. This is particularly true when the goal is to sell the
taxpayers a $375 million stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot measure, you cannot weigh the new spirit that will
be created by an NFL team,'' Gov. John Rowland told Connecticut's
state legislators last week. On Tuesday the Legislature is going to
vote on a deal that would relocate the New England Patriots to
Hartford, a move that Robert Kraft, the Patriots' owner, refers to
in terms bordering on the matrimonial. (``We're taking an asset
we're very passionate about ... We're telling you we want to
partner with Hartford.'') Kraft has nevertheless done an excellent
job of weighing and measuring what it will take to consummate the
relationship. The stipulation describing how the state will pay him
up to $17.5 million a year in reimbursements if the Patriots fail
to sell their new and very expensive luxury boxes reads a little
like a prenuptial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has been lobbying the legislators with a mix of sports
metaphors and a sort of hard-nosed mysticism _ Knute Rockne meets
Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When they express doubt that large
numbers of area residents will pay $5,000 to watch the games in a
seat that has waiter service, the governor tells them that ``no
dream is worth having without some risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft's side of the deal is actually very specific and
risk-averse, while Connecticut gets all the parts about partnership
and passion and the promise of economic touchdowns. The legislative
leaders, who cannot be thrilled that the deal recently starred in
one of NBC's ``Fleecing of America'' news features, are pressing
the Patriots for concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the lawmakers seem eager to be won over. After
Kraft made his pitch at a public hearing last week, a state senator
from the Hartford suburbs announced he had decided to support the
project when he saw Kraft kiss his son Jonathan, the Patriots' vice
president. Almost no one has publicly rejected the entire idea of
committing public funds to the pursuit of a professional football
team that would play a total of 10 home games a year. When anyone
does, the governor just asks if there are any better ideas about
how to resuscitate Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's state capital is a physically small city, hemmed
in by suburbs that guard their autonomy like Rottweilers. It has
been the beneficiary, or victim, of lots of redevelopment schemes
over the years, which sliced up neighborhoods with highways and
drove out small businesses to make way for office towers. The night
life is so bleak that the traditional restaurant hangout for
politicians has moved to the suburbs. ``People actually coming
downtown _ now there's a novel idea,'' said Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Think of this as the Hail Mary of urban redevelopment. Everybody
knows Hartford's citizens have dozens of needs more pressing than
football, but they are needs that defy normal political answers.
The state is already shoveling money into Hartford's schools, which
deliver abysmal education at the cost of about $10,000 per pupil _
as much as the richest towns in Connecticut spend.
</P>
<P>
   The local Board of Education once embraced that spirit of risk
the governor finds so energizing and hired a private company to run
the system, an experiment that ended in disaster. The board has now
been replaced by state trustees, who are facing a long, gritty
trench war against the effects of years of patronage hiring, bad
contract negotiations and bureaucratic intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder the legislators are relieved to be talking about
something big and showy and specific _ what Hartford's mayor calls
``the Big Bang theory of getting things done.'' The state, Rowland
reminded them recently, has spent $650 million on economic
development in Bridgeport, but the most heralded achievement is a
low-budget stadium for a minor-league baseball team called the
Bridgeport Bluefish.
</P>
<P>
   The mention of the Bluefish inspired one of the lawmakers to ask
Kraft if he didn't think Connecticut would do better by finding
Hartford a Triple-A baseball franchise. ``If you think a
minor-league ball team can rejuvenate the city,'' said the owner
doubtfully. Only he, Kraft reminded them, could make their capital
the star of ``Monday Night Football.'' And how do you put a price
tag on that?

 &HT;    When the mentally disabled become easy targets
 &HT;    WITH ELBERT-SIS, ELBERT-STATE
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBERTON, Ga. _ In this rural east Georgia community, they were
nearly invisible _ Elbert County's poorest and most isolated
citizens, either mentally or physically disabled, few with family
ties and most unaware even of how to lodge complaints.
</P>
<P>
   For years, state officials allege, many of these vulnerable
citizens were systematically preyed upon by the very people who
were in charge of protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years with (the State Department of Human
Resources), and all the cases I've looked at, it's the most gross
case of system failure I've ever seen,'' said Carl E. Roland,
director of DHR's Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and
Substance Abuse. ``The checks and balances just weren't there, but
even if they had been, it's very hard when people decide together
that they're going to engage in criminal activity and exploit
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In as many as 20 cases here, state officials say, those caring
for the mentally handicapped and disabled were listed as
beneficiaries on clients' life insurance policies _ giving the
caretakers a financial stake in client deaths. Investigators
believe caretakers sold the policies to clients, then used the
clients' Social Security to pay policy premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of insurance documents show that one of those insured
clients was Talmadge Goss, a 52-year-old mentally disabled man. He
died in February 1996, a month after he was admitted to Elbert
Memorial Hospital with symptoms of starvation and dehydration,
according to hospital records. Investigators said that a $10,000
policy on Goss subsequently paid benefits to Herbert Gaines, the
Elbert County manager with the Northeast Georgia Community Service
Board, which was responsible for overseeing Goss' care.
</P>
<P>
   Goss is one of seven mentally disabled adults whose deaths are
under investigation, according to state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A center worker's concerns about the insurance arrangements
involving clients led state authorities to examine the operations
of the Elbert County office. This past February, the state began
investigating allegations of insurance fraud. That probe has
widened, District Attorney Bob Lavender said, to include
allegations of Social Security fraud, misuse of state funds,
Medicaid fraud and allegations of criminal neglect and abuse of
clients, whose disabilities include mental retardation, autism,
physical infirmities and cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation focuses on Athens and Elberton employees of
the Northeast Georgia Community Service Board, which provides
mental health, mental retardation and substance abuse treatment and
services.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made, but Lavender said he likely will seek
indictments, probably in early 1999, against some of nine workers
in Elberton and Athens who have been fired for alleged wrongdoing
since the investigation began.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from interviews with CSB employees,
state officials and investigators, along with documents and reports
obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is of a community
care network that seemed to operate with almost no oversight.
According to state reports and investigators, it apparently was a
system where state and federal benefits were misappropriated, where
client neglect was routine, and where eligibility for benefits was
envisioned as a product for sale. And it allegedly went on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The problems) took so long to detect because of a lack of
oversight systems, the lack of knowledge by the (Northeast Georgia
Center) management staff and the desire not to want to see
problems,'' said Region 3 Director Margaret Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Contract forms discovered on the hard drive of a computer used
by Betty Harper, a center employee who used to bring clients with
her to church, offer a glimpse into how profoundly the center's
social services mission may have been corrupted. One computer form
states that Harper ``will serve as a representative and assistant''
to clients seeking to qualify for federal benefits _ in exchange
for 10 percent of the benefits received. Another form ups the
benefits fee for ``consultational assistance'' to 15 percent.
Investigators said they haven't identified anyone who acknowledges
signing such a contract, but Harper's dismissal letter alleges she
helped people who weren't mentally disabled to be classified as
such in order to receive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   `C' still stands for colored
</P>
<P>
   Elbert County is nestled by the Savannah River, a few hours
drive northeast of Atlanta. Billboards hail Elberton as the granite
capital of the world, and it will be a long time before they run
out of tombstone material. A continuous deposit of high-grade
granite six miles wide and 35 miles long suggests that as long as
there are graves to be marked, there will be employment
opportunities here. For those willing to embrace the hard work of
the quarries and the sheds, a high school diploma has never been
crucial; 45 percent of the county's population doesn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   In this county where African-Americans make up 34 percent of the
population, Probate Court records of deceased black citizens still
are marked with a ``C'' for colored. But it is not a community
marred by racial tension. Black and white residents work together
and serve side-by-side in athletic booster clubs, the theater
foundation and in other community organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, complaints about discrimination and racial politics figure
into what allegedly went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all who worked for Community Support Services, the Elbert
residential part of the Northeast Georgia CSB, or for Quali-tech
Industries, the work and training branch, were black people. So
were most of their disabled clients.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few black managers in the Athens office of the
center, which provides social services to a 10-county district that
includes Elbert. And over the years, several black employees of the
center complained about inequities in promotion opportunities,
filing discrimination lawsuits and complaints with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   One was Linda Lloyd, who settled a racial discrimination lawsuit
last year after being passed over for promotion. She was in charge
of mental retardation services for the district before she was
dismissed in April.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities and several people with first-hand knowledge
of how the center works said they believe this racial climate
shielded the Elberton office from the oversight it normally would
have received from Athens supervisors. Rather than risk possible
litigation or further complaints by raising questions, Elbert
County was left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Northeast Georgia Center) was unusual because county
managers were much more powerful and autonomous than in any other
center we have,'' said Carroll Benson, head of monitoring and
evaluation for DHR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the way the agency was set up led to the breakdown in
checks and balances. The center director (Lisa McKinney) didn't
feel empowered to tackle some issues because of political
repercussions in Elbert County. The county manager (Herbert Gaines)
had more political clout there than anywhere else in our system.''
McKinney, who is a white woman, resigned. She would not comment for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   Fired officials known for hard work
</P>
<P>
   Many in Elberton have trouble believing the fired workers could
have done anything wrong. They find the allegations especially
surprising in the case of Gaines, 43, and Harper, 52, a social
services technician. Both natives of Elbert County, they were
fixtures in the center and well-known in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief stint at Georgia Southwestern College, where
he studied recreation, Gaines has lived in Elberton all of his
life. Harper's tenure with the state stretches back to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither has a college degree, both rose through the
ranks to earn about $30,000 annually in a community where 25
percent of the households earn less than $10,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   As county manager, Gaines had considerable clout, making
decisions about client placement in area dwellings and payments to
personal care home owners. He also controlled about 50 part-time
jobs involving client care _ a significant position in a county
where black unemployment runs as high as 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Harper and Gaines were known for working long hours and
when needed on the weekends. Employment evaluations over the years
laud both Harper and Gaines as workers who fulfilled or exceeded
expectations in their job duties and who valued the developmentally
disabled as individuals. Although he was suspended briefly in 1985
for verbally and physically abusing a mentally disabled woman,
employment records generally assert that Gaines had a calm,
easy-going manner with even the most difficult clients, and
excellent public relations skills.
</P>
<P>
   The records praise Harper for excellent communication skills and
note her practice of taking clients on outings. One supervisor
nominated Harper for an outstanding service award.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, a center worker going through files at the
Elberton Center offices came across some policies issued by Woodmen
of the World Life Insurance Society. The life insurance policies,
most between $10,000 and $25,000, were on center clients and listed
local employees as beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed, the worker quietly copied the documents and gave them
to friends, who passed them to Rep. Tom McCall (D-Elberton). In
January, the legislator showed the copies to Gov. Zell Miller, who
had vowed to put more effort into detecting Medicaid fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance commissioner's office and DHR were alerted. A team
of inspectors was dispatched from Gracewood State School and
Hospital, a state-operated facility for the mentally disabled in
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in March, the Gracewood report dealt a significant
blow to the Northeast Georgia Center, saying that the care provided
to many Elbert County clients was substandard.
</P>
<P>
   Information from DHR led to dismissals: Five were fired in
Elberton, in addition to four from the central office in Athens who
worked in supervisory or oversight capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Gracewood findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mentally disabled clients were living in homes with rotted
floors, no running water, broken furniture, dangerous stairways,
dirty kitchens and no heat. Bathrooms were filthy; food was
decomposing in kitchens; and first aid kits and fire extinguishers
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   _ The part-time staff caring for clients followed no formal
communication system in some cases, so someone working the night
shift might not know what had happened during the day. (Some
part-timers couldn't write well enough to record information or
keep medication logs and couldn't read the labels on prescriptions,
a former worker said.)
</P>
<P>
   _ There was little structured activity, with only 10 of 77
clients attending the county's day service center, Quali-tech. (In
the past, records show, some employees there had clashed with CSS
officials over the care of clients, and there was a history of
tension between the two organizations.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Most clients who didn't hold jobs were left alone to watch
television all day, while others wandered the community
unsupervised. One client told the Gracewood team that neighborhood
people gave her marijuana to smoke; another client stole a car and
wrecked it, damaging several other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clients reported having food stamps and money stolen, and
being physically intimidated by center employees' friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ State officials repeatedly recommended that a profoundly
mentally disabled, nonverbal woman be moved from a personal care
home where another client had choked to death. Periodically, CSS
employees assured the state they were working on the relocation,
but not until the Gracewood team intervened, was she moved _ six
years after her relocation was requested.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Talmadge Goss was admitted to Elbert Memorial
Hospital in January 1996 with symptoms of starvation and
dehydration. According to her dismissal letter, Marian Moss, 44, a
high school graduate who worked as a social worker, told doctors
not to take exceptional measures to revive Goss. He died the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines, who was supervising Goss' care, collected $10,000 from
an insurance policy after the mentally disabled man died, law
enforcement and center officials said. Copies of insurance
documents show Gaines was falsely listed as a relative of Goss.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not comment for this article, Gaines said in an
earlier interview with the Journal-Constitution that he didn't know
how he was named the beneficiary. He said he had asked Woodmen of
the World representative Don Norman, a center employee in Athens,
to remove his name from the policy and said he thought Norman had
complied. Gaines said he reported the benefit payment to Lloyd, his
supervisor, and that any insurance benefits were to cover client
funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, one of the nine fired, has refused to comment. Gaines
said he paid Goss' funeral costs, then gave the remaining money to
the dead man's family. Goss' cousin, Nellie Allen, said she told
investigators this year that she didn't receive a penny from Gaines
and doesn't know of any relative who did.
</P>
<P>
   Financial questions are raised
</P>
<P>
   The Gracewood report said insufficient funds had been allocated
for clients. In one case, $120 a month was budgeted to feed three
or four people living in a group arrangement, with another $25
budgeted for personal items and supplies. Yet, officials said
Social Security typically pays disabled clients $494 a month,
suggesting a combined sum of nearly $2,000 was available for living
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Gracewood report said, clients often lacked
food and other necessities. Some personal support workers used
their own money to buy food and cleaning supplies for group
residences.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gracewood report concentrated on client safety and
welfare, financial issues raised in the report attracted the
attention of other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appeared to be a slush fund created with food stamps and
food stamp money, and the investigators are seeing where it's
leading,'' said Lavender, the district attorney. ``Employees had
control over that money. They had petty cash funds and other
various accounts set up.''
</P>
<P>
   By early spring, the GBI's Health Care Fraud Unit, the inspector
general of the Social Security Administration and the Fraud and
Abuse Division of DHR all were involved in the investigation. These
agencies, which are expected to complete their work this month,
uncovered other financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the Health Care Fraud Unit say that center
employees may have billed Medicaid for thousands in services not
rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Center staff in Elberton were listed in some cases as payees for
Social Security checks and food stamps, according to findings of an
administrative investigation obtained by the Journal-Constitution
in an Open Records Request. The review said that center employees _
Gaines, Harper, Moss and social service technician Joyce Harris _
had control of some clients' checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the irregularities cited in the administrative findings
were checks made payable to staff members; life insurance premiums
paid by check or automatic draft; no bills found for these
premiums; checks signed with clients' signatures ``obviously not
written by them''; and accounts that were unbalanced, unreconciled
and overdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I couldn't believe (the allegations), but I kind of
got ripped off, too,'' claimed CSS client Melvin Allen, 39, who has
spoken to state investigators. He moved into his own
handicap-accessible apartment two years ago with help from Gaines
and other CSS workers. Confined to a wheelchair, Allen receives
round-the-clock help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some money, and Herbert (Gaines) said he'd keep it safe
for me,'' he said. ``We were right tight. I trusted Herbert like a
brother, so I gave him about $1,200. They try to say I spent it,
but I know I didn't spend but $200. Once you trust people and they
do you like this, it makes it hard to trust someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen differs from some CSS clients in that he receives frequent
visits from his extended family, most of whom live in Elbert
County.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the clients in the residential program had no family
support. Either they weren't from Elbert County or their relatives
were dead or in nursing homes, and they had no visitors. Most were
living not in personal care homes, but in apartments or houses,
which aren't inspected by state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people didn't have any living relatives to
check on them,'' Lavender said. ``It looked like there was little
chance of getting caught, or somebody complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Elbert County residents might spot these
developmentally disabled citizens in Wal-Mart or at a yard sale,
outings termed ``activity therapy events to facilitate community
integration.'' But authorities suggested many of these clients were
so isolated that people in the community probably weren't even
aware of their existence, much less their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they were invisible.
</P>
<P>
   `Possibility of some conspiracy charges'
</P>
<P>
   Those dismissed in the wake of investigations include Gaines and
the four women he supervised _ Moss, Harper, Harris, 44, and
secretary Stacey Rucker White, 25. Lavender said the personal
relationships between them _ if they are shown to exist _ may be
relevant ``to show how these things occurred. We are looking at the
possibility of some conspiracy charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Fired for alleged misconduct from the Athens office were
Christine Wren, 47, former head of mental retardation services in
charge of quality improvement; Norman, 61, a program assistant
working with Wren who also sold life insurance; and Lloyd, 43, the
head of mental retardation services, also for alleged misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   After winning her appeal, Wren recently reached a tentative
settlement with the Community Service Board, which reinstates her,
provided the State Retirement Board lets her buy 25 months of
service and retire by June 1999, according to CSB attorney Michael
Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Anderson, 41, a notary public who worked as a secretary
for Wren and then for Lloyd, also was fired from the Athens office.
She was dismissed for misconduct, allegedly notarizing documents
pertaining to life insurance that contained false information
naming staff members as relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine, only Wren and Norman are white. Civil rights
activist Hosea Williams has alleged racism in the firings, and
Lloyd has lodged another complaint with the EEOC. She claims the
fired employees were denied due process because they were not
allowed to offer their version of events or defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything about abuse and neglect that I knew about, I
corrected,'' she said. ``If I did anything wrong, I trusted people
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Clark, who represents all of the fired black
employees except Lloyd, said he advised his clients not to discuss
the matter. Clark also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Changes to help create safeguards
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast Georgia Community Service Board is part of the
support network created over the last few decades to help citizens
move from institutions into communities. In many parts of Georgia,
community-based care is credited with greatly improving and
enhancing the lives of the developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But in moving to community-based care, DHR officials concede
that few checks and balances were mandated statewide to safeguard
the well-being of disabled clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know there's not another (situation) like this
somewhere,'' said DHR Division Director Roland. ``But what I can
tell you is the odds are better now there's not another one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Elbert and the other counties in the Region 3 area, a private
Atlanta agency now evaluates the quality of services for 220 to 225
clients.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, developmentally disabled clients in
Elbert County have become a little more visible. Staff workers said
there are more people working in jobs in town and there is more
community support in the form of special events and activities at
Quali-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen clients kept in substandard housing have been moved to
better quarters. Among them are four mentally handicapped men, who
lived for years in an aging, dimly lit mobile home lined with
unfinished particle board. Their rent for those quarters was $800 a
month, center officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Every employee in the 10-county district _ which includes
Athens-Clarke, Barrow, Walton, Jackson, Madison, Greene,
Oglethorpe, Elbert, Oconee and Hart counties _ also has been
trained in goal-setting, documentation and program standards, while
clients have been told how to file grievances and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those who were fired used `I don't know' as an excuse
to explain what they did, so we wanted to make sure everyone
understands how we proceed and what our values are,'' said Mark
Stricklett, acting director of mental retardation services. ```I
don't know' is an excuse I don't want anyone to have.

 &HT;    Judiciary approves fourth impeachment article
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting the stage for a momentous showdown in the
House of Representatives this week, the House Judiciary Committe
adopted a fourth article of impeachment Saturday against President
Clinton and was poised to reject a Democratic proposal to censure
the president instead.
</P>
<P>
   A rare Saturday session lasted all day as the committee's
Republicans and Democrats kept up their robust, intensely partisan
debate on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With their work nearly finished and the debate on impeachment in
the closely divided House set to begin Thursday, committee members
grappled with the potential impact of impeachment if, as it
appears, the Senate would be unlikely to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether any of the four articles calling for
Clinton's impeachment for perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse
of power will pass the House. They all relate to Clinton's affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the president's
efforts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sought to assure the public and their colleagues
that a vote for impeachment does not equal a vote for Clinton's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, seeking to build support for the lesser punishment of
censure, criticized Republicans for cavalierly voting for
impeachment, knowing that the Senate most likely will not convict
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.), however, drew bipartisan praise for
his assessment of the gravity of the upcoming votes on the
president's fate. ``I'll have knots in my gut next week when we
cast votes,'' Coble said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could become the second U.S. president to be impeached.
Andrew Johnson survived a trial in the Senate by one vote in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Judiciary Committee voted three articles of
impeachment against President Nixon, who resigned his office before
the House could act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was out of the country, en route to Israel aboard Air
Force One, when the committee's 21 Republicans voted for a
watered-down article of impeachment that charges Clinton with
abusing his office. All 16 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a White House lawyer, gave a stinging statement
of rebuttal: Impeachment, he said, will ``divide the country,
gridlock the government and defy the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prediction that Republicans may pay a political price for
their actions, he added, ``in the end, the American people will
make the final judgment about whether the impeachment of the
president is in the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth impeachment article stemmed from what it called
``perjurious, false and misleading sworn statements'' Clinton made
in his written response to 81 questions posed by Republican
committee investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) called those answers ``an assault on
the Congress'' in justifying a vote for a separate article of
impeachment, rather than including the charge in one of the two
articles on perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stripped from the abuse of power article allegations
that Clinton merited impeachment because he lied to the public and
to his aides, and because he invoked the legal doctrine of
executive privilege in a bid to keep several close advisors from
testifying to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.) said the Republicans' willingness to
weaken the article demonstrated a judiciousness that Democrats have
said has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee Democrats viewed the deletion of the
provisions, proposed just three days ago, as a transparent
political tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an orchestrated dance in order to create an illusion of
respectability,'' Rep. Howard Berman (D-Calif.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans mounted a similar argument to explain their
opposition to the Democratic censure resolution, a formal rebuke of
Clinton that would be less severe than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With the defeat of the censure option a forgone conclusion in
the committee, Democrats targeted their remarks to winning the day
on the only unresolved issue before the full House: convincing Rep.
Bob Livingston (R-La.), virtually certain to succeed Newt Gingrich
as speaker, and other GOP leaders to permit a censure vote on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would plead with Mr. Livingston, do not force the House to
choose between two unpalatable options, impeachment or nothing,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). ``Please ... allow a censure
resolution ... and let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt also sought to raise the
political stakes, urging Livingston in a letter to permit a censure
vote when the issue reaches the floor. ``Your decision ... will
decide whether or not history will mark our actions as a purely
political exercise or a high-minded debate on the impeachment of a
president,'' Gephardt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Louisiana, Livingston told reporters, ``'Frankly we
haven't decided yet.'' But, according to the New York Times, when
asked if he would allow the full House to vote on censure even if
the Judiciary Committee voted against it, Livingston said: ``Not
very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he would leave the decision to Livingston and
other Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on the Judiciary Committee roundly denounced the
censure option, either because they believed it was
unconstitutional or because it was too lenient a punishment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar to yelling at a teen-ager,'' said Hyde. ``It
purges you of some of your feelings, but I don't see what it
accomplishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also argued that Republicans do not want to consider
the censure so that fence-sitting GOP moderates would feel
pressured to choose impeachment rather than no punishment at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country will not accept a partisan solution to this
matter,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett (D-Wis.). ``It will show only
that we are divided.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one U.S. president, Andrew Jackson, has been censured. The
Senate censured Jackson in 1834, but expunged it from its record in
1837, by which time Jackson's Democrats had regained their
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats warned that an impeachment trial in the Senate
next year would snarl the business of the Congress for many months,
arguing that a bi-partisan censure resolution was the fastest way
to condemn the president and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the notion that an impeachment trial will tie up the
Senate for months and months,'' said Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.).
``Such tactics are scare tactics ... designed to scare us away from
our constitutional duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats even held up one of the GOP's own to make their case.
Schumer noted that Gingrich was found by the House ethics committee
to have made false statements under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet I didn't hear a single member from the other party
call for Mr. Gingrich's removal from office,'' Schumer said. ``I
would remind my colleagues again to be fair and consistent.''

POLICE COMMISSIONER WANTS DNA FROM ALL ARRESTED PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With violent crime down sharply, Police Commissioner
Howard Safir has proposed taking DNA samples from everyone arrested
in New York City _ from subway turnstile jumpers on up _ so that
police can use new technology to lock up career criminals like
burglars and car thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Under Safir's plan, police would take a saliva sample from
anyone who is fingerprinted after an arrest. The sample would be
tested and loaded into a database at an estimated cost of $50 per
person. A suspect's DNA record would be expunged if there were no
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking myself how am I going to continue to reduce
crime,'' Safir said in an interview, noting that the homicide rate
this year is expected to be the lowest since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he said, was in focusing on crimes against property,
like burglary and auto theft, which are usually committed by career
criminals. Thus, arrests in such cases might also clear past
unsolved crimes and prevent new ones, and DNA evidence could prove
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   A professional burglar or car thief, for instance, might leave
skin or sweat cells when forcing open a door or window. ``As long
as there's one cell,'' Safir said, ``you could use this to help
solve just about any crime you could think of.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, who publicly proposed the DNA testing plan
earlier this month, is to describe it in a speech Monday at the
Bronx High School of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require state legislation to expand the
circumstances under which DNA testing is allowed. Under current
law, police take DNA samples from people convicted of certain major
felonies, primarily crimes like murder or rape. The data is sent to
a state databank.
</P>
<P>
   Every state has some kind of databank of convicted felons' DNA
and, in October, the FBI, after nearly a decade of preparation,
opened a national database linking the state systems. To date, only
Louisiana takes samples from everyone charged with a crime,
although South Dakota has authorized a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, DNA, the material in human cells that records each
person's genetic inheritance, has been used primarily to identify
positively a suspect already in custody or to eliminate a suspect
or clear someone wrongly convicted. It has been used mainly in such
violent crimes as murder or rape, when a criminal leaves blood or
semen on a victim or crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the rapidly developing science could be used
more aggressively to establish a pattern of crimes or to tie
someone arrested for one crime to others committed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is based on an extensive system developed over the
last five years in Britain. Officials there say the system has led
to a marked increase in solving crimes, particularly burglaries.
Like police practice here of staking out subway stations to arrest
fare beaters who often turn out to be wanted on other charges, the
system in Britain is based on the idea that people who commit big
crimes, particularly career criminals, are also likely to commit
small crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain has less of a tradition of civil liberties than the
United States, and Safir's plan is certain to draw objections.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Safir said he was making his proposal public precisely
because ``this needs a lot of discussion and debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
said he would oppose the plan as violating the Constitution's
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's plan grew out of a series of meetings he had
with Barry Scheck, a lawyer who is a leading expert on the use of
DNA evidence and who took part in the defense of O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   But Scheck, who sits on the state's new Forensic Science Review
Board, which regulates crime labs, said he disagreed with the
commissioner's plan on a number of grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck described Louisiana's testing of all those who are
arrested as a ``logistical nightmare'' and suggested it was simply
impractical under current conditions to do the same thing in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an unreasonable idea,'' he said. ``I just don't think
its time has come.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Instead, Scheck said, the city's police should ``front-load the
system'' with more limited initiatives involving new DNA technology
to solve old crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, the evidence in unsolved rape cases was
routinely thrown away after five years. This practice should be
stopped, he said. Evidence from all unsolved rapes should be tested
for DNA and there should be an emphasis on checking for DNA
evidence in all rape and homicide cases, he said. The department's
Cold Case Squad, Scheck said, should re-examine all old homicide
cases for DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scheck said, a pilot program should be set up to
train a special burglary detective squad in DNA evidence-gathering
to see if it would result in more arrests and cleared cases.
</P>
<P>
   Although Safir favors the broader DNA testing program, he agreed
with Scheck's more modest initiatives, Scheck said, and delegated
his deputy commissioner for operations, Edward Norris, to look into
putting them into effect.
</P>
<P>
   A major barrier to expanded use of DNA is the cost of equipment,
training and additional personnel. When the Police Department built
a new $30 million crime lab in Queens, the state regulatory board
on which Scheck sits required another $30 million in improvements
for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel of the Civil Liberties Union argued against a broad
program of DNA testing. ``They're using the DNA sampling for some
future event,'' he said. ``The information they will be receiving
is much more personal and private, including your genetic makeup,
than fingerprints.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that in one case in Massachusetts, courts had held that
the involuntary taking of DNA samples from prisoners, those on
probation and those on parole was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had just been invited to debate Safir on the DNA
question at a state law enforcement conference in February, Siegel
vowed to ``make this a high priority research project.''
</P>
<P>
   The police commissioner was unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman is my reality check,'' he said. ``Any time he agrees
with me, I know I'm wrong.''

SECRET SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS GROWING IN CITY, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Millions of people who live or work in Manhattan, or
just visit, are being secretly videotaped every day on public
streets, sidewalks and parks by a proliferating array of
surveillance cameras, according to a new study by the New York
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   A block-by-block survey by volunteers found 2,380 surveillance
cameras trained on public spaces, and the group says its total is
undoubtedly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is watching where you're going and what you're
doing,'' said the group's executive director, Norman Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   The group is proposing that city and state officials hold
hearings and adopt regulations intended to prevent the abuse of
public surveillance. These measures include posting signs telling
people that they are under surveillance, requiring camera owners to
register their equipment and setting a time limit on how long tapes
can be retained.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not certain who owns the cameras, the survey
estimated that 2,000 are operated by private entities and the
remainder by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has endorsed the use of video
surveillance to enhance public safety. His police commissioner,
Howard Safir, said Saturday that such cameras had proven to be
``incredibly effective,'' cutting crime by 30 percent to 50 percent
in public housing projects. ``The citizens love them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to privacy in a public place,'' Safir added,
and ``no court order is required'' to use cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that while cameras may have legitimate uses as
crime-fighting tools, the unfettered spread of surveillance
threatens private freedom. That is especially true in New York,
they say, where diversity and tolerance have been a magnet for
unorthodox people seeking the big city's cloak of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a hub for freedom of thought, action and lifestyle,''
Siegel said. ``If you want to have pink and gray hair, this is a
place where people can be whatever they are. There's a right to be
anonymous and not be observed by government.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surveillance cameras are on Wall Street and in
midtown, the survey found, and the biggest concentration _ 70 _ is
found in three blocks around Madison Square Garden. ``We were
really shocked to see how many cameras are out there,'' Siegel
added.
</P>
<P>
   As civil liberties workers pressed colored push pins, each one
representing a camera, into a 10-foot-long map of Manhattan at a
news conference Saturday, they found that some spots were too dense
to accommodate all the pins.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said of one block of Wall Street, ``I don't think we can
get any more pins in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be driving the technology, not the technology
driving us,'' he said. ``The cameras are already here, but without
any public debate or rules, and it raises a slew of questions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Most New Yorkers don't know they're being taped,'' Siegel
said. By releasing the map and giving information about the cameras
on the group's Web site, he hopes to provoke debate. ``We're not
filing suit now; we're going to the court of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Safir scoffed at the civil liberties group's concerns,
saying: ``Norman Siegel, as usual, is on the wrong side.''
</P>
<P>
   Most surveillance cameras are in fixed positions, attached to
places like building entrances, rooftops and lamp posts, the report
said. But nearly 400 are rotating cameras concealed at the bottom
of globes that look like light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated ones have remote controls that can focus
and zoom in on windows and backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Some cameras are operated for news gathering for television,
mostly for traffic and weather reports. Siegel said that such uses
of cameras involve First Amendment rights of the news media.

 &HT;    Livingston appears ready to let process go forward
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMOND, La. _ Bob Livingston, the presumptive speaker of the
House, told graduates of Southeastern Louisiana University Saturday
to move forward and leave past mistakes behind. But he didn't
appear ready to leave behind President Clinton's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving the commencement speech, Livingston told reporters
that Clinton's public apology Friday didn't make him feel
differently about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate it won't make a great deal of difference (for
me),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston repeated earlier statements that he will not make any
decisions about how the full House of Representatives will proceed
with impeachment until the House Judiciary Committee finishes
voting on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he wished Clinton would do something in addition
to Friday's apology to affect the process, he said, ``The president
has his own actions to justify. I will not seek to give him counsel
at this late date.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's speech to the 961 graduates of this university an
hour north of New Orleans was full of self-deprecating stories of
his own mediocrity. He attributed his ascent to the third-most
powerful position in the country to good luck and a good mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not to the manner born, I was not gifted with athletic
skills, and I was not gifted with scholarly skills, to put it
mildly,'' he said. ``But I learned from my mother to work hard for
what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a good politician is just ``an average person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a person who holds a high office who is without .
. . some degree of human frailness,'' he said. ``A good politician
not only accepts that but revels in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before mounting the podium to give the commencement address,
Livingston paid a visit to the ``Golden Graduates,'' alumni who
graduated 50 years ago or more. They warmly welcomed him with
applause and said, ``We're so proud of you'' and, ``We're behind
you'' as he worked the room.

 &HT;    No safe haven for Faye Yager
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREVARD, N.C. _ Like a lot of people in this mountain town known
for waterfalls and white squirrels, Faye Yager came for the quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Yager was known throughout metro Atlanta
as the operator of a network of safe houses that hid women and
children from allegedly abusive fathers.
</P>
<P>
   She has given up the clandestine enterprise of sheltering
fugitives for the commercial enterprise of sheltering tourists, as
operator of The Inn at Brevard. Yager has told people she left
behind the Children of the Underground when she left her home in
Sandy Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   But hometown troubles have followed Yager to North Carolina.
Bounty hunters chasing the $2 million reward announced a year ago
by Philadelphia millionaire Bipin Shah for the return of his
children continue to harass Yager, according to a report she has
filed with local police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watch me. They come into the hotel. They threaten my life
and, worse, they terrorize my children,'' Yager said this month.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the trouble she stirred up after moving in
only five months ago: Yager is being sued by her next-door neighbor
for blocking access to a shared alleyway.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking to start over, Brevard is a pleasant place to
do so. The town of 7,000 sits next to the Pisgah National Forest, a
deep green preserve where trout streams and black bear meander.
</P>
<P>
   Brevard College, a small liberal arts school, and Brevard Music
Center offer cultural diversions not generally found in a town this
size. Fed with the money of college students, tourists and affluent
retirees, the downtown hums, despite a nearby Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The Inn at Brevard _ purchased by Yager's husband, Howard, in
July for $695,000 _ was built in 1885 as a private home. The house
was converted to an inn in the 1940s. The inn now includes five
rooms in the main house and an adjacent lodge with 10 rooms. The
first floor of the main house is a series of dining rooms, each
currently decorated with a ceiling-scraping Christmas tree, that
seat a total of 150-or-so patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Yager appears to be a hands-on innkeeper, stopping by the
Bracken Mountain Bakery on South Broad Street for bags and bags of
fresh bread and baking coconut cakes _ mighty fine coconut cakes _
for dinner dessert.
</P>
<P>
   She is simply trying to run a business, she said while scurrying
to load a van with equipment for a catered luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing the best I can to survive Mr. Shah,'' Yager said,
declining to sit still for a lengthy, formal interview. Yager has
told magazine and television reporters that she helped Shah's
ex-wife, Ellen Dever, vanish in June 1997 with Sarah, now 9, and
Genevieve, now 7, despite the fact that no one had accused Shah of
harming the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he takes every single thing I have,'' she
said. ``He can take everything I have, but he can't take my soul
and he can't take me from my husband. He can take everything. I
don't care about money. I'm not a money freak like him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bipin Shah, the man who has put the price on the return of
his two daughters, said it's not money he is after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in taking her bed-and-breakfast or her
assets,'' Shah said. ``I want my children back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dever claimed Shah battered her, and Yager has likened Dever's
situation to that of Nicole Brown Simpson. No one, not even Dever,
has accused Shah of harming his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Shah, who made millions developing electronic banking systems,
learned of Yager's involvement in the disappearance of his children
on Dec. 18, 1997, just as the news conference announcing the $2
million reward was breaking up. He has been after her ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he filed a $100 million lawsuit against Yager in
federal court in Atlanta. The lawsuit, Shah said earlier this year,
is an essential element in his strategy to find his children. It
allows Shah to subpoena telephone and airline records and other
pieces of a paper trail that might lead to Dever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second thing it did was what I call `bleeding' Faye Yager
financially,'' Shah said this summer. ``If you're bleeding you'll
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager on Thursday told a federal court judge she had dismissed
the attorney defending her against Shah because she no longer can
afford to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence gathered for Shah's civil suit is also passed on to a
federal grand jury in Philadelphia that is investigating Yager's
role in aiding Dever. A federal arrest warrant has been issued for
Dever, charging her with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for
concealment of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said he feels sure Yager still has contact with his
ex-wife, and it is important to keep track of Yager and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get as much intelligence as we can on what
the Yagers are doing so that it leads us to my children,'' Shah
said last week. ``They are our connection to my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager claimed Shah has used illegal wiretaps to gather
information, a charge Shah denied.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Shah's lawsuit, the Yagers are being sued for $80
million by a Connecticut man whose ex-wife disappeared with their
son in September 1997. The Yagers also are being sued by Henri and
Dennis Minick, who live next to The Inn at Brevard.
</P>
<P>
   The inn shares a 10-foot driveway with the Minicks, according to
the suit filed in Transylvania County civil court in November. The
suit states that when Henri Minick tried talking to Faye Yager
about the driveway shortly after Yager took over the inn, she was
rebuffed ``and has continued to be rebuffed and confronted in a
belligerent and aggressive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the suit states, Faye Yager came to the Minick home
at 10 p.m. one night in October ``and in a loud and boisterous
manner, confronted (Minick), repeating her threats to close the
alley.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing in the Brevard lawsuit is scheduled for later this
week. Faye Yager also is expected to appear in federal court in
Atlanta on Monday for a hearing regarding the Shah suit.
</P>
<P>
   Life for Faye Yager, even in the mountains, is anything but
quiet.

COWBOYS MUST STILL PROVE THEY'RE WORTHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After bad football _ actually, it was disgraceful football _
life is still good if you're the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, at a charity Christmas auction in Arlington,
a Chan Gailey autographed football sold for the top bid of the
evening _ $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours earlier in New Orleans, Gailey's team had given a
performance best described as clueless, gutless and heartless.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys actually had beaten what was supposed to be an
inferior foe, then what would have been the bid in Arlington?
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the New Orleans crash, Jerry Jones was appearing
before the Irving City Council. He was also dealing. For a mere $15
million, five-year contract, Jerry offered to cut in Irving on his
corporate sponsorship package.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Irving tax dollars built Texas Stadium. Jones
holds the lease, but nowhere in the fine print does the city have
any advertising rights. Unless, of course, Irving meets a certain
price. And apparently, Irving will.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jerry threw in a discount after the Bourbon Street
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the Cowboys absolutely can't sell is another
mindless effort like the last one. There is no lower form of jock
life than a team that simply mails in a game, and with postage due.
This was, however, the Cowboys last week.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, this was also the Cowboys all of last December. They
quit.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact it happened on the Gailey watch was both shocking
and disturbing. What had been a good overall season, particularly
when you factor in a multitude of injuries, suddenly has a large
cloud hovering over Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Do these people even care enough to care anymore?
</P>
<P>
   There won't be a long wait for the answer. Keep a close watch on
today in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Cowboys don't have to win this game to prove anything.
Instead, their criteria is very elementary, and also something that
by now should be totally unnecessary. Is this a team that will show
up in the proper frame of mind? In other words, just be prepared to
play hard, OK?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like our season came to an end because we had one bad
game on offense,'' said Gailey at midweek.
</P>
<P>
   But Chan, is that all it was? Merely one bad game on offense?
There seemed to be more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree that New Orleans was anything beyond what Chan
said,'' noted Jones on Friday. ``I didn't see a lack of effort or
heart. I really didn't. What I saw was a frustration level that
kept building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did underestimate some things last week _ like the extent
of hostility the Saints would bring. I'm as guilty as anyone of
that. I didn't think we'd see what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Gailey's halftime message, with the Cowboys down,
19-3, was ``let's go out, start running the football, that will
open up everything else, and we can win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it took us like seven minutes to get the ball back (to
open the third quarter),'' said Jones. ``When we did nothing, what
continued was a loss of confidence. We had come to expect this
offense to put up points. As we struggled to do that, our
confidence level dropped out from under us.''
</P>
<P>
   Did it remind Jones of last December, maybe the worst month in
Cowboys' history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``Last December happened mainly because
we had no playoff hopes. This team can get it turned around in
Kansas City, and we will be right back on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. It all comes right back to today in Kansas City. The
Cowboys have not played a bigger game this season. In fact, nothing
else has been close, at least from the standpoint of
re-establishing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect us to play well, and as far as hostility goes, this
situation, in that stadium, will be about as hostile as it gets,''
said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I like the approach of the coaches and the players this
week. I do expect us to shake off New Orleans and regain what we
lost down there. Take it one first down at a time. Get one, then
get another, and let the confidence level build from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, like an autographed football, the Cowboys were
still a top sell after New Orleans. But on the field, this is now a
team trying to get back to market value. The Cowboys' worth in that
area will be established today.

COACH TRADING SAN DIEGO'S UNCERTAIN CLIMATE FOR HAWAII 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the situation with the Chargers is bad when June Jones
would rather coach at the University of Hawaii _ where the team was
0-12 _ than at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii may be nice this time of year _ all right, it is nice
every day of the year _ but a pro coach demoting himself?
</P>
<P>
   The story of Jones, the interim head coach of the Chargers who
would have very likely been promoted to permanent head coach at the
end of the season, is one of the stranger ones in the National
Football League this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who replaced Kevin Gilbride as the Chargers' coach on
Oct. 13, said part of his decision had to do with lifestyle issues
because he wanted to spend more time with his wife. Also, the lure
of Hawaii was too strong to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've lived in Hawaii, unless you know the people
there, it's different than anything else,'' Jones said. ``It's just
a passion that I've had, and that's what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this story, according to several Chargers
assistant coaches and league executives.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Chargers' organization is hinging its future on
quarterback Ryan Leaf, and Jones is not convinced that Leaf has the
maturity to be a top NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has spent much of the second half of the season on the
bench because of poor play and several off-the-field incidents,
including cursing at a reporter and being accused of throwing beer
on several Washington State students when he visited his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Jones has told friends he thinks General Manager Bobby
Beathard may be in jeopardy of losing his job. The Chargers, 3-4
under Jones and 5-8 overall, will be looking for their fourth head
coach in four years, and much of the blame for the turnover is
falling on Beathard.
</P>
<P>
   Factions apparently are developing among the San Diego owners,
with some wanting to dismiss Beathard and hire Green Bay Coach Mike
Holmgren to run the organization and coach the team. Others want
Beathard to stay because they believe he gives the Chargers the
best chance to get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who wants to keep Beathard and who does not, but
coaches and league officials said Jones felt his future was cloudy
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Chargers said they planned to wait until after the
season to decide if Jones would be made the permanent head coach.
But Jones was apparently told by the Chargers that the interim tag
would most likely be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely unstable,'' linebacker Junior Seau said.
``Until we find a way to win, things like this are going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Beathard wants to hire an offensive coach to tutor Leaf. Coaches
who might receive consideration are the Packers' offensive
coordinator, Sherman Lewis, and the Vikings' offensive coordinator,
Brian Billick, a former assistant at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   I Spy Super Bowl Contenders
</P>
<P>
   Are the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings watching one
another from afar as they try to make their way to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said he occasionally catches
highlights from Vikings games and was impressed by their talent,
particularly rookie wide receiver Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham has friends on the
Broncos and is pulling for them to go undefeated _ unless Denver
plays Minnesota in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But neither head coach said he was thinking beyond next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are where they were last year, so we still have a lot to
learn,'' Minnesota Coach Dennis Green said. ``I'm not looking at
Denver just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how entertaining a Broncos-Vikings game would be.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Mike Shanahan, the Broncos' coach, are two of the
smartest coaches in football, which means much of the game would be
a chess match.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the game would not be is a defensive struggle. Denver
has scored at least 30 points in 10 of 13 games this season, and
the Vikings have scored a league-high 442 points, an average of 34
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Bluffing or Packing?
</P>
<P>
   There continues to be speculation among a small group of owners
that Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, is mounting
one of the most impressive bluffs in football history.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners think Kraft is too image-conscious to move the
Patriots from the Boston area to Hartford, and several Patriots
officials said in interviews this week that they still had not made
plans to move because they did not believe Kraft would relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that Kraft is going through all of these elaborate
talks with the state of Connecticut in order to get the city of
Boston to come up with a better stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft is bluffing, it is a great bluff, and is contrary to
what most of the league owners and executives believe. Most feel
Kraft's bags will be packed and ready to move for the 2001 season,
when the Patriots are expected to play in a new 68,000-seat stadium
that will cost taxpayers $350 million to build.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kraft met with Connecticut legislators, and though
there were a few protesters, Kraft mostly received a warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating an Issue
</P>
<P>
   The competition committee will speak in a conference call on
Tuesday to discuss instant replay for the playoffs. But while
instant replay may be voted back in during the owner's meetings in
March, it probably will not be for the playoffs because owners and
executives think there has not been enough time to study the many
different ideas. ... After the Carolina Panthers lost to the San
Francisco 49ers in overtime last week, Coach Dom Capers gave the
team Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday off to ``do some
soul-searching.'' But some players were asking themselves: Why the
introspection now? The Panthers are 2-11. ... Several NFL Players
Association officials said that more than 25 percent of the
league's players do not participate in the 401(k) retirement plan,
which worries some union officials. ... Oakland Coach Jon Gruden
may need to add some spice to his offense. Last week in the 27-17
loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Raiders threw two interceptions
that were turned into touchdowns, suffered eight sacks and lost one
fumble. Dolphins players said they looked at the Raiders'
formations and matched them exactly to game film, meaning Oakland
did very little to try to fool the Miami defense. ... The Terrell
Davis Migraine Foundation will honor 10 adolescent migraine
sufferers from New York and New Jersey during a ceremony after the
Giants-Broncos game at Giants Stadium on Sunday. Davis has suffered
from migraines most of his life, but takes medication to control
the problem.

   DAYTON-ANNIVERSARY _ SARAJEVO, BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA _ Three years
after the Dayton Peace Accords ended the ethnic war here, a lot of
progress has been made in the reconstruction of Bosnia. Bridges and
roads have been rebuilt, schools reopened, electric lines
re-connected. Food shortages are a thing of the past, as is the
systematic violence of the war. But the peace here remains tenuous.
The reason, and the result, is 1.1 million Bosnian refugees who
haven't gone home yet. The Dayton Accords, reached at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1995, divided Bosnia into two
states, the Serb Republic, and the Muslim/Croat Federation. The two
states are largely autonomous, each with the right to elect its own
president and parliament, maintain its own military and even
negotiate agreements with other countries. The Peace Accords
accomplished its most important goal, ending the war and the ethnic
cleansing that so horrified the world. But it has been unable to
undo the damage of ethnic cleansing. Bosnia is still sharply
divided along ethnic lines. And while enabling people to go home
wasn't the first goal of the peace plan, it remains the one that

   w/BOSNIA-FAMILY _ PALANKA, BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA _ Sevala and Suad
Pobric were supposed to move into their new house on May 1, 1992.
The young couple had spent their entire savings building the
four-bedroom house, their dream house, with plenty of room for the
family they wanted to raise together. But on April 28, a unit of
the Serbian Special Forces arrived in their hometown of Brcko and
the Pobrics, who are Muslims, had to flee. More than six years
later, they still can't go home. A Serbian family that fled
fighting in another part of the country is living in the Pobric's
house now. Sevala has met them, even had coffee with them. The
Pobrics, and the Serbian family occupying their house, are among
the more than one million Bosnian refugees who either aren't able
or aren't willing to return to their pre-war homes. They are all
survivors of ethnic cleansing and war. And three years after the
war ended here, they each represent a weakness of the fragile peace
here. (Nesmith, Special to the Cox News Service).

   ELBERT-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ It is difficult to imagine how people
who had so little - those who were poor, retarded and isolated -
could be perceived as an ideal group to steal from, but state
officials believe that is exactly what happened in Elbert County -
for years. They allege that many of this county's most vulnerable
residents were systematically preyed upon by the very people
charged with their protection. They became vehicles for others to
attach life insurance policies to, and then collect on when they
died, sometimes of starvation and dehydration. A probe that began
here last February into allegations of insurance fraud has now
widened to include Social Security fraud, Medicaid fraud, misuse of
state funds and allegations of criminal neglect and abuse of
clients. Seven deaths are under investigation. (McCarthy, Atlanta

good that came out of that situation, it's the fact that it was a
wake up call to all of us,'' said Carl E. Roland, head of the
Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse

bolted from the table into a nearby field, where she died before
someone could reach her. Fact is, much of what Ruby Clark was told
was not the truth. Minnie Lawrence died after choking on a piece of
barbecued meat in the basement of Mrs. Arnold's home, where she and
two other retarded women had been left alone to eat. (Workers at
the day center Ms. Lawrence attended said they never left her alone
while easting because she had a propensity to choke). Close-up of

COWBOYS SEEK WIN VS. NON-DIVISION FOE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As Emmitt Smith sees it, the Cowboys don't have
enough passion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have much more talent than their 8-5 record
indicates, but they lacked pure emotion in upset losses against New
Orleans, Chicago and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fight,'' Smith said. ``When we throw a blow,
we've got to throw a serious blow and mean it. We need to be a
little more emotional and enthusiastic about what we are doing. If
we add that element to our game, maybe you will see a different
type of ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the businesslike Cowboys face the Kansas City Chiefs
(5-8) at blustery Arrowhead Stadium. The NFC East title and a home
playoff game is theirs with a victory. The Cowboys are favored, but
they must be wondering how good they really are. They are
undefeated in six division games and have outscored their opponents
by an average of 31-10. But outside the division they are 2-5 _
which includes the current two-game losing streak _ and they have
been outscored by an average of 25-20.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does the disparity show more than on defense. The
Cowboys allow 71 more yards and 15 more points per game in the
seven games they've played outside the division.
</P>
<P>
   This statistic has a lot to do with quality of competition in
the NFC East. Outside the Cowboys, no division team ranks in the
top 15 of total offense; New York and Philadelphia are ranked 29th
and 30th. There is no Top 15 passer, no Top 15 rusher, and only one
Top 15 receiver.
</P>
<P>
   This competition certainly has not prepared the Cowboys for
what's outside the division. In blowout losses to Denver and
Minnesota, the Cowboys have been unable to handle the quarterback
with the highest passer rating (Randall Cunningham), the league's
leading rusher (Terrell Davis), and the league's leader in
receiving yards (Randy Moss).
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs do not have one of the top offenses in the league,
but wide receivers Andre Rison and Derrick Alexander are
gamebreakers. Mobile quarterback Rich Gannon makes few mistakes;
his 1.3-percent interception ratio is one of the lowest in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret our division is down right now,'' Cowboys
strong safety Darren Woodson said. ``One of our goals was to win
the NFC East, and then take care of everything else. We have not
taken care of everything else. Maybe it's confidence. Guys have
been injured, and we've got to have trust in the guys that are out
there. The bottom line is we need to come up with something this
week to change the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting George Teague at free safety for the second consecutive
week has been the only major lineup change on defense. The
cornerback situation is still unsettled. Even if Kevin Smith and
Deion Sanders play despite their injuries, they'll be limited, at
best. To help offset the hurting secondary, defensive coordinator
Dave Campo said the club needs a better pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have only five sacks in the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams who get a real good pass rush are at an advantage,''
Campo said. ``We're not that bad, but there are other teams who are
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense may have failed the Cowboys against Minnesota and
Denver, but the offense had its problems in losses against Oakland,
Chicago and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Garrett subbing for an injured Troy Aikman, the
Cowboys were held to 12 points against Oakland and Chicago. The
loss against the Bears saw the Cowboys total a season-low 128 yards
passing. In New Orleans, the running game suffered a complete
meltdown, totaling a franchise-low eight yards.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Cowboys score 10 fewer points and rush for 48 fewer
yards per game outside the division. The Cowboys have faced only
two teams all season with a higher rating than the Chiefs'
12th-ranked defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said outsiders can draw their own
conclusions about whether his club can matchup outside the
division. ``They can think what they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he realizes the importance of his team playing well as it
heads into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a little more committed, quit relying on
someone else to make a play and make the play ourselves,'' Smith
said. ``I'm confident we'll get things turned around. If it takes
something like New Orleans to get us back refocused, fine. I'm all
for it. But we have to learn from that and get better real quick.''

WHO HAS THE EDGE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Edge
Cowboys Run Offense vs. Chiefs Run Defense Edge: Cowboys The Chiefs
have had problems against the run all season, ranking 21st in the
league. Even though they will copy the strategy used by the Saints
to shut down the Cowboys running game, don't count on them having
the same success. Their linebackers aren't as fast and the Cowboys
won't be fooled again.
Cowboys Run Defense vs. Chiefs Run Offense Edge: Cowboys This
should be a slam dunk for the Cowboys. The Chiefs don't have a
running game. The run defense has been the only consistent facet of
the Cowboys defense all season. The hope for the Chiefs is to get
some scrambles from quarterback Rich Gannon.
Cowboys Pass Offense vs. Chiefs Pass Defense Edge: Cowboys The
Chiefs are solid against the pass statistically, however, they have
been giving up big chunks of yardage lately because they have
overcompensated to stop the run. The Cowboys pass offense is as
good as any in the league and should be back on track after last
week's debacle against the Saints.
Cowboys Pass Defense vs. Chiefs Pass Offense Edge: Chiefs The
problems the Cowboys have in the secondary have been the story for
some time now. Their problems getting a consistent pass rush has
been the story all season. Don't look for the Chiefs, who have one
the league's hottest passing attacks of late, to have any sympathy.
Special Teams Edge: Cowboys Chiefs returner Tamarick Vanover is as
dangerous as any in the league. However, the Cowboys coverage teams
are among the league's best, as are punter Toby Gowin and kicker
Richie Cunningham. The Chiefs have problems in special teams
coverage.
Coaching Chan Gailey (8-5) Marty Schottenheimer (143-84-1) Edge:
Even Schottenheimer certainly has the edge in experience, however,
it seems that he is no longer getting through to his players. The
Chiefs are the most undisciplined team in the league and are on the
verge of quitting. The matchup, however, could also reveal a lot
about Gailey and how his team responds from a shocking loss.
Ones to Stop Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman Considering the
much-publicized problems of the Cowboys defense, the Cowboys know
they must score big to win games. And that puts the onus on
quarterback Troy Aikman, who has led the Cowboys to at least 30
points in five games of the seven games he's started and finished
this season. When he gets time to throw the ball, the Cowboys
offense is virtually unstoppable. He didn't get time last week and
the Cowboys offense was shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs quarterback Rich Gannon Gannon is playing as well as any
quarterback in the league over the past three weeks, completing 68
of 104 passes for 775 yards with seven touchdowns and two
interceptions over his last three starts. That comes with a
sizzling quarterback rating of 102.1. As a result, the Chiefs has
scored at least 30 points in each of the past three games _ a first
in ten years under coach Marty Schottenheimer and a first for the
franchise since 1967.
Story Lines Cowboys (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   Can the Cowboys get a pass rush?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to talk about the problems the Cowboys have had in the
secondary. However, already-struggling defensive backfield is
getting no help from the Cowboys front seven. None of the defensive
linemen have gotten to the quarterback with any consistency. And
when they have gotten pressure, they have been unable to complete
the play because the quarterback has usually danced away and made a
play on the outside. A defensive backfield is only as good as the
line in front of it. And if the Cowboys don't get to Rich Gannon,
it will be another long day in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   How will the Chiefs game affect the Cowboys playoff chances?
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Chiefs game will probably have little impact
on the Cowboys playoff chances. Barring the unthinkable, the
Cowboys are virtually assured of winning the NFC East and hosting a
wild card game. There is no way they can catch Atlanta for the
second-best record to possibly host two playoff games. That being
said, the Cowboys don't want to back into the playoffs on a losing
note if they plan on doing something when they get there.
Considering that the last two games are against the woeful Eagles
and Redskins, the Chiefs game could tell a lot about what type of
team the Cowboys have. A loss would certainly reinforce the view
that the Cowboys just benefited from being in a weak division and
are not a legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs (5-8)
</P>
<P>
   Did the Chiefs fire their last shot against the Broncos?
</P>
<P>
   Key for the Chiefs is how they will respond following last
Sunday's loss to the Broncos. The Chiefs' season has been over for
some time, but they put a lot of energy into trying to get some
redemption and knock off the Broncos. They didn't get it done.
Considering the many disappointments and embarrassments they've had
in 1998, the question now is have they mentally closed shop for the
season. They need to come out strong because if they get behind, no
one is sure if they will fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Chiefs muster a running game?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Rich Gannon is throwing the ball well. However, the Chiefs
still want a solid running game to help balance the offense. Right
now, there is no need to respect the Chiefs ground attack, which
has topped 100 yards only once in the past eight games and has
averaged less than three yards a carry in three of the past four
games. They will be hard-pressed to find running room against the
Cowboys defense, however, they will try to ram former Texas Tech
star Bam Morris in the middle to soften the Cowboys for the pass.

   Cowboys analysis Mike Fisher NFL beat writer
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came away from the Superdome in New Orleans last
week believing that it's one of the toughest places to play in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   They ain't seen nothin' yet.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Chiefs are about out of fight. They began the season
boasting about their prospects for going 16-0, and in recent weeks,
they turned a loss against Denver into a bar brawl. Then came a
loss against the woeful Chargers, followed by a hard-fought loss at
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   I've always known the Chiefs don't possess the big-play weapons
on offense that can hurt an opponent. Now I wonder if the Cowboys
do.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs 17, Cowboys 16
Clarence E. Hill Jr. Cowboys beat writer
</P>
<P>
   Let me see. The Cowboys are 6-0 against the NFC East. And 2-5
against everybody else. Sounds like a trend to me. Let's look
again. Of seven non-division games, the are Cowboys 2-1 against
teams no longer in the playoff chase _ wins against Carolina and
Seattle and a loss to Chicago. Is that a trend? Or how about the
fact that the Cowboys are 0-3 against teams above .500 and 8-2
against teams below .500. So where does the matchup against the
Chiefs (5-8), who have nothing to play for, fall. Who cares? As my
grandma said a long time ago, statistics are like a lamp post, some
use it for illumination, a wino uses it for support.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys 28, Chiefs 21
Kevin Lyons beat writer
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs are a talented team with nothing to lose. Out of the
playoff race, the Chiefs would like nothing more than to slow the
Cowboys' momentum toward the postseason. The Cowboys have more
talent, but today's game will be about more than that. Grit.
Determination. Confidence. The Cowboys will need all of these
things to win at noisy Arrowhead Stadium. They have not played with
much confidence lately, and should they get behind early, it could
be a long afternoon for the 'Boys. But this game should bring out
the championship mettle in the Cowboys as well as coach Chan
Gailey.

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Kevin Brown became baseball's first $100
million player Saturday when he agreed to a seven-year contract
with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's deal, for a total of $105 million, gives him both the
biggest overall contract in baseball and the biggest annual salary
at $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The previous records were anything but ancient history. The
record for the biggest contract was set less than two months ago
when Mike Piazza agreed to a $91 million, seven-year contract with
the Mets on Oct. 23. The record for the largest annual salary was
set about two weeks ago when Mo Vaughn agreed to a $13.3
million-a-year deal with the Anaheim Angels on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 years ago, Nolan Ryan became the first player in
baseball history to be paid the now routine salary of $1 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown may not last long as the record-holder himself. The
five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens is expected to be
traded by the Toronto Blue Jays during baseball's winter meetings
here and any such trade would require a new contract for him. It is
believed that he was waiting for Brown's deal to be completed
before he agreed to a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The deal likely will give Dodgers owner Rupert Murdoch
baseball's biggest payroll. It now stands at $89 million, a 24
percent increase from the Baltimore Orioles' major-league record
$72 million payroll of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has the money, though, and the Dodgers apparently felt
they could not afford to let Brown get away after losing out to the
Arizona Diamondbacks in the bidding for the left-handed pitcher
Randy Johnson two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's Fox Group paid a then-record $311 million to buy the
Dodgers last March, only to see the team fail to reach the playoffs
for the second season in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin has taken a good team and put them in the World Series
before,'' his agent, Scott Boras, said on Friday. ``He just may
take a club to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 33-year-old right-handed pitcher, went 18-7 with a 2.38
earned run average to help lead the San Diego Padres to the World
Series, where they were swept by the Yankees. A year earlier he was
16-8 with a 2.69 ERA and helped the Florida Marlins win the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that Kevin's stature in this game and this
market certainly has exceeded others,'' Boras said on Friday night.
``Usually it's two or three clubs. In this case, there were five or
six teams seriously involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers outbid the Baltimore Orioles, the Colorado Rockies,
the St. Louis Cardinals and the Padres. The Cardinals apparently
dropped out after it became clear that it would take at least a
six-year contract to sign Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were believed to have offered a $100 million,
seven-year contract, but that apparently only served to increase
the ante for Brown, who had pitched with the Orioles in 1995 and
apparently did not want to sign with them again.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers responded with a seven-year offer of their own,
the decision became an easy one for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also were able to assuage one of Brown's major
concerns _ how much he would be able to see his family, which still
lives in Macon, Ga. _ by guaranteeing them a dozen or so flights a
season on a Fox corporate jet. They also agreed to his request for
a complete no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the crowning touch to a busy off-season for Los
Angeles. The Dodgers already had signed center fielder Devon White
to a $12.4 million, three-year contract and reliever Alan Mills to
a $65 million, three-year deal and acquired catcher Todd Hundley
and reliever Mel Rojas from the Mets. They also traded away
outfield Bobby Bonilla and lost the free agent pitchers Scott
Radinsky and Brian Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   Brown becomes the ace of a staff that also includes Chan Ho
Park, Carlos Perez, Ismael Valdes, Darren Dreifort and Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   In other moves Saturday, the Cincinnati Reds and the free agent
infielder Mark Lewis agreed on a one-year contract to become the
team's starting second baseman. A Cincinnati native, Lewis hit .249
with the Philadelphia Phillies last season. He will replace Bret
Boone, who was traded to the Atlanta Braves in a deal for pitcher
Denny Neagle. The Reds also released Tony Perez's son, first
baseman Eduardo Perez.

 A BLUEFISH BLITZ IS SURFCASTING HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDY HOOK, N.J. _ Here, along the Eastern shoreline in autumn,
few things cause pandemonium among fishers _ particularly
surfcasters _ quite like a school of bluefish blitzing the beach.
Utterly satisfying like a home run in baseball, a true blitz, or
feeding frenzy, offers one of those rare moments when the angler,
having caught his or her fill, may actually walk away with fish
still biting.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case during a recent trip to this westernmost point
of Lower New York Bay, and gateway to New York Harbor. Cooler
temperatures had begun flushing baitfish out of the estuaries
sending them migrating along beach fronts. The bluefish schools, in
turn, were in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   I had just pulled into the parking lot, when several anglers
trudged past, carrying buckets full of 2-pound bluefish. ``They're
still hitting,'' one of them told me, looking wild-eyed but
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The next five minutes I spent yanking on my waders, grabbing
lures, then racing for the beach. Almost immediately, I spotted a
large flock of laughing gulls and terns wheeling above the surf.
Ocean fishermen keep a perpetual vigil for ``working'' seabirds,
knowing that they often follow schools of bait fish, swooping down
when predators drive them to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I saw a picket fence of perhaps 50 anglers. More than half
clutched doubled-over fishing rods. As I walked closer, freshly
caught bluefish could be seen flopping all over the beach. Beyond
them in the surf, shoals of coppery rainfish _ so tightly packed
they made each wave look almost red _ weaved and undulated as they
tried to evade the hungry blues.
</P>
<P>
   Even though striped bass, weakfish and other surf-caught game
fish periodically swarm in dense schools while chasing prey, for
sheer carnage nothing matches a pack of hungry bluefish. In 1874,
the United States' first fish commissioner, Spencer Baird, said it
best when he described them as ``animated chopping machines.'' My
friend Richard Kress, a former lifeguard and avid surf angler,
remembers having to whistle swimmers out of the water one summer
because the blues were in so thick.
</P>
<P>
   I chose a spot and cast a silver popper beyond the breakers. I
turned the reel once and right away a fish boiled behind the lure.
A second turn produced a slashing strike. Minutes later, a wave
deposited a prime fall-run bluefish at my feet, a gift from the
fishing gods.
</P>
<P>
   The scene continued on _ a fury of blues, birds and fishermen.
In five casts, I caught five bluefish. A rolling wave picked up a
particularly dense school of bait then collapsed on the beach,
scattering rainfish on the sand like confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen chased the bluefish schools on foot as they swept down
the surf line. Old men with custom rods stood side by side with
tourists using push-button reels. All caught fish. Kids too young
to cast gathered the bluefish in buckets for their parents. One
angler that seemed a little too well-dressed, as if he had sneaked
out on his lunch break, wore a beeper, which proceeded to go off
just as he landed a fish. He read the message, then, looking
obviously dismayed, gathered his gear and left.
</P>
<P>
   I finally stopped casting, having released so many fish I lost
count. Instead, I sat in the sand and watched the schools pass on
their long migration to southern waters. By Thanksgiving, they
would be off Cape Hatteras; by Christmas, Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, anglers began filing off the beach, weighed down
with limits of bluefish which they dragged on rope stringers, or
carried off in coolers and buckets. Some fishermen were dripping
wet and laughing, others wore a thin layer of wet sand. Meanwhile,
behind them in the surf, the bluefish kept blitzing, apparently
having worn out even those who pursue them.

 &HT;    CLINTON PLEDGES TO ``WALK WITH ISRAEL'' BUT NUDGES ITS LEADER
 &HT;    EDS: New top and writethru after Clinton's arrival ceremony.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Casting his three day Middle East visit as a solemn
mission to ''put the peace process on track,'' President Clinton
pledged early Sunday that ''the United States will walk this road
with Israel every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a precursor to tough talks ahead, Clinton served notice
on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel must move forward
with currently suspended West Bank withdrawals, as Netanyahu
protested that Palestinians have failed to live up to their own
promises to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last few weeks, our partners have not kept their
commitments,'' Netanyahu said, a reference to increased street
protests against Israelis by Palestinians in Israeli-occupied
territories. ''We must, therefore, seek compliance without let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came at a ceremony to welcome Clinton on the
tarmac of Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport, named for
Israel's first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers in America witnessed an odd juxtaposition of
split-screen images. As House Judiciary Committee members were
shown heatedly debating articles of impeachment, Clinton was seen
receiving a statesman's greeting a half world away.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., one of more than a dozen lawmakers
who accompanied Clinton aboard Air Force One, said the president
``seemed very fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there's going to be a lot on his mind and a lot of
churning inside him,'' Wellstone told reporters. ``But he seems
very focused on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Netanyahu is in deep political trouble. He
narrowly survived a no confidence vote this past week and may soon
face another one.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible opening on other fronts, Netanyahu said he hoped
to reinvigorate long-stalled peace talks with two of Israel's other
regional foes: Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ''We extend our hands to the Syrians and the Lebanese to revive
the process,'' Netanyahu said. ''And we extend our hands to our
Palestinian neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu, whose relations with Clinton have rarely risen
above frosty, salted his welcome with some hard-edged talk.
</P>
<P>
   In a thinly-veiled jab at White House diplomacy, Netanyahu
chided Clinton at one point. ``Peace agreements in themselves do
not necessarily bring about peace,'' he said, adding that Israel
seeks ''a peace that will endure for decades _ and not just for the
next newscast.''
</P>
<P>
   Capping a dramatic day in which the House Judiciary Committee
passed its fourth article of impeachment against Clinton, the
president, accompanied by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
their daughter Chelsea, arrived at Ben Gurion shortly before
midnight local time. After a ceremonial reception and arrival
remarks, Clinton flew by helicopter to his hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to meet Sunday with Netanyahu for what promises to be
contentious talks over what can be done to keep the imperiled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Clinton is to meet in Palestinian-controlled Gaza with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss Palestinian commitments
made under the peace accord Clinton brokered in October between
Arafat and Netanyahu at the Wye River Plantation in rural Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking shortly after midnight, Clinton said he had come ''to
reaffirm America's unbreakable ties to Israel, (and) to reaffirm
our unshakable commitment to Israeli security.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is asking Congress for an additional $1.2 billion in aid
to Israel for next year, on top of the $3 billion already planned.
</P>
<P>
   Also meeting the Clintons at Ben Gurion was Israeli President
Ezer Weizman. An Israeli military band played the national anthems
of both countries _ the Star Spangled Banner and Hatikva, which
translates roughly into ''hope.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton walked through a ceremonial review of the troops on
the tarmac, Netanyahu chatted easily with Mrs. Clinton, who smiled
and appeared engaged and animated after the ten-hour flight from
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Netanyahu's tough talk, Weizman said Israelis welcomed
Clinton's visit his fourth to Israel as president and his efforts
to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hour is late, but it is the hour of truth,'' said Weizman.
''The people of Israel yearn for peace and security.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over impeachment raged Saturday on Capitol Hill,
there was relative calm in and around Israel after two weeks of
sometimes bloody clashes between police and Palestinian protestors.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, about a half dozen protestors were injured in
Bethlehem in the West Bank before Palestinian police quelled the
violence. The crackdown was seen as a sign that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will not allow demonstrations to mar Clinton's
scheduled visit to Bethlehem on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The protestors were not angry about Clinton's pending visit.
Rather, they were demonstrating against Israel's refusal to release
hundreds of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the brief violence in Bethlehem on Saturday, workers
unfurled 40-foot-long U.S. and Palestinian flags side-by-side on
the wall of the 1,600-year-old stone Church of the Nativity, the
site of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath and most stores and offices in
Israel were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Netanyahu was coming off a bad week in which his
government was almost toppled, in part by former allies who oppose
the Wye River peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the violence in Bethlehem Saturday, there were only a
couple incidents of the isolated rioting that has occurred almost
daily for two weeks. In the West Bank, funerals were held for two
of the four Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers in the recent
riots. In the Arab section of east Jerusalem, Israeli riot police
with M-16 rifles were out in unusually large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say they are rioting because Israel is not
releasing enough prisoners from Israeli jails releases prompted by
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get our prisoners and our rights. If they don't let
them out we'll have an Intifada (uprising) with Clinton here,''
said Mahmoud Ismail, a 15-year-old in Bethlehem near where youths
had been throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ismail said he would join his neighbors in trying to see
Clinton when he visits the town on Tuesday.

TEACHER SUSPENDED AFTER BRINGING BIBLES TO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx elementary school teacher has been suspended
on charges that he distributed religious books and promoted
Christianity in his classroom. The teacher, Simpson Gray, says he
is being unfairly singled out for his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, a fifth-grade teacher at Public School 5, was removed from
his classroom last week after a school board investigation of one
parent's complaint that he supplied the school's library and his
students with six copies of the Bible and four religious books that
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His suspension marks the second time this year that a Bronx
teacher has been embroiled in a controversy about religion in the
classroom. Mildred Rosario, a substitute teacher at Intermediate
School 74, was dismissed after she asked children in her class if
they accepted Jesus as their Savior.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, 57, said he did take the materials into the school in
October 1997, but not for religious reasons. Instead, Gray said, he
was trying to broaden the selection of reading materials and to
show children that at least one of their teachers was also an
author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the law,'' said Gray, a former lawyer who has taught at
the school for seven years. ``What it says is that you can't
preach, you can't pray and you can't teach the Bible in school.
Nowhere does it say it is illegal for a teacher to bring a Bible
into an elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education officials have a different view, and say that
Gray may be guilty of much more. ``There is quite an array of
allegations concerning this particular teacher,'' said Chiara
Coletti, chief spokeswoman for the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are allegations that he may have said or written things
that were adverse toward other religious faiths, that he advocated
religion in his classroom and there are some corporal punishment
charges,'' she said, declining to be specific. ``All these things
have to be sorted out; there is always the possibility they are not
valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the allegations stemmed from an incident with one
parent who accused him of calling her child dumb and teaching
religion to the students. The parent demanded that her child be
removed from his class.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who said he was being aided by his union, denied the
parent's accusations and said board investigators never found proof
that he called the student dumb. He declined to identify the
parent.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he had filed a $400 million lawsuit against the Board
of Education charging religious discrimination and defamation of
character. He said he selected his books because they illustrate
``that any one can change their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he turned his life over to God after he was convicted
in October 1985 of stealing $18,000 to $22,000 from his law
clients. He was on probation for five years and performed 2,000
hours of community service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an inner city school where students are facing all sorts of
challenges to their academic development,'' he said, ``it's
essential that they have role models, that they have a chance to
relate to someone who made a mistake but is now living right. They
need as much motivation as they can get. ''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on Gray's lawsuit is scheduled for Friday in Bronx
Supreme Court.

HOUSE PANEL REJECTS CENSURE, APPROVES 4TH IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Saturday approved
a fourth article of impeachment against President Clinton and
rejected Democratic-led efforts to substitute a softer censure
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's final action sets the stage for the historic
vote by the full House later this week on four articles of
impeachment against the president, marking only the second time in
U.S. history that a president has faced such a constitutional
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority of the House approves one or more articles of
impeachment, the Senate would then conduct a trial and vote whether
to convict the president. A conviction, which requires a two-thirds
vote of the 100 senators, would automatically expel Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the censure alternative brings maximum pressure
on House members who believe Clinton should be punished to vote for
the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat on the committee
and a steadfast defender of the president, said he hoped outgoing
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia or Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston of Louisiana would allow the full House to take up the
censure option.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that the Republican leadership will allow us to
fashion a way out of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, Livingston told reporters, ``Frankly we haven't
decided yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the move to censure Clinton, Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee argued that the Constitution did not allow such
a step. They also argued that a censure would not adequately punish
Clinton for his alleged wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is a constitutional cop-out,'' said Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., a leader in the impeachment drive. Rep. Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., said the president would immediately begin undermining a
censure by ``sending out his spindoctors'' to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the president wants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., rejected the idea that the president
would ``laugh off'' a censure, saying it would be a ``scarlet
letter'' on the legacy of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``No American history textbook will fail to mention what the
president did and what we thought of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also contended that opinion polls show that a majority
of the American people favor censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said the American public only now is becoming aware that
Clinton is close to being impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a lot of Americans are finding out that the
Republican move to remove the president is not only wrong but
real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated censure resolution accused Clinton of violating the
trust of the American people; failing to uphold his presidential
oath; making ``false statements concerning his reprehensible
conduct'' with a subordinate; and ``wrongly'' delaying the
discovery of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The censure resolution also would have required the president to
sign it to ``acknowledge the censure and condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who invited Congress to censure him on Friday, was on a
journey to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the committee voted 21-16 to approve a
fourth article of impeachment that accused the president of abuse
of power in connection with written answers he recently submitted
to Congress in response to 81 written questions about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the article, members of the committee narrowed
it by removing language condemning the president for asserting
executive privilege in trying to prevent testimony sought by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and for lying to the American
people and his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was simply uttering a privilege that is accorded him,''
said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., who proposed making the changes to
the article. ``We ought to give the benefit of the doubt to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democratic committee members approved the narrowing,
although they continued to oppose the remaining allegation that
Clinton lied to Congress when he answered the 81 questions
submitted by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, both inside and outside the committee, have
voiced anger over Clinton's answers to those questions, claiming
they showed that the president was continuing to cover up his
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois called Clinton's
evasive answers to the questions ``an assault on the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said even the limited
accusation of abuse of power was ``absolutely indefensible'' and
that the 81 questions were written to ``trap'' Clinton into
admitting he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., praised the committee for limiting
the charge. He said Congress ``could go down the list of every
president from George Washington to the present and impeach
everyone of them'' if lying were an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, special counsel Gregory Craig, who defended
the president before the committee on Thursday, attacked the
committee, claiming its results would ``divide the country,
gridlock the government and defy the will of the people.'' He added
that ``nothing about this process has been fair.''
</P>
<P>
   All four impeachment articles arise from Clinton's relationship
with Lewinsky and his effort to cover it up, drawing from material
that Starr submitted to Congress in September.
</P>
<P>
   The first three articles approved Friday alleged that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton provided ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' to Starr's grand jury last August about his
relationship with the former White House intern and other matters;
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton provided ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' in a sworn deposition as part of the Paula Jones civil
suit against the president alleging sexual harassment;
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton obstructed justice in an effort to impede Starr's
investigation by encouraging Lewinsky to testify falsely; by
coaching presidential secretary Betty Currie in her own testimony,
to hide the truth about gifts the president received from Lewinsky
and other matters.

SKIING LOSES ITS MOST CHARISMATIC STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Winter will seem longer and grayer this year. Alberto
Tomba has retired, and his season and sport are hardly the better
for it.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the most successful men's Alpine skier in history:
Ingemar Stenmark won 36 more World Cup races. But with his innate
feel for the big moment and brash comment, Tomba was certainly the
most charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 rollicking and delightfully well-documented years, Tomba
jerked his often insular sport out of the Alps and the Rockies and
into the wider world's living rooms below.
</P>
<P>
   He was the city mouse who roared on a circuit traditionally
dominated by country mice; a child of privilege from the
sophisticated Italian city of Bologna who was taught to ski by
private instructors on weekend visits to the resort of Cortina
d'Ampezzo.
</P>
<P>
   He was irrepressible and utterly embraceable _ unless you were a
paparazzi _ although not nearly as bacchanalian in his habits later
in his career as his enduring playboy image and La Bomba sobriquet
would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba was a dominant personality with an even more dominant
presence on the slopes, and although the essential sometimes got
lost in the white noise he generated off the mountain, the sight of
a predatorial Tomba on skis was a sight to behold.
</P>
<P>
   With his powerful lower body, superb sense of balance and quick
feet, he thrived on steep, technically challenging courses, and the
direct line he chose to pursue through the gates, instead of
around, changed his sport forever.
</P>
<P>
   You could see Tomba's influence last season in the bold approach
of Hermann Maier, the sturdily constructed Austrian who dominated
the World Cup circuit and won two gold medals at this year's Winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba won no medals in Nagano, a disappointment that helped
remind him that it was time to move on. But it was in the
psychologically daunting, all-or-nothing crucible of the Olympics
that he left his deepest impressions in the snow. He would finish
with three gold medals and two silvers, becoming the first Alpine
skier to defend an Olympic title successfully and the first to win
medals in three consecutive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the downhill has been skiing's glamour event, but
with Tomba, the less risky and spectacular technical events assumed
center ring in the White Circus. In 1988 in the Calgary Winter
Games, after bursting onto his sport's radar screen the previous
season, he won his first two gold medals and considerably more
hearts and minds with his swarthy good looks and bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Previous Italian champions, like the man who would become his
personal coach, Gustavo Thoeni, had been laconic northerners, often
from the German-speaking South Tyrol. Tomba looked and often acted
like he belonged in a convertible with the top down and the
Mediterranean in his rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about good food, nice women, soccer matches and fast
cars, just like every Italian,'' Tomba once said.
</P>
<P>
   Before his first run in the giant slalom in Calgary, he turned
to his opponents and said with typical brio: ``OK boys. Keep calm,
and good luck to all.'' He won and then cheerfully and accurately
predicted another victory for himself in the slalom. When he
returned to Bologna, he was flown by helicopter into a soccer
stadium where 50,000 of his fellow Italians were expecting him, and
Tomba often made it clear that if he had his druthers, ski races
would be staged in such stadiums instead of remote resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The hangover came the next season, when he put on weight and
lost his edge, but by the next Olympics in 1992 in Albertville,
France, he had returned to form, albeit with certain modifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I used to party until 5 in the morning with three
women,'' he said upon arrival. ``At the Olympic Village, I will
party until 3 in the morning with five women.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomba had already coined the sparkling motto, ``Last to bed,
first to finish.'' He soon dubbed the Olympic city
``Alberto-ville'' and won another gold in the giant slalom and a
silver medal in the slalom, rising from sixth place after the first
run with one of his typically aggressive and intimidating efforts
in the second. In Lillehammer in 1994, he made an even more
spectacular second-run revival in the slalom, leaping from 12th
place to another silver medal as his overwrought rivals took turns
falling on their own poles.
</P>
<P>
   It would be Tomba's last Olympic moment worth savoring, but not
his last triumph. The following season was arguably his finest, and
he won the overall World Cup title for the first and only time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But when the world championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain, were
postponed because of lack of snow, he decided to postpone
retirement, and in February 1996 he finally ended his run of
misfortune at the world championships, somehow recovering after
slipping and bouncing off the snow in his final giant slalom run.
He would win both his events in Sierra Nevada, which left him with
nothing left to win in his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning his attention to his wine cellar (``only
5,000 bottles'') and acting aspirations (``Maybe I could be on
skis, something like `Cliffhanger'''), Tomba let his agents and his
father, Franco, persuade him to delay retirement again to compete
in the world championships in the Italian resort of Sestrieres in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba pared down his entourage, parted ways with Thoeni, his
longtime coach and conscience, and proceeded to win only three more
races in his last two seasons. Along the way, he ran afoul of the
Italian authorities, who are currently investigating him for tax
evasion, along with his father and some of their former financial
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Last January in Cortina d'Ampezzo shortly before the Olympics,
Tomba was clearly on edge and very weary of the scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, they don't care about me if I win the race, because
it's the same thing I have done before,'' he said. ``Instead they
write about my private life, about my money and about my
girlfriends. You know it's not funny. Italy is a very difficult
place to live when things are like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the investigation and his forgettable visit to
Nagano, Tomba still found a way to laugh last: winning his final
race, a slalom in Crans Montana, Switzerland, last March. It was
his 50th World Cup victory, second behind Stenmark, a better skier
but not a better entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba chose not to entertain when he announced his retirement in
a terse statement released through the Italian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, when asked how he hoped to be remembered when he
stopped competing, he did not hesitate, saying: ``Was good guy. Won
everything. Was extroverted. Had to be extroverted to win the
race.''

TRYING TO MAKE TRASH A BIT MORE PALATABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New York City moves to close the giant Fresh Kills
landfill on Staten Island, it is becoming a truism that nobody
wants the city's garbage. The point is underlined by fierce
opposition in New Jersey and Brooklyn to giant transfer stations
proposed in those locales by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the garbage came with a promise of no odor, no rats
and no spills? Furthermore, what if people living near the station
were promised acres of parkland, a new business complex dedicated
to recycling industries that might employ 400 workers, and millions
of dollars each year for 20 years to use for schools, roads or
other civic projects?
</P>
<P>
   That is the plan being pushed by a developer who has helped
finance $3 billion worth of solid-waste transfer stations,
incinerators and other related projects and an environmentalist who
formerly worked as the City Sanitation Department's chief of
composting.
</P>
<P>
   They teamed up to propose that a large portion of the city's
residential garbage move through an ultramodern transfer station to
be built at an abandoned industrial site on the northwest corner of
Staten Island, about five miles north of the Fresh Kills landfill.
</P>
<P>
   But after 50 years of living with Fresh Kills, Staten Island
residents want no more of anybody else's garbage, even if it is
just the passing-through sort. The mayor rejected the Staten Island
transfer station and seven other ideas two weeks ago in favor of
three locations he proposed _ two in New Jersey and one in Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dead,'' said Stephen Lynch, the would-be financier of
the Staten Island station.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not completely. Lynch and his partner, Thomas
Outerbridge, the compost expert, are quietly continuing to push
their plan as an alternative if opposition dooms any of the
proposed Brooklyn or New Jersey sites. Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey adamantly opposed New York City's exporting garbage to
transfer stations in her state when Giuliani proposed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   The developers are playing an intricate endgame, based on the
notion that the city will become increasingly desperate as the Dec.
31, 2001, deadline set by New York state for closing the landfill
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically know we have to ride through an extended period
of time at the bottom of the pile,'' said Outerbridge, whose Staten
Island roots go back to his great grandfather, for whom the
Outerbridge Crossing, one of the island's three bridges to New
Jersey, is named. ``That's the nature of our site.''
</P>
<P>
   As the barrage of legal and political opposition demonstrates,
the city's plan to export trash does indeed seem far from settled.
Last week, a group of 16 environmental, consumer and neighborhood
groups wrote Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota asking for a meeting to
question virtually every aspect of the policy. The letter said
unraveling a skein of complex issues ``is essential if the city's
Fresh Kills closure program is not to run into a series of dead
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   And so many companies are suggesting new ideas that Lhota
recently said the city may ask for another round of proposals.
Other companies that were at first rejected, encouraged by a a
statement by the mayor that their bids might later be re-examined,
have not given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the picture,'' said Ron Klempner, executive
vice president of American Marine Rail LLC, which had its bid for a
transfer station in the Bronx rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lynch is not as optimistic as other developers, at
Friday's meeting of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce, he and
Outerbridge politely pressed their campaign to convert a vacated
Procter &AMP; Gamble factory, which once made Ivory Soap, into what
they described as a safe and secure garbage-transfer station.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other proposed stations, it would accept barges in a
tightly enclosed building, compact the garbage they brought, pack
it in airtight containers and ship it out by rail within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   As they have at Rotary and Kiwanis Club meetings and before
community boards for more than a year, the principals of the Port
Ivory Recycling &AMP; Transfer Alliance said that geographic logic
argues in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Their site is one of the biggest patches of available
industrially zoned land in the city; it is a half-mile from any
houses, and barges would pass much less of the Staten Island and
New Jersey shores than they do on their way to Fresh Kills. The
land also has access to rail lines to New Jersey. Almost every
major waste company looked at the site, according to Bill Hettler,
a real estate agent helping Procter &AMP; Gamble to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The other companies rejected it because of Borough President Guy
Molinari's opposition to any other borough's garbage ever again
coming to Staten Island, according to Outerbridge.
</P>
<P>
   But the Port Ivory backers are betting on a positive response to
their promise to heap environmental benefits on Staten Islanders:
25 acres of restored parkland that would include a wildlife
habitat, 50 acres of land for recycling industries and financial
support for a community environmental fund or other civic projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Port Ivory has been endorsed by such national environmental
groups as the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental
Defense Fund, and the Trust for Public Land. The Tri-State
Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group supporting more rational
transportation planning, backs it.
</P>
<P>
   On Staten Island, it has drawn support from the Sweet Bay
Magnolia Biological Reserve Conservancy, an environmental group,
and the Staten Island Building and Construction Trades Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very much enlightened proposal,'' said Mark Muscaro,
executive vice president of the builders group.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions at the Chamber of Commerce meeting suggested
that it will face continued opposition. Some questioners asked
about economic benefits and jobs, but more asked about rats and
odors. What if the railroad bridge collapsed and the garbage backed
up at the transfer station. What would happen to the barges in bad
weather?
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Patricia Marceante, a public-relations executive,
approached Lynch. ``I was impressed by your presentation,'' she
said, but added that she opposed anything like it. ``I don't care
how foolproof it is. Nothing in life is foolproof. I don't want any
more garbage on Staten Island.''

HOUSE PANEL REJECTS CENSURE, APPROVES 4TH IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: INSERTS 5TH graf to describe committee votes)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Saturday approved
a fourth article of impeachment against President Clinton and
rejected Democratic-led efforts to substitute a softer censure
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's final action sets the stage for the historic
vote by the full House later this week on four articles of
impeachment against the president, marking only the second time in
U.S. history that a president has faced such a constitutional
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority of the House approves one or more articles of
impeachment, the Senate would then conduct a trial and vote whether
to convict the president. A conviction, which requires a two-thirds
vote of the 100 senators, would automatically expel Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the censure alternative brings maximum pressure
on House members who believe Clinton should be punished to vote for
the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The committee votes approving the fourth article of impeachment
and rejecting the censure alternative were largely along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat on the committee
and a steadfast defender of the president, said he hoped outgoing
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia or Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston of Louisiana would allow the full House to take up the
censure option.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that the Republican leadership will allow us to
fashion a way out of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, Livingston told reporters, ``Frankly we haven't
decided yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the move to censure Clinton, Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee argued that the Constitution did not allow such
a step. They also argued that a censure would not adequately punish
Clinton for his alleged wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is a constitutional cop-out,'' said Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., a leader in the impeachment drive. Rep. Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., said the president would immediately begin undermining a
censure by ``sending out his spindoctors'' to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the president wants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., rejected the idea that the president
would ``laugh off'' a censure, saying it would be a ``scarlet
letter'' on the legacy of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``No American history textbook will fail to mention what the
president did and what we thought of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also contended that opinion polls show that a majority
of the American people favor censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said the American public only now is becoming aware that
Clinton is close to being impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a lot of Americans are finding out that the
Republican move to remove the president is not only wrong but
real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated censure resolution accused Clinton of violating the
trust of the American people; failing to uphold his presidential
oath; making ``false statements concerning his reprehensible
conduct'' with a subordinate; and ``wrongly'' delaying the
discovery of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The censure resolution also would have required the president to
sign it to ``acknowledge the censure and condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who invited Congress to censure him on Friday, was on a
journey to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the committee voted 21-16 to approve a
fourth article of impeachment that accused the president of abuse
of power in connection with written answers he recently submitted
to Congress in response to 81 written questions about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the article, members of the committee narrowed
it by removing language condemning the president for asserting
executive privilege in trying to prevent testimony sought by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and for lying to the American
people and his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was simply uttering a privilege that is accorded him,''
said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., who proposed making the changes to
the article. ``We ought to give the benefit of the doubt to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democratic committee members approved the narrowing,
although they continued to oppose the remaining allegation that
Clinton lied to Congress when he answered the 81 questions
submitted by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, both inside and outside the committee, have
voiced anger over Clinton's answers to those questions, claiming
they showed that the president was continuing to cover up his
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois called Clinton's
evasive answers to the questions ``an assault on the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said even the limited
accusation of abuse of power was ``absolutely indefensible'' and
that the 81 questions were written to ``trap'' Clinton into
admitting he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., praised the committee for limiting
the charge. He said Congress ``could go down the list of every
president from George Washington to the present and impeach
everyone of them'' if lying were an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, special counsel Gregory Craig, who defended
the president before the committee on Thursday, attacked the
committee, claiming its results would ``divide the country,
gridlock the government and defy the will of the people.'' He added
that ``nothing about this process has been fair.''
</P>
<P>
   All four impeachment articles arise from Clinton's relationship
with Lewinsky and his effort to cover it up, drawing from material
that Starr submitted to Congress in September.
</P>
<P>
   The first three articles approved Friday alleged that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton provided ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' to Starr's grand jury last August about his
relationship with the former White House intern and other matters;
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton provided ``perjurious, false and misleading
testimony'' in a sworn deposition as part of the Paula Jones civil
suit against the president alleging sexual harassment;
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton obstructed justice in an effort to impede Starr's
investigation by encouraging Lewinsky to testify falsely; by
coaching presidential secretary Betty Currie in her own testimony,
to hide the truth about gifts the president received from Lewinsky
and other matters.

 &HT;    Falcons-Saints a feud undiminished
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly 20 years later, former Falcons linebacker Dewey
McClain still relates the tale with enough hint of embellishment to
suggest his narrative of woe is even deeper than the nap of the
Superdome carpet where he claimed to have almost expired.
</P>
<P>
   The play on which McClain purported to be within a breath of
suffocation occurred in the 1979 season opener between the Falcons
and Saints, a game much more infamous in the Big Easy because of
the incredible gaffe by New Orleans punter Russell Erxleben that
led to Atlanta's 40-34 overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   On a blitz, McClain raised his arms to deflect an Archie Manning
pass and was violently sucker-punched in the gut by New Orleans
guard Conrad Dobler, the notorious cheap-shot practitioner who had
invented nearly every dirty trick in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy `double-barreled' me,'' McClain recalled last week.
``Hey, I didn't even know you could get away with something like
that. But there I was, face down in the AstroTurf and here comes
(trainer) Jerry Rhea out to me. The first thing trainers always did
back then was put their hand on your head to calm you down. So
here's Jerry with his hand on the back of my helmet and my nose is
deep into that rug. By the time he rolled me over, I'd about had
it, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons-Saints rivalry, which will be renewed for the 60th
time today (counting a '91 playoff matchup), has been many things
to many people. Even with Atlanta's current seven-game winning
streak, eight of the past 12 meetings were determined by eight or
fewer points and nine were decided in the final seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the fans haven't turned out the way they once did for a game
formerly viewed as the social event of year in both cities _ the
average attendance for the past seven games is just 51,871 and
charter services no longer order extra buses _ the lore of one of
the NFL's most colorful rivalries remains.
</P>
<P>
   As with Dewey McClain, there's no reason yet to call for a
respirator.
</P>
<P>
   There have been ``Big Ben'' plays and brutal blunders. Overtime
and underachieving. A guy dressed like Moses parading through the
stands, and four players impersonating an NFL secondary but parting
like the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's been the ridiculous and the sublime, and
sometimes all of those elements converged in the same contest.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the wins and losses, however, every man who ever lined up
in a Falcons-Saints game has a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one I remember best,'' said all-time great Atlanta center
Jeff Van Note, ``was that year the Saints just laid down like dogs.
We beat them 62-7 at their place (in the 1973 season opener) and
they had quit halfway through the first quarter. A lot of crazy
stuff has taken place in this rivalry, but I'd never seen anything
like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the trouncing, in fact, Saints coach John North
placed his entire roster on waivers. When he addressed his rag-tag
team the Tuesday after the loss, North let the players know the
disdain with which he regarded every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Former defensive back Tommy Myers remembered the game, in which
Atlanta set 35 franchise records, and the unbelievable aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Recalled Myers: ``Coach North came in and said, `Don't any of
you ever ask to be traded again. I just put the whole bunch of you
on waivers and nobody wanted any of you guys.' From the back of the
room somebody yelled out, `What, even Archie?' And North said,
`Yeah, even Archie.' '' Van Note said several Saints players
related the same story.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died in 1994, Falcons equipment manager Whitey
Zimmerman would sit watching practice and, along with assistant
Horace Daniel, regale his visitors with several tales from what he
called ``the damnedest rivalry that no one outside the South even
knows anything about.'' Mostly Zimmerman would speak of the annual
appearance of his favorite guy named Jack _ Jack Daniels, that is _
among the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who was at the Georgia Dome last Sunday afternoon to
watch son Peyton play against the Falcons, grew up with the rivalry
and still regards it has a highlight of his career _ even if some
of the memories are painful ones. Manning recalled the game his
rookie season, '71, when the Falcons defense was pounding him into
the mud at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in the midst of a 28-6
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, I was running for my life and the crowd wanted
blood,'' Manning said. ``Late in the game, Claude Humphrey came
through on a jail break and had me in his sights. And then he just
pulled up and went right by me. I was so relieved, I about cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Such displays of compassion have been rare in a series that, no
matter the records of the teams, characteristically is played with
intensity. The era of free agency has taken away some of the edge,
but Saints coach Mike Ditka allowed last week there are still
enough old-timers around the city of New Orleans to enlighten those
younger players on the significance of the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you don't like to think you can make or break
your reputation on one play in one game,'' former Saints linebacker
Rickey Jackson said. ``But in Atlanta or in New Orleans, lots of
folks remember you by what you did in the Falcons-Saints games.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, wide receiver Alfred Jackson remains one of the finest
big-play performers in Falcons history, but will be most remembered
for his ``Big Ben'' catch he hauled in from Steve Bartkowski to
rally Atlanta to a 20-17 victory in 1978. ``A signature play,''
said Jackson recently.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Dallas, former punter Russell Erxleben still is
haunted by the snap that sailed over his head in the '79 game where
McClain was slugged by Dobler. After chasing down the errant snap,
Erxleben attempted an ill-advised pass that was intercepted by
Atlanta's James Mayberry and returned for the game-winning
touchdown, one of only two he scored in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, I knew it was a stupid play,'' Erxleben said. ``And if I
didn't, there always someone who calls when the Falcons play the
Saints and reminds me of it.

 &HT;    Games encore unclear
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Even after a few red-white-and-booed U.S. hockey
players turned a Nagano, Japan dormitory into Animal House, even
after the NHL's grand marketing venture accomplished little outside
of Kladno, it appeared to be a lock that the league would supply
players to the Winter Olympics at least one more time.
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's constant focus is to increase
the NHL's exposure, make it hip, sell T-shirts. There is no bigger
stage than the Olympics, especially with the next Games being held
on U.S. soil/ice, in Salt Lake City in 2002. And didn't the U.S.
win hockey gold medals in Squaw Valley (1960) and Lake Placid
(1980)? How great a boost would hockey, on levels from grassroots
to Gretzky, be given if Americans win gold in Salt Lake City?
</P>
<P>
   For the aforementioned potential, the NHL's participation in the
next Games remains probable. But a lock? No. Consider the major
factors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Television: Bettman was upset about the hockey competition
being buried by CBS in Nagano and wants assurances that NBC won't
do the same. But women's figure skating and skiing generally take
precedent in primetime network coverage. Bettman and network
officials have had conversations, but NBC spokesman Ed Markey said,
``We're not close to making any programming decisions for Salt Lake
City. We're still working on Sydney (2000 Summer Olympics).''
Bottom line: The NHL will have to make its decision without the
benefit of a programming guide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Management: Some general managers were not thrilled with the
17-day break in the schedule last season and are not warm to doing
it again (although it would be only 12 days this time). The
Colorado Avalance was 29-13-16 before the intermission, sent a
league-high nine players to Nagano, then went 10-13-1 after the
break. If the Olympics were this year and you're the Phoenix
Coyotes, who lead the Western Conference, would you embrace a break
in the schedule right now?
</P>
<P>
   _ Players: Like GMs, the players wonder if the Games are more
trouble than they're worth. Prior to committing to Nagano, the NHL
Players Association asked for a ``reopener'' clause to be taken out
of the collective bargaining agreement. As a result, the collective
bargaining agreement runs through 2004. NHLPA executive director
Bob Goodenow, who convinced his constituents to keep quiet on the
identity of the three U.S. room trashers, has remained quiet on
these Games. But one American, Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick, said this
week, ``If they say no NHL players in the Olympics, I won't lose
one wink of sleep over it. We have a goal in the NHL and that's to
win the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the thrill of Olympic rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said a decision will come in ``60 to 90 days,'' so the
world's respective hockey federations can make alternative plans if
the NHL backs out. But the issue may be clarified when the Board of
Governors meet next month during the All-Star break in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the potential of another Czech-Russia final, Thrashers
and Turner Sports president Harvey Schiller said he would support
any decision that improves the NHL's visibility. But that
visibility is linked to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix center Keith Tkachuk, who also was in Nagano, said,
``Why send NHL players if you're not going to show the games?
What's the sense of doing it?

 &HT;    Holy Toledo, the UCLA coach may be headed to NFL
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite the season-ending loss to Butch Davis and
Miami, the hot name among college coaches who will be considered
for NFL vacancies is UCLA's Bob Toledo. In an intriguing twist, two
teams that might vie for Toledo are the reborn Cleveland Browns and
their predecessors, the Baltimore Ravens. While Denver offensive
coordinator Gary Kubiak is likely to get a strong recommendation
for the Cleveland post from boss Mike Shanahan, team president
Carmen Policy will interview several candidates and Toledo probably
will be one of them. Meanwhile, Ravens owner Art Modell is telling
confidantes he feels Toledo might be a ``great'' NFL coach. Toledo
also will draw interest from San Diego GM Bobby Beathard, who wants
to replace June Jones with an offense-minded coach who can develop
Ryan Leaf. The Chargers' primary target, however, is Florida coach
Steve Spurrier. If Beathard can't lure Spurrier to the West Coast,
he'll consider Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham, Toledo and others.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett comeback
</P>
<P>
   The success in '98 of 30-something sackmasters like Reggie White
(Green Bay), Kevin Greene (Carolina), Chris Doleman (San Francisco)
and Trace Armstrong (Miami) almost certainly means former standout
defensive end Tony Bennett will be back in the league in 1999.
Surgery on his left knee limited Bennett to six games with
Indianapolis last season, and the Colts released the eight-year pro
this summer when president Bill Polian didn't feel his rehab was
far enough along. Bennett recently had the left knee repaired by
leading orthopedist Richard Steadman, got some loose bodies removed
from his right knee, and feels better than he has in years. Several
teams, including the Falcons, have phoned agent Pat Dye Jr. about
Bennett, a speed-rusher who has 64 1/2 career sacks and won't turn
32 until next July.
</P>
<P>
   Goin' from Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   Among the teams interested in Bennett is Kansas City, where
players and management have tired of linebacker Derrick Thomas.
Since pillaging Oakland tackle Pat Harlow for six sacks in the
season opener, Thomas has only three sacks. When team president
Carl Peterson sits down with coach Marty Schottenheimer at year's
end to evaluate players, Thomas' name will be first on the list.
There's also a chance Schottenheimer, who will not be fired, could
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle vacancy
</P>
<P>
   The erroneous call by head linesman Earnie Frantz last week,
which cost Seattle a win when he ruled Jets quarterback Vinny
Testaverde had crossed the goal line, left coach Dennis Erickson in
tears in his locker room. With the Seahawks all but eliminated from
the playoffs for a fourth straight year, the coach realizes he may
soon be eliminated as well. Two names of interest to owner Paul
Allen and club president Bob Whitsitt are former 49ers coach George
Seifert and Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett. But if
Schottenheimer left the Chiefs, he'd probably move to the top of
the Seattle wish-list.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback update
</P>
<P>
   Three more quarterbacks, all in the AFC, will be added to the

 &HT;    Reeves, Ditka: This is personal
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It might lack the panache of the pro wrestling,
but it would be similarly entertaining if old buddies Dan Reeves
and Mike Ditka were televised while competing against each other in
golf, racquetball, poker, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   They're fiercely competitive, and Ditka, of course, gets
downright ferocious. Imagine ``Iron Mike'' losing a hand at the
poker table only to pick up his chair and throw it so that all four
legs stuck in a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves nor Ditka has confirmed or denied this, but enough people
who count the men as friends have told the story that it has become
legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I'm surprised by Mike, but that's just
Mike,'' said Reeves who met Ditka in 1969 when they were teammates
with the Dallas Cowboys (and later assistant coaches). ``There's
nothing phony about him. He's just intense, and he hates to lose at
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves' Atlanta Falcons (11-2) play Ditka's New Orleans
Saints (6-7) today, it figures to be like an extension of their
personal rivalry _ heated.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, both teams have something on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who have won 17 of 21 dating to last season, are
trying to hold off the San Francisco 49ers (10-3) to win just the
second NFC West title in the 33-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   This game is huge for Atlanta, which has overcome slow starts
three games in a row to beat the Bears, Rams and Colts in a
six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Saints would be the Falcons' second in the
division this season, and the 49ers have just one. In essence,
Atlanta would fall out of first place, even with the same overall
record as the 49ers, as long as San Francisco wins Monday night at
home against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have beaten the Saints seven in a row, including
three consecutive wins here, but New Orleans is in a fight of its
own, tied with Arizona and Tampa Bay in a race for the third and
final wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are 4-2 at home, and have allowed just one field goal
in each of their past three games in the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   As Ditka promised after a 30-10 loss at Miami two weeks ago, New
Orleans used a much more aggressive defense in a 22-3 win over the
Dallas Cowboys, surrendering just eight rushing yards on 18
carries.
</P>
<P>
   In a 31-23 Falcons win over the Saints on Oct. 18 in the Georgia
Dome, running back Jamal Anderson rushed 25 times for 132 yards and
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this is like one of the racquetball games between
Ditka and Reeves _ ``That didn't hit the wall ... Yes it did; one
inch up .. . No, it short-hopped the wall. I'm telling you, that's
my point.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, one guy is saying ``We're going to run'' and the other
``No, you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them will be proven wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you coach football for, to get into the types of
games we're in here,'' Reeves said. ``That's what Mike thrives on.
That's the reason he's so competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Reeves.

 &HT;    The Bucs pass agai
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ For much of his five-year tenure, quarterback
Trent Dilfer has been the convenient whipping boy, a once-anointed
savior whose erratic performances stymied the progress of the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   But with three weeks remaining in the season, and the suddenly
resurgent Bucs poised to claim the final NFC wild-card berth,
Dilfer could go from scatter-arm to golden arm.
</P>
<P>
   Since an embarrassing 9-3 defeat at New Orleans on Oct. 25, the
former first-rounder ('94) has been at the forefront of Tampa Bay's
offensive revival. In a six-week stretch, Dilfer has thrown 13
touchdown passes, tying Randall Cunningham for the most in that
period. His passer rating, just 70.6 in the first seven games, is
85.5 in the last six. And an offense that averaged only 264 yards
and 13.4 points the first two months of this season has rung up
349.3 yards and 25.5 points since the collapse against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately they've been the guys bailing us out,'' defensive
tackle Warren Sapp said of the Bucs' offense. ``It's hard to play
(defense) when you know you have to hold the other guy under 20
points to have a chance. But when our offense gets on the
scoreboard early ... oh, my goodness, we can do all sorts of damage
on our side of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That the offense is most responsible for resurrecting a season
gone bad is, indeed, a surprising twist in this NFL precinct. In
the first seven games, Tampa Bay scored more than 20 points on just
one occasion. Although the last six games have produced just a 3-3
record, the Bucs haven't been under 22 points in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In the three defeats, the usually stingy defense surrendered an
average of 29.3 points and twice allowed game-winning drives after
the Bucs had taken late leads.
</P>
<P>
   While coach Tony Dungy still is waiting for his club to dominate
an opponent for 60 minutes, the Monday night victory over Green Bay
was a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer threw the ball efficiently and the two wide receivers the
Bucs acquired specifically to help them beat the Packers, veteran
Bert Emanuel and second-rounder Jacquez Green, both turned short
passes into long touchdowns. The duo of Mike Alstott and Warrick
Dunn ran hard. The defense, struggling to overcome several
injuries, exerted consistent pressure on Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to at least suggest that the Bucs, beginning with
today's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, could win out, finish
a respectable 9-7 and still cause some trouble in the playoffs.
That wasn't the scenario many envisioned when the Bucs began the
season as the chic pick to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl, but
it is more than could have been expected when the club was 3-4 on
Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current standings, a Tampa Bay-Dallas matchup in the
first round of the playoffs is a strong likelihood. And with the
Cowboys in a funk _ their secondary is in tatters and Dallas is
only 2-5 in games outside its division _ anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a chance for us to salvage something,''
Dilfer said. ``We still feel our best game hasn't been played
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact the Bucs are even contemplating a playoff
run is a reflection of how unbalanced the NFC has become. Not since
1990 has the conference included a wild-card team with less than a
winning record, but it's a distinct possibility this season in the
NFC.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, New Orleans Saints and Arizona Cardinals all begin
today with 6-7 marks and the chance to sneak into the No. 3
wild-card spot. After years of being treated like an outcast, maybe
it's apropos Dilfer be the one to help the Bucs crash the party.

 &HT;    Cowboys limping defense leaves team open
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLATNA _ Although the Cowboys will meet the lowest-seeded
wild-card team in the opening round of the playoffs, Dallas might
be the division champion most vulnerable to a premature exit. The
multiple-set offense installed by rookie coach Chan Gailey is fine,
but Dallas' secondary woes could severely hamper coordinator Dave
Campo's defense. Both corners, Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith, are
out with injuries. Free safety Omar Stoutmire is a liability
against the pass and young ends Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis
aren't getting a lot of pressure. Some defensive players were
stunned that owner Jerry Jones couldn't come up with a better
stop-gap corner than Larry Brown. ``We are pretty exploitable right
now,'' agreed strong safety Darren Woodson. In their last two games
without Sanders, the Cowboys have surrendered six TD passes (five
of 50-plus yards) and 598 passing yards. If Kansas City's Rich
Gannon throws the ball today as well as he did a week ago, Dallas
could post a third straight loss. Dallas is 6-0 in the division but
just 2-5 outside the ``NFC Least.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions roar
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has deferred the $50,000 fine levied
against Lions owner William Clay Ford for criticism of referee Phil
Luckett's crew in the Thanksgiving Day victory over Pittsburgh, and
the penalty likely will be altogether rescinded. Still some Lions
officials remain angry that Tagliabue faxed Ford, one of the NFL's
most respected owners, notification of the fine instead of phoning
him. And in the fax to Ford, he also attached a copy of a letter
sent earlier this year to Colts president Jim Irsay. In that
letter, Tagliabue lauded Irsay and coach Jim Mora for the
``professionalism'' and ``class'' demonstrated in the wake of a
loss at San Francisco in which the officials crew headed by Walt
Coleman made two erroneous calls which cost the Colts an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel fizzling
</P>
<P>
   Very quietly last week, Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi
served unofficial notice that coach Jim Fassel will be on the hot
seat in '99. Accorsi acknowledged owners Bob Tisch and Wellington
Mara were disappointed in the team's performance, noted that the
front office has confidence in Fassel but asid he will get no
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the low Rhodes
</P>
<P>
   Embattled coach Ray Rhodes, certain to lose his job at season's
end, doesn't figure to leave the Eagles quietly. Rhodes took a
couple shots at director of football operations Tom Modrak last
week, claiming two recently released players, safety Matt Stevens
and receiver Russell Copeland, would be valuable pickups for other
teams. His words might have stung a little more had Rhodes been
using either player. Owner Jeff Lurie and vice president Joe Banner
have started looking at replacements for Rhodes, who is 9-20-1 in
the last 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   Replay redux
</P>
<P>
   The league's competititon committee will meet by conference call
Tuesday to discuss the possibility of instant replay for the
playoffs. Both co-chairmen, Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren and Tampa
Bay GM Rich McKay, concede the committee is split and the concept
probably won't even come before the entire league membership.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of derogatory remarks by defensive tackle Joe
Phillips, Rams officials are rethinking the future of coach Dick
Vermeil and staff. Phillips sounded off about Vermeil's 3 1/2-hour
practices and president John Shaw fears the Rams will have problems
landing veteran free agents. Former Falcons center Roman Fortin
turned down more money in St. Louis, and signed with San Diego,
because of Vermeil's practices. ... The 49ers are trying to extend
the contract of wideout Terrell Owens before the season ends.

 &HT;    Two-minutes with 49ers tailback Garrison Hearst
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Subject: San Francisco 49ers tailback Garrison Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: Long-distance scoring plays.
</P>
<P>
   Background: A first-round pick by Arizona in 1993, Hearst, a
former University of Georgia star, is in his sixth season and with
his third team. Through 13 games, Hearst already has a career-best
1,224 rushing yards, his third 1,000-yard season in the last four.
Hearst has added the big play to his repertoire this year. He has
four touchdowns _ three runs and one reception _ of 70-plus yards.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You started the year with a 96-yard touchdown run in overtime
of the opener. What do you remember about that play?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nearly suffocating to death with all those people piled on
top of me. Even after watching tapes, it's hard to believe. I'd run
10 yards, break a tackle then run 10 more yards. I thought I'd die
when I hit the 20 (yard line).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is straight-line speed the primary component to long
touchdown plays?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, I think you have to be more slow, in a patient
sense, than fast. You don't see many guys just sprint 70 yards
untouched. You have to set up your blocks well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But there are times, like on last week's 71-yard run at
Carolina, when everything is blocked perfectly, you break clean
into the secondary, and it's all over.
</P>
<P>
   A: You get those mostly in short yardage, when (the defense) is
bunched at the line of scrimmage. Those are the ones you dream
about.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON . . .
</P>
<P>
   Veteran: In his first two seasons, Bills wideout Eric Moulds
totaled 49 catches, 573 yards and two touchdowns. His numbers for
1998 project to 67 receptions, 1,362 yards and 10 scores. He faces
aggressive coverage today from Oakland's Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: Pittsburgh's playoff hopes and running game are on
life-support. Unless rookie guard Alan Faneca can handle Tampa Bay
tackles Warren Sapp and Brad Culpepper today, the Steelers are
doomed. A tough in-line blocker, Faneca struggles against
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent: In three seasons, quarterback Jamie Martin has
thrown only 68 passes. He gets his first career start today in
place of Jacksonville's injured Mark Brunell. The running game, led
by Fred Taylor, is peaking, but Martin has to hold things together.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Two weeks ago it looked as if the Cardinals were headed
to the playoffs for the first time since 1982. Having faltered
against an easy schedule, however, Vince Tobin could be in trouble
with owner Bill Bidwill. Tobin needs a victory against lame duck
Ray Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   TIP SHEET
</P>
<P>
   With the Detroit Lions having taken a step backward in Bobby
Ross' second season, tailback Barry Sanders is distressed enough to
have started looking down the road to retirement for the first
time. ... The NFL pulled a classic end run on vice president George
Young and director of officiating Jerry Seeman last week, leaving
them in the dark about its attempts to resurrect instant replay in
the postseason. Young and Seeman met with commissioner Paul
Tagliabue all day Monday, but were not apprised of plans to float a
replay trial balloon later that night. ... San Diego president Dean
Spanos wants to get a contract extension with general manager Bobby
Beathard, who has just one year remaining on his current deal. ...
Carolina owner Jerry Richardson wanted another shot at luring Joe
Gibbs out of retirement. That became a moot point when the former
Washington coach teamed up with Phoenix businessman Sam Grossman on
a bid for the Redskins. ... It's still a good bet Tim Couch will be
in the draft, but the Kentucky quarterback recently called the NFL
Players Association for Peyton Manning's telephone number so that
he could discuss the decision with him.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   Coaches like Mike Holmgren of Green Bay and Tampa Bay's Tony
Dungy spoke out against the league's trial balloon of restoring
instant replay for the postseason. ``If you're a guy like Dennis
Erickson in Seattle, and you lost a game (to poor officiating), it
wouldn't seem fair,'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   A day after Cincinnati punter Lee Johnson suggested the Bengals
would improve only when the team's front office was upgraded, owner
Mike Brown released the 14-year vet and fined him one game check _
$20,588 _ for conduct detrimental to the team. Given the Bengals'
eight-game losing streak, Johnson must have plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   THE LIST
</P>
<P>
   Dallas wideout Billy Davis entered '98 with three career
receptions but has flourished under rookie coach Chan Gailey and
projects to 41 this year. That would make him only the second
``complementary'' receiver to Michael Irvin to have 40 catches the
last eight years. Here are Dallas' No. 2 wideouts since Irvin
became the primary option in '91:

   In 27 regular-season appearances against the Jets during his

 &HT;    Collins finding Saints redeeming
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kerry Collins says he's not looking for redemption,
but he's having a hard time outrunning his checkered past.
</P>
<P>
   The story is old news: Several players said he quit on the
Carolina Panthers two months ago by walking into the office of
coach Dom Capers a couple days after a 51-23 loss in Atlanta and
saying his heart wasn't in it. Collins insists he didn't quit. He
said he told Capers that he should be benched ``If I'm the reason
this (0-4 start) is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was waived early the following week, and his agent
arranged for Collins to plead his case on national television. He
looked foolish, and his image continued to take a pounding. It got
worse in the wee hours of the morning after the Saints' Nov. 1 game
at Carolina, when Collins was arrested in Charlotte on suspicions
of drunken driving. None of it helped a man who reportedly had
alcohol-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   But as Collins gets ready to make his fifth start for the
Saints, who claimed him off waivers Oct. 14, he says he doesn't
care about history. It will be his fourth appearance, three as a
starter, against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely am aware (of the image),'' Collins said. ``But
I'm worried about the guys on this team and getting ready to play
three tough ball games. That will take care of itself. I've always
been a guy who has played hard and played every game to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After not playing for four games in New Orleans, Collins hasn't
been spectacular. In fact, his four-game statistics are inferior to
those of Billy Joe Tolliver, his backup; Collins has completed 60
of 122 passes for 827 yards and three touchdowns and has thrown six
interceptions and been sacked 14 times. But he led New Orleans to a
resounding victory against Dallas on Sunday, and the
quarterback-starved city thinks it has found its man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing he's not, and you can talk to our players to
a man _ he's not a quitter,'' Ditka said. ``He may get flustered at
times and make a mistake or two, but he's not a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are interested in signing Collins to a new contract
after the season. ``Kerry is a guy who can be very good in this
league if he dedicates himself to it,'' Ditka said. ``We're
interested, but . . . that will come down to him and his agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Collins still sees a psychologist, as mandated by the
league. And he'd prefer his on-field performance speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish,'' he said, ``that things . . . in my private life
would stay private.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Collins
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback
</P>
<P>
   Age: 25
</P>
<P>
   Height, weight: 6-5, 240 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: West Lawn, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   College: Penn State. He was All-American and a Heisman Trophy
finalist in 1994, leading the Nittany Lions to a 12-0 record and a
38-20 victory over Oregon in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Personal: Single. Was selected by the Detroit Tigers as a
pitcher in the 26th round of the 1990 draft and in the 58th round
by Toronto in '94.
</P>
<P>
   Professional: Collins was the fifth overall selection of the
1995 draft, selected by Carolina with a pick acquired from
Cincinnati. He began the season with a career passer rating of
65.3. His best season was in '96, when he had a 79.4 passer rating,
completing 204 of 381 passes (53.5 percent) for 2,454 yards, 14
touchdowns and nine interceptions. He started 14 games and helped
lead the Panthers to the NFC West title and the NFC Championship
game.

 &HT;    Thrashers use caution, careful consideration in picking goalie
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ THRASHERS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   If goaltending makes or breaks any hockey team, it follows that
Thrashers general manager Don Waddell will draw on several
resources before drafting a goalie in the expansion or amateur
drafts next June. But he will not rely merely on his team's
scouting staff. Waddell plans to hire a goaltending consultant for
six months, and is on the verge of signing the recently retired
Andy Moog. If signed, Moog would be the highest-profile hire by the
Thrashers to date. He played on three Stanley Cup winners with the
Edmonton Oilers and competed for four teams before retiring in June
after 18 seasons. Moog, who also played for the 1988 Canadian
Olympic team, went 372-209-88 with a 3.13 goals-against average in
713 games with Edmonton, Boston, Dallas and Montreal. He also
played in four All-Star Games. If hired, Moog would scout NHL
goalies who might be left unprotected by their teams, as well as
the top four or five amateurs. ... Reporters asked Waddell at last
week's league meetings in Arizona if he was going to hire Marc
Crawford as his coach. ``I told them what I've been saying all
along _ I'm not going to begin that process for a couple of
months,'' he said. Crawford, who left Colorado in a dispute after
last season, has expressed interest in the Thrashers job. ...
Waddell and assistant general manager Les Jackson were in Orlando
last week to explore the possibility of setting up training camp
there next year and having the IHL's Solar Bears as the Thrashers'
minor-league affiliate. ... The Thrashers plan to bring in some
season-ticket holders to get a gauge on the team's recent marketing
efforts and visibility. ... Greg Stathis, who coaches Georgia
Tech's club hockey team, conducted the team's skating clinic
Saturday at the ``Coke on Ice'' rink adjacent to Underground. The
clinics are held Saturday mornings in conjunction with the Boys &AMP;
Girls Clubs.

   Update: In four straight starts against Florida, Philadelphia,
Nashville and St. Louis, he went 3-0-1, allowing only four goals on
139 shots for a saves percentage of .971. He leads the league at
.942 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   On using his head to make a save: ``I'm not afraid to stop the
puck with my head. I try to do it sometimes even in practice. I say
to me teammates, 'Shoot me in my head.' Maybe other people think of
a different way to make a save.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether NHL players should go back to the Olympics: ``I think
so. It's the only competition in the world where all the best
players can meet and play for their country, and it's only every
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether two extra feet between the net and end boards has
helped forwards: ``I think it helps the goalies and the defense.
Before the puck hit the board and (bounced) right away in front of
the net. I think, to be honest, the NHL made a mistake moving the
goal line.''

<P>

   The NHL has been studying ways to minimize tie games in the
regular season, and here's why. The percentage of games that remain

Phil Esposito's 550 in 1970-71. Esposito did it in a 78-game

 &HT;    Valley of the Funds on the West side
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Things like this don't happen by coincidence. The NHL
held its Board of Governors meetings in the Phoenix area last week
and commissioner Gary Bettman used the stage to help the Coyotes
pressure local governments for a new arena, dangling the
possibility of landing the All-Star Game in return. No question,
this is prime time to ask for a new building. The Coyotes were a
league-best 16-3-3 going into their game at Ottawa Saturday night,
leaving the Dallas Stars in the unfamiliar position of second
place. But Bettman and ownership had better tiptoe through this
arena subject. Jerry Colangelo _ owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks,
Phoenix Suns, America West Arena and BankOne Ballpark _ is not at
the height of popularity these days after helping orchestrate $253
million in public money to build a new baseball stadium. There is
nothing wrong with America West Arena, except that it was built for
basketball, not hockey. Consequently, 4,300 upper-level seats have
an obstructed view of the ice. The Coyotes have lost $4 million a
year since moving from Winnipeg three years ago. The plan is to
build an arena adjacent to an old mall in Scottsdale. Ironically,
the Coyotes plan to move out of an arena owned by Colangelo, who
helped Bettman lure the team. The Coyotes are in the third year of
a five-year lease agreement. ``The Suns and America West are both
successful,'' Bettman said. ``The bottom line is the Coyotes need a
place to play of their own. Long-term, in its present
configuration, America West has a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado climate warms The heat is temporarily off Colorado
general manager Pierre Lacroix and coach Bob Hartley _ one for
expediting the departure of Marc Crawford, the other for replacing
him. The Avalanche, which started the year 0-4-1, was on a 9-3-1
streak going into New Jersey Saturday, including a five-game
winning streak. ``It was with hard work that we came out of that
torture,'' Hartley said. ... When Nashville third-string goalie
Tomas Vokoun, recalled from the minors because of injuries, stopped
34 of 35 shots against San Jose in a 2-1 win, it was the first time
in seven games the Predators won a game without Mike Dunham in
goal. ... Los Angeles president Tim Leiweke, concerned about a
dwindling season-ticket base as the Kings flounder the year before
moving into a new arena, sent a ``we still believe in this team''
letter to ticketholders. Asked what kind of reaction he got to the
letters, Leiweke responded, ``Some said, `Class act.' Others said,
``If you don't make the playoffs, it will be our last year.' '' ...
No, Vancouver hasn't traded Pavel Bure yet. The Rangers remain at
the center of rumors, but, then again, they're at the center of
every trade rumor. ... Glen SatherFelix PotvinBob Essensa Tony

 &HT;    Cancellation raises hard questions
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the sake of argument, let's pretend officials
canceled the 1998-99 NBA season today. Now let's ask some hard
questions about the game:
</P>
<P>
   Before the league can begin play again, it must decide the draft
rotation. Would the Clippers get the first pick again?
</P>
<P>
   When will the players and union rejoin negotiations? And when
would the league begin play? Before another season can start, the
league and the union still must come to an agreement. There were no
negotiations last summer because the players filed an
unfair-labor-practices complaint that was withdrawn on the eve of a
ruling. Then they filed for lost wages and were beaten again,
delaying negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   When will they start talking? Next September? When will they
start playing? Next December?
</P>
<P>
   And with new arenas opening in Atlanta, Los Angeles,
Indianapolis and Toronto, what happens to season-ticket sales and
pre-paid suites?
</P>
<P>
   Other important questions: What happens to this season's
contracts? Are they wiped out? What happens to the next group of
free agents, including Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, Ray Allen,
Kobe Bryant, Antoine Walker, Toni Kukoc, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Steve
Nash, Mitch Richmond, Vin Baker, Jeff Hornacek and John Stockton?
Can Shaquille O'Neal, Penny Hardaway and Grant Hill invoke escape
clauses?
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern defers any answers. ``You want to take
all of our lawyers' fun away,'' Stern said. ``There are probably a
thousand different questions that are now being compiled at
considerable hourly expense, as we contemplate a first in
professional sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Threat to cancel a ploy?
</P>
<P>
   Too much pessimism? OK. Suppose they reach agreement. Union
members remain skeptical about the league's resolve to cancel.
Union chief Billy Hunter underscored that sentiment when he assured
80 agents, many of them quite angry, that there will be a season.
</P>
<P>
   The union leader says the league is following the example set by
the NHL during the 1994-95 season. The NHL All-Star Game was
canceled the second week of December and there were no negotiations
until Jan. 7, when a around-the-clock negotiations resulted in a
48-game season. Some think the NBA could push back its championship
to accommodate more games.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik says there have been no formal
discussions with NBC. ``I think that we may be able to get an extra
week or 10 days or so, but that's about it,'' he said. ``I don't
think that it makes any sense to us or to them to put the Finals on
into July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Households using television drops so dramatically as you
approach the July 4th weekend, that I don't think that is a
realistic possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 14 start not viable
</P>
<P>
   Can the league start as late as All-Star weekend, Feb. 14, and
still have a viable season?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I don't think so,'' Stern said. ``I am going to leave that
to the board of governors. But my personal view is, no, not at all.
And I don't think we would ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Demise of the NBA possible
</P>
<P>
   And here's the commissioner's icy view of the future: ``If we
and our players, who are ultimately going to have to work together
to rebuild this sport, can't make this deal, I don't think there is
that much hope for the sport itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe the hype
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few players have protested the lockout. But now
the strident Charles Oakley weighs in with his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Losing out on a $10 million balloon payment, the Atlanta
resident, who was traded from New York to Toronto, speaks for all
the have-nots: ``I always see where they put the microphones when
they come out of these meetings, only with the franchise players.
They don't let the little man speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they ought to put the microphones next to the guy who's
making $350,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley says the status quo exists ``because you have all these
so-called franchise players who aren't leaders, who don't make
anybody better and don't even make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league has become all about fake superstars, about
hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners hold all the cards
</P>
<P>
   And here's the view of agent Harold MacDonald, so at odds with
David Falk and Arn Tellem that client Derrick Coleman, a '94 Dream
Team member, was not invited to play next weekend in Atlantic City,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald assails union leadership, saying: ``I don't think they
ever recognized how strong and organized the owners are. The owners
were never going to back off of a hard cap. But the union
leadership called the owners' bluff and got the players to fall on
the sword for a soft cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is almost impossible to make a deal without the players
having to say it's a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there back in 1994 in Minneapolis when David Stern
signed his (new) contract with the league. He told the owners then,
'Don't hire me if you are not willing to back me all the way on
getting a hard cap.'''
</P>
<P>
   Layups
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley is hurting. Additional problems were discovered
when Barkley underwent surgery for a hernia. He's still
recuperating. ...
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Rick Majerus isn't being kind when he says about Kobe
Bryant: ``He's heading more in the direction of Dominique Wilkins
than Michael Jordan.'' Wilkins' No. 21 will be retired by the
Hawks, if he ever leaves the game. At age 38, he wants at least one
more NBA season.

 &HT;    Gingrich bows out to tribute
 &HT;    By Clint Williams and Duane Stanford
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COBB COUNTY, Ga. _ More than 600 people put holiday preparations
on hold Saturday and packed a Cobb County high school auditorium to
pay tribute to House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is leaving Congress in January after resigning amid
criticism that he failed to engineer Republican gains in the
November elections. He gave the overflow crowd at his final town
hall meeting a long look at his agenda for the future, but made
only brief mention of the current impeachment debate in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American should read the report of the Judiciary
Committee next week,'' Gingrich said. ``Every American should take
the future of their country seriously. Every American should decide
what the rule of law and the Constitution require. And every
American should make up their own mind as a matter of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said there was no need to add to the public debate
``because the calmer we are, the more factual we are and the more
we look at the big picture and the future of our children's country
... the clearer it will be to every American what the appropriate
outcome is.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, and in a letter to constituents distributed at
the meeting, Gingrich said that he went to Congress 20 years ago
with the goals of cutting taxes, balancing the federal budget,
reforming welfare, defeating the Soviet empire and establishing a
Republican majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1998, we had accomplished every major goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who won re-election to his Sixth District seat by a
landslide, told the crowd he decided not to run again for speaker
because criticism focusing on him was diverting attention from
additional goals he wanted to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I was speaker, I was the excuse,'' Gingrich said.
``The fact is that I was the excuse for Clinton. The fact is that I
was the excuse for the Republicans who didn't want to learn how to
be the majority. The fact is that I was the excuse for the news
media that doesn't want to think about the issues and just wants to
cover stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he decided not to run for speaker, resigning from Congress
was the next logical step, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can have two head coaches on a team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced he would not run for another term as speaker
shortly after being re-elected to Sixth District congressional
seat. His decision to resign from Congress came days later.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation is effective at noon Jan. 3. A special election
to fill the seat is expected in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich said he and his wife aren't going from Capitol Hill
to the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving public office, but we're not leaving public
life,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will speak out for Social Security reform and
redefining America's role in the world. And he will work to shorten
the time it takes for state-of-the-art medical research to become
standard practice in the typical doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said changing the Social Security system is his top
priority. He proposed allowing people to put 3 percent of their
income into a private retirement account instead of into the Social
Security system. The current federal budget surplus could be used
to make up the difference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks, Carol Hughes, chairwoman of Gingrich's
disabilities task force, presented him with a book, ``Dinosaur
Hunters,'' in recognition of his fossil-collecting hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, whose son uses a wheelchair, praised Gingrich as a
compassionate champion for the disabled and triggered a sustained
standing ovation when she said, ``There is not another leader in
the world today of his caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people lined up in the aisles of the Walton High
School auditorium to speak to Gingrich, and to a person they
offered thanks and praise. A few in the crowd held up signs of
support, but many more cradled camcorders to record the speaker's
last town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Widow Diane Davis grew emotional has she thanked Gingrich for
his support of the ``innocent spouse'' law, which protects spouses
from being forced to pay the delinquent tax bills of their late, or
former, husbands or wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the day when I can vote for you for
president of the United States of America,'' said Davis, who was
released from an IRS lein for taxes her husband owed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the meeting went far beyond its scheduled time, some of
Gingrich's supporters wished he had said more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had mentioned education in the state of Georgia,''
said Dan Buyers, a 27-year-old commercial Realtor from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers, who filled out ``A Farewell Note to Newt'' on a form
passed around by the speaker's staff, said he would like to see
Gingrich focus his expertise as an educator locally. Buyers
believes Gingrich can use his leadership talents to make Georgia a
testing ground for improving public education. If successful,
Buyers said, Gingrich could take the formula to the nation in a
year 2000 presidential election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Eidell, 50, a Roswell sales manager in the funeral
industry, wanted Gingrich to say more about tax reform. However,
Eidell was pleased that Gingrich had discussed overhauling the
Social Security program by giving individuals more control of the
fund. Eidell, a volunteer with Citizens for an Alternative Tax
System, said giving ``control back to the people'' is fundamental
to both reform movements.

PANEL APPROVES FOURTH IMPEACHMENT CHARGE, REJECTS CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee, nearly united in
disdain for President Clinton's misconduct but irreparably split
over the appropriate sanction, approved a fourth impeachment charge
Saturday against the president and rejected a resolution to censure
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the last public act of the committee's historic drama, the
Republican-controlled panel voted along party lines, 21-16, to
recommend Clinton's impeachment for allegedly abusing the power of
his office by lying to Congress about his extramarital affair with
a former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure alternative lost several hours later,
22-14, as Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat,
joined every Republican in opposing the option. Scott and
Representative Maxine Waters of California, who voted present,
complained that Clinton has been treated unjustly in the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Amid high solemnity tinged with raw political posturing, the
climactic votes unfolded as members of both parties jockeyed
fiercely to sway a critical bloc of undecided lawmakers who are
expected to decide Clinton's fate when the impeachment saga reaches
the House floor on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the struggle for the hearts and souls of the
undecideds will escalate in the final days before the showdown, as
the White House, Republican leaders, and advocacy groups on both
sides of the issue wage campaigns to seize the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The decibel level had risen since the panel approved three
articles of impeachment the day before: two counts of perjury and
one count of obstructing justice, all arising from Clinton's
alleged attempt to coverup his sexual liaisons with Lewinsky in the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the committee's action in the face of what polls say
is overwhelming public support for a censure and opposition to
impeachment, the panel's chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde,
said the multiple allegations of perjury and obstruction against
Clinton warrant the only constitutional remedy available to
Congress: his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Censure, Hyde said, ``is similar to yelling at a teenager. It
purges you of your emotional feelings, but I don't know what it
accomplishes.''
</P>
<P>
   A prime sponsor of the censure resolution, Representative
William D. Delahunt of Quincy, cited the public preference for the
alternative sanction, which was first proposed by a Republican,
former President Gerald R. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution is not a suicide pact,'' Delahunt said. ``It
does not compel us to detonate a nuclear explosion when light
artillery will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had appealed the day earlier for a censure to
resolve his impeachment crisis, was flying to the Middle East
Saturday when the committee snubbed his plea.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, special counsel Gregory Craig warned that
the enduring impeachment process could have dire consequences for
the country _ and possibly the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the goal of the partisan majority on the committee is to
impeach the president and remove him from office, the certain
result would be to divide the country, gridlock the government, and
defy the will of the people,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, hinting at a possible backlash against the Republican
majority, added: ``In the end, the American people will make the
final judgment about whether the impeachment of the president is in
the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a fractious, two-month inquiry, committee Republicans
Saturday abruptly dropped three of the four proposed sections of
the abuse-of-power charge. The move was approved, 29-5, with three
Democrats voting present on the premise that the amended article is
no less offensive than the original measure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes, Clinton no longer is at risk of losing his
office for misleading the American people by denying he had sexual
relations with Lewinsky. He also will not face charges that he
``willfully made false and misleading statements'' to his Cabinet
and top aides.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the scope of the fourth article was narrowed, at
the urging of Representative George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania
Republican, by removing a reference to Clinton's assertion of
executive privilege to try to limit testimony that was sought by
investigators in the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the fourth impeachment article charges Clinton with
making ``perjurious, false, and misleading statements'' in his
responses to 81 questions from the committee asking him to admit to
aspects of the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde called Clinton's responses ``an assault on the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats said the 81 questions were an unfair ploy to
force Clinton to admit guilt despite his constitutional right to be
presumed innocent. They also chided Republicans for recommending
removing Clinton from office over responses to questions about
intimate details of his private, consensual sex life, and about
gifts that he and Lewinsky exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   One perjury charge in the article alleges that Clinton abused
the power of his office in answering a question about gifts he
bought at the Black Dog on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not there were additional gifts from the Black Dog
cannot possibly be grounds for removal of the president of the
United States,'' said Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In defeat, the censure plan's future remains highly uncertain,
though it looms as a potentially decisive factor in whether Clinton
will be allowed to serve the remainder of his term with the taint
of a congressional rebuke or will suffer the grave indignity of a
Senate trial that could force him to forfeit the presidency in
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties believe a censure vote in the full
House would prevail because it would permit undecided moderate
Republicans to express their outrage at Clinton's misdeeds without
endorsing the step of ousting a president without an election.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republican leaders have steadfastly refused to
sanction a censure vote. And several Democrats said they might only
be swayed by public pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a censure resolution on the House floor,''
Delahunt said, ``unless the American people become engaged in the
process and stand up and demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that bordered at times on the surreal, the Judiciary
Committee executed what many members described as their most
serious duty other than declaring war as the rest of official
Washington was shuttered for the weekend and much of the public was
congregating at Christmas tree lots and holiday shopping spots.
</P>
<P>
   The censure resolution also was pushed by the committee's other
two Massachusetts Democrats: Representatives Barney Frank of Newton
and Martin T. Meehan of Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said lawmakers should not think ``the president will just
laugh at a censure resolution and there will be champagne toasts at
the White House.'' To support his assertion, he cited Frank's
comments last week about the effect of his reprimand by the House
for an ethics violation stemming from his relationship with a male
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you that having been reprimanded by this House of
Representatives, where I'm so proud to serve, was no triviality,''
Frank said. ``It is not something that is a matter of pride. I wish
I could go back and undo it.''

VOTERS REALLY EXIST AND ARE ANGRY AT BEING CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his latest effort to overturn his apparent defeat
in the November election, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco has
challenged the votes of Elias Alvarez, Susan Linder, Edleena
Alexander and 100,000 others in New York City, asserting that they
had moved or were otherwise ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   But a check by The New York Times of all the voters challenged
by Vacco in three election districts found nearly all at home,
living at or near the addresses on their voting records, and many
furious with Vacco and his tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that Vacco's challenge has serious
methodological flaws. Vacco's charges of widespread vote fraud will
be taken up in a state court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco skipped about a third of all Assembly districts, but in
districts where he challenged votes, he cut deep into the election
rolls, challenging one in eight votes cast. This approach produced
a challenge list of a virtual cross-section of New York society _
or at least of registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The largest shares of votes that he challenged were in minority
neighborhoods _ including one of every three votes cast in a
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, a largely poor black
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, by slightly
more than 26,000 votes, Vacco, a Republican, has already raised,
and then dropped, technical challenges to absentee ballots, and
broad claims that thousands of votes might have been cast in the
names of dead voters.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest challenge, Vacco questioned voters whose names and
addresses appeared in election registration lists but did not
exactly match the names and addresses provided by Experian, a
commercial credit reporting and mailing list company. Vacco has so
far unsuccessfully sought to get the police to canvass challenged
voters to see if they exist and are eligible, meeting citizenship
and residency requirements.
</P>
<P>
   When The Times systematically looked at the challenged voters in
election districts in three neighborhoods, it found the vast
majority of the challenged voters late last week with little more
than a day of legwork, at or near an address provided by the
election board.
</P>
<P>
   In Alvarez's mostly Hispanic election district in Washington
Heights, 22 voters were challenged. One voter had an unlisted phone
at her address on Dongan Place and could not be found, and a
building superintendent said that another had moved out in the last
few weeks, around Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The others, like Alvarez, a maintenance worker at a UNICEF
office on First Avenue in Manhattan, were identified through
interviews, or by relatives, neighbors, building workers or mail
carriers or through drivers' licenses and other government records.
</P>
<P>
   One voter, Patricia Reilly, has worked as an Election Day
inspector for 20 years. Ms. Reilly, a retired executive secretary,
said she had lived at the same address for 36 years. ``He has a lot
of nerve,'' she said of Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Alexander's election district around West 129th Street
in Harlem, The Times accounted for all but three of the 32 people
challenged. Neighbors said two people on the list had moved out of
their apartments and a third was registered at a building that was
said to be unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   Under election rules, voters who move are supposed to vote at
their new polling places. But election officials said that if
someone votes at his old voting place and still lives in the city,
the vote is still valid.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Alexander has lived at the same address on West 129th
Street for 15 years. A few years ago, she and her husband, a
contractor, moved into Apartment 11, and then to Apartment 8 in the
same building during renovations, and she wondered whether that was
enough to snare her in Vacco's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe he is nit-picky like this,'' she said. ``I was
born into the world a Democrat. But if someone says something worth
listening to on the other side, I will vote for that person. But I
don't think Vacco has what it takes. Somebody who is so involved in
something so minor like this could never get my vote.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And in Ms. Linder's more affluent high-rise neighborhood around
East 63rd Street in Manhattan, populated by investment bankers,
lawyers and the like, all 24 challenged voters were found living at
their official addresses. And 14 of the challenged voters in the
district had listed telephone numbers in their own names. While the
Vacco campaign challenged only 24 people there, they represented
roughly one in four Democratic votes cast in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least they didn't think I was dead,'' said Gail
Zahler, who has lived on East 64th Street for 29 years. She said
the list of challenged voters showed a business address she had
used eight years before.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Linder, a fund raiser at the New York Public Library,
could not fathom why her name appeared. ``Is this a Nixon enemies
list?'' she asked. ``I think it is outrageous to arbitrarily find
Democratic names, and frankly I don't have much sympathy for Vacco.
I think he is a sore loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Spargo, Vacco's lawyer, said that because of
difficulties in exactly matching names, and because people move
within the same building, he had always expected to find that half
of the votes cast on his list were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he still hoped to find enough questionable votes to
invalidate the results, but that no effort was made to target
minorities. ``To me, this is a mathematical exercise,'' he said.
``I have no idea where those election districts are or who resides
in them.''

   (NYT6) RAMALLAH, West Bank -- Dec. 12, 1998 -- PALESTINE-STATE,
12-12 -- Palestinians are enjoying many new symbols of sovereignty,
among them a national flag, which this unemployed man uses for his
midday prayers. The Palestinians, with a relatively sizable
intellectual elite, international help and the model of Israel,
have moved more quickly and closer toward developing democratic
institutions than any of their Arab neighbors, experts say. (Rina

   (NYT5) TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Dec. 12, 1998 -- IMPEACH-REACT-2,
12-12 -- Paul Janos, 43, a candidate for mayor of Tarrytown says
that he does not think the president should be exempt from laws.
``I know that a lot of people are tired of it, myself included, but
what's right is right, what's wrong is wrong,'' he says of Clinton.
But he wonders, ``Is it worth the turmoil?'' ``I'm afraid of what
the market reaction will be.'' (Librado Romero/New York Times

   (NYT4) TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Dec. 12, 1998 -- IMPEACH-REACT-1,
12-12 -- As the House Judiciary Committee approves articles of
impeachment against President Clinton, the seriousness of the
situation began to sink in around the historic village of
Tarrytown, N.Y. Still, others have been shutting out the issue.

   (NYT3) BIRNEY, Mont. -- Dec. 12, 1998 -- MONTANA-RAIL-2, 12-12
-- Irv Alderson, a 68-year-old rancher, and his daughter Jeanie,
owners of the Bones Brothers Ranch, are opposed to a $385 million
railroad link that would bisect the Montana's Tongue River Valley.
The cost to the valley, they say, will be unbearable. ``It's
already split the community,'' says Alderson. ``There's people who
don't speak to each other anymore.'' (Jim Robbins/New York Times

   (NYT2) BIRNEY, Mont. -- Dec. 12, 1998 -- MONTANA-RAIL-1, 12-12
-- Montana's Tongue River Valley, may seem peaceful, but a proposal
to build a $385 million rail link to haul coal from the isolated
area has divided residents, some of whom see a bonanza and others a
disaster waiting to happen. The proposed rail line would bring
startling change to an area where stillness is broken only by
cattle lowing or an occasional tractor-trailer hauling livestock.

   (NYT1) UNDATED -- Dec. 12, 1998 -- HOG-FARMER-WOES, 12-12 -- Rex
Hoppes feeding his pigs on his 160-acre farm near Indianola, Iowa.
The near-collapse of the market for hogs -- his now sell for far
less than last year -- has forced him to take money out of a
retirement account to keep going and has led him to question his
lifelong dream of being a hog farmer. (Rodney White/New York Times

TREATMENT PUTS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE FOR HORNETS' FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ind., Minn., N.C., Texas)  (rl) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Royal would pull out of his driveway on a glorious day
and find himself winding through the golf courses that brush stroke
the fringes of Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh-cut grass was everywhere. Normally, Royal would have
inhaled the scent. But now he knew the slightest sniff would cause
his 6-foot-8-inch frame to recoil in nausea. So he would press on
in his 15-mile drive with the windows rolled up and his choices in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   What route would he take this time: Interstate or back roads? No
matter how often he varied the trip, the journey he has taken five
times each of the last six months would lead him to the parking lot
of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. He knew that the moment he
walked through the door it would hit him, this foul odor that only
people like himself could detect. Only people going through
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst smell you can ever imagine,'' Royal said in an
interview on Wednesday, two days before his last chemotherapy
treatment. ``It's weird, but no one else would notice but us.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the clinic, Royal would take his seat in the waiting room
with other patients. He would nod politely to the familiar faces.
How could a slash-to-the-basket forward in the NBA end up with a
diagnosis of colon cancer at age 32 on a summer day in June, just
one month after he was springing off the bench for the Charlotte
Hornets in the playoffs? That question was not on his mind as he
waited, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think about?'' he said. ``The people around
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I went to the center and did the chemo and saw people
dealing with the same thing,'' Royal said in a voice that was weary
but steady, ``I realized that I should be thankful for the fact
that my situation is curable. At times, you're sitting next to
people who are desperate, people on their last hope. They're
getting chemo and radiation at the same time. And it's kids. You
see them losing their hair and with skin that has turned green from
the treatment. It hurts your heart. I know my situation, as tough
as it is, theirs is twice as bad. All anyone in that room is doing
is trying to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   For Royal, the word survival has a tangible meaning. On July 1,
at the same time the NBA began its lockout, a catheter was being
surgically planted in Royal's chest for his first 15-minute
treatment _ it's called a ``push'' _ of chemotherapy. While other
players began to talk of ``fighting for our livelihood'' and
``struggling for survival,'' Royal was losing 20 pounds from his
customary 218 because of nausea and fatigue that made him too tired
to eat. As owners argued that they needed a new basic agreement
with the players to guarantee the economic health of their
franchises, Royal was popping Jolly Ranchers to cover the metallic
taste that coated his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `What's going on in the league?''' said Royal,
who was a player representative for the Orlando Magic when the last
collective bargaining agreement was signed, in 1995. ``I get calls
from people and hear what's going on. But I don't concern myself
with it like I did in the past. I don't need the extra stress.
There are other things to focus on. My priorities are very
different now. One thing you gain is perspective. I'm just so
grateful for what I have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Royal has never lacked gratitude. He did not barge into the NBA
as a hot draft choice with a shoe deal. He was a Notre Dame
graduate with a political science degree. As the Cavaliers'
third-round draft choice in 1987, Royal was viewed as a quick but
limited player saddled with a hard-boiled jumper. He was released
in the pre-season.
</P>
<P>
   It was either give up and settle into an office job or labor in
the lunch-pail atmosphere of the Continental Basketball
Association. He chose the latter, which meant spending three years
eating Thanksgiving meals in restaurants like Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, he was playing in Israel. Not long after his arrival,
Royal was in a Tel Aviv mall when a woman placed a bag next to him.
It was ticking. Royal did not notice at first, but then people
started scattering and a man pulled on him and told him to run. As
he dashed from the mall, the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   That was not his only narrow escape. Twenty-four hours before
Iraq launched its first Scud missile at Israel during the Persian
Gulf War, Royal boarded the last flight out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in some tight situations, I guess,'' Royal said. ``A
lot has happened, hasn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it has. Eventually, he got his chance. After stops in
Minnesota and San Antonio sandwiched around his time in Israel, he
went from role player to starter with the Magic in 1993 and landed
a two-year, $2 million contract. It was solid money for a solid,
middle-tier player, and he was thankful for it.
</P>
<P>
   When he became a participant in the collective bargaining
negotiations that led to the 1995 agreement, Royal's demeanor was
in stark contrast to the chest-thumping rhetoric that has been on
display during the current labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald was a calm voice,'' former union president Buck
Williams said. ``He was soft-spoken and really cared about the guys
he represented, guys that were role players. At the right time,
he'd say just the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal is level-headed and cool by nature. Bombs could not rattle
him. But cancer did. In a scenario similar to that of the Yankees'
Darryl Strawberry, Royal discovered he had colon cancer just in
time to give himself a chance. In February, shortly after he was
waived by the Heat and signed by the Hornets, he began to notice
blood in his stool. It was sporadic, and Royal shrugged it off. By
the end of the season, the sight of blood grew more frequent and
abdominal pains started to bother him. But the playoffs were on and
this was no time to get sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I just avoided it, it would go away,'' Royal
said. ``No man wants to go and get his colon checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, he dropped into a family clinic one day in
mid-June. In one surreal week, he learned he had an orange-sized
tumor that was malignant. After surgery to remove the tumor on June
24, doctors discovered cancer in one of the 17 lymph nodes taken
from the area. His shock was quickly replaced by tears and horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `I got it too late; &UR;  &LR; oh no, I got it too
late,''' Royal said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors assured him that he had hope. With chemotherapy,
there was a good chance of survival. But nothing could have
prepared him for the effects of chemotherapy. Not only are there
physical ravages, but the weakening of the immune system leads to
physical isolation. Going out can be unhealthy. Anyone with a
sniffle is off limits.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped to have family around the house, like his wife
Robin, his daughter Shauntel and his mother. When everything else
makes him queasy, Royal can still find room for a hot helping of
his mother's red beans and rice. When he is cooped up in his house,
phone calls form a bridge to the outside world. One call came from
Eric Davis, the former Baltimore Oriole who recovered from colon
cancer to play baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first talked, I just wanted to pump him up, almost
like a pep talk when you're up by 1 point with 30 seconds on the
clock,'' said Digger Phelps, who coached Royal at Notre Dame. ``You
tell them, `Hold on and you're going to win.' I knew he had to go
through this whole horrible process. I just wanted him to know he
was going to get through this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with Donald, he knows how to fight. There's a silent
force inside him that's very powerful. I think sometimes if you put
yourself in the right mental state you can beat anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Royal completed his last chemotherapy treatment.
After six months, it is finally over. ``I made it through,'' he
said. While he is optimistic about his future _ he would like to
play two more years _ he will be monitored for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the league,'' Royal said with a half-laugh.
``But I know I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Years may pass before he truly knows if he has beaten cancer.
But for now, Royal can take comfort in knowing that his taste buds
and his sense of smell will return in the coming weeks. Fresh-cut
grass can be appreciated again. Soon, he will feel like his old
self, lively and energetic. The weight room awaits. Soon, the scent
that rudely greeted him at the door of the cancer center will fade
from his memory. And yet, he will never forget the people he sat
with in the waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen what chemotherapy does to people,'' Royal said. ``In
that room, there are all races and creeds, elderly and young. There
are kids in there on a drip, which is an IV. They are in there for
three hours. I was 15 minutes and out. The chemo I went through was
minor in comparison. You see the desperation around you, and you
know you're the lucky one.''

34th Street to Canal Street _ is 4.6 percent,'' said Rob Martin, a
managing director at Insignia/ESG, the real-estate services and
brokerage concern. ``There are more of these companies and they are
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ippolito, a managing director at Newmark &AMP; Company Real
Estate, added: ``Over the last three years, new media has emerged
as a major force in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives say that the concentration of advertising
and publishing companies in New York has attracted technically
oriented companies who want to tap into the city's talent pool.
``New York has become the content capital of the Internet
industry,'' said Mark Mandell, an associate director of Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield and a specialist in new-media companies.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``new media'' generally applies to activities now done
on computer screens that were once done on paper or film, and it is
usually stretched to include electronic commerce and services
consumed by new-media companies. ``Information technology'' is also
a term used to describe these companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study published in October 1997 by the Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand consulting and accounting firm, employment in new-media
companies increased from a total of 71,500 at the end of 1995 to
105,000 by the middle of last year and was projected to hit about
140,000 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are no generally agreed-upon estimates of the amount of
space being used by new-media companies, partly because many of
them also fall under such categories as advertising agencies. But
if each of the workers counted in the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand survey
occupied 100 square feet of office space _ well below the 150 to
250 square feet typical in office buildings _ the total amount
would be well into millions of square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new companies _ 3 years old is considered mature
in this industry _ are opting for locations north of the Wall
Street area, where the city-sponsored Plug 'n' Go program has
attracted high-tech companies to subsidized prewired space in the
financial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that Silicon Alley started in the Flatiron
area and Wall Street was added later,'' said Joshua Glantz, the
director of business development at Rare Medium, an interactive
advertising agency that has 15,000 square feet at 44 West 18th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Alley'' is the shorthand term used to describe the
new-media and related companies, echoing the ``Silicon Valley''
label for the concentration of computer-related companies near San
Francisco. The Coopers &AMP; Lybrand report included a map showing
everything south of 41st Street as Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Glantz said that a lot of startup companies and those that are
in their second or third phase of growth were taking space in the
Flatiron area. ``There must be a half a dozen companies like ours
between 18th and 20th streets and Fifth and Sixth avenues,'' he
said. ``You can't go to lunch and talk about business, because you
are probably going to have a competitor at the next table.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Plug 'n' Go program, sponsored by
the Alliance for Downtown New York and the city's Economic
Development Corp., has been unsuccessful. According to alliance
officials, 171 leases have been signed in downtown buildings since
the program was initiated in February 1997 after the successful
marketing of the building at 55 Broad St. as a high-technology
center by Rudin Management Co.
</P>
<P>
   Plug 'n' Go offers incentives for landlords to install
high-capacity telecommunications in their buildings and offers
tenants below-market rents _ currently as low as $19 a square foot
for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Weisbrod, the president of the alliance, said that a report
in Crain's business weekly in April 1997, had said that 40 percent
of the information-technology companies signing leases over the
previous two years had moved in below Chambers Street.
</P>
<P>
   But brokers say many companies are wary of downtown's
still-sparse nightlife in terms of hiring technical staff. ``The
quality of after-work life is not great compared to SoHo and
Flatiron,'' said Mandell of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. ``When they grow
out of those incubators, they tend to look to Midtown South, so
there are no negatives in attracting highest-quality people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cushman &AMP; Wakefield sees the new-media business as so attractive
that it is one of the sponsors of the New York New Media
Association, a trade association for the people in new-media
companies. Alice O'Rourke, the executive director of the group,
said 1,400 new members joined the group this year, pushing
membership to close to 3,200, or a 60 percent increase in one year.

<P>
   Most of the new-media companies have similar histories. A small
group of people think they have an idea that could be commercially
viable. On the West Coast, these startups have traditionally been
located in garages. In New York they begin in people's apartments.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea is a good one, the task is to search for an
``angel,'' an individual or company willing to make an investment
so the new enterprise can grow fast enough to keep up with the
rapidly changing world of new media and electronic commerce. At
this point, the fledgling enterprise usually moves from apartments
to commercial space in low-rent districts.
</P>
<P>
   For Rare Medium it was 2,500 square feet on 17th Street from
1995 until it moved into its present location early this year.
</P>
<P>
   When growth pushes the number of employees from a few dozen to
hundreds, and more substantial financial backing has been found,
the firm leaves its incubator for larger space where it has more
control of the communications, electric power and other
infrastructure issues.
</P>
<P>
   Trev Huxley and a partner started Muze in Huxley's
600-square-foot apartment in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn
in 1990. Now he has 121 employees and 28,000 square feet of space
on the top floor of the building at 304 Hudson St., between Spring
and Vandam streets.
</P>
<P>
   Muze supplies information on music, videos and books to
retailers selling those products, both in traditional stores and
online at Web sites. As befits a company whose roots are in music,
one of its early angels was Bob Weir of the band Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now largely owned by John Kluge of Metromedia
Co., although Weir maintains his investment.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he personally likes Williamsburg and still
lives there, Huxley said that by the mid-1990s it became obvious
that the company needed a location in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for the staff to get to Williamsburg and we
needed a place where we could meet with clients,'' Huxley said. His
decision to move to Manhattan came at a time when Trinity Church,
which owns much of the property in the Hudson Square area, was in
the midst of replacing the printing companies that had operated
there for decades with higher-tech tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of tenant we were looking for,'' Stephen
Heyman, the director of commercial real estate for Trinity Real
Estate, said of Muze. ``This is New York's fastest-growing sector
in terms of office. We did not so much target them as they started
knocking on our door.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of 304 Hudson's industrial history there is plenty of
electrical power for the big servers and the hundreds of personal
computers these technology-based companies require, Heyman said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the site is close to the Holland Tunnel, where the
main fiber-optic telecommunications lines enter the city, it is
relatively easy to provide the robust communications services that
online companies need. ``Any building of reasonable size can get
this stuff, but you have to be in the city,'' he said. ``If you are
out in New Jersey it won't be as easy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Huxley, a grandson of the author Aldous Huxley,
moving Muze into the Hudson Street building raised other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's employees enter data and add comment to
the databases on music, books and videos. This information is used
to update touch-screen terminals in retail stores and for the Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a bookstore a person could request a list of
titles by author, geographic area, or a period in time. The screen
will list the titles available. By touching or clicking through to
subsequent screens, a shopper can find descriptions of the work and
reviews of it.
</P>
<P>
   The company supplies monthly CDs to stores with freestanding
terminals, but updates its electronic database more quickly as
information becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little like a news organization, and we sometimes
work 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Huxley said, noting that
Muze rushed out additional information on Frank Sinatra after the
singer's death earlier this year. ``But the building turns the heat
off at 5 p.m., so we had to add heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, in the summer, heat is a big problem, since the
company has large server computers operating around the clock and
has approximately three personal computers for every employee. All
that equipment generates heat. ``So we had to add extra cooling,''
Huxley said, ``and since we can't afford to go down, we need
redundant power and telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most new-media companies, Muze has avoided the standard
office layout of executive offices on the outer perimeter of each
floor in favor of an open layout that allows natural light from the
windows to penetrate to the interior. Nor has it bothered with a
dropped ceiling to conceal the utilities. Instead, most of the
wiring is in a tray about 10 feet off the floor where it will not
be in people's way but will be readily accessible when changes are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 years old, Muze is an established company that is
contemplating a public stock offering and can afford to be a bit
choosy about where its space is located and how it is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Newer firms being financed by their founders have fewer options.
Thinking Media Corp. occupies about 3,000 square feet in an old
garment-industry building at 34 West 17th St. The space is raw and
open, with wiring exposed on the walls and not an air conditioner
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an old shoe factory _ we are the first office
tenant,'' said Owen Davis, the chief executive of the company,
which produces interactive advertisements and customer-tracking
software.
</P>
<P>
   On the company's Web page (www.thethinkingmedia.com) is an
advertisement for Procter &AMP; Gamble's Bounty paper towels that
invites viewers to drag a graphic representation of a towel to
clean up a spill and then asks users for information in exchange
for a free sample.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he located the 3-year old company on 17th Street two
years ago ``because the rents were incredibly cheap.'' But they
have risen as the area has attracted more tenants and he said he
may be forced to move to a less expensive location in the future.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said space in side-street buildings in Flatiron and
Chelsea could be rented annually for $10 to $14 a square foot two
to three years ago and can still be found in the midteens today.
But they say that space near the Flatiron Building at Broadway and
23rd Street and along Park Avenue South has risen to the high teens
and mid-$20s.
</P>
<P>
   Mandell said space in the Hudson Square area is renting in the
low $20s for lesser quality buildings to close to $30 a square foot
for well-situated, well-equipped space.
</P>
<P>
   Some landlords apparently have a strategy of renting unimproved
space to fledgling high-technology concerns at low rates secure in
the knowledge that the companies will pay for improvements they
need to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a sweatshop,'' said Glenn Meyers, the president of
Rare Medium, referring to the company's space on West 18th Street.
``There was lead cable in the risers and no electricity,'' he said,
adding that there were problems of electrical interference from
industrial companies still operating in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to put in fiber risers for telecommunications, more
electricity and surge protection,'' Meyers said. ``We fixed the
building for the landlord and changed $5 space to $25 space.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the company may be forced by its rapid
growth to consider moving. ``We are pretty much maxed out of space
here,'' he said. ``That's how it goes in this business, you grow,
max and move.'' Brokers said successful companies that are moving
to larger quarters typically sublet their old space to startup
companies that benefit from the improvements already made.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be another side to this landlord-tenant duet.
Real-estate executives say landlords are often willing to spend
money building space for new-media companies with questionable
prospects and no credit, because they can usually rent it to
another high-tech company without doing much more than painting the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our track record with Internet companies is better than
average, but if they get in trouble, they usually merge and
somebody else steps in,'' said James Doran, director of property
management for Trinity Real Estate. ``If you do have one go under,
what you are left with is a prebuilt unit for the next guy. This is
usually not the case with standard office tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   We wire our spaces to the hilt, so that when we grow and move
on, it is suitable for a startup,'' said Ronald Ruegg, controller
of Interworld Corp., which went from an apartment to three small
spaces of under 5,000 square feet each in Chelsea to 50,000 square
feet at 395 Hudson St., between King and Charlton streets.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Interworld are greeted by a glassed-in computer room
as they step off the elevators, with the blinking lights of the
powerful machines indicating the work going on within. The room is
meant to convey the look of matured high technology, said John
Henderson, a designer with Studios Architecture, which designed the
interior.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, Interworld is not a new-media company, its
executives insist, but they admit that because they are involved in
electronic commerce they get counted as a Silicon Alley company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expertise is in transaction processing,'' said Charles
Rich, a senior strategic analyst for the company. He said the
company produced systems that allowed companies selling on the
Internet to fulfill orders and process payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here because the relevant expertise is on Wall
Street,'' he said. ``When you need to process a large volume of
highly valuable transactions and do it without making mistakes, you
are describing what Wall Street has been doing for years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Interworld executives say their admiration for Wall
Street talent does not extend to wanting to physically be downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The prewired spaces in the Plug 'n' Go program were
unattractive, Ruegg said, because they were not specialized for
Interworld's needs. ``We wanted to build our own space and do it
our way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although it presents a corporate front for customers and
investors, the company is still a high-tech operation with a pool
table, a pinball machine and a weight room to allow employees to
work off strain and tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a cultural advantage here,'' Rich said. ``Downtown is
very impersonal. This location protects our identity.''

CLINTON ARRIVES IN MIDDLE EAST FOR THREE-DAY VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Far from the bitter impeachment hearings threatening
to engulf his office, President Clinton arrived Saturday to carry
out a historic and personal commitment to overcome the mistrust
between Israelis and Palestinians that has blocked a path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   At an airport ceremony last night that began a challenging
three-day mission, including the first visit by a US president to
Palestinian territory, Clinton urged both sides to live up to the
commitments in the troubled land-for-security deal they signed in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that for two peoples who are fated to share this
land, peace is not simply an option,'' Clinton said, ``but the only
choice that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension,
and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said of the
deal concluded after nine days of dogged diplomacy at the Wye River
Plantation in Maryland. ``I believe it now. But both sides must now
face the challenge of implementing Wye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton concluded the remarks by saying: ``It is good to be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a stange twist of fate that Clinton's journey back into
the lion's den of Mideast conflict seems to offer him political
shelter from the storm of controversy he left behind in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip will be anything but easy.
</P>
<P>
   New Israeli ultimatums and bloody West Bank street clashes,
which continued Saturday, have stalled the Wye agreement. The
visit, planned in October to celebrate the success of Wye, now has
become a mission to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began immediately trying to sell the benefits of moving
forward on peace to embittered Israelis and Palestinians, an effort
their own leaders have failed to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his trip, the fourth to Israel in his presidency,
was to honor a promise he made at Wye ``to speak with the people of
Israel and the Palestinians about the benefits of peace, and to
stand by you as you take risks for a just, lasting, and secure
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many security analysts indicated Clinton may be taking his own
risks as violence and threats of violence have been heightened by
extremists intent on destroying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 Israeli military and police were on duty last
night to ensure Clinton's safety as Air Force One touched down in
Tel Aviv and the president, Mrs. Clinton, and their daughter,
Chelsea, were shuttled by helicopter to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the arrival, violent clashes continued in the
West Bank town of Bethlehem, where Clinton is to light a Christmas
tree on Monday. Saturday, near the birthplace of Jesus, tear gas
and acrid black smoke from street clashes enveloped a banner that
read ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian protesters have taken to the street in angry protest
because they say Israel has not met a commitment to release
hundreds of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a verbal agreement at Wye, Israel agreed to release some 750
Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase last month, Israel
released 250 prisoners, but most of them were common criminals,
many of whom had only a short time left on their sentences. The
Palestinians claim the agreement was to free what they call
``political prisoners,'' those involved in the political and armed
struggle against Israel. But Netanyahu insists he will release none
with ``blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Saturday the release of
more ``political prisoners'' would be ``a real indication Israel is
implementing'' the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the prisoners, Clinton will face deep challenges in
confronting other issues that threaten the Wye agreement. The
agreement spelled out specific steps that the Palestinians must
take to step up its fight against terrorism aimed at Israel in
exchange for Israeli troop withdrawls from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel last week issued an ultimatum, saying that it would
not cede any more West Bank land to Palestinians in the aftermath
of violent street clashes that Israel claims were provoked by
Palestinian leaders. Chilling videotape of an attack by Palestinian
stone throwers on an Israeli citizen and a soldier put intense
domestic pressure on Netanyahu to act.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the violence in his ultimatum, Netanyahu said Israel
would cede no more West Bank land until Arafat clearly retracted
repeated statements that he would unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state in May, the expiration of the five-year peace
process that began in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   This left both sides claiming that the other has violated the
Wye agreement. It will be a difficult task, analysts said, for
Clinton to re-establish trust between the two sides in time for the
next scheduled phase of Israeli troop redeployments set for the end
of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism looms large in this presidential visit. Israelis worry
that Clinton's visit to the Palestinian areas may put a kind of
unofficial blessing on a future Palestinian state. The Palestinian
leaders are thrilled with that impression.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's senior aide David Bar-Illan said, ``We are concerned
that this trip will turn into an endorsement of a state, because it
has the trappings of a state visit. It concerns us because it
encourages the Palestinians to believe that they can indeed discard
the Oslo process by unilaterally declaring a state. We are looking
for a clear message from the president that this is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the red-carpet arrival for Clinton last night, an Israeli
military band played an old Zionist song from before the founding
of the state of Israel in 1948. Titled ``Tomorrow,'' The main
stanza was an ironic reminder of just how enduring are the
Israelis' hopes for peace in a secure state, and how Israel's
founders knew that would take a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The song says, ``All this will come tomorrow, if not today, and
if not tomorrow then the next day.''

 &HT;    L.A. signs Brown for $105M
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ A pitcher with just one 20-win season to his
credit and who has not won a Cy Young Award buzzed baseball's
salary structure Saturday. Kevin Brown is the game's first $100
million man.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers outlasted Baltimore and Colorado in a
fierce bidding war to lock Brown into a seven-year $105 million
deal that spun the winter meetings with its largesse. The agreement
includes no deferred payments and allows for twice-monthly charter
jet flights from his Macon home to L.A. at the club's expense
during the season to allow Brown's wife Candace and the couple's
young sons to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a (financial) position we did not want to exceed,''
said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone. ``We pushed it as far as
we could. We went as far as we thought we'd have to go. We could
not go any further.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal ended Randy Johnson's reign as the game's highest paid
player at just two weeks. Brown will average $15 million a year
compared to Johnson's $13.1 million via his five-year $65.1 million
deal with Arizona. Pedro Martinez, whose $76 million deal with
Boston was finalized a year ago Saturday, earns $12.5 million year.
Atlanta's Greg Maddux could be a bargain with a $10 million average
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about an hour ago, I got a lot smarter,'' said incoming
Dodger manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If Major League Baseball had any reservations about allowing
communications magnate Rupert Murdoch to buy the Dodgers this year,
those thoughts were being revisited even before the L.A. management
evacuated the podium. The Dodgers payroll at the end of the season
stood at $60.7 million and has now jumped to $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's reason for surprise but there is reason
for disappointment,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president
for baseball operations for MLB. ``As a former GM (with Oakland),
I'm alarmed by the contract. As a member of the commissioner's
office, I'm alarmed by the contract. And as a fan, I'm alarmed by
the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final stages, St. Louis and San Diego were eliminated for
being unwilling to add a seventh year to the deal and though both
the Rockies and Orioles expressed willingness to up the bid,
according to Malone, agent Scott Boras ended the process then.
Brown, the former Georgia Tech star, heads up a rotation that
includes Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort, Carlos Perez and Ismael
Valdes while throwing Dave Mlicki's fate into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' Johnson said. ``There's going
to be a lot of swagger there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who did not attend the announcement, will be 41 when the
contract expires in 2006. Only four pitchers have ever recorded
20-win seasons at age 40 (Phil Niekro, Warren Spahn, Grover
Cleveland Alexander and Cy Young) and only Young won 20 at 41. The
Dodgers countered that Brown's durability is excellent (only Maddux
matches his 1,400 innings over the last seven years) and would not
apologize about the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do, what the Dodgers do, what the major market teams
do, we can't really change,'' said Malone, former GM with
cash-strapped Montreal. ``The smaller markets have limitations. I
do not see how we can change that.''

REMAKING BIRMINGHAM'S DOWNTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP A. MORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ In 1986, when the Birmingham Historical
Society offered tours of the first loft apartments carved out of a
couple of low-rise former retail/warehouse buildings, large numbers
of curious people turned out to see what a new concept for this old
industrial city _ downtown living _ would be like.
</P>
<P>
   For a low-density metropolitan area of just under 1 million,
with wooded suburbs just a 10-minute drive from downtown, a further
demand for downtown residences seemed unlikely. But 14 structures
now have apartments, and with six more projects under way, there
will be a total of 236 units. They are part of a long-term effort
by the city and its various partners to remake its downtown as a
lively urban neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent developments _ the reopening of the long-closed
Loveman's department store in the old retail district elsewhere in
the city center as the McWane Center science and children's museum
and the restoration of the adjoining Alabama Theater _ have
stimulated interest in renovation for office, residential and other
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Under Richard Arrington Jr., the city's first black mayor, who
is now in his fifth four-year term, reviving the downtown through
renovation and new development has been encouraged through
low-interest loans, a strategic use of urban renewal programs,
parking decks coordinated with new projects, park upgrading and
sidewalk improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new concept for Birmingham,'' said Michael Calvert,
who since 1982 has headed Operation New Birmingham, a
public/private nonprofit organization charged with promoting
renovation and new development in the four-square-mile city center,
including downtown. The organization also acts as middleman between
developers and the city and expedites such matters as tax credits
for historic preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no tradition of living in the city center like you
find in older, East Coast cities,'' Calvert said. ``We've found
it's a niche market, but a bigger niche than most people
anticipated, and a growing one.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, rental lofts fared better than condominium sales. But
as the market became established, ownership has increased.
Currently, 45 percent of the apartments are owned by individuals,
mostly occupants. Many loft residents are lawyers or others with
offices downtown, but the live/work option has also proved
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 units in the three-story former Rhodes-Carroll furniture
warehouse, built in 1914, occupants with studios as well as living
space include a photographer, a film editor and the owner of an
advertising company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used a 2,400-square-foot space for living and working, but
we've grown again, so now I have a separate 1,200-square-foot space
a floor above for living,'' said John Montgomery, owner of BIG, a
public relations and advertising firm. ``It's a creative
environment. There is no commute. A lot of our customers are
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did voice a yearning for two more things in the district
_ ``a park, mainly for our animals, and a small deli market to pop
in and grab the things we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the newest projects involve architecturally
distinguished but functionally obsolete towers ranging from 10 to
21 stories. Most dramatic is the 1912 John Hand Building, a
21-story former bank building at the corner of First Avenue North
and 20th Street.
</P>
<P>
   That building and three others at the corner, the city's first
skyscrapers, are one block from the railroad lines that helped make
Birmingham an iron-and-steel boom town soon after its founding in
1871.
</P>
<P>
   The John Hand Building was bought at auction for $1.5 million in
1997 by Jimmy Taylor, a retired banker who, with a group of local
investors, then bought a small suburban bank, renamed it and
installed it in their building. ``I was so worried somebody was
going to buy John Hand and not do it right,'' said Taylor. ``It's
really the building that got me back into banking.''
</P>
<P>
   Above the space restored for the new Bank of Birmingham, floors
four through seven will be leased office space, eight through 19
will be converted into condominium residences and the top two
floors will be reserved for a new athletic club. Taylor said about
$10 million would be spent by the investment partners on
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 5,600-square-foot residential floors have
been sold at $200,000 per floor, unimproved. About half of them
will be single units; the rest of the floors will have two or three
apartments each.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his wife, Martha, will move from a distant suburb to
live on the 19th floor. Charles Barkley of the Houston Rockets
professional basketball team, who grew up in the Birmingham area,
has taken a floor.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of conversion from office to residential use has
surprised Robert Black, an architect who is supervising overall
renovations and is designing the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to save many features, even keeping some glass
hallway panels that will let us draw light to the interior,'' he
said. The modest floorplate size means all residents will have
views of Red Mountain to the south, downtown to the north and west
and, to the east, Birmingham's main airport just three miles away.
The city is covering the $3.8 million cost of new sidewalks and a
parking deck bridging adjacent vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Motives for the painstaking process of renovation vary. ``It
takes a special person to want to do this,'' said Calvert of
Operation New Birmingham, ``and love of old buildings is a big
factor. But many also see a chance for a great deal of appreciation
over the years as city-center values rise.''

   Adam Cohen and his father, Woody, who have a costume-jewelry
business have taken on four downtown residential projects. Among
them is the long-vacant, 17-story art-deco Watts Building, an
office tower built in 1929 in the heart of downtown. Purchased
three years ago for $327,000, its needed renovations have been hard
to finance. But with the help of a $970,000 low-interest loan from
the city, work is now under way on a $6 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Floors one through six will be built-to-suit offices; the rest
of the building will be occupied by rental apartments ranging in
size from an 880-square-foot one-bedroom to a 1,400-square-foot
two-bedroom and two 2,400-square-foot penthouses. Rents will range
from $800 to $975 for the one- and two-bedroom apartments; the
penthouses will rent for $2,300.
</P>
<P>
   Elias and Gaynell Hendricks, who own a chain of five local
day-care centers, bought the 10-story Transportation Building in
the heart of the roughly 12-square-block loft district and have
completed 17 loft apartments. They put one of their Wee Care
Academy operations on the ground floor and renovated the top two
floors for their residence.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Erdreich and her brother, Jeremy, an architect, recently
bought the former New Ideal retail building, built in 1927, to
convert it into 25 apartments with retail on the ground floor. They
made their purchase, they said, because Ms. Erdreich had enjoyed
living in Washington and her brother enjoyed living in downtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The city's director of planning, engineering and permits,
William Gilchrist, an architect by training, also points to new
residential construction, like the Southside Station market-rate
apartments near the University of Alabama at Birmingham medical
center, which have been developed by Atlanta's H.J. Russell
company, as further advancing the goal of 24-hour activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working hard to make permitting smoother and provide
amenities like new sidewalks, benches and trees. But we will stick
with design review, too. We need to keep the quality there. That's
why people have come.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lauriello, whose Southpace Properties has renovated 40
city-center buildings over the last 15 years for office or retail
use, said that the emergence of residential use as an option has
two positive effects: It takes vacant Class B and C office space
off the market and adds value to other uses because of the tone it
brings to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear many comments about people walking their dogs,'' he
said. ``Apparently, this makes everyone feel more comfortable about
the place. And in a city where living downtown takes getting used
to, comfort sells.''

CLINTON ARRIVES IN MIDDLE EAST FOR THREE-DAY VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (i and a coding)  
 For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Far from the bitter impeachment hearings threatening
to engulf his office, President Clinton arrived Saturday to carry
out a historic and personal commitment to overcome the mistrust
between Israelis and Palestinians that has blocked a path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   At an airport ceremony last night that began a challenging
three-day mission, including the first visit by a US president to
Palestinian territory, Clinton urged both sides to live up to the
commitments in the troubled land-for-security deal they signed in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that for two peoples who are fated to share this
land, peace is not simply an option,'' Clinton said, ``but the only
choice that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension,
and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said of the
deal concluded after nine days of dogged diplomacy at the Wye River
Plantation in Maryland. ``I believe it now. But both sides must now
face the challenge of implementing Wye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton concluded the remarks by saying: ``It is good to be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a stange twist of fate that Clinton's journey back into
the lion's den of Mideast conflict seems to offer him political
shelter from the storm of controversy he left behind in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But this trip will be anything but easy.
</P>
<P>
   New Israeli ultimatums and bloody West Bank street clashes,
which continued Saturday, have stalled the Wye agreement. The
visit, planned in October to celebrate the success of Wye, now has
become a mission to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began immediately trying to sell the benefits of moving
forward on peace to embittered Israelis and Palestinians, an effort
their own leaders have failed to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his trip, the fourth to Israel in his presidency,
was to honor a promise he made at Wye ``to speak with the people of
Israel and the Palestinians about the benefits of peace, and to
stand by you as you take risks for a just, lasting, and secure
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many security analysts indicated Clinton may be taking his own
risks as violence and threats of violence have been heightened by
extremists intent on destroying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 Israeli military and police were on duty last
night to ensure Clinton's safety as Air Force One touched down in
Tel Aviv and the president, Mrs. Clinton, and their daughter,
Chelsea, were shuttled by helicopter to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the arrival, violent clashes continued in the
West Bank town of Bethlehem, where Clinton is to light a Christmas
tree on Monday. Saturday, near the birthplace of Jesus, tear gas
and acrid black smoke from street clashes enveloped a banner that
read ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian protesters have taken to the street in angry protest
because they say Israel has not met a commitment to release
hundreds of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a verbal agreement at Wye, Israel agreed to release some 750
Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase last month, Israel
released 250 prisoners, but most of them were common criminals,
many of whom had only a short time left on their sentences. The
Palestinians claim the agreement was to free what they call
``political prisoners,'' those involved in the political and armed
struggle against Israel. But Netanyahu insists he will release none
with ``blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Saturday the release of
more ``political prisoners'' would be ``a real indication Israel is
implementing'' the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the prisoners, Clinton will face deep challenges in
confronting other issues that threaten the Wye agreement. The
agreement spelled out specific steps that the Palestinians must
take to step up its fight against terrorism aimed at Israel in
exchange for Israeli troop withdrawls from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel last week issued an ultimatum, saying that it would
not cede any more West Bank land to Palestinians in the aftermath
of violent street clashes that Israel claims were provoked by
Palestinian leaders. Chilling videotape of an attack by Palestinian
stone throwers on an Israeli citizen and a soldier put intense
domestic pressure on Netanyahu to act.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the violence in his ultimatum, Netanyahu said Israel
would cede no more West Bank land until Arafat clearly retracted
repeated statements that he would unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state in May, the expiration of the five-year peace
process that began in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   This left both sides claiming that the other has violated the
Wye agreement. It will be a difficult task, analysts said, for
Clinton to re-establish trust between the two sides in time for the
next scheduled phase of Israeli troop redeployments set for the end
of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism looms large in this presidential visit. Israelis worry
that Clinton's visit to the Palestinian areas may put a kind of
unofficial blessing on a future Palestinian state. The Palestinian
leaders are thrilled with that impression.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's senior aide David Bar-Illan said, ``We are concerned
that this trip will turn into an endorsement of a state, because it
has the trappings of a state visit. It concerns us because it
encourages the Palestinians to believe that they can indeed discard
the Oslo process by unilaterally declaring a state. We are looking
for a clear message from the president that this is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the red-carpet arrival for Clinton last night, an Israeli
military band played an old Zionist song from before the founding
of the state of Israel in 1948. Titled ``Tomorrow,'' The main
stanza was an ironic reminder of just how enduring are the
Israelis' hopes for peace in a secure state, and how Israel's
founders knew that would take a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The song says, ``All this will come tomorrow, if not today, and
if not tomorrow then the next day.''

FOR FRAMERS, PROCESS WAS ALL ABOUT POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's all politics.
</P>
<P>
   That's the dour conclusion many Americans, especially President
Clinton's staunch defenders, will probably reach as they consider
the House Judiciary Committee's mostly party-line votes for four
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But, to a degree, that's exactly what the framers of the
Constitution intended. Impeachment is, by design, a politician's
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on politics also explains why the House might vote
this week mostly along party lines to impeach Clinton, and it sheds
light on why the Senate could be likely to acquit Clinton in a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk last week about whether Clinton committed
perjury, the fact is there is no requirement that any member of
Congress determine the president broke a specific law. This is not
a case in which a defense attorney, such as Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.
in the O.J. Simpson trial, can point to a piece of exculpatory
evidence and say, ``You must acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this is a case in which many Republicans and Democrats
agree on the most important fact _ that Clinton lied about his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky _ but have come to different
conclusions whether that is an impeachable offense. It is a
political choice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the first
Democrat to come to the Senate floor earlier this year and strongly
condemn Clinton's actions, said he could conclude Clinton committed
perjury and still vote to acquit him in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite possible that a given member of Congress could
conclude that a president committed a crime, but it was not
sufficiently grave to overrule the result of an election,''
Lieberman said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of argument sends many Republicans into a rage. They
note the Constitution states a president can be impeached for
``treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
Although the Constitution does not mention perjury, obstruction of
justice or abuse of power, Republicans said they fit into the
``other'' category.
</P>
<P>
   But even House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, in
arguing for impeachment, acknowledged there is no simple way to
define it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is like beauty,'' Hyde of Illinois said. ``It is
in the eye of the beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution is always subject to interpretation, as
emphasized by the murky standard for such a momentous decision as
impeachment. But the clues to understanding what will happen in the
House this week, and possibly in the Senate next year, were written
long ago in the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alexander Hamilton foresaw the kind of partisan split
engulfing the Congress today on impeachment. The impeachment of a
president, Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers on March 7,
1778, ``will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole
community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or
inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with
the pre-existing factions ... in such cases, there will always be
the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated by the
comparative strength of the parties, than by real demonstrations of
innocence or guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, who served in 1988 and 1989 as the Senate counsel in
the last two impeachment trials of federal judges, said those
outcomes demonstrate how the constitutional language is so
``amorphous.'' Former US District Judge Walter Nixon had already
been convicted on charges of lying to a grand jury when his case
came before the Senate, and he was impeached and convicted. But
former US District Judge Alcee Hastings, who had been acquitted in
a criminal trial on bribery and conspiracy charges, also was
convicted by the Senate. Hastings is now a Florida congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really highlights that it is conduct, not whether they were
convicted of a crime,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Baron, who worked as a Democratic counsel on
Capitol Hill, does not think impeachment is warranted in Clinton's
case. He said that just as the impeachment of President Andrew
Johnson in 1868 is now seen as a regrettable and excessive
political sanction, so would the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution could have avoided many
political aspects of impeachment by having the cases heard by the
Supreme Court. But the framers decided instead to make it a
political act that, in most cases, couldn't be controlled by one
party. Thus, the framers made it relatively easy for a political
party to impeach a president with a majority vote in the House, but
difficult to convict him, with a two-thirds vote needed in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who would preside over the possible Clinton trial in the
Senate, has written that the impeachment system has worked well
because politicians have been able to make the right decision in
the end. In the single instance when the Senate conducted an
impeachment trial of a president, Rehnquist wrote in his 1992 book,
``Grand Inquests,'' the Senate rightly decided by a single vote to
acquit President Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said the impeachments of Johnson and federal Judge
Samuel Chase had been overly political. ``The importance of these
two acquittals in our constitutional history can hardly be
overstated,'' he wrote. Rehnquist applauded the way the framers of
the Constitution ``left considerable room for `play in the
joints''' for determining to impeach and convict a president.
</P>
<P>
   To Clinton's relief, there is much more ``play in the joints''
in the Senate, which is controlled 55-45 by Republicans, than in
the House. If all senators are present, it would take 67 votes to
convict him, meaning a defection of at least 12 Democrats. In other
words, while the Republican control of the House might lead to
Clinton's impeachment, the framers' insistence upon a two-thirds
vote in the Senate probably will save him.
</P>
<P>
   When the House votes this week on impeachment, the members are
bound to argue that their vote is based on how they interpret the
Constitution. If Hamilton were alive today, he might commiserate
with Clinton. Fourteen years after Hamilton wrote about impeachment
in the Federalist Papers, the treasury secretary was confronted
with allegations he had conducted corrupt stock transactions with a
man named James Reynolds. No, Hamilton responded, he was paying off
Reynolds because he had an affair with Reynolds's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton complained that the ``malicious intrigues to stab me in
the dark ... distract me to a point, which (makes) my situation
scarcely tolerable.''

BRUINS' DEFENSE FINALLY REINFORCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been plenty of ink used to chronicle the resurgence of
Bruins right wing Dmitri Khristich, the heady finesse of center
Jason Allison and the flashy moves of left wing Sergei Samsonov.
Goalie Byron Dafoe is on his way to a potential career year and a
new contract, and his role in the club's recent run has been duly
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that hasn't been recognized as much as it should is
the substantial contribution of the defensive corps. Quick, when
was the last time the Bruins had six or even seven reliable
defensemen? Can't remember? Try 1989-90, the last year the club
went to the Stanley Cup finals. Ray Bourque, Don Sweeney, Garry
Galley, Glen Wesley, Al Pederson, and Bob Beers manned the blue
line.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque and Sweeney remain from that group, and they're now
complemented by Kyle McLaren, Hal Gill, Darren Van Impe, Grant
Ledyard, and Dave Ellett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only remember back 48 months, any more it's a problem,''
said Bourque with a laugh, when the question was posed to him. ``We
kind of had a revolving door there for a while. We had a good,
solid three or four guys, but the fifth and sixth guy were
constantly being changed and not used very much. It's good when you
are able to use people and have confidence in all six guys. Last
year, we lost Donny and we lost Kyle for a while. Van Impe really
came on in the last part of last year and got off to a good start
this year. I think he knows what it's all about now. (The coaches)
feel like they can use everybody. It helps me, and it helps
everybody. I know I'll be out there against the top lines and on
the power play and penalty killing. But if I can't go, someone else
is going to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he vividly remembers the 1989-90 season because it
was the first time in his career he played the majority of his year
in the NHL. He had split his first pro year the season before in
Maine and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not slighting anybody, but the depth we had with Garry
and Al Pederson then,'' said Sweeney. ``I was in the same situation
Hal and (the younger guys) were in. It's been a few years (since)
we had that kind of overall depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Having more options has resulted in less pressure on Bourque, a
luxury he hasn't had for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good and bad scenario for him,'' said Sweeney, who was
mentored by Bourque early in his career. ``He's a teacher in that
he's helping and can bail guys out every once in a while in
situations. But it's hard on him because he's playing against the
top guys each and every night and at the same time, you've got a
younger guy you're trying to help teach. I say that because I was
in the situation with him. Maybe you're spending more time in your
own end whereas if you were playing with a guy of equal caliber you
wouldn't be. Not that many are equal to him. But it does make it
more difficult, though you wouldn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has never been one to revel in his accomplishments. To
him, that's something he will do long after his playing days are
over (unless of course, as some predict, he will just play
forever). However, as much as he prefers to put off discussing his
achievements, one milestone does stand out _ his approach of
 &UR; Gordie Howe's  &LR; 1,049 assists. Bourque went into last night needing
two assists to tie Howe for third all-time. Next up is  &UR; Paul
Coffey's  &LR; 1,090.  &UR; Wayne Gretzky  &LR; is first with 1,932 and counting.
Bourque said just the stature of Howe makes the mark special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Gordie Howe,'' said Bourque, ``just that name. Knowing
you're going to go by him, it's something. He's Mr. Hockey. It just
tells you that things have gone pretty well for yourself. But no
matter ... you enjoy it, you know things have gone well but you
wake up the next morning and you've got to keep doing it. You've
got to keep going out and playing well and playing hard. Whatever
I've achieved, I've enjoyed. I've had fun doing it. I've enjoyed my
success but knowing that, you've always got to prove it again the
next day. That's how I've taken things all along. Like I said, once
it's all over and you sit down and see where you stand among other
guys, I think that's where you're going to say it's been good. But
I've still got time to play and I still have to go out and do the
job. I can't stop, I've got to keep going. I've got to keep putting
up numbers and you've got to keep playing hard, winning games, and
that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiary (only?) of goalie  &UR; Felix Potvin  &LR; walking
away from the Maple Leafs while he awaits a trade has been  &UR; Glenn
Healy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who finished his three-month exile in the International
Hockey League with Chicago last week and is now back with Toronto.
``You can sit on pins and needles all the time or go out and live
your life fully, and that's the way I approached it,'' said Healy.
``It was refreshing. You learn a lot about yourself and you learn
that a lot of guys are in this game for pure fun, not the money.''
Healy feels for Potvin. ``I care a lot for that guy,'' he said.
``He's a tremendous human being and he was a great partner. I'm
sure at the end of the day it will all work out for everyone.'' ...
Say what you will about the big guns on the Coyotes roster but two
impressive contributors to Phoenix's success are bruising forwards
 &UR; Shane Doan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 22, and  &UR; Brad Isbister &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 21. The two competed
against each other in junior hockey with Isbister playing for
Portland and Doan for Kamloops. ``I fought him once in junior,''
Isbister said. Being the good teammate, Isbister wouldn't say who
won ... The Sharks had been interested in acquiring Calgary star
 &UR; Theo Fleury &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but that has dwindled. They don't want to give up
defense prospect  &UR; Brad Stuart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and it's not as if the Sharks are
one player away from the Stanley Cup. ``It doesn't make sense,''
said San Jose coach  &UR; Darryl Sutter &LR; . ``(Stuart) was our best player
at training camp. You can't trade a Brad Stuart. When you've got to
give up a player like that, that's wrong. It would be different if
they wanted someone else. If they wanted someone else, go for it. I
will drive him up there myself. Until somebody takes the Stanley
Cup away from Detroit, there is nobody else. They have the best
team in the league by 10 miles. I mean, is there any other team in
the league that can play four lines and have their starting
goaltender ( &UR; Chris Osgood &LR; ) out for a period of time (six games
because of a hip injury) and it doesn't bother them at all?'' ...
Young forward  &UR; Harry York  &LR; changed teams again last week when he
was picked up off waivers by Vancouver. York began his career with
the Blues, was traded to the Rangers last season, went to
Pittsburgh a few weeks ago, and ended up with the Canucks last
Tuesday. York, who grew up outside Edmonton, said he dreamed of
playing on the Oilers' dynasty teams of the 1980s. So far, he has
played with goalie  &UR; Grant Fuhr  &LR; in St. Louis,  &UR; Wayne Gretzky  &LR; in
New York, and now he's on the same team as  &UR; Mark Messier &LR; . ``As I
make my rounds around the league, I'm getting to play with all the
old Oilers,'' said the 24-year-old. ``But in my original dream we
were all together in Edmonton.'' York was 14 when those three
players led the Oilers to the Cup in 1988 ... The nightmarish
situation continues in Tampa. As rumors persist that Potvin will be
traded there, the franchise continues to struggle. The most recent
controversy revolved around former Bruin goalie  &UR; Bill Ranford  &LR; and
the seriousness of his groin injury. Last week, he met with general
manager/coach  &UR; Jacques Demers  &LR; to clear the air about the situation
in which there were behind-the-scenes grumblings that Ranford
wasn't hurt that badly. Even when he was playing, his numbers were
brutal (1-7-1 record and .866 save percentage), though he wasn't
helped by the shoddy defense. Former Rangers goalie  &UR; John
Davidson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now a Rangers broadcaster, thinks Ranford will have to
change his style. ``What I see him doing is playing goal
feet-first,'' said Davidson. ``Goalies now, the majority of them
anyway, use all of their body to make the saves. Billy can change,
lots of goalies have done it. The guy's always done well under
pressure. Mentally I think he's still there. I just don't think you
can play goal now acrobatically.'' ... All right, we give. On the
notes given out before Thursday night's Bruins-Hurricanes game, it
lists Carolina's No. 13 as left wing  &UR; Bates Battaglia &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a name we
actually love. At the end of the game, however, the final
scoresheet listed the same left wing as ``Jon'' Battaglia. So? As
Carolina media relations manager  &UR; Jerry Peters  &LR; explained, Jon is
his given name, Bates is the name he prefers.

SOLID FOOTWORK ASIDE, TUPA'S A HANDY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH _ Watch closely, very closely, when Adam Vinatieri
attempts a field goal or extra point this afternoon in St. Louis.
But don't only peer at Vinatieri's foot; also notice the fingers of
the holder, Tom Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up with the idea a couple of years ago,'' Vinatieri
said of what the sharp-eyed should see. ``Tom figured it could only
help me with my kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, holders of field goal and extra point attempts
hold the football for the kicker with one finger, their index
finger at the top of the ball. Tupa, though, uses two fingers, his
index finger and his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just at practice one day and I decided to give it a
try,'' said Tupa. ``I feel like I have a better feel for the ball
that way and I can turn the ball faster.''
</P>
<P>
   So important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have to kick the laces,'' said Vinatieri. ``Every
time, all the time, Tom has them turned.''
</P>
<P>
   So typical of Tupa, the ultimate thinking person's football
player. Spinning the ball is a job requirement of every holder,
spinning the laces forward is so key to a good kick, so kickers
don't kick the laces; but holders have taken hundreds of thousands
of snaps in football for eons after eons, all doing the job the way
it always has been done. Virtually all spin the ball with one hand
while holding the point with the index finger of the other.
</P>
<P>
   One holder, though, decided to try a new and creative way. Two
fingers, instead of one. Tom Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't put them on the point of the ball,'' said Tupa.
``I put them on the sides of the point. I feel I can spin the ball
faster using two fingers and I can have more control of the ball so
Adam won't see the laces, won't see them forward (to Vinatieri). It
works so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   No coincidence, either, that Tupa's kicker _ Vinatieri _ is one
of the more dependable kickers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is unique in what he does with two fingers,'' said Dante
Scarnecchia, the Patriots' special teams coach. ``As far as I know,
he's the only one who does it that way. Tom has such good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is prelude. Tupa is much more than a holder for extra
points and field goals and his true value to the Patriots is as a
punter, not to mention fill-in quarterback. And, in the middle of
the third quarter of last Sunday's game in Pittsburgh, as the game
_ and their lead _ seemingly was about to slip from the Patriots'
grasp, Tupa stood at the back line of the end zone, ready to punt.
</P>
<P>
   New England had a fourth-and-27. Three Rivers Stadium was loud
and raucous, the Steelers' fans willing their team to make the play
that might turn the game. Mike Bartrum snapped the ball back to
Tupa, a Steeler slipped through the Patriot line and seemed ready
to block the punt.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa stopped his leg, seemingly in mid-punt. Tupa seemed ready
to take a safety, rather than risk a blocked punt and a possible
recovery in the end zone for a Pittsburgh TD.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for football intelligence is so great that it was
presumed that Tupa through all the myriad possibilities in that
split-second that he saw the Steeler upon him and sensed the punt
was about to be blocked. It all seemed so apropos for Tupa's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Tupa with a small laugh, ``I thought I heard
a whistle. I sort of heard a whistle, and I thought it was off to
my right. So I just held the ball because I saw (the Steeler)
coming free at me. I didn't want to take a chance on a block there
and give them a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   True and not true. The play actually was dead, but the actual
reason why was unknown to Tupa. The Patriots had let the time clock
run out and there was no play. The whistle had come from the stands
behind Tupa. But his instincts had been so perfectly on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided, just in case there had been a whistle,'' said
Tupa, ``that I should hold onto the ball and not punt it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tupa was given a second chance. And that second chance was
fatal to the Steelers because this time, again pushed back to the
endline of the end zone, Tupa took the snap from Bartum and boomed
what the Patriots most needed at the moment _ a 63-yard punt. It
was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole mindset (before the second punt) was not to take a
block and just to get the ball out of there,'' said Tupa. This is
the mindset of all punters in such situations _ just get the ball
out, even if only to the 40- or 45-yard line. But Tupa did so much
more than just ``get it out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it sit pretty well on my foot and it just went,'' said
Tupa, modestly. ``I just happened to get it out of there. Dante and
I have been working a lot on field situations, the last five or six
weeks, what to do in a situation like that. And it just happened to
come in handy just then.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa is very consistent and it seems difficult to remember many
poor punts (``Oh, I can remember them,'' he says), but he feels
back in the groove as the December pressure games are played,
because ``I started out the season well and then I was kicking the
ball kind of average during the middle of the season. Now I'm
feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Tupa has delivered crucial punts in the most
crucial of situations. Tupa did it in the last-second victory over
Buffalo, just as he did in the last-second victory over Miami, just
as he has done through his entire career in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Good-natured ribbing
</P>
<P>
   Tupa's locker is near the lockers of quarterbacks Drew Bledsoe
and Scott Zolak. Tupa no sooner had gotten a word or two out of his
mouth to a media member when Zolak began the needling. ``How come
you are talking to him? How about that for sweet potatoes, somebody
talking to the punter?''
</P>
<P>
   Because he is one of the most valuable members of the team,
Zolak was told.
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' needled Tupa back to Zolak. ``Silence ... you think I'm
surprised by that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Bledsoe came by and his needle toward Tupa
was even longer than Zolak's as Tupa tried to speak. ``On that
ball, I took the snap from center and I punted it,'' joshed
Bledsoe, impersonating a Tupa interview. ```That's what I did on
that play. Then, on that other play, I took the snap and I stood it
up on its tip and Adam kicked it. Then ...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' said Tupa again. ``I don't get respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. Tupa kicks in a (sometimes) cold weather climate,
the wind and swirls of November and December hindering his punts.
Yet, year after year, Tupa is one of the top punters in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care for statistics except for one,'' said
Tupa. ``And that's my (net) average compared to what the punter on
the other team has done, punting the same day and under the same
conditions as I do. And the last few years, I've done pretty well
on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl XXX, Tupa may have been the one Patriot who played
up to his potential. Time and again, Tupa not only boomed long
punts, but they all were angled toward the sideline _ both long and
perfectly placed _ so that Green Bay return threat Desmond Howard
had little room to maneuver. Tupa certainly contained Howard, even
if New England's kickoff team did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the game I'm most proud of,'' said Tupa. ``In the
biggest situation, under the most pressure, with everybody
watching, that's when you want to do your best. That Super Bowl, I
feel, was my best game.''
</P>
<P>
   He's earned their respect
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on three teams and Tom's the best punter I've ever
played with,'' said Bartrum. ``Not only that, but he's the best
punter I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vinatieri, singing the praises of his holder, said he's not
surprised by anything Tupa does in an athletic contest. The Super
Bowl? And those perfectly angled punts? ``You give Tom six days or
a week to work something specific,'' said Vinatieri, ``and Tom
always comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri and Tupa, of course, spend endless hours during camp
together, as do kickers and punters on all NFL teams. And they talk
and talk (``He does talk about Ohio a lot''), but from time to
time, ``I'll say to him, `Tom, I want you to stay here as much as
anybody. I want you to be my holder forever.' That's because I
never have to worry about a hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bartrum said he never has to worry about a snap. (``Tom
has such good hands that no matter where I put the ball, he just
snags it.'') Indeed, the needed confidence between snapper and
punter, snapper, holder and placekicker, Bartum, Tupa, and
Vinatieri is almost tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike almost never gives me a bad snap,'' said Tupa. ``And
Adam, if you get the ball down, he puts it through the uprights.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Vinatieri, and not Tupa, who will spill the word that Tupa
is a scratch golfer, a very good basketball player (``He's the best
basketball player on the team'') and a man who could be successful
in virtually any sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just enjoying my job,'' said the punter. ``I think I have
the best job in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe one of the better wits on the team. Tupa, who has also
played for the Colts, Cardinals, and Browns, delivered the line of
the year on the day news broke the Patriots would be moving to
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``All four teams I've been on have moved their franchise at one
time or another,'' said Tupa. ``All I can say is that if there is
any owner out there who might be thinking of moving his team, just
sign me. I'll be his guarantee he'll move.''

GOOD CALL: NO INSTANT REVERSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Thankfully, instant replay is going to come back slowly in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   After an instant of panic, it appears NFL owners have decided,
upon further review, that efforts to rush a system into this year's
playoffs have proven inconclusive, so the way they play will stand
until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There may yet be a straw vote of the owners by phone, but the
early returns hint strongly that commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
suggestion that some form of replay be instituted in the playoffs
because of the recent spate of obvious errors has met with
surprising resistance, although for the best of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks last winter several highly respected NFL coaches and
front office leaders _ like Packers coach Mike Holmgren and
Redskins GM Charley Casserly _ worked diligently to come up with a
system that would win approval at the winter meetings. For the
seventh time, their efforts failed, and so the decision was made to
play this season with replay available to everyone involved in an
NFL game but the people who need it _ the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The wise heads in the NFL now are saying so be it, and they are
right.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL needs instant replay. It always has. It just doesn't
need it to show up like a blindside blitz, because the only thing
worse than continuing to vote down the reinstitution of replay next
winter would be ramming some form of it through now, because
decisions made in haste and panic invariably cause more problems
than they solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should change the rules in the middle of the
stream,'' said one NFC executive who has always supported replay.
``We've (made) proposals in the past. Charley Casserly will again
this winter. Personally, I think it's a slamdunk this time. Even
some of the naysayers of the past like Buffalo and Rich McKay in
Tampa are saying they're considering voting for it next time, and
you already know Cleveland will.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure we'd even vote for a playoff system this
year. We adopted a set of rules. Stick with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that is what will happen. The call for replay began,
in truth, not from a blown call but from a hearing problem when
referee Phil Luckett couldn't make heads or tails out of Jerome
Bettis trying to say heads or tails. That error on a simple
overtime coin flip on Thanksgiving Day is what has really fueled
support for replay, even though it would have done nothing to
reverse that situation.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment of it, however, when coupled with recent blown
calls in the Patriots-Bills game and last week in the Seahawks-Jets
game have the suits in New York petrified that one of these days,
one of their half-competent officiating crews will cost somebody
the Super Bowl, when even Heidi in Hanover watching at home could
see that they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen, but generally the best crews work the
playoffs and that reduces the odds. Still, not even that is reason
enough to add a replay system no one is yet fully satisfied with on
a moment's notice, and a lot of wise NFL owners like the Chiefs'
Lamar Hunt know it and have counseled their brethren about the
folly of such a rapid-fire decision.
</P>
<P>
   When respected owners like Hunt and recently burned coaches like
Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher, as well as a pro-replay advocate like
Holmgren, all counsel against a postseason form of replay coming
in, the idea is doomed. Fortunately.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, why should a playoff game be any different from the
rest of the games? If the league thinks they're more important they
should talk to Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson, who may well be
fired because of Vinny Testaverde's phantom touchdown run last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Panic is never the best way to find a solution to a recurring
problem. Common sense is. This time it appears that both may
prevail in the NFL when they should _ at next March's owners'
meetings in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is being taken as a given that Minnesota wide receiver  &UR; Randy
Moss  &LR; is a shoo-in for rookie of the year and that thinking is
probably right. But is it accurate?
</P>
<P>
   Moss has been nothing short of unstoppable in Minnesota, where
he's scored 14 touchdowns and so terrorized defenses that his
mentor and close friend,  &UR; Cris Carter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said earlier this season,
``Do you understand that this kid could be  &UR; Michael Jordan &LR; ? That
we're on the ground floor of something huge?''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Moss leads the league in touchdown catches (14)
and receiving yards (1,120), it's an easy case to make for him,
especially when you consider 19 teams passed on drafting him
(including the Bengals twice, which figures). Then point out that
Moss has already broken the rookie record for touchdown catches
(13) set by old Green Bay Packer receiver  &UR; Billy Howton  &LR; in 1952
and tied by  &UR; John Jefferson  &LR; in 1979, and there seems little room
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you happen to live in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   If you do, you can build a powerful case for Forgotten  &UR; Fred
Taylor &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is the first Jaguar runner to ever rush for 1,000
yards and he still has three games left.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor gained 183 yards last weekend against the Lions to lift
his total to 1,005, only 115 fewer than Moss has produced. If you
add Taylor's additional 343 receiving yards, he's ahead of Moss in
yardage production and, surprise, Taylor has also scored 14
touchdowns, many of them the hard way. By running over people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a better argument to make for Taylor. He has
produced his numbers on a team that has nowhere near the ancillary
talents Moss finds around him, and he's done it despite missing all
or most of four games with a shoulder injury after barely playing
in the season's first two games while head coach  &UR; Tom Coughlin &LR;  was
trying to bring him along slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach  &UR; Jeff Fisher  &LR; was studying ways to try and stop
Taylor this week and couldn't find many.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a 6-foot, 225-pound guy who runs like
he's 180,'' Fisher said. ``He's got quickness and strength to the
hole and what really is impressive is what he does after initial
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that explosiveness or those numbers may be enough to
derail the train Moss is riding toward NFL Rookie of the Year
honors, but failing that, the train should at least stop in
Jacksonville and pick Taylor up for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jets wide receiver  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; during a conference call
this week with the national media, explained perfectly the problem
coaches have with instant replay. It giveth but it also taketh
away. When asked if he would vote for or against it, Johnson said,
``Well, you know, different situations come up every other game and
some games you say, no, I wouldn't vote (for it). Some games you
say, yes, I would vote. What happened to us in Detroit last year, I
would vote for instant replay. What happened to us this year, no, I
wouldn't vote for instant replay.'' In other words, when it gets
you a win great and when it doesn't, forget about it ... Sometimes
being lucky is far better than being smart. Two years ago, the
49ers offered restricted free agent running back  &UR; Rodney Hampton  &LR; a
six-year, $16.45 million offer sheet. When the Giants matched it,
San Francisco was forced to go find someone else and settled on
oft-injured  &UR; Garrison Hearst &LR; .  &UR; today &LR; , Hampton is out of football
and Hearst has become the first 49er running back since 1988-89 to
rush for more than 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons. Asked about
his good fortune, Hearst said, ``I knew the (cloudy) running back
situation (in San Francisco) and I was hoping I could be the runner
that changed things.'' That he has been, somehow avoiding the
debilitating injuries that ruined him in Arizona ... You think the
Patriots have injury problems? How about the Packers? Green Bay
listed a club-record 17 players on their injured list on Wednesday
and they already had eight players on injured reserve. In Monday
night's loss to the Buccaneers, eight players left the game with
various injuries. The most costly may be to wide receiver  &UR; Robert
Brooks &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has yet to play a full game this season. Once the
featured deep threat, Brooks is now a shadow of himself after knee
and finger injuries, back surgery, and a hamstring pull, and
defenses know it. They now rotate coverages to double  &UR; Antonio
Freeman  &LR; in the belief Brooks can no longer hurt them deep, and now
he may not even have the chance, because he may be out for the
season with the hamstring problems. And now Freeman is expected to
play Sunday with a broken jaw. Although his jaw is still wired,
Freeman had some of the wires cut shorter last week and was fitted
with a special mouthpiece ... Only a team run the way the Bengals
are would try something like this. On Monday, Cincinnati cut
14-year veteran punter  &UR; Lee Johnson  &LR; for publicly criticizing
management. On Tuesday they tried to fine him $20,588, which is a
week's pay. Good luck trying to collect. The NFLPA immediately said
they would fight the fine because you can't discipline someone
after you fire them. The union won a similar case a year ago
against Carolina when the Panthers tried to collect a summer's
worth of fines from  &UR; Kevin Greene  &LR; after releasing him for holding
out with a valid contract. An arbitrator ruled in Greene's favor.
Bengals president  &UR; Mike Brown  &LR; insists he'll go after the money.
Like most everyone else associated with the Bengals of late, he'll
come up empty ... The Broncos may be sailing along toward an
undefeated season, but running back  &UR; Terrell Davis's  &LR; quest to
break  &UR; Eric Dickerson's  &LR; single-season rushing record has slowed.
Davis still leads the NFL with 1,654 yards rushing, but he's been
held under 100 the past two games and has significantly fallen off
the pace to match Dickerson's 2,105. Davis now must average 151
yards a game the next three weeks to break the record. But whether
he makes it to 2,000 or not, someone already has in the NFL.
Referee  &UR; Dick Hantak &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the flag-throwingest man since  &UR; Abbie
Hoffman &LR; , leads a crew that has called 259 penalties in 13 games
for 2,090 yards ... Here's one good reason Denver is so tough to
beat. It not only has the most balanced attack in the league, but
is averaging 6.5 yards a play on first down, which results in third
and short an alarming amount of the time if you're an opposing
defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; seems to be almost a weekly topic in the NFL.
This week, in addition to his phony flap with Sports Illustrated
about having been promised he wouldn't be on the cover of the
magazine, Johnson explained why he likes playing for his often
bombastic coach. ``I think I have a coach who wants me to succeed
on all levels and he's putting me in a position to succeed,''
Johnson said of what many are viewing as his breakthrough season.
``No. 1 picks go to poor organizations and they don't know what to
do with you. They don't know how to use you. They just know how to
pick you. For me, I thank God that I got Bill Parcells in my second
year because my first year was devastating.'' ... Parcells, by the
way, has told friends he's hoping Testaverde &UR;  &LR; can turn into the
 &UR; Jim Plunkett  &LR; of the 1990s. Plunkett was the Heisman Trophy winner
and former No. 1 draft choice in New England who appeared to be
washed up when he arrived in Oakland in 1978, but two years later
led the Raiders to the first of his two Super Bowl triumphs. When
Testaverde arrived with the Jets, he, too, looked like a
broken-down former Heisman winner at the end of his career. Now
he's been reborn, although he acknowledges he had reservations when
Parcells first talked to him about signing on. ``After what I saw
last year with ( &UR; Neil &LR; )  &UR; O'Donnell  &LR; and ( &UR; Glenn &LR; )  &UR; Foley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; you
know, I was a little skeptical about coming here,'' Testaverde said
recently. ``I didn't want it to be kind of a circus with the
quarterbacks in and out every week. I expressed that feeling to
him. He's the head coach. He's going to run the team like he wants
to do it. As players, you just go each week and do what he tells
you. So far, things have been great, we've gotten along great. I
don't expect it to be any different. He's very demanding of his
players but yet he takes care of them when he needs to. He's a
little bit different, but I felt like if I wanted a chance to win a
championship, it was going to be with a coach like Bill Parcells.''
The Jets hold an option on Testaverde for next season but are close
to a long-term deal that could see him through to the end of his
career, at least as a starter ... Much-maligned and seldom-seen
49ers free agent acquisition  &UR; Gabe Wilkins  &LR; got a chance to pay
back some of the $20 million contract he signed in the offseason
last Sunday when he came off the bench to be part of a three-man
rotation coach  &UR; Steve Mariucci  &LR; must use down the stretch to try
and replace All-Pro defensive tackle  &UR; Bryant Young &LR; . Young was lost
for the season with a badly broken leg sustained when he was hit by
teammate  &UR; Ken Norton's  &LR; helmet two weeks ago. Wilkins was brought
in at a defensive end from the Packers but will now rotate inside
after spending all but the last month on the inactive list ... The
Carolina Panthers rushed for 203 yards against the Niners last
Sunday, and they're ranked 29th in the NFL in rushing. Now they
have  &UR; Barry Sanders  &LR; to contend with Monday night. That should be
interesting ... The Saints' decision to release former second-round
pick  &UR; Ray Zellars  &LR; last week wasn't because the powerful fullback
can't run. It was because he wouldn't block. Just a year ago,  &UR; Mike
Ditka  &LR; was so high on Zellars he made him a starter, and he led the
team in rushing with 552 yards. But apparently he began to think he
was now a runner not a blocker. The result has been that in three
of his four starts, quarterback  &UR; Kerry Collins  &LR; has led the team in
rushing, and Zellars was finally replaced by fifth-round pick
 &UR; Wilmont Perry &LR; . &UR;  &LR; Zellars was not active for the last two games and
reportedly learned he wouldn't play against the Dolphins when he
got to the stadium and found there was no uniform in his locker ...
Meanwhile, Saints pass rusher  &UR; Joe Johnson &LR;  should be tougher than
ever to keep away from quarterbacks the next three weeks. Johnson
stands to earn a $1 million bonus if he can produce three more
sacks ... Although he'll be trying hard to beat him Sunday, Raiders
coach  &UR; Jon Gruden &LR;  is a big fan of Bills quarterback  &UR; Doug Flutie &LR; .
When Gruden was an undersized quarterback at the University of
Dayton, Flutie was an undersized quarterback winning the Heisman
Trophy at Boston College. ``He was my idol when I was a player,''
Gruden said. ``He gave all us 5-foot-9-inch quarterbacks hope.''
Sunday, however, Gruden's Raiders could lose all hope of reaching
the playoffs if Flutie continues his magic.

SKEPTICS ABOUND AS VOTE NEARS ON NFL STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ ESPN's satellite dishes line one of the main
roads like a dealership for pre-owned flying saucers, but here in
the armchair-quarterback capital of America, residents are as wary
as the rest of their Connecticut neighbors about the state's plan
to build a stadium for the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   At Gold's Gym, next door to the sports network's headquarters,
four football fans who work in construction had so many objections
to the plan that they kept interrupting each other to point out
their favorite flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in 10 years when the Patriots stink and the seats
don't sell?'' asked Barry Ziegler, 24, as he pulled the pin on the
lateral-pull machine and notched it up to 230 pounds. ``I'll be
able to get any seat I want _ and I'll have to pay for it twice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ziegler and for many others, the potential taxpayer
liability is the most irksome part of the proposal, which is
scheduled for a vote at a special session of the General Assembly
on Tuesday. Several polls have indicated that, by wide margins,
Connecticut residents approve of bringing the Patriots to Hartford
but believe the state made too sweet an offer to the team's owner,
Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland conceded last week that his tentative
agreement might have been too generous, and he met with Kraft at
the Capitol until 8:30 Friday night, trying to revise the deal.
Legislative leaders are adamant that they will hold a vote on
Tuesday. They are said to fear that a delay could erode support for
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler said he makes about $35,000 a year as the owner of a
remodeling business. He spent Friday hauling 72-pound bundles of
shingles up a ladder as part of a three-day job. ``Let Kraft do a
roof,'' Ziegler said. ``When I get off the roof, my back kills, and
part of it is going to that millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   That Robert Kraft is a household name in small-town Connecticut
is a tribute to Patriots fever. Some Hartford television and radio
stations accompany their updates with stirring theme music and
``Patriot Games'' logos. People are surprisingly familiar with the
minutiae of the proposal, which would put the state on the hook for
as much as $17.5 million a year if luxury suites and seats went
unsold. It is these guarantees, much more than the $375 million
construction cost and 30-year, rent-free lease, that seem to be
stirring resentment.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Roger Michele, D-Bristol, a barber, says his
customers and constituents are 100-1 against the stadium proposal's
current terms. ``People instinctively sense that there are going to
be a lot of hidden costs,'' he said. ``If Rowland got this deal
after long, hard negotiations, they wonder what the first offer
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol, a city of 62,000, is about 18 miles southwest of
Hartford and eight miles from Interstate 84. It remains largely
blue-collar despite the 40-acre, 1,700-employee ESPN campus.
Bristol is also home to the eastern region headquarters of Little
League Baseball Inc., and residents say the city is sports-crazy,
partly because of its huge youth sports leagues. City Council
members and officials of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce plan to
make a pitch for a training center that the Patriots have agreed to
build in Connecticut _ at a cost to the state of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, unabashed boosters of the Patriots deal are as
rare as shuffleboard highlights on ``SportsCenter.'' At Gold's Gym,
one of Ziegler's workout partners, Kevin Herrick, 21, scoffed at
state officials' claim that they need to budget no money to widen
Hartford highways, even though the contract guarantees that the
state will be sure the parking lot can clear in one hour. ``I drive
in there all the time, and it's always crowded, even though right
now there's nothing in Hartford,'' Herrick said.
</P>
<P>
   At Rock's Sports Cards, workers reported a run on requests for
Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots' quarterback. But Mike Bakaysa, 53, a
siding contractor, said Kraft should be making more of an
investment. ``Rowland panicked and offered him the moon,'' Bakaysa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles down Middle Street from ESPN, pool players at the
Chalker's Choice sports bar saw the deal's bright side. Adam Dube,
21, a carpenter, said he agrees with Rowland that the stadium could
be a catalyst for a Hartford comeback. ``People think of Hartford
as a slum place,'' he said. ``I haven't been there in 10 years.''
And Christa Singleton, a 26-year-old bartender, has paid the team's
$25 deposit for a spot on the season-ticket waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   At the holiday party of the Carousel Museum of New England, on
Bristol's Riverside Avenue, supporters were serenaded by a string
quartet as they admired the collection of 75 painted ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Giovanniello, 75, a retired accountant, said visions of
the major leagues seem to have blinded backers of the stadium.
``Ten years from now, we may be trying to figure out how to bail
ourselves out.''

IN RURAL PUERTO RICO, SIGNS OF CORPORATE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODR I GUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOIZA, Puerto Rico _ Nestled among sand dunes with towering palm
trees, plywood shacks line the main road to Loiza, a coastal town
where the descendants of African slaves still carve masks from
coconut shells.
</P>
<P>
   As Mazdas and Toyotas whisked by, Antonio Perez Montalvo, 22,
waited under a canopy sign that read, ``Coco frio,'' cold coconut.
Finally, a customer arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's calloused hands clenched a machete as he eyed the
coconut on the counter before him. Whack! Perez struck, chopping
off the tip, before poking a straw into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Un peso,'' one dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in one of the poorest pueblos in Puerto Rico, this is
commerce. Deeper in town, open-air restaurants and bodegas abound,
but not much more. It's a different world from San Juan, 30 miles
west, where yuppies live in high-rise condominiums, eat bagels for
breakfast, carry cell phones, and go to nightclubs that spin Janet
Jackson and Green Day.
</P>
<P>
   But already there are signs of changes to come in Loiza. A
Burger King stands on a corner, offering ``los mejores,'' the best,
hamburgers. At least the sign is in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 years since the United States took possession of this
Caribbean island, it has been evolving, becoming more Americanized
every day. Most Puerto Ricans welcome the corporate-driven way of
life: fast food, drive-through service, designer clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, they say, the island already resembles the rest of
the United States, and, like it or not, they predict, the island
will one day become the 51st state. The only question is when.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 80 percent of registerd voters among Puerto
Rico's 3.9 million residents are expected to head to the polls,
essentially shutting down the island, in a daylong plebiscite that
will be celebrated with fiestas, flag waving, homemade food, and
dancing in parks.
</P>
<P>
   The plebiscite offers voters five choices, including statehood,
which is expected to win. Statehood supporters hope the results of
the nonbinding referendum will persuade Congress to begin the
process of adding another star to the US flag. That would only
ratify what has become a reality in the island's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course we should become a state,'' said Lucy Hernandez
Rios, 30, an interpreter, as she walked through the cobblestone
streets of Old San Juan. ``We're practically American.''
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan is one of the oldest cities in the Western
Hemisphere, established in 1521, long before Pilgrims even thought
about sailing to America. It sits near a harbor of luminescent blue
waters. Above the harbor rise Spanish colonial buildings with
protruding balconies in the colors of sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan clings to its culture, an area where jewelry and
clothing stores are owned by locals. Restaurants display menus of
carne asada and sopa de pollo, stewed beef and chicken soup. But
around every corner there are surprises: Pizza Hut, McDonald's,
Payless Shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like everything that is American,'' said Gregorio Gonzalez
Rios, 72, standing in a brick-paved plaza under the sweeping
branches of a ficus tree. ``I like the blues, Frank Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   Four men sitting at a table playing dominoes echoed that
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   While adults debate the future of Puerto Rico _ those in
Americanized cities like San Juan generally siding with statehood
and those in small towns favoring the status quo or independence _
the younger generation wants a permanent relationship with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the Planet Hollywood in Old San Juan, rock music blares, and
a video of ``The Wedding Singer'' plays overhead, as Kenitza
Salgado Vega folds T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Salgado, 24, of Bayamon, a city southwest of San Juan, is like
most young people here: She watches MTV, VH1, and loves American
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Everclear, Natalie Imbruglia, Alanis Morrissette, Puff
Daddy,'' she said. ``Tourists are surprised when they hear me
speak. They're like, `You speak English so well and without an
accent.' But of course. This isn't a Third World country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Puerto Rico is nothing like its Caribbean neighbors, the
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba. Its standard of living is
exponentially greater, due mostly to its status as a US
commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 50 years since ``Operation Bootstrap'' lured American
textile factories here by offering corporate tax breaks, the Puerto
Rican economy has changed in waves. First it was factories like
Jansen and Maidenform offering low-wage jobs, but it was still a
step above the long days of toiling in sugar cane and coffee
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Oil refineries moved in but then shut down after the oil crisis
a few years later in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies that replaced them now produce 20
percent of the pharmaceuticals sold in America, according to Carlos
Vivoni, secretary of the Department of Economic Development and
Commerce in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Vivoni said, Governor Pedro Rossello wants to gear Puerto
Rico toward high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an economic policy that hinged on (US) tax breaks,''
Vivoni said. ``We needed to get away from that kind of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes sense, especially now that Congress has repealed a
law that gave corporate tax breaks to American companies on the
island, ending them in 2002. This week, as the heads of 34 Latin
American countries meet in Miami to discuss creating a market of
the Americas, like the European Union, Vivoni hopes Puerto Rico
will be able to serve as a bridge between Latin America and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the states, people regard Puerto Ricans as Latin Americans,
but in Latin America, they consider us Americans,'' Vivoni said.
``That doesnt give us an identity crisis; instead, a very unique
identity. We feel as comfortable in Chile as we do in New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Rosello's staff, Vivoni is a member of the New
Progressive Party, which advocates statehood. He sees the
Americanization of Puerto Rico as a trend toward a globalized
culture in Puerto Rico, where the best is mixed, just as it is in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Tokyo once, and people were upset because the
Japanese were eating more hamburgers than sushi.'' Vivoni said.
``Is that good or bad? I don't think it's bad. Open markets give
people choices.''

CLOCK RUNNING OUT ON SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hanukkah starts Monday. There's a new moon on Friday. In between
these two events, there's a chance we may finally learn if we're
going to see NBA basketball this season.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are not encouraging. There is no agreement on how to
divide the $2 billion in revenues. There is no agreement on
regulating the salaries of the high-end earners. There is no
agreement on how the much-discussed escrow system would work. There
is no agreement on conduct or the drug program.
</P>
<P>
   And those are the issues that need to be settled now simply to
play a shortened, made-for-NBC season. What if there is no season?
What happens to the draft, to players whose contracts expire, to
rookies drafted but never signed? What happens to the sport itself?
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern joked, ``you want to take all of our
lawyers' fun away.'' Then, he added, ``it is sad to say that we are
looking into that and a lot of other issues.'' We asked Stern's
consigliore, Jeff Mishkin, about the Great Unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of horrendous issues,'' Mishkin said,
``that we have not yet even contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple math tells us that this week is crucial. A miraculous
agreement by, say, Friday, would mean we might see basketball in
mid-January. But there's a history of mistrust and distrust here
when it comes to putting verbal agreements into writing. Stern
isn't about to open the floodgates until he sees what he wants in
print. That leaves 4 1/2 months to cram in however many games are
deemed necessary and, possibly, a playoff system that may not look
a lot like the one we're used to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   So let's use Jan. 24 as the mythical starting date. The Celtics'
schedule has them with 43 games left. Cramming in games here and
there and adding another week might stretch the season to 50 games.
Is that enough? It was in 1947-48; the season that year was 48
games as the league cut games (there had been 60 the year before)
to reduce travel. ``Unfortunately,'' the NBA Encyclopedia notes,
``with so few games, teams could barely generate sufficient income
to cover basic expenses.'' The league went back to 60 games the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   So there is precedent, however flimsy. But all of this
speculation/wishful thinking is contingent on an agreement getting
done in a week or so and that seems improbable given neither side
has shown much inclination to get it done. The players say they
have already made enough compromises. The owners say the
compromises mean little until the main issue of dividing revenue is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   The players this past week demonstrated all the public relations
aplomb of major tobacco or the baby seal bashers. Alonzo Mourning,
whose lust for the extra dollar forced Charlotte to trade him, was
calling the owners greedy. Ron Mercer never bothered to tell his
public relations firm that his teammates were inclined to skip ``an
intense workout'' at Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's this proposed ``All-Star Game'' this weekend in
Atlantic City. Why can't these guys stage a game or rally in a
place where there aren't blackjack tables or slot machines? We can
just hear Claude Rains coming out and saying how shocked he is to
learn that there is gambling going on. Do you think the Delta
Center was booked?
</P>
<P>
   The casinos are indifferent to the event. Don't expect a traffic
jam on the Atlantic City Expressway, either. Public relations has
not been the players' strong suit and they'd be better off pulling
the plug on this silly thing and figuring out a way to survive, as
Patrick Ewing likes to say, under the Draconian system being
offered by their employers that will pay the average player around
$5 million when the deal is up. We should all be so subjugated.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   One of the so-called ``third rail'' issues from the union's
standpoint is the ``timing rule.'' The owners want to prevent a
team from using its cap room to sign a free agent and then turning
around and re-signing its own players using the  &UR; Larry Bird
 &LR; exception. Under this scenario, a free agent such as  &UR; Scottie
Pippen &LR; , &UR; Charles Barkley  &LR; or  &UR; Damon Stoudamire  &LR; would have trouble
signing with a Phoenix or a Houston because the Suns or Rockets
couldn't then turn around and re-sign their own people. (Similarly,
if the Celtics used their cap room to sign  &UR; Matt Geiger &LR; , &UR;  &LR; they
couldn't then turn around and re-sign  &UR; Popeye Jones &LR; .) The union
thinks such a system would inhibit free agent movement. It would.
But there's a catch. The league would likely allow a team to do
both if the union accepted its proposal for a pay scale for Bird
free agents. The union has been loathe to do that, preferring
instead a tax that would kick in at a level few players could
expect to reach ... Old friend  &UR; Ed Pinckney  &LR; had his Villanova
uniform retired Saturday. Pinckney said most people remember him
for, as he called it, ``that game.'' That would be the 1985 NCAA
final, the Villanova upset of mighty Georgetown and future  &UR; Joe
Hill  &LR; clone Ewing. (Pinckney was the MVP of the tournament.) But
Easy Ed also says his professional ID is strictly Boston, even
though he also toiled for the Suns, Kings, Bucks, Raptors, and
Heat. He spent 5 1/2 seasons with the Celtics, arriving with  &UR; Joe
Kleine  &LR; in February 1989 and leaving in June 1994 in a draft day
deal for  &UR; Derek Strong  &LR; and  &UR; Blue Edwards &LR; . ``For my family and
myself, it was the best,'' he said of Boston. ``The atmosphere in
Boston, sportswise, is difficult to simulate anywhere else. People
mean it when they say they live and die with the Red Sox, Celtics,
Bruins, and Patriots. It's a religion. It really is.'' Pinckney
didn't want to talk about the lockout; technically, he's an
employee of the Heat because he scouts for them in addition to
broadcasting their games. He's also doing college games for ESPN;
``I don't have anything else to do,'' he said. He said he was
surprised by Villanova's decision to retire No. 54, mainly because
he has been out of college for 13 years and out of the NBA for a
year. ``My son ( &UR; Shea &LR; ) is playing for his eighth grade team and he
thinks I'm an old fogey,'' Pinckney said. ``It's nice to be
recognized.'' ... The rosters were announced this week for the
European League All-Star Game, Dec. 29 in Berlin.  &UR; Dino Radja  &LR; will
be there, representing Panathinaikos on the East team. Among the
other familiar and soon-to-be-more-familiar participants include
 &UR; Radoslav Nesterovic  &LR; and  &UR; Zeljko Rebraca &LR; , &UR;  &LR; both big men whose
rights are owned by  &UR; Kevin McHale's  &LR; Timberwolves, and former US
collegians  &UR; David Rivers &LR; , &UR; Wendell Alexis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Conrad McRae &LR; .
Another participant is  &UR; Dragan Tarlac &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Bulls' second-round
pick in 1995 who may be Chicago's starting center (he's 6 feet 10
inches).  &UR; Zan Tabak &LR; , &UR;  &LR; alas, did not make the squad ... Mercer may
have been unable to make it to Brandeis this past week, but his
coach,  &UR; Rick Pitino &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the Celtics' staff promises to be there
this afternoon for the Massachusetts High School Coaches
Association clinic. Also scheduled to attend are WNBA players
 &UR; Cindy Blodgett  &LR; and  &UR; Nykesha Sales &LR; . Maybe Sales could demonstrate
how to make a layup wearing a cast ... Speaking of Mercer, he has
dumped  &UR; David Falk  &LR; and signed on with  &UR; Master P &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the rapper and
former college hoopster who otherwise goes by the name of  &UR; Percy
Miller &LR; . ``My main thing is that I like to have a closeknit
relationship with the guy that I deal with,'' Mercer said. ``I want
to be able to talk to him three or four times a week. I couldn't do
that with (Falk).'' He said he met Master P while working out in
Los Angeles and liked what he heard. He said he and former Kentucky
teammate  &UR; Derek Anderson  &LR; signed with the man the same day.

DODGERS BREAK BANK TO LAND ACE BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ It took one year to the day he signed with the Red
Sox for Pedro Martinez to look like a bargain, and just 2 1/2 weeks
for Mo Vaughn to lose his distinction as baseball's highest-paid
player.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Los Angeles Dodgers broke the $100 million salary
level by signing pitcher Kevin Brown to a seven-year, $105 million
deal in which Brown, who has won 20 games in a season only once,
hasn't won a game in the World Series, or won a Cy Young Award,
will collect $15 million a year until he turns 41. He received a $5
million signing bonus, a $10 million salary next season, and $15
million a year for the last six years of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also agreed to provide Brown a private plane to fly
his family to Los Angeles from his home in Macon, Ga., 12 times a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't do it, and that doesn't justify it, but somebody
else was going to do it,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone, who said two clubs _ believed to be the Orioles and Rockies
_ were prepared to pay Brown even more. ``He's been to the World
Series in each of the last two years. The Dodgers haven't been to
the World Series since 1988. That's why we've made the seven-year
commitment we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Only nine pitchers in major league history have won 15 or more
games at age 40. That number drops to five at age 41, which means
Brown, who went to the World Series with the Florida Marlins in
1997 and the San Diego Padres in 1998, will be paid $1 million a
win if he can join that group.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who last year signed a then-record, six-year, $75
million deal, will not reach the $15 million plateau until 2003,
the last year of his deal with the Sox. He will turn 32 at the end
of that season, and has a chance to be paid $17.5 million if the
club picks up his option in 2004. By then, Martinez may be no more
than a middle-of-the-road wage earner in the exploding economics of
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cross the $100 million barrier, you have what makes
us tantamount to the NBA,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice
president of baseball operations for Major League Baseball,
``especially when you start extending that level of money to a
player who is going to be in his late 30s or early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred million (dollar) contracts are why the NBA is
locked out today. This is not a good baseball decision. This was
not a decision made by a baseball person.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, whose first GM job was with the threadbare Montreal
Expos, said he was sensitive to how Brown's contract, which
eclipses the average annual value of $13.333 million in Vaughn's
contract with the Angels as baseball's richest deal, will further
exacerbate the disparity between the haves and have-nots in the
game. But he said it's unfair to cast stones at the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society that has a lower class, a middle class,
and an upper class,'' Malone said. ``We try to help those who are
less fortunate, but to criticize us because we're the Dodgers, we
have the stadium we have, we draw 3-4 million fans a year ... I
feel very blessed that we have the revenues that we can make this
kind of commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox media
conglomerate, which is fulfilling predictions that it would quickly
become among the game's biggest spenders. Brown's signing raises
the Dodgers' payroll to around $80 million for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of event was not unforeseen,'' Alderson said of
Fox's record-setting deal.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to an outrageously expensive blueprint,
Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks will face Brown on
Opening Day in Dodger Stadium next April, a matchup of pitchers
whose combined 1999 earnings ($28 million) will be higher than the
total payrolls of eight teams last season: Tampa Bay, Detroit,
Minnesota, Cincinnati, Florida, Oakland, Pittsburgh, and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the enormous difference in payrolls between the elite
teams and their lesser brethren, Alderson said that realistically
only 12 to 15 teams have a chance to advance to the playoffs next
season. That means at least half of the teams will begin play
knowing they have no chance of competing.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Alderson was asked whether some clubs
should market themselves not as being in competition, but as
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some clubs are going to have to continue doing that,'' he
said. ``Many have a place that is no longer an arena, it's that
place you go for entertainment. It's the House of David.'' That
being a reference to the barnstorming team of bearded players that
used to play exhibitions around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez contract, of course, shows the Red Sox have not
been innocents in this salary escalation, or in pitchers getting
seven-year deals. Sox GM Dan Duquette, who was due to arrive here
Saturday, afternoon, has said he had interest in Brown, but was
unwilling to give him a six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers justified giving him seven years by noting he and
Greg Maddux of the Braves are the only pitchers to have thrown
1,400 innings in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, the new Dodgers manager, was asked if he
considered Brown the best pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly do,'' he said. ``He's my Opening Day pitcher. I
don't usually announce it this early. Yes, I'd have to say we're
favorites to win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone is known to be interested in trying to move outfielder
Gary Sheffield, who has a $10 million-a-year contract, and the Sox
are known to like Dodgers outfielder Raul Mondesi. But Malone said
Saturday he has had no discussions with Boston.

PITINO'S GOT PLENTY OF TIME ON HIS HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One phrase is rarely heard around the Pitino household these
days. The father doesn't stand up and announce to the family, ``I'm
sorry, but I just don't have time to spend with you all.'' If he
were to say that, the father would immediately be declared a
``case'' by the people who love him.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino has lots of time. He is Father Time. Time is an
infinite treadmill and Pitino is the lead runner on it, jogging in
place until NBA basketballs officially bounce again. The Celtics
coach just finished a 1,100-page book on Harry Truman. ``Very
well-written,'' he said. Now he is writing his own book on
leadership. No annoying editor has to tell him to find time to
write more pages because, hey, with the NBA's labor dispute
charging toward its sixth month, Pitino definitely knows where to
find time.
</P>
<P>
   The other day he watched his son, Richard, play basketball.
Pitino misses the game that he coaches so frenetically, but not
enough to grab a St. Sebastian's High clipboard and chart some
plays. ``No, no,'' he said, ``I just sit there and smile.'' He and
his family spent Thanksgiving in Florida. He has been to Las Vegas.
He has watched horses run. He has received an invitation to return
to Florida and watch Kentucky and Penn State play in the Outback
Bowl on New Year's Day. If he goes to Tampa for that game, he'll
see quarterback Tim Couch, whom he helped recruit. ``He wanted to
know if he could play two sports,'' Pitino recalled. ``I told him
I'd make him captain of the basketball team.'' The coach laughed.
He has watched Mo leave and Drew break his finger. He has watched
Duke's Elton Brand and likes what he sees. He has watched film of
pro basketball games, college games, high school games, and
ambitious players who think they have game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, though,'' he said, ``I'm bored.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does he do, basketballwise, to see through the haze of
that boredom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think about trades a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Stop right there. You may be thinking what many people
have thought in the past several months: Does that mean Pitino has
traded or plans to trade Antoine Walker? We all know that Pitino
definitely isn't shy about picking up the phone and making a deal.
And that's when he's busy. Give a guy like this time and an NBA
roster and you'll have yourself a makeover. Well, maybe. Remember:
Pitino said he is bored; he did not say he has lost his mind.
Pitino is not going to trade his best player simply because
Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit aren't as engaging as they used to be.
And although time can sometimes lead people to reflection and a new
way of looking at life, time hasn't changed the way Pitino feels
about Walker. Which is to say that, you know, he digs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Antoine on the court,'' Pitino
said. ``But, don't take this the wrong way, I have never paid
attention to anything he says off the court. What I mean by that is
this: He is 22 years old. I would never respond to something that
any 22-year-old player says in the newspaper. It's irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker turned off many Boston fans last summer when he called
himself a veteran All-Star and said he didn't see the point in
attending Pitino's voluntary camps. Many predicted that Walker had
seen his last days in Boston. He was the first player in a long
time to go on the record and criticize Pitino. The league does not
permit the coach to speak about labor issues nor to his players,
but he can speak generally about his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this is the way I am,'' Pitino began to explain. ``All
of my players are like children to me, especially the Kentucky
kids. I am loyal to all of them. If my kids don't come home on
time, do I stop being their father? Of course not. I don't turn on
my players. My job is to be extremely loyal to them. If I don't
like something Antoine said, he is still my college basketball
player and I love him dearly. He's going to get a lot of love from
me and he's going to get a lot of discipline from me, too. I say
this about all my players: They'll appreciate me more when their
careers are over. But I'm not going to let them _ and I'm not going
to let Antoine _ do everything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything. But when Pitino daydreams about his young team,
he can see the rhythmic Walker breaking into the Walker Wiggle.
Pitino doesn't want that to stop. Go to Chicago, Walker's hometown,
and you'll understand that it's full of dancers, people who frown
if you go to a club simply to lean against the walls. The coach has
no problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to stop the wiggle,'' he said. ``Now, if he
doesn't get into his defensive stance, he'll wiggle right out of
the game and to the bench. But I don't think coaches should try to
discipline a player's individual expression. What I do want to see
is Antoine develop a better relationship with the referees, because
if he doesn't it will hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino and Walker do not always get along, but the coach does
not dislike him. He has a rule that every player should be 15
minutes early for every bus and plane. ``Know how many times
Antoine didn't make it last year?'' the coach asked. ``Once. He
plays hard. He practices hard. He never misses games ...''
</P>
<P>
   But will he be traded? There's certainly time to work out a
deal. Part of me believes that Walker stays if the owners win the
lockout. But while I certainly believe Pitino when he says that he
loves Kentucky players, that's also why I wonder if the rumored
trade with Miami _ which includes former Kentucky player Jamal
Mashburn _ is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never been close to trading Antoine,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   What about a deal with Portland for Brian Grant?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true,'' the coach said. ``Never close.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also whispers of deals with Golden State, Denver and
the Clippers. Now it seems that, when basketball begins again,
Walker will be spending money from a Celtics paycheck. And Pitino
will be spending time and watching Walker in green.

BIG TIME TURMOIL AT UMASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AMHERST _ They arrived here in the fall of 1997, three women
from vastly different backgrounds and athletic programs. Nicky
Vallieres, Tory Grant, and Kara Trent were united in their love for
basketball and their desire to play it for the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a big-time program. The Minutewomen play in the
Atlantic 10 Conference. They travel the country; their practices
routinely run three hours or more. It's a serious commitment, but
the allure was understandable for three promising recruits eager to
play college hoops. The reality under coach Joanie O'Brien, they
say, proved to be quite different.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, none of the three is playing for UMass, a
development all attribute to O'Brien, now in her eighth year at
UMass and last season's conference Coach of the Year. Vallieres has
transferred to Division 2 American International, Grant has been
kicked off the team, and Trent has quit; due, in part, she said, to
what happened to the other two.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the individuals and many of their friends and
relatives describe O'Brien as a knowledgeable coach with an
unpredictable temper who insults and demeans some players while
unfairly favoring others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her language on the court was like none I had ever heard from
a coach before,'' Vallieres said. ``I understand getting frustrated
and blowing off steam in that way, but I thought most of her
language was unnecessary and could be taken for verbal abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent's family has hired a lawyer, who has been in negotiations
with the university about the charges. Grant, too, said she is
seeking legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who share the concerns of the three former
teammates. Many of the players on the team reportedly are in
counseling. The parents of a player still on the squad were so
concerned about O'Brien's behavior they had a relative attend a
game for the sole purpose of videotaping the coach in action.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth player, former Globe All-Scholastic Rekiya Penton, also
just left the team, citing ``personal reasons.'' Penton, who played
at Jeremiah Burke in Dorchester, had played only six minutes all
season, none during a Nov. 16 game at Boston College, disappointing
a contingent of around 25, many from Burke, who attended the game.
Efforts to reach Penton were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, O'Brien dismisses the criticism as a matter of
style. ``Am I an aggressive coach? Yeah. Am I intense? Absolutely.
If that's the way it comes across to them, that's their opinion of
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it. You just do what you feel like you have to do.
It's whatever's best. I don't see where that's coming from, as far
as being able to make a statement like that.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Bob Marcum, the athletic director at UMass,
said he has been impressed ``that Joanie operates her program in a
way that I think she has a great concern for the young people. Is
she an intense coach? Yes, she is. In all honesty, I don't see
where Joanie O'Brien is much different from a lot of the college
coaches I've seen. I'm not saying all their behavior is excellent
or all of it is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Carroll, UMass's sixth leading all-time scorer who
played for O'Brien for four years, said she had no problems with
the coach in her time there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken with other kids who've gone through Division 1
programs and it's a mirror image of what I went through with
Joanie,'' said Carroll, an assistant coach/athletic director at
Emmanuel College in Boston. ``She's also had two players who have
gone back there for a fifth year. If I could, I'd have stayed there
for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side is correct, the turmoil at UMass reflects a new
reality for women athletes. Being taken seriously means being
subjected to the same pressures _ and flaws _ that plague men's
college sports. It's the flip side of Title IX. There's more
exposure, more pressure to win, more pressure to find that certain
someone to carry the program.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it wasn't a game. It wasn't fun,'' Vallieres said.
``It was like going to work every day, having a job. Everything
here (at AIC) is so less stressful. It's a game again. This is more
like high school, where you have fun doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven to tears
</P>
<P>
   In her one year at Massachusetts, Vallieres kept a journal that
described a coach selective in her punishment, profane in her
language and abusive in her interactions with her players. ``I
never knew I would feel like I want to kill myself every day,''
Vallieres wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Roberta Cernik, recalled long, tearful telephone
conversations with her daughter. ``Am I bitter? I'm furious,''
Cernik said. ``This did not have to happen. And Nicky isn't the
only one. I feel sorry for all the girls there. I thank God my
daughter is out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres wanted desperately to play for Massachusetts. Her
uncle, Warren Anton, played on the freshman team with Julius Erving
and wore No. 44, the same number Vallieres chose as a freshman last
fall. But her excitement quickly ended when confronted with the
demands of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hard. I was on an emotional roller coaster every
day,'' she said. ``It was so tough. It wasn't normal, the way I was
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And while she was aware of O'Brien's reputation as a screamer,
she was unprepared for the real thing. During practice, she said
O'Brien would grab a player's arm ``very forcefully'' if the player
was out of position and ``sometimes even almost throw us in the
right direction.'' During games, Vallieres said, ``she would slap
our butts when we were subbing in.'' She recalled a teammate who
still had a welt on her behind two hours after a game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she ever grabbed players, O'Brien said, ``I guess it
would depend. Do we get after it in practice? Yeah. Am I involved?
As far as that type of stuff goes, not a lot. I'm not always the
one in there. But I'm a coach. I'm out there trying to show them
some things. `Get 'em here. Get 'em there. Do this. Do this. Watch
this.' Those types of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres may have been overmatched at UMass. She noticed
immediately that her teammates were faster, stronger, more
polished. O'Brien said the 5-foot-8-inch guard didn't deliver as
expected and, as a result, played only 66 minutes all season and
did not appear in one third of the 30 games. Vallieres told O'Brien
in January she wanted to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't deal with it anymore,'' Vallieres said. ``I was
used to getting a lot of playing time and here I am, sitting on the
bench. And the way she talked to me, I wasn't going to get too much
playing time in the future. I wanted to play ball. I wanted to have
fun. I wasn't doing either. So, I figured, why should I stay?''
</P>
<P>
   American International may be down a level, but it also meant
she wouldn't have to sit out the season. She couldn't wear No. 44 _
it was taken _ so she chose No. 21, the number she wore in high
school. Now, instead of spacious gyms with cushioned seats, she
plays in places like the Fieldhouse at Franklin Pierce College,
with wooden bleachers on one side and aluminum bleachers on the
other. The sound system wasn't working on a recent night, but no
one seemed to care, least of all the starting shooting guard for
AIC, Nicky Vallieres.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat performance
</P>
<P>
   When the UMass women gathered for the start of the 1998-99
season in mid-October, no one was more eager than the 5-11 Grant.
She was finally going to get a chance to play. She had played
sparingly as a freshman at Seton Hall and not at all last year
because of transfer regulations and surgery on both shins.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had practices begun, she said, than O'Brien was on
her in much the same way she said the coach had been on Vallieres
and Trent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember last year telling Trent and Nicky to `suck it up,
don't pay attention to what she says. Don't let it affect your
game,''' she said. ``They would tell me how hard it was with her
constantly on them every second. Then, when I started practicing,
it was me she was on all the time. She grabs people. She grabbed me
all the time and I didn't like it. Every time I stepped on the
court, it was (expletive) this and (expletive) that. The things she
says to you, well, no one should talk to anyone like that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien acknowledged that she ``probably'' was often profane
with her team. ``I don't know. Everyone has their own way of doing
things. But to say that I ever called anybody a name is an absolute
fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   On Halloween, O'Brien called Grant into her office. A teammate
had told the coach about a rules violation, one substantially more
severe than missing practice or being late for the team bus.
Neither Grant nor the university, however, has elaborated on the
violation. This was, however, Grant's second offense. She had done
the same thing the previous spring and, O'Brien said, had been told
that any future violation would lead to a dismissal from the team.
Grant said there had been no such warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that had been the case, I would have lied just to stay on
the team,'' Grant said. ``There was no proof. But I figured if I
just told the truth, Joanie would get mad and I'd get punished and
things would go from there. But I never expected her to kick me off
the team. I had no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Grant understood the situation the second time around,
O'Brien said, ``yes, she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said she wasn't the only violator, however. She said
another player, a starter, was involved in both incidents. That
player remained on the team. Grant said she told O'Brien about the
individual the day after Halloween. O'Brien said she had received
no such information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who they're talking about,'' O'Brien said. ``If
she (the other individual) did it, no one ever said it. And she
never admitted it. I can't accuse her.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Grant, ``I understand I did something wrong, but why does
this rule apply to me and not to anyone else? The other players
know. If it had been the other way around, I would have asked why
she got kicked off and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant waited a few days to tell her parents. She talked to the
school's athletic psychologist, who, Grant said, cautioned her
against ``going to the newspapers.'' When she finally did call
home, her parents came up from New Jersey the next day, hoping to
see Marcum. They never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left a number for me to call,'' Marcum said. ``That's
where they said they would be. I left a message saying to call
back, that I'd be happy to meet with them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a month ago. There still has been no contact between
the Grants and either Marcum or O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you kick someone off the team, you could at least have the
decency to talk to their parents,'' Grant said. ``My parents don't
like what's going on at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dropout
</P>
<P>
   The Trents had better luck than the Grants. Having already
scheduled a meeting with Marcum, they drove to UMass and met with
the athletic director for an hour. Mark Trent has a long history in
Massachusetts women's prep basketball, running the Massachusetts
Magic program and coaching many of the region's top college stars,
including BC's Brianne Stepherson and BU's Alison Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   The family spelled out their concerns, and then Kara Trent
walked down the hall to O'Brien's office and said she was through.
</P>
<P>
   ``She walked in here, sat in this office, and said that I wasn't
letting her be the person she wanted to be,'' O'Brien said of
Trent, who also told her coach ``I don't agree with how you dealt
with Tory and I don't want to play for you anymore.'' That was the
gist of what she said.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it certainly looked as if Trent had adjusted
quite well to UMass. She had been a two-time Globe All-Scholastic
selection while playing at Sandwich High School and had been the
subject of a flattering story in the Cape Cod Times after she moved
into the starting lineup late last year. She later confided to
friends that ``I made a nightmare into a fairy tale'' while talking
to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, she dreaded the prospect of a second season under
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joanie was always on Trent last year,'' Grant said. ``And
Trent couldn't handle it. She couldn't handle the way Joanie talked
to her and it completely changed her game.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent participated in the first two weeks of practice this fall.
Then, after Grant was kicked off the team, Trent called home the
next night and told her parents she planned to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutewomen lost five of their first six games this season
and, for the second straight year, also lost starter Kelly Van
Huisen to a torn anterior cruciate ligament. They are 4-7 after
Friday's 72-70 loss to Dartmouth. According to O'Brien, ``There's a
lot going on this year.'' Are the allegations a distraction?
``Yeah,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the season, O'Brien said she had the deepest and
most talented team in her eight years at Amherst. For a number of
reasons, that is no longer the case.

<P>
   The people have spoken, and many of them say Congress has
ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not doing what Americans want,'' said Ann Fricke, the
liberal postmaster of small-town Burlington, Ill. A ``witch hunt,''
she called it.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cullen, an Atlanta salesman who twice voted against
Clinton, said, ``What Clinton did was despicable, but what they're
doing is totally deplorable.'' He called it ``politics masquerading
as jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Bollman, a nuclear reactor operator for the US Air Force
from Napa, Calif., said he considers the impeachment hearings a
sham and subversion of the people's will. Bollman doesn't like
President Clinton, either his dalliance with a White House intern
or his refusal to fess up afterward, but he said it was ``time to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on long enough,'' Bollman said. ``People just
want it to go away already.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite poll after poll showing that the American people do not
want Clinton removed from office by impeachment, despite November
election results sending the same message, the House Judiciary
Committee voted on party lines to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The charges: perjury and obstruction of justice. The message,
said scores of voters from New York to Florida to Washington state
in interviews Saturday: Democracy has been hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We elect Congress; they're supposed to listen to us,'' said
Mike Owens, a Clinton supporter who works in the shipping and
receiving department of a Seattle company. ``If we say, `Hey, don't
pursue it,' then they shouldn't pursue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Frank Tiano, vice president of a Philadelphia
pharmaceutical company, who did not vote for Clinton either time,
``There are things that Congress should be doing. I don't know if
impeachment of the president is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tiano favors impeachment, although he dislikes the
partisanship displayed in Washington ever since Clinton's sexual
relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky became public in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed that Clinton needs to be punished, if only
censured by Congress as the White House wants. But those
declarations also tended to break down along party lines, with
Republican voters wishing to see the president ousted and Democrats
wanting to see him left alone to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment ``is what should take place under the balance of
powers,'' said Brian Radachy, a Queens, N.Y., auto parts
distributor who voted for Clinton in 1992 and against him in 1996.
``The executive has committed a crime, now the legislature must
act. ... Though, surprisingly, he seems to have the support of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spezzano, however, simply doesn't believe the polls
indicating that Clinton is as popular as ever, if not more so. As
the owner of a lawn-care service in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., Spezzano
said he speaks with 100 or more clients a week. Most are against
Clinton and for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the silent majority is in favor of impeachment, but
they won't speak up,'' said Spezzano, who voted for Bob Dole in the
last election. ``The majority of the public'' agreed with
congressmen pushing for impeachment, he said. ``Secretly, they're
saying, `That's right.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Peggy Cozart, an Atlanta photographer and registered
independent who did not vote for Clinton, what the people want is
of little concern anyway. What matters, she said, is that in her
eyes Clinton broke the law. He lied to the American public and,
worse, in a court of law during his testimony in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person who supports the Constitution of the United
States, I believe we have to go with the rule of law, despite the
will of the people,'' Cozart said. ``In the South, segregation was
once the will of the people. The law doesn't have to do with what
people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Still the $40 million investigation by independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr has never gripped the rest of the country as it
has Washington. With the only charges at issue related to furtive
sex in the White House, many voters said they had no interest in
listening to the House Judiciary Committee hearings on radio or
television. Unlike the Watergate hearings, voters clearly were not
riveted.
</P>
<P>
   As Dano Weisbord, program director for the Family and Wilderness
Foundation in Plymouth, Vt., put it, ``I'm not indifferent or
angry; I'm fascinated but also bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Added her breakfast companion, Rob Schultz, the foundation's
executive director and also a Democrat: ``How could this be
anything but partisan? I'm disgusted with the Republicans, but also
with the Democrats for coming to Clinton's defense so thoroughly.
He's a bonehead, missing a few important standards. It's disgusting
partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who oppose impeachment, the phrase, ``witch
hunt,'' arose again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Holden, a high school history teacher in Atlanta, called
the impreachment effort a vendetta by Republicans intent on evening
the score for the forced resignation of President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Crenshaw, an environmental writer and consultant from
Birmingham, Ala., called the impeachment hearings a ``ruse to
attack and possibly destroy Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to imply, however, that the people who continue to
support Clinton or to oppose impeachment were willing to condone
his behavior. While many again said the fallout from the
president's extramarital relations should be between him and the
first lady, they also said they found his behavior distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   But few thought that lying about such an affair was what the
founding fathers had in mind when they penned the phrase, ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.'' Instead, time and again, they said that
Congress had wrongly made the personal political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are out of their minds,'' said Jack Halsbond,
a Republican and freelance publicist in New York who said he
reluctantly voted for Clinton because he could not stand Dole.
``They're following a political agenda. ... How do you have
representation without paying attention to public opinion?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim McGeough, a computer consultant who lives in
Washington, D.C.: ``I think they are very isolated from reality,
those Republicans on the committee. It's only recently that the
American public could gain instant access to such proceedings, and
I think the politicians are underestimating the feelings of the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rosie Colter, a Realtor from Charleston, S.C.: ``They say
that the American people want to know, but I want to know who these
American people are. Everybody I talk to wants to know why they're
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of the impeachment proceedings, many
voters predicted a backlash in the next election. While some fear
that voters will stay away from the polls, convinced by the
hearings that their representatives do not heed their wishes,
others said they will at least be heard at the voting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to lose their seats,'' said Craig
Levesh, a printer and registered independent from Branford, Conn.,
who voted for Clinton. ``Or a lot less people will be voting
because they'll say, `Why should I? They're not listening to me.'''

ON HOCKEY: RANGERS AGAIN SHOW NEED FOR A GOAL-SCORER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Todd Harvey has a sore thumb, and he acted like
a sorehead. For either of these reasons, Harvey might miss at least
Monday night's game when the New York Rangers play Calgary at
Madison Square Garden. And if the National Hockey League is serious
about its crackdown on cheap shots and blows to the head, Harvey
might miss more than just one game. He may be the heartbeat of the
Rangers, as his coach has said, but Harvey needs to skip a couple
of beats for his gratuitous attempt to beat up Vaclav Varada of the
Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's right hand was bandaged after Friday night's 2-0 loss
in Marine Midland Arena. He said he did not injure it when he
charged the celebrating Varada from behind and clubbed him in the
back of his helmeted head. Varada had taken his sweet time about
dropping the puck into the empty Ranger net in the final minute
after goalie Mike Richter was pulled for an extra attacker. The
injury, Harvey said, came earlier, when another Sabre slashed him
with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Campbell, the league's senior vice president and director
of hockey operations, told the Rangers Saturday that he was looking
into the matter. In his first season in this sheriff's role,
Campbell, the former Ranger coach, has given out several severe
suspensions for bad behavior. Matt Johnson of Los Angeles got 12
games for a sucker punch that knocked out the Rangers' Jeff
Beukeboom. Blows to the head, the league has said, cannot be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Varada suffered only a headache, and his thought process was
clear enough to restate blunt opinions that have offended Harvey
and other Rangers. A member of the Sabres' checking line, Varada
said late last month that it was not that difficult to cover Wayne
Gretzky and his linemates in this, the Great One's 20th NHL season.
After Friday's game, he was unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what was the truth,'' Varada said. ``I didn't lie, and
I was right. I can say anything I want if it's true.'' As for
Harvey's attack, Varada added, with sarcasm: ``Hockey is a
fair-play sport. Really smart from his standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the emperor's new clothes, such observations
about Gretzky are offensive to the hockey establishment,
particularly to the Canadian hockey establishment, especially when
spoken by a young European. Once again Friday night against the
Sabres, Gretzky and his linemates were ineffective. Gretzky had one
shot on goal in 17 minutes and 24 seconds of ice time, including
duty on four power plays.
</P>
<P>
   After Varada knocked Gretzky down hard in the third period,
Gretzky limped to the bench so slowly for a line change that he got
caught in a Sabres rush. In the ensuing confusion, the Rangers were
penalized for too many men on the ice. Gretzky's wing men, Kevin
Stevens and John MacLean, received reduced playing time in the
third period. After a spurt of three goals and four assists in
three games, Gretzky has gone scoreless in the last four, with just
two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Will it help the Rangers to trade for a sharp-shooting right
wing to skate alongside Gretzky or another of their centers? So
many seem to be on the market. Among the names heard are
Vancouver's Pavel Bure, Calgary's Theo Fleury, Montreal's Mark
Recchi, Colorado's Claude Lemieux and Tampa's Mikael Renberg.
Despite denials from the Pittsburgh owner Roger Marino, the
financial crisis facing the bankrupt Penguins could eventually
force them to consider offers for the high-salaried and
multitalented Jaromir Jagr. Yes, the Rangers would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   But would an expensive addition help the Rangers in the short or
the long run, particularly if they have to give up young talent
such as center Manny Malhotra, left wing Niklas Sundstrom or goalie
Dan Cloutier? This season, such an acquisition might help them
qualify for a low playoff berth. The last two games, a 2-1 loss to
the Avalanche and the 2-0 loss to the Sabres, might have been
victories or ties with a timely goal or two from a sniper. The
Rangers played well both nights, better than in some victories over
lesser foes.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the bigger picture, this is a rebuilding team that will
usually work hard, occasionally entertain and sometimes suffer
noble defeats. The addition of another veteran will not suddenly
reverse the long-term erosion of what is still, overall, an old and
slow team. The reconstruction began last spring with the addition
of the youthful Harvey, who adds the spunk and spirit they have
lacked. Harvey's attack, wrong in the narrow frame, was a positive
development from a team that is regaining its self-esteem. Judged
in this context, a short suspension is a worthwhile price to pay, a
down payment on a long-term investment.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee completed action
Saturday on its bill of charges against President Clinton,
approving a fourth article of impeachment to stand alongside the
three it voted on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The final roll-call came a few hours after President Clinton
donned his peacemaker's cloak and flew to the Middle East, where he
arrived just before midnight in an effort to shore up the Wye
Plantation accords.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind a capital in wintry disarray, gripped by a
pervasive sense of sadness, with grievous divisions between the two
parties unmended and legislative business effectively stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike viewed the road ahead with doubt
and apprehension. Along with the rest of official Washington, the
president's aides grappled with the ever-more imminent prospect
that he will face trial next year in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment by the full House is starting to look
inevitable,'' a senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders prepared for a vote on the four articles
by the 435 House members next week, probably on Thursday. Chances
appeared dim for a floor vote on the alternative preferred by
Democrats, a resolution of censure for his misconduct with Monica
Lewinsky. Censure was defeated in the committee tonight, 22-14,
after a lengthy debate. The speaker-designate, Robert Livingston,
said he would fight any further effort to bring censure to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved the fourth article, in considerably
watered-down form, by a party-line vote of 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the
House, said that failure to permit a floor vote on censure ``will
most certainly result in a bitterly divided House.'' Ultimately, he
suggested, the American people would pass judgment on the fairness
of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the president's special counsel, said in a
statement that ``the certain result'' of the committee's actions
``will be to divide the country, gridlock the government and defy
the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the White House, he added: ``Nothing about this
process has been fair. Nothing about this process has been
bipartisan. Nothing about this process has won the confidence of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a session marred by harsh charges of bad faith and improper
pressure, Republicans with the backing of most of the committee's
Democrats substantially narrowed the reach of the fourth article.
It had originally dealt with allegedly widespread abuses of power,
but most allegations were removed, leaving only one major charge:
that Clinton had falsely or incompletely answered many of the 81
questions the committee submitted to him.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article as originally constituted had been considered
the weakest of the lot, with the poorest chance of winning approval
in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
committee, became so exercised at one point that he exclaimed,
``This does sometimes, to some people, begin to take on the
appearance of a coup. It's staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   That produced an uproar among the Republicans. Rep. Ed Bryant of
Tennessee shot back, ``This is the orderly process of the
Constitution, not troops in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, one of the fiercest Democratic foes of
impeachment, accused the Republicans of showing insufficient
respect to Clinton, who, she heatedly reminded them, ``is still the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen congressmen, many of them still undecided,
joined Clinton at Andrews Air Force Base as he boarded Air Force
One. It seemed probable that the president, always formidable in
one-on-one situations, would seize the opportunity do some lobbying
on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will be able to inject any adrenaline into the
flagging Middle East peace process is another question. He is to
meet privately with both Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime
minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and make a
number of public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the very best of times, the Middle East has proved a
minefield for American presidents. In this, the worst of times for
his presidency, Clinton is taking his own minefield with him, and
it is not clear how much influence he retains there, if any, given
his difficulties at home.

 UNDATED: at home.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president is due back in Washington before Thursday's vote
in the House. Only Andrew Johnson among Clinton's predecessors has
ever faced such a perilous roll-call, and Clinton may try once
again to make a statement that would sway moderate Republicans to
avoid impeachment. But his closest advisers said they did not know
what more he could say, beyond another expression of his regret and
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried that on Friday afternoon, to no avail.
Republicans looking for an admission from Clinton that he had lied
were disappointed; most agreed with Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio that
``the president did not say nearly enough.'' The advisers said
there was no chance he would ever do so, if the moderates were
seeking an acknowledgment of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Impeached by the House, Johnson escaped conviction by the Senate
by a single vote, but he was enfeebled by the process. If
impeached, Clinton is expected to survive in the Senate by a wider
margin, given the close partisan division and the requirement for a
two-thirds vote to convict. The widespread fear in Washington is
that he, too, would be crippled, with almost two years left to
serve on the second term he won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee raised that
prospect in arguing that impeachment without conviction was a
destructive idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president and the president after that and the
president after that,'' asserted Rep. Steven Rothman of New Jersey,
``will be looking over their shoulders every time they make a
controversial decision with a Congress that is controlled by the
opposition party.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his long-standing promise to try to wrap things up by
Christmas, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, gaveled the panel to order shortly before 10 o'clock
Saturday morning _ an unusual hour for a Capitol Hill committee
meeting, especially on a Saturday. With the 10-week inquiry nearing
its end, Saturday's session descended almost immediately into more
partisan wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three hours, the two sides had at each other,
despite Hyde's efforts to move things along. At one point his usual
civility slipped a bit as the speeches droned on, and he
complained, ``We've had everything from aardvark to Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hyde and Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the incoming
speaker, were said by staff members to be opposed to allowing a
censure resolution to reach the House floor. Their strategic
calculation was this: If members reluctant to vote for impeachment
but determined not to let the president escape without punishment
were given the chance to vote for censure, they would not cast
their votes for the more severe measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde relented to the degree of permitting committee debate
on censure. Democrats continued to push for a floor vote, to no
evident effect, with Rep. Thomas Barrett of Wisconsin insisting
that ``no member of this institution should be denied the chance to
vote his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., introduced the censure
resolution, stating that the president had ``dishonored the
office.'' He said that while ``the president's conduct was
reprehensible, it did not threaten the nation'' and did not warrant
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans termed the resolution a slap on the wrist and said
it was precisely what Clinton wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Little of Saturday's debate dealt with the merits of the
Republican move to narrow the scope of the proposed article four by
excluding abuse of executive privilege and false statements to the
public and White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, it was
eventually approved by a vote of 29-5, with three members voting
``present.'' Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah, a Republican, voted
``no'' because he favored keeping the excised material in the
article, and four Democrats voted ``no'' to demonstrate their
opposition to the one remaining charge in the truncated article.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who would have a chance to vote in
the Senate trial as a new member of that body next year, said one
part of the original fourth article was ``the greatest reach of
all, the most absurd thing'' in any of the allegations lodged by
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That was the charge that by lying to the American people in
speeches on television Clinton had committed an impeachable
offense. If he had, Schumer said, every president since George
Washington had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts restated the Democrats' case
that Republicans were starting a process ``designed to kick the
president out'' in the full knowledge that the Senate would never
do so. That course of action, he said, demeaned the constitutional
process as well as the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde rebutted him, quoting the late Rep. Barbara Jordan,
D-Texas, who in the committee's proceedings against Richard Nixon
almost 25 years ago said that ``the House accuses, the Senate
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's job, Hyde insisted, was simply to decide ``whether
there was enough evidence to warrant a Senate trial,'' not fully to
weigh the evidence itself. Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, also a
Republican, summed up his party's view by saying, ``The House does
not convict; it merely accuses.'' If the Senate failed to convict,
he said, the House's vote to impeach would stand as a far more
effective rebuke to Clinton than a mere censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is the scarlet letter,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., in a rejoinder typical of Democratic attempts to drive home
the seriousness of the House's proceedings. ``Impeachment is the
removal of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank conceded that that was not literally true, but in the
House ``we hold the keys to this door,'' he said.

AT FAREWELL TOWN HALL, ADVICE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ As his colleagues in Washington debated
President Clinton's fate, House Speaker Newt Gingrich played host
Saturday to a farewell town hall meeting in his district that
combined effusive tributes for Gingrich with seething denunciations
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At both his forum at Walton High School and at a news
conference, Gingrich maintained his distance from the details of
the impeachment process, which he has bequeathed to his successor,
Rep. Bob Livingston, and to Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee. He relented to speak about Clinton only when
Chris Bennett, a ninth grader at Lassiter High School, asked him
what the next president should do ``to restore dignity to the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich responded: ``I suspect every person in this room is a
sinner. But there is an enormous difference between being human and
failing to recognize the responsibilities and the duties you have
voluntarily accepted. I hope that the next president, whoever they
are and of whatever party, takes seriously being the leader of a
free people, takes seriously being commander in chief, takes
seriously that the Oval Office is the civic center of the American
nation. And I think, frankly, any reasonable person who takes those
three and does them will, in a heartbeat, will in the opening 24
hours, restore to the White House the dignity, the honor, the
decency which it has so clearly lost in the last six years.''
</P>
<P>
   At the town hall meeting, the 33rd such forum that Gingrich has
held in his district since becoming speaker in 1995, dozens of the
500 people present lined up to pay homage. They hailed Gingrich,
who will leave the House on Jan. 3, as a compassionate visionary
who made time for his constituents even after the Republicans took
control of the House in 1994. With thunderous ovations, they urged
him to run for president, which he later said he would not do in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who announced his resignation from the House last
month after the Democrats gained seats in the Nov. 3 election, said
he had consulted on Friday with Livingston about next week's
impeachment vote. But he refused to disclose any advice he offered
about whether the Republican leadership should allow debate on a
Democratic proposal to censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He urged all House members to vote their conscience. While
declining to specify his own views on impeachment, Gingrich
emphasized that his withdrawal from the House's leadership had
removed a political obstacle to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last month, because I haven't been public, because I
haven't said anything, the focus really has been on some issues
that are pretty important to the country,'' Gingrich said with a
grin. He acknowledged that he is such ``a sufficiently vocal and
polarizing personality'' that Clinton had been able to use him
effectively as a foil. As long as he remained speaker, he said, he
would continue to serve as ``the excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is a brilliant counterpuncher,'' Gingrich said.
``He does almost nothing positive but he hits those who try to do
things remarkably well. And now, frankly, he has to stand on his
own feet. He and Gore have to decide are they going to handle
Washington, are they going to lead the world, are they going to
solve problems. And the country will measure them without being in
some kind of fight with the Republican speaker of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the House, Gingrich, 55, said he would give paid
speeches and remain vocal on issues.

BREWER WAITING FOR NEWS FROM CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Savvy NBA watchdogs say that in the Clippers'
coach-hiring derby, the smart money is on Jim Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the sneaky money, money that had nothing to do
with the Clippers, was on Jim Brewer, too. This particular loot had
been scored in a 50-50 raffle during a game at Long Beach City
College, and belonged to lucky ticketholder Patsy Brewer, Jim's
wife. That didn't stop Jim from pocketing this fistful of small
bills while Patsy shared a post-game embrace with Jim Brewer Jr.,
starting point guard for the unbeaten LBCC squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need this,'' said Brewer in the role of slick, grinning
husband, probably deciding that not being on a payroll doesn't mean
he can't snag a roll of some kind. For now, he's a coach in
professional limbo. After four years as a Clippers assistant,
Brewer became unemployed when the team fired head coach Bill Fitch
a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers will wait for the death of the NBA lockout before
hiring Fitch's replacement, and Brewer is on a short list that
includes deposed Sacramento Kings coach Eddie Jordan and Chris
Ford, who was shown the door in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels a lot like the situation in Minnesota,'' said
Brewer, referring to his pre-Clippers days as an employee of the
Timberwolves, whose ownership had threatened to take its franchise
to New Orleans. ``Not knowing where you're going to be is really
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wait is made almost tolerable by knowing he's considered
the Clippers favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Brewer said in what can be interpreted as a
public declaration of really wanting this job, and thereby worth a
few brownie points.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Safety, the Clippers' vice president of communications,
confirms that Brewer is highly regarded in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Brewer is a super guy,'' Safety said. ``The people would
love him. He's well-respected by the players, he has no agenda...
he's a very astute guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Does all of this mean he's the guy? The Clippers aren't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be mysterious about it,'' said Safety, who
added that the job has not been offered to Brewer, Ford, Jordan or
any of the more-exotic, alleged candidates whose names surfaced
after Fitch was let go. ``There's been an awful lot of noise, but
we prefer to take all of the available time before making the
decision. But when it (lockout) ends, we're in a position to move
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But probably not as quickly as Brewer moved when the 50-50
raffle money came his way.
</P>
<P>
   Selling `Kandi': ``There's been interest from every country in
the world,'' said Bill Duffy, sounding more like a nuclear-weapons
dealer than the agent for Michael Olowokandi, the first pick in the
most-recent NBA draft. That pick, you may recall, was made by the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout is doing little to accelerate the hoop education of
Olowokandi, a 7-footer from the University of the Pacific by way of
England who has played basketball for all of four years. So, while
his client is unable to play or get paid, Duffy has entertained
offers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one today from Italy,'' said the agent, who didn't
share specifics.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Team Olowokandi's final foreign decision will be
postponed until the next turn of the NBA labor war, Duffy said,
``Not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for profit in a foreign professional league, especially
if the NBA season is wiped out, could help Olowokandi hold the
learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in on this issue is Pete Newell, who coached Cal to the
NCAA championship in 1959 and now operates boot camps for tall
basketball players, serving as the Dalai Lama of low-post play.
Olowokandi has been a prized pupil at Newell's gatherings the last
two summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'd be great for him,'' said Newell of Olowokandi
killing time and raising his game in a foreign league. ``I think
the kid needs to play. The lockout may be hurting him more than
anybody.''

VISIT TO TEST CLINTON-NETANYAHU SURVIVAL SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton arrived in Israel just before
midnight on Saturday on an intricate mission to revive the peace
effort, a centerpiece of his foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   On a cool, overcast night, Clinton was greeted with trumpets and
an honor guard, but also with flinty remarks from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who declared that the Palestinians had
not kept their commitments ``and have reverted to past practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary moment of symmetrical political peril, the
arrival ceremony brought together two men who are facing crises of
confidence in their leadership, each of whom has reason to fear the
other's potential impact on his own precarious position. The House
will vote late this week on Clinton's impeachment, and just days
later the Israeli parliament is scheduled to hold a vote of
confidence in Netanyahu's government.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief, sober address, Clinton _ who is traveling with his
wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, _ expressed understanding of
Israeli concerns. ``We are determined that Israel's just
requirements for security be met,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``for two peoples who are fated to share this
land,'' peace was ``the only choice that can avert still more years
of bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu shattered his support on the right and jeopardized his
hold on office by cooperating with Clinton in October and agreeing
to cede more land to the Palestinians, under an accord reached at
the Wye River Plantation in Maryland. Now, when failure of that
agreement could make Clinton look weak, Netanyahu has every reason
not to see it through. And the president risks further erosion in
his congressional support if he is seen as leaning too hard on the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In his nine-minute remarks _ three times as long as the
president's _ Netanyahu warned, ``Agreements not anchored in
security, agreements which only serve to conceal belligerent aims,
agreements brazenly flouted and violated with violence inevitably
lead not to peace but to the continuation and intensification of
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment and his stewardship of foreign affairs linked
in the minds of many members of Congress, Clinton is under intense
pressure to perform during his three-day visit. ``Does he have the
trust and credibility to build an international coalition?'' asked
Rep. Rick Lazio of New York, one of two House Republicans undecided
on impeachment who are among a large congressional delegation
accompanying Clinton. The other is Jon Fox of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight from Washington, Lazio said he would speak
with Clinton about impeachment if the president broached the
subject, but would not bring it up. ``I'm sure he's laboring under
a good deal of anxiety, about this trip and about the outcome of
the vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also on the trip, said Clinton
was ``wonderful'' and in ``apparent good spirits.'' Aides to the
president said he spent most of the 10-hour flight in his cabin
with his family.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee approved a fourth article of
impeachment, charging abuse of power, less than two hours before
Clinton's jet pulled up at Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the wary Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, is thrilled that Clinton is here. On Monday and
Tuesday, the president is to tour Palestinian territory in Gaza and
Bethlehem, in what many Palestinians are seeing as tacit
recognition of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the United States did not recognize a Palestinian
state. ``The president feels the same way,'' he said. ``But others
are seeing it differently, and it is causing anguish in some
quarters in Israel. For that reason, I hope the president will find
the occasion to say something about it while on the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said Netanyahu had ``paid a terrific price for the
withdrawals,'' while the Palestinian leadership ``has a lot to
prove.'' In particular, he said, the Palestinian National Council,
with Clinton in attendance, must vote on Monday to rescind clauses
in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's destruction.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee completed action
Saturday on its bill of charges against President Clinton,
approving a fourth article of impeachment to stand alongside the
three it voted on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The final roll-call came a few hours after President Clinton
donned his peacemaker's cloak and flew to the Middle East, where he
arrived just before midnight in an effort to shore up the Wye
Plantation accords.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind a capital in wintry disarray, gripped by a
pervasive sense of sadness, with grievous divisions between the two
parties unmended and legislative business effectively stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike viewed the road ahead with doubt
and apprehension. Along with the rest of official Washington, the
president's aides grappled with the ever-more imminent prospect
that he will face trial next year in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment by the full House is starting to look
inevitable,'' a senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders prepared for a vote on the four articles
by the 435 House members this week, probably on Thursday. Chances
appeared dim for a floor vote on the alternative preferred by
Democrats, a resolution of censure for his misconduct with Monica
Lewinsky. Censure was defeated in the committee tonight, 22-14,
after a lengthy debate. The speaker-designate, Robert Livingston,
said he would fight any further effort to bring censure to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved the fourth article, in considerably
watered-down form, by a party-line vote of 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the
House, said that failure to permit a floor vote on censure ``will
most certainly result in a bitterly divided House.'' Ultimately, he
suggested, the American people would pass judgment on the fairness
of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the president's special counsel, said in a
statement that ``the certain result'' of the committee's actions
``will be to divide the country, gridlock the government and defy
the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the White House, he added: ``Nothing about this
process has been fair. Nothing about this process has been
bipartisan. Nothing about this process has won the confidence of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a session marred by harsh charges of bad faith and improper
pressure, Republicans with the backing of most of the committee's
Democrats substantially narrowed the reach of the fourth article.
It had originally dealt with allegedly widespread abuses of power,
but most allegations were removed, leaving only one major charge:
that Clinton had falsely or incompletely answered many of the 81
questions the committee submitted to him.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article as originally constituted had been considered
the weakest of the lot, with the poorest chance of winning approval
in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the
committee, became so exercised at one point that he exclaimed,
``This does sometimes, to some people, begin to take on the
appearance of a coup. It's staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   That produced an uproar among the Republicans. Rep. Ed Bryant of
Tennessee shot back, ``This is the orderly process of the
Constitution, not troops in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, one of the fiercest Democratic foes of
impeachment, accused the Republicans of showing insufficient
respect to Clinton, who, she heatedly reminded them, ``is still the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen congressmen, many of them still undecided,
joined Clinton at Andrews Air Force Base as he boarded Air Force
One. It seemed probable that the president, always formidable in
one-on-one situations, would seize the opportunity do some lobbying
on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will be able to inject any adrenaline into the
flagging Middle East peace process is another question. He is to
meet privately with both Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime
minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and make a
number of public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the very best of times, the Middle East has proved a
minefield for American presidents. In this, the worst of times for
his presidency, Clinton is taking his own minefield with him, and
it is not clear how much influence he retains there, if any, given
his difficulties at home.

 UNDATED: at home.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president is due back in Washington before Thursday's vote
in the House. Only Andrew Johnson among Clinton's predecessors has
ever faced such a perilous roll-call, and Clinton may try once
again to make a statement that would sway moderate Republicans to
avoid impeachment. But his closest advisers said they did not know
what more he could say, beyond another expression of his regret and
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried that on Friday afternoon, to no avail.
Republicans looking for an admission from Clinton that he had lied
were disappointed; most agreed with Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio that
``the president did not say nearly enough.'' The advisers said
there was no chance he would ever do so, if the moderates were
seeking an acknowledgment of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Impeached by the House, Johnson escaped conviction by the Senate
by a single vote, but he was enfeebled by the process. If
impeached, Clinton is expected to survive in the Senate by a wider
margin, given the close partisan division and the requirement for a
two-thirds vote to convict. The widespread fear in Washington is
that he, too, would be crippled, with almost two years left to
serve on the second term he won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee raised that
prospect in arguing that impeachment without conviction was a
destructive idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president and the president after that and the
president after that,'' asserted Rep. Steven Rothman of New Jersey,
``will be looking over their shoulders every time they make a
controversial decision with a Congress that is controlled by the
opposition party.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his long-standing promise to try to wrap things up by
Christmas, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, gaveled the panel to order shortly before 10 o'clock
Saturday morning _ an unusual hour for a Capitol Hill committee
meeting, especially on a Saturday. With the 10-week inquiry nearing
its end, Saturday's session descended almost immediately into more
partisan wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three hours, the two sides had at each other,
despite Hyde's efforts to move things along. At one point his usual
civility slipped a bit as the speeches droned on, and he
complained, ``We've had everything from aardvark to Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hyde and Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the incoming
speaker, were said by staff members to be opposed to allowing a
censure resolution to reach the House floor. Their strategic
calculation was this: If members reluctant to vote for impeachment
but determined not to let the president escape without punishment
were given the chance to vote for censure, they would not cast
their votes for the more severe measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde relented to the degree of permitting committee debate
on censure. Democrats continued to push for a floor vote, to no
evident effect, with Rep. Thomas Barrett of Wisconsin insisting
that ``no member of this institution should be denied the chance to
vote his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., introduced the censure
resolution, stating that the president had ``dishonored the
office.'' He said that while ``the president's conduct was
reprehensible, it did not threaten the nation'' and did not warrant
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans termed the resolution a slap on the wrist and said
it was precisely what Clinton wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Little of Saturday's debate dealt with the merits of the
Republican move to narrow the scope of the proposed article four by
excluding abuse of executive privilege and false statements to the
public and White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, it was
eventually approved by a vote of 29-5, with three members voting
``present.'' Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah, a Republican, voted
``no'' because he favored keeping the excised material in the
article, and four Democrats voted ``no'' to demonstrate their
opposition to the one remaining charge in the truncated article.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who would have a chance to vote in
the Senate trial as a new member of that body next year, said one
part of the original fourth article was ``the greatest reach of
all, the most absurd thing'' in any of the allegations lodged by
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That was the charge that by lying to the American people in
speeches on television Clinton had committed an impeachable
offense. If he had, Schumer said, every president since George
Washington had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts restated the Democrats' case
that Republicans were starting a process ``designed to kick the
president out'' in the full knowledge that the Senate would never
do so. That course of action, he said, demeaned the constitutional
process as well as the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde rebutted him, quoting the late Rep. Barbara Jordan,
D-Texas, who in the committee's proceedings against Richard Nixon
almost 25 years ago said that ``the House accuses, the Senate
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The House's job, Hyde insisted, was simply to decide ``whether
there was enough evidence to warrant a Senate trial,'' not fully to
weigh the evidence itself. Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, also a
Republican, summed up his party's view by saying, ``The House does
not convict; it merely accuses.'' If the Senate failed to convict,
he said, the House's vote to impeach would stand as a far more
effective rebuke to Clinton than a mere censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is the scarlet letter,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., in a rejoinder typical of Democratic attempts to drive home
the seriousness of the House's proceedings. ``Impeachment is the
removal of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank conceded that that was not literally true, but in the
House ``we hold the keys to this door,'' he said.

VIOLENCE OVERSHADOWS CLINTON'S FIRST VISIT TO PALESTINIAN-RULED
SOIL

<P>
   QALQILYA, West Bank _ Palestinians buried the latest two victims
of West Bank violence on Saturday with angry chants and shouts of
``God is great'' just hours before President Clinton arrived in
Israel to try to salvage an ailing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At Israeli checkpoints outside Ramallah and Bethlehem,
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers clashed, while Palestinian
police tried in vain to stop the youths from throwing stones. In
Hebron, Palestinian demonstrators threw a homemade firebomb in the
central market.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Palestinians were injured by soldiers who fired
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. Two Israelis,
one border guard and a civilian, were also injured outside
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   In Qalqilya, just before noon, pallbearers carried the body of
Kamal Adwan, 21, wrapped in a white Muslim burial shroud and a
Palestinian flag, as thousands of mourners slowly walked through
narrow streets to the town cemetery. At the same time, another
group of mourners gathered in the West Bank village of Qbeibeh to
bury Mohammed Suleiman, 18.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men had been among hundreds who fought with
Israeli soldiers Friday evening in an open field on Qalqilya's
western border with Israel. It was the deadliest incident in a week
of violent protests against the detention of hundreds of
Palestinians in Israelis jails. Adwan and Suleiman were the third
and fourth victims shot and killed during the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has overshadowed Clinton's first visit to
Palestinian-ruled soil, a trip meant to add momentum to the Wye
peace accord, signed on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton is scheduled to address a meeting of the
Palestine National Council in Gaza City. The council is to remove
clauses of the Palestinian charter that call for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three-day visit will include trips to Gaza,
Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem on the West Bank and Masada, a hilltop
fortress that is symbolic of ancient Jewish resistance to the
Romans, in the Negev Desert.
</P>
<P>
   The week leading up to Clinton's visit has been marred by
violence and disputes between Israel and the Palestinians over the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused Israel of
trying to ``raise tensions'' before Clinton's visit by allowing
troops to quell riots with live bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israeli officials accused Arafat of instigating
problems by timing the demonstrations to coincide with Clinton's
visit as a way to pressure Israel to release more Palestinian
prisoners incarcerated for their involvement in the struggle
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, Palestinian prisoners and their families
have staged a hunger strike that they say will continue until the
last prisoner is released.
</P>
<P>
   Other Palestinians have gathered at hunger-strike tents set up
in most major West Bank and Gaza towns. Daily clashes between
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers have left hundreds injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Palestinian activists plan to call a general strike
in solidarity with the prisoners. And on Tuesday, they plan to have
the children of prisoners hold a candlelight vigil in Bethlehem to
coincide with Clinton's visit to that West Bank city to light a
Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   In Qalqilya on Saturday, Palestinians closed closing shops,
restaurants and schools in honor of the two dead, but Israeli army
checkpoints at the entrances to the city, the scenes of violent
rioting on Friday, remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, mourners vented anger at Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who last month freed mostly common criminals in
a prisoner release deal negotiated in October at the Wye River
conference center. The crowd yelled, ``Netanyahu, you coward,
release all the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only way to get the prisoners released,'' said
Nasser Mansour, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club in
Qalqilya, referring to the bloody clashes with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high price to pay,'' said Mansour. ``But there is no
other way. There is no peace as long as any prisoner is still in
Israeli prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu promised at the Wye negotiations to release 750
Palestinian prisoners. He angered Palestinians by mixing 150 common
criminals in with the first group of 250 that were released last
month. The action sparked riots that Palestinians have dubbed the
``prisoners' intifada,'' a reference to the seven-year uprising
against Israeli rule that ended with a peace agreement five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of brewing trouble, Israelis and Palestinians
spent last week in dispute over the purpose of Monday's meeting of
the Palestinian National Council in Gaza. Israel insists that the
700-member body conduct a formal vote to remove the clauses from
the Palestinian Liberation Organization charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wye agreement does not specifically call for a vote, and
the Palestinians say a vote is neither needed nor planned.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, U.S. officials were still trying to set up a
three-way meeting between Arafat, Netanyahu and Clinton, which the
Palestinian leader has already agreed to attend. Netanyahu has said
the meeting will take place only if the Palestinian National
Council votes to annul the controversial clauses of the charter on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Qalqiliya, Palestinians said they hoped Clinton's visit would
finally put the issue of the charter to rest and would push Israel
to release more prisoners. ``If he helps to free the prisoners
without conditions, then he will definitely help the situation
here,'' said Ghassan Jasser, an English teacher who taught
Suleiman, one of the two Palestinians killed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Gaza City, the militant Hamas organization
ridiculed the Palestinian Authority's anticipation of Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian Authority claims that Clinton's visit
reinforces Palestinian sovereignty, but this is a mere illusion,''
the leaflet said.

LIVINGSTON VOWS TO BLOCK CENSURE OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle lines over allowing the House to censure
President Clinton rather than impeach him hardened sharply
Saturday, as Rep. Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate, vowed to
block such a move, and White House allies promised to take the
fight to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston shed his ambiguity on the issue moments after the
House Judiciary Committee rejected censure as an alternative, and
the panel's chairman, Henry Hyde, urged House Republican leaders to
keep it off the floor, saying such a move would threaten the
separation of powers between the legislative and executive
branches.
</P>
<P>
   In revealing his position, Livingston said that he strongly
supported impeachment and that censure was not envisioned by the
Constitution's founders. ``Censure is out of the realm of
responsibility of the House of Representatives,'' Livingston said
before flying back to Washington from Louisiana Saturday. ``We have
a constitutional responsibility to charge or not charge, impeach or
not impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, President Clinton's supporters mounted a full-scale
campaign to force Livingston to reverse course, aiming to build
public support for an alternative to impeachment and to put a
glaring spotlight on Livingston's ability to cope with his newly
won leadership duties.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic challenge, already facing long odds before
Saturday, now confronts a unified House Republican leadership,
bolstered by the arguments offered by Hyde, which are likely to
influence many undecided Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Only a strong, vocal protest from several moderate Republicans
who oppose impeachment could force Livingston to reverse course at
this late hour, censure supporters say. And up to now, any
Republican who has openly opposed impeachment or supported censure
has been hammered mercilessly by conservative groups and right-wing
talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, the Republican whip and a fierce critic of
Clinton, fears that allowing a censure vote would siphon votes from
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this dynamic, the president's allies Saturday tried
to begin gathering the broad public support for censure to give
moderate Republicans the political cover they need to openly
challenge their leadership. But White House allies voiced worries
that it would be hard to rouse a public distracted by the holiday
season, even though opinion polls are running hard against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the Judiciary Committee voted out a fourth article
of impeachment, Democrats on the panel gave an impassioned argument
for a censure alternative that condemns the president's
``reprehensible conduct'' and leaves open the possibility that
Clinton could face ``criminal and civil penalties'' after leaving
office. It does not call for a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to punish the president or brand the president
with scarlet letters or stamp him on the forehead, censure is the
way to do it,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To buttress their case, Democrats underscored the gravity of an
impeachment vote, by arguing that casting such a vote explicitly
urges the president's removal. ``This is not sending to the Senate
a questionnaire,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``This is a
statement the president should be thrown out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several Democrats sought to put pressure on Livingston. Rep.
John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee,
conceded that the censure resolution would fail in committee (it
did, 22-14), but focused on its chances on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will practice our arguments today and prepare them for a
larger presentation,'' Conyers said. ``My hope is on the untested
speaker-elect, Bob Livingston.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel rejected the censure resolution as
unconstitutional, a bad precedent and feckless.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Livingston and Speaker Newt Gingrich released
moments after the committee adjourned, Hyde said ``a resolution or
amendment proposing censure of the president in lieu of impeachment
violates the rules of the House, threatens the separation of
powers, and fails to meet constitutional muster.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said the president's crimes were too
serious for censure. ``This president mocks the Congress, and this
censure is exactly what this president wants,'' he said in debate
Saturday. ``He will take this as a vindication of his mocking and
we should not give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As committee Democrats began their frontal assault, the House
Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, appealed in a letter to
Livingston to allow a censure vote on the House floor. Gephardt's
aides vowed an intense fight for censure and issued veiled warnings
that Livingston, by blocking a vote on censure, was inviting
protracted battles with House Democrats in the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This first most important decision for you as a leader will
mark more than the fate of impeachment,'' Gephardt said. ``It will
surely mark the kind of leader you will be, and thereby the kind of
Congress we can expect under your speakership.''
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston characterized Gephardt's proposition as flouting
the rules of the House. ``An attack on the rules is an attack on
the chair,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans also threw back in Livingston's face
his promise not to whip the impeachment vote, and instead make it a
vote of conscience for each member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership cannot say this is a conscience
vote, if they don't allow members of Congress to express their
conscience to voice an alternative,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y.,
who opposes impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who is undeclared, said, ``I'd rather see
censure as an open option.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Congress is out of session, and that lawmakers are
scattered across the country, has also hurt the censure effort. But
as House members filter back, censure supporters say, they will try
to gather their allies for a final push.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and Thursday, there has to be on outpouring of
public opinion,'' King said. ``People are still not focused on
this. The average American thought this ended with the elections on
Nov. 3, and they aren't fully aware we're down this path.'' &QL;

GRAPEVINE MAKES HUGE STATEMENT IN TEXAS 4A TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The hug between Grapevine football coach Mike Sneed and
Carroll coach Tom Rapp occurred at midfield, right on Texas
Stadium's big blue star. The words were from Sneed, and they were
oh so sweet for him to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't win district,'' Sneed told his District 11-4A
rival, ``but we won state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We won state''. The words sound strange _ not so much because
it is Grapevine High School we are talking about. The Mustangs
have, after all, now won two Class 4A Division I championships in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the way they did it that makes them such an incredible
story.
</P>
<P>
   These were not the Mustangs of old, that 1996 Grapevine team
that rampaged through Class 4A with an unblemished record. This was
a scrappy, sometimes ignored, often underestimated bunch.
</P>
<P>
   There are big games and big-game teams. Then there is Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's 22-0 victory against Bay City was an exclamation
point for so many, a perfect ending to a storybook season.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, junior linebacker Matt France laid in bed for
nearly three hours, unable to sleep, alone with his thoughts,
anxieties and hopes. He said he knew the Mustangs would dominate.
He was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best Christmas present I think I'll ever get in my
life,'' said France, who was the game's leading tackler. ``Nobody
expected us to do it, but now we're state champions.''
</P>
<P>
   State champions. There's that phrase again. How did these
Mustangs pull it off? How did Grapevine transform from a team that
had to defeat Colleyville Heritage and Keller in its final two
regular-season games simply to get into the playoffs into one that
now sits on top of the Class 4A mountain?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. All they did was manage to win the games that counted
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to think that to win a state title, you had to
have better players than anybody else, like we did in 1996,'' Sneed
said. ``This has been done in a whole different way. If your kids
want to win, you have a chance. For every team in Texas, this is
the ultimate goal. We're no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sneed wasn't given the credit he deserved for
leading Grapevine to a state title. Overshadowed by Lewisville's
championship the same year in Class 5A, Sneed was given the
sleight. Anyone could have taken a team that included Jack Brewer
and Tellis Redmon and won it all, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody will be saying that this year,'' Sneed
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, seniors can wear their state-title rings with pride.
Though they received rings then by being little-used junior-varsity
players called up for the playoffs, they don't wear them.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can. They did in 1998 what they felt they did not do in
1996: earn their rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the last game of my life and we won a state
championship,'' linebacker Jared Brown said. ``What more could you
ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Mustangs asked for much. They asked to find a way
to get into the playoffs and they did it. They asked to survive a
three-overtime gut-check against Greenville and they did it. They
asked to squeak past Plainview last week and they did that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, they asked for the magic one more time. France was
asking for his bedtime thoughts to be true. Sneed was asking for
his Mustangs to find a way. Quarterback Jordan Wilson was wanting a
new ring he could wear with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, they got all those things and more.
</P>
<P>
   They got their magic, their answered prayers, their vindication.
They earned their rings and their title. And they proved that the
rest of us who gave them up for dead more than a month ago were
instead dead wrong ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know the Mustangs never were dead.
</P>
<P>
   They were only getting started.

WITH IMPEACHMENT CLOUD OVER HIS HEAD, CLINTON TRIES TO SALVAGE
MIDEAST PEACE ACCORD
</HEADLINE>

Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton, his mission to salvage a troubled
peace accord overshadowed by impeachment proceedings at home,
Saturday urged Palestinians and Israelis to keep their commitments
to the troubled Wye River agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But a tough-talking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
his own right-wing coalition government near collapse, accused
Palestinians of breaching the peace and inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
daughter Chelsea, was greeted at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion
International Airport by Netanyahu and Israeli President Ezer
Weizman. But several of Netanyahu's conservative Cabinet members
boycotted the arrival, adding to the air of uncertainty about the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth time I have come here as president to
reaffirm America's unbreakable ties to Israel, to reaffirm our
unshakable commitment to Israel's security; and this time to
fulfill the pledge I made at the Wye talks to speak with the people
of Israel and the Palestinians about the benefits of peace,''
Clinton said. ``The United States will walk this road with Israel
every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, breaking from English for an unexpected passage in
Hebrew, denounced Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat's
quest for Palestinian statehood. The Palestinians have embraced
Clinton's visits to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as a step
toward acknowledging an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader, whose decision to sign the Wye River
Memorandum in October angered members of his coalition and may
bring down his government in two weeks, said the accord ``means
that our partners must honor the agreements with deeds and not only
with promises that all too often prove empty; with implementation,
not with signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This also means that our partners must totally and permanently
discard incitement, violence and terrorism. Above all, our partners
must realize that genuine peace can only be achieved through
negotiations, not through unilateral attempts to decide issues
which can only be settled by mutual consent,'' he said, referring
to statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here as part of an agreement in October at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland that he would address both Israelis and
Palestinians. The Wye River agreement called for further Israeli
troop withdrawals from the West Bank in return for security
guarantees for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, the accord appears troubled as Palestinians protest
Israel's refusal to release political prisoners. Israelis, in turn,
have postponed further troop withdrawals from the West Bank and the
situation seems again at a standstill. Violence repeatedly has
flared in the West Bank in recent days. Arafat also angered some
Israelis by announcing he would declare a Palestinian state in May.
</P>
<P>
   Many right-wing Israelis object to Clinton's visit here and to
the Palestinian territories. Some posters portray Clinton in a
black and white kaffiyeh similar to the headdress worn by Arafat.
But in Palestinian controlled areas, the president's visit is being
hailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Palestine,'' said many posters in Bethlehem. Police
tore down signs around Clinton's hotel referring to his affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will address Israeli youth tonight (Sunday) here. On
Monday, he will speak to the Palestinian National Council in Gaza
City as it affirms removal of passages in its charter calling for
Israel's destruction. On Tuesday, Clinton will tour Holy Land sites
before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that for two peoples who are fated to share this
land, peace is not simply an option among many, but the only choice
that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and
sorrow,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   His visit to the troubled region sparked a remarkable display of
security as Israel put 10,000 police onto its streets. Soldiers
with automatic weapons slung casually over their shoulders
patrolled the streets around Clinton's hotel, even though Hamas,
the Palestinian terrorist group, pledged to give Clinton safe
passage.
</P>
<P>
   The oddly timed trip came as not only Netanyahu was fighting for
his political life but Clinton's fate also was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   As Air Force One landed in Tel Aviv, the House Judiciary
Committee in Washington was debating a resolution to censure the
president for lying about a sexual affair with a White House
intern. The resolution later failed, but the committee already had
approved four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on board Air Force One with Clinton were Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. If the dramatic issue
of impeachment was weighing on Clinton's mind it wasn't showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wonderful. He's fine. He's in apparent good spirits,''
said Specter, who prefers having Clinton prosecuted after leaving
office instead of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also said it was important that Clinton be seen as
still in charge and that foreign policy was not being crippled by
the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, one of about two dozen undecided Republican moderates,
said he had not discussed the issue with Clinton. Lazio said it was
``up to him to raise the issue if he wants to speak to me. I'm not
looking for it (an impeachment conversation) and I'm not going to
ask for it.'' &QL;

FINAL DEFEAT FOR DEMOCRATS AS WEARY COMMITTEE RETIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; nearly total rewrite.)  
 (ATTN: Wis., Fla., Mass., Calif., N.Y., Ga., N.C.)  (lh) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democrats on the impeachment committee agonized
in their final defeat Saturday night, accusing Republicans of
attempting a legislative coup and seeing their hopes for the
Scarlet C, as in censure, rebuffed as the alternative to removing
President Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we'd come to this,'' Thomas Barrett, D-Wis.,
sadly admitted as he offered the motion to censure ``my president''
as a man deserving the ``condemnation of the American people'' for
his sex-and-mendacity scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides clashed in a final burst of exhausting debate. In
the day's result, the Republican majority turned back the censure
motion as toothless and completed their crossing of the impeachment
Rubicon: A party-line vote approved the last charges of high crimes
and misdemeanors, triggering the full House's return next week for
the historic decision of whether to have the Senate put the
president on trial for removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``By golly he deserves it,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.,
offering a blunt coda to the House Judiciary Committee majority's
resolve to see Clinton banished.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was completed at 6:23 p.m., to a smattering of
audience applause and a quiet, weary observation from the chairman,
Henry Hyde of Illinois, that the committee ``slips into history''
to await the floor impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Democrats' pleas for censure as a more popular
remedy, the Republicans insisted to the end that impeachment was
the only way to deal with ``a president who sees truth as the mere
plaything of his imagination.'' Clinton had indeed left ``a wound''
on the nation to ``fester in history,'' the Democrats conceded, as
they failed in their pleas for some middle-ground mercy.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours of a punishing legislative exercise, the
Democrats' confidence that they can defeat impeachment on the House
floor next week clearly was fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Dr. Ruth is getting ready,'' said Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., warning that the Senate trial would see a parade of
witnesses offering gloss on the seamy details of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body politic doesn't want that to happen,'' Howard Berman,
D-Calif., told the committee. Barrett fairly prayed for a public
awakening. ``They've hit the snooze button,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment committee eased into its final day with a sense
of political hangover, a somber wistfulness at having irrevocably
done the deed. Members quietly sipped coffee in the hearing room
doorways and munched muffins at their microphones on a gray day,
awaiting the Republicans' approval of the final article of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with members looking depleted as they headed into
the night, the Democrats talking of a last-ditch hope to see House
speaker-designate Bob Livingston end his aloofness on the issue and
let a censure debate be added next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking all week about the proceedings was a Democratic warning
that the Republicans may be putting their House majority on the
line in the next election by pressing the unpopular impeachment
vote. ``Beware,'' the Republicans were cautioned by Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif. ``Next election, the voters will be out to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite moments when the ghost of Richard Nixon was summoned
forth, the bluntest distinction between Watergate and the move to
impeach President Clinton was stated by Howard Coble, R-N.C., who
noted that the Republicans are in the congressional majority this
time, while the Democrats were in 1974. ``It's a lot easier to
throw grenades than to catch them,'' Coble said with some
satisfaction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the president's fate on the table, ceremonial gavels moved
with the fleetness of tap dancers through the impeachment
proceeding: A brief rap or two for a new gavel, then on to the next
one, and the next, for fresh history needs fresh souvenirs. In the
eyes of Democrats, these symbolic hammers of law and order,
however, had a macabre aspect in being brandished at a far grimmer
event, the committee's presidential impeachment, so an explanation
was in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are to be given to people for what purpose I don't
know,'' Hyde lightly announced. Privately, Democrats grimly joked
they might serve as prizes at Republican fund-raising dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The avuncular chairman remained unflappable through the
legislative ordeal and was widely praised at the end. ``We're
nearing the end, folks, let's take a deep breath,'' he announced,
as if he were driving a school bus through a maelstrom with a
partisan spitball fight being waged about him.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote rejecting censure seemed to restoke passions for
the looming floor debate. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., complained that
the House would face ``moral blackmail'' if the floor choice
presented members with ``impeachment or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Barr, R-Ga., who first proposed Clinton's impeachment,
said the censure motion, with its oblique language that the
president ``wrongly took steps to delay the discovery of the
truth,'' read like the product of group therapy, not Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a feel-good session,'' Barr snapped, urging
Congress to reject censure and rely on impeachment. ``Let's do
it.''

TWO PARTIES PLOT STRATEGY TO INFLUENCE PUBLIC, UNDECIDED LAWMAKERS
IN IMPEACHMENT BATTLE
<TEXT>
<P>

   c. 1998

<P>
   Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a high-stakes impeachment showdown headed for
the House floor this week, Republicans have begun playing down the
impact of the historic vote, as Democrats escalated warnings of the
dire consequences of ousting the president.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing strategies, which were in evidence during the
Judiciary Committee's final deliberations Saturday, were aimed at
convincing undecided lawmakers and influencing a public that has
grown weary of the scandal and for the most part opposes the
president's removal.
</P>
<P>
   The full House consideration of impeachment, scheduled to begin
Thursday, will be decided by a handful of Republican moderates who
represent districts Clinton captured in his presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Judiciary Committee approved the fourth and final
article of impeachment, the panel's Republicans tried to reassure
those undecided lawmakers who may be nervous about upsetting the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that a House approval of impeachment only meant the
matter was being sent to the Senate for a trial. It takes a
two-thirds vote to remove the president, which is considered
unlikely in Clinton's case.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R- Ill., bristled at Democrats'
suggestion that the House impeachment vote meant that the moving
vans would be arriving at the White House any day now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you imply we are kicking him out of office you go too
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., even suggested that if the Senate
convicted Clinton, it might decide to let him remain in office.
Such action is prohibited by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats, seeking to arouse voters opposed to
impeachment but who appear to be more focused on Christmas shopping
than the president's fate, stepped up their warnings that House
Republicans are on the verge of doing something drastic and harmful
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not sending the Senate a questionnaire,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., ``We are beginning the process of throwing
the president out of office. We are beginning the process of
undoing the last election.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to insist that the only way out of the mess
was for the House to approve a censure resolution, a course that
polls show is favored by the majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee Republicans rejected such a resolution,
arguing that it was not tough enough punishment for a president who
they claimed repeatedly committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The debate and vote on censure broke down along the same
partisan lines as the other actions of a committee that has been
bitterly polarized since the day it commenced the impeachment
probe.
</P>
<P>
   And while many politicians predicted that for impeachment to be
accepted by voters it had to eventually win bipartisan backing, it
appears that the upcoming House debate and vote will be as divisive
and partisan as the committee deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believed that with Republican losses in the
midterm election and polls as recently as Saturday showing that as
many as 60 percent of Americans oppose impeachment that the GOP
would back off.
</P>
<P>
   However, spurred on by its most conservative members, the House
GOP has pressed forward with its impeachment drive. Political
observers say the national polls do not accurately reflect the
lawmakers' sentiment in part because they represent heavily
Republican districts which are supportive of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, many Republicans are scared that a vote against
impeachment will open them up to primary challenges. When one GOP
lawmaker, Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., said last week that he would
vote against impeachment, a conservative in his district
immediately announced he would challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including a number of prominent Republicans outside
of Washington, have argued that the impeachment pursuit has hurt
the GOP because it is increasingly alienating voters.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki, a leader among the moderate
Republicans, recently announced he supported censure over
impeachment, arguing ``I really want to see Congress focus on
issues that affect people's lives as opposed to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats believe that their only hope for stopping
impeachment is if a ground swell of public opposition materializes
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   While the impeachment hearings have riveted the nation's
capital, they have failed to stir Americans in the way the
Watergate hearings did almost a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The three major networks largely ignored the proceedings last
week, with network executives citing public indifference and the
belief that the Senate would not convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Watergate, which sparked passionate demonstrations in
front of the White House, the current impeachment procedure has
produced only scattered protests.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday only a handful of demonstrators advocating Clinton's
impeachment marched in front of the White House. But they were
largely ignored by the tourists roaming the lawns and having their
pictures taken in front of the historic home of the president.
</P>
<P>
   David Rizzo, visiting from Tampa, said he wasn't terribly
interested in the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to listen to us,'' he said. Rizzo added that
while the impeachment didn't affect him personally, he feared that
kicking the president out could ``really throw a monkey wrench into
a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Cheryl Smith, also of Tampa, said she believed the
inquiry was a ``waste of taxpayer money.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she didn't believe the president should be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be different if he was doing a lousy job,'' she said.
``But the economy is good.''

NFL WEARS SALARY CAP RIGHT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aside from insurance salesmen who dress up as referees every
weekend, aside from widening commercial breaks that destroy the
flow of the game, the NFL has it right.
</P>
<P>
   And aside from the natural evolution of talent, it is the only
major professional league that is better today than in the previous
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that a hard salary cap is the only way to save sports.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday, three teams in the NFC are vying for the last
wild card entry. In the AFC, nine teams are above .500, with four
of six playoff slots up for grabs. For all the mediocrity, the
drama of competition still lives. Merely the reason you watch
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, baseball is spiraling out of control. The NBA is
getting sucked into the same vortex. And while the NHL might be on
solid ice, there's no doubt it has lost some of its roots.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Rupert Murdoch one-upped the rest of the fat cat
frat, purchasing the most expensive toy in the neighborhood. His
Los Angeles Dollars produced the first $100 million player, the
exclamation point on a league fast becoming a joke.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago when small markets had a chance in
baseball. The Minnesota Twins won two championships. The Kansas
City Royals won a World Series and lost a World Series. Even the
Milwaukee Brewers reached the pinnacle, losing to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   For a glorious while, in nearly every locale, the rite of spring
training flourished. The giddy belief that your team was going to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, everything is neatly ordained. In 1998, if you didn't have
a payroll over $47 million, you didn't make the playoffs. With the
exception of the Blue Jays, you had to spend more than $46 million
just to break .500, which 15 teams did not.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 20 cities, or 67 percent of the league, knows their
teams have no chance entering next season. Hideous facts that
qualify as a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is at the same crossroads. Currently, small-market teams
such as Utah and Indiana still are in the mix. But if there is no
cap on high-end salaries soon, the league will have the same
division of classes.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors that the lockout might end by Christmas, and
hopefully, the players union is beginning to represent its masses.
Nearly 20 percent of the league is making the NBA minimum. And
they're all fighting for Stephon Marbury's right to make $100
million, so David Falk's commission doesn't take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is ridiculous, aptly described by a Chicago
columnist as two limousines fighting for one parking spot. But if
the current system prevails, the financial heavyweights will
eventually gobble up the best players. The middle class will
disappear. The small markets will get by at the cost of
competition. The NBA will become baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the owners must win this fight.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's problem is more about feel, the melody and not the
lyrics. It is about the declining Canadian influence, a country
that treats hockey with a respect and passion that most Americans
can never comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, eight of 21 teams belonged to Canada, at least one in
each division. While the NHL has expanded by six teams, it has lost
two Canadian cities. And now, four of six divisions are
all-American.
</P>
<P>
   So while the league is thriving as a whole, it has lost some of
its fervor, its clash of borders and cultures. All of the
mysteries, traditions and codes of chivalry that somehow weave
together the undeniable allure of hockey were born in Canada. But
now, their teams just can't compete economically. Not like they
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Three more U.S. teams will join the league in the next two
years, and the Canadian influence will shrink from 39 percent to 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, if we can't beat you, we'll buy you out. So thank you
for the players. And sorry about the corporate takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't that America?
</P>
<P>
   So be thankful this weekend that for all its warts and blown
calls, the NFL has a hard cap that every team can afford. And not
coincidentally, a system that still works. &QL;

ASTRONAUTS' FINAL SPACEWALK PAVES WAY FOR MAY'S MISSION
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By MARK CARREAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Spacewalking Endeavour astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman floated
outside the first components of the new international space station
on Saturday, preparing the towering spacecraft for the shuttle's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   The tasks took the two men 76 feet above Endeavour's cargo bay,
where the first two modules of the station jutted eight stories
into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' exclaimed Ross at one point, as he gazed at the sun
rising over Russia. ``Fantastic blues on the horizon, man.''
</P>
<P>
   During the near seven-hour excursion, the two men freed a jammed
guidance antenna, stowed construction tools and snapped photographs
documenting last week's assembly work. The walk was the third for
the duo since the shuttle crew linked the new station's American
Unity and Russian Zarya modules on Dec. 6. It was the mission's
final spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The Endeavour crew was prepared to undock from the first modules
of the new station today, leaving the 75-foot-long, 70,000-pound
orbital complex unstaffed in Earth orbit. The shuttle's 12-day
station-assembly flight is scheduled to end Tuesday night with a
landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's spacewalk was considered the lowest priority of the
mission's three excursions, conducted primarily to lighten the
workload for a pair of spacewalkers on the next shuttle-station
assembly flight in May.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalk's most dramatic moments occurred as the two
astronauts scaled the modules to install a hand rail near the
summit of the towering structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the snow on the mountains below,'' said Ross as they
flew 248 miles over China. ``Not very often you get to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Working cherry-picker style from the tip of the shuttle's long
robot arm earlier in the excursion, Ross used a 10-foot-long
boat-hook tool to free a 4-foot-long guidance-system antenna on the
Russian module. Newman performed a similar task during Wednesday's
spacewalk. Both antennas had failed to deploy after Zarya's Nov. 20
launch from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Ross poked at the antenna, which was coiled like a tape measure,
more than a dozen times with the boat hook before it sprung free.
</P>
<P>
   The two men began their final spacewalk at 2:33 p.m., CST, by
lugging an ice-chest-size bag with nearly two dozen wrenches,
ratchets, foot restraints and power-tool attachments to the docking
assembly separating the two modules. Ross lashed the tool bag in
place, staging the implements for use by the May shuttle crew.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Newman were to complete the excursion late Saturday
with brief test flights of the back-mounted jet packs worn as a
rescue device.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the spacewalking astronauts are double-tethered to the
structure of the station or the tip of the robot arm as they work.
The jet packs would provide a sort of ``parachute,'' a means for
spacewalkers to steer themselves back to the station if both safety
lines were to snap.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's test flight was to be conducted with the two men
tethered in the shuttle's payload bay. During a similar test in
1997, a valve that allows the nitrogen gas fuel to reach the
thrusters on the jet pack failed to open.

BIG SHOW SIGNALS CHANGE  
 PLUMMER'S DEBUT PUT CARDS IN HIS CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Fourteen months ago, Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer ran into his first NFL regular-season huddle and
immediately took charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `No more (expletive) around,' '' center Mike Devlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Who did this pencil-neck rookie think he was, thought some of
the veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, he announces, `We're going to take this down and score,'
'' Devlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were 98 yards from the Philadelphia Eagles' end
zone, hadn't scored a touchdown through three quarters and had
gained only 96 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer made good on his prediction, one of the most dramatic
debuts in the franchise's 100-year history. The Cardinals return to
Philadelphia today to play the Eagles, Plummer's opening act still
fresh on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The more the veterans thought about Plummer's remarks in the
huddle, the more they liked it. ``We needed something,'' offensive
tackle Lomas Brown said. ``We were at the point of being desperate.
We needed any spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rob Moore listened and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the huddle jacked up and was yelling a whole
bunch of stuff,'' Moore said. ``He believed he could take it down
and score, and we needed that (attitude).''
</P>
<P>
   There was 10:26 left in the fourth quarter when Coach Vince
Tobin sent Plummer into the Oct. 19, 1997 game to replace Stoney
Case, who made his first start.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin told Plummer while the defense was on the field that he
was going to put him in the game on the next offensive series. &QL; 
Here, go 98 yards
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made the decision to put Jake in, I didn't envision it
would be at the 2-yard line,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer wasn't nervous about his pro debut. But he, too, didn't
expect to start with such poor field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of amazing I was actually getting a shot,'' he
said. ``It didn't really sink in until afterwards. But I just had
to go out and play. We were down to our third (quarterback) and no
one was really expecting much from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 2-yard line, the best-case scenario would be to drive
for a touchdown. The next best thing would be to get a little
yardage for the punter.
</P>
<P>
   Facing his first third-down situation, Plummer ran around right
end for five yards and a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he was cool as a cucumber,'' fullback Larry Centers
said. ``Then he scrambles for that first down, and I said, `You're
bad. You're a bad dude.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `I am, ain't I?' I thought, `That cocky rookie.' As
long as he was making first downs, I didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer missed his first three passes before hitting Moore for a
34-yard gain to the Eagles 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling that our future had come a little early,''
Moore said. ``I was just happy to be along for the ride.'' &QL; 
Sack, sack, touchdown
</P>
<P>
   Plummer got sacked on the next play. In fact, the Eagles were
blitzing him almost every passing down. But then he completed a
16-yard pass to Centers to the Eagles' 30.
</P>
<P>
   He got sacked again, and after an eight-yard completion to wide
receiver Frank Sanders, the Cardinals faced third and 11 at the
Eagles 31.
</P>
<P>
   The play-call in the huddle was a slant pattern by wide receiver
Kevin Williams, who caught Plummer's pass about the 25 and outraced
two defenders to the end zone for a 31-yard score. Joe Nedney's
extra point gave the Cardinals a 10-7 lead with 3:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first touchdown pass is something obviously you're real
proud of, especially where I'd come from and everything,'' Plummer
said. ``It was a big moment for me and a big moment for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer had driven the Cardinals 98 yards in 14 plays, using
more than seven minutes of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd actually do it,'' Brown said of Plummer
making good on his prediction. ``A young guy being put in a
situation like that in such hostile territory, it was so gutsy.''
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't have been surprised had they done their homework
on Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore at Boise Capital High School, he drove the team
to a 96-yard score on his first possession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he made his first appearance at Arizona State as a
freshman against Utah at Sun Devil Stadium. His first pass went for
a 78-yard score. &QL; 
Some kind of rookie
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see (Plummer's 98-yard drive against the Eagles), but
I remember hearing about it,'' said free safety Pat Tillman, who
was a senior at ASU at the time. ``I know rookies don't normally do
that, but Jake's an exceptional guy. Some people have it; some
don't. He has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Rose Bowl year, we knew if we needed points, he was going
to get them. If we had any chance in hell, he'd get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, vice president/player personnel of the Cardinals,
had preached in meetings before the 1997 draft that Plummer had a
chance to be a special player because of his intangibles, including
comeback ability. He remembers talking about Plummer in one meeting
for 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Plummer became the first NFL quarterback to take his
team more than 66 yards for a score on his opening possession,
Ferguson got emotional in the press box at Philadelphia's Veterans
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited because that was the kind of thing we hoped he
could do on a regular basis,'' Ferguson said. ``It was storybook,
but the ending can be storybook, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were some questions about this kid (physically).
But everybody said a horse (Seattle Slew) was too short. But all he
did was win the Triple Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense couldn't hold on in regulation and allowed
Philadelphia to go 59 yards in 11 plays to tie the score on Chris
Boniol's 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, the Cardinals won the toss, and Plummer went right
to work. On first down, he ran for 18 yards to the Eagles 40. But
then a questionable intentional grounding call forced the Cardinals
into a second-and-27 situation.
</P>
<P>
   On third and 18, Plummer had Moore wide open. ``We still should
have won the game,'' Plummer said. ``People forget that I missed
Rob on a hook route and threw it short.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Cardinals punted, the Eagles needed only six plays to
go 73 yards for a game-winning field goal. It was the Cardinals'
fifth loss in a row, but Plummer's performance overshadowed
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The following Tuesday, he was named the starter and has been in
every game since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll have 98 more of those before it's over,''
Ferguson said of Plummer's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin said there has been some revisionist history in
discussing the 98-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legend has grown such that some think he (Plummer) really
wasn't actually there,'' Devlin said. &QL;

ONE STATISTIC TELLS IT ALL: REBOUNDS LEAD TO A ROUT

<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ It is easy to overlook amid all of the
running and pressing. After all, open-court steals and breakaway
baskets are more eye-catching than a proper box-out.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not St. John's speed and pressure that Virginia Coach
Pete Gillen raved about after the Red Storm routed his Cavaliers
Saturday 95-68. Instead, he gushed about St. John's brute strength
under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just manhandled us on the boards,'' said Gillen, who is
in his first year at Virginia. ``It was unbelievable. It was just
men playing against young men. Tyrone Grant is a tough, hard-nosed
kid. He's just a monster. We had nobody to compete with that. The
boards was just a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillen, whose young club was dropped violently to 6-4, was not
exaggerating. The rebounding columns of the final box score forced
one to rub his eyes and take a second look. With no one taller than
6 feet 8 inches playing more than eight minutes, St. John's grabbed
a remarkable 31 offensive rebounds, 4 more than Virginia had on
both ends of the court. Grant had 16 rebounds, to go with 19
points. All told, the Red Storm had 58 rebounds, making its 45.6
shooting percentage irrelevant. An errant shot was simply retrieved
and put in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of very lively legs and a lot of very aggressive
guys,'' said St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis, whose club averages 12
more rebounds a game than its opponents. ``They take it serious
when we tell them that there's a big Whopper or something up on the
rim, go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's (8-2) is starting to get some national attention.
After being left out of the preseason polls, the Red Storm drew
whispers after almost defeating Stanford and Purdue. Now that it
has ripped 20th-ranked Pittsburgh, which lost to top-ranked
Connecticut Saturday by a point, and driven a team from the
Atlantic Coast Conference out of its own packed gymnasium, it will
likely move from 18th into the top 15. Gillen, who got a solid
25-point performance from freshman Chris Williams, says the Red
Storm should rise even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a top 10 team,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Gillen knew before the game that St. John's was tough, the
crowd of 8,394 _ which matched the Cavaliers' largest home crowd
since 1995 _ had its hopes up. But six minutes before halftime, the
Red Storm began pounding on those hopes like so many would-be
Cavaliers rebounders.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding off its crowd and playing emotionally _ as evidenced by
the two first-half technical fouls and subsequent ejection of
Cavaliers guard Chezley Watson _ Virginia was tied with St. John's
at 25-25. But just like that, the Red Storm scored 22 of the final
29 points of the half to go ahead 47-32. The Cavaliers pulled
within 11 points twice early in the second half, but the margin
began growing enormously after that.
</P>
<P>
   The game-turning run started rather strangely, with a missed
breakaway dunk by Red Storm guard Bootsy Thornton (19 points).
After missing the two-handed attempt, Thornton, who has not dunked
all year, grabbed the rebound and had a shot rejected, then grabbed
another rebound and missed. Usually, a play like that sparks an
opponent, but this time it sparked St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bootsy is an old-time player,'' Jarvis said. ``The closer he
stays to the ground the better. You don't do things in the game
that you don't do in practice, and I haven't seen him dunk all year
in practice. It was out of character for him. But the miss, I
think, helped get the rest of our players motivated because it went
away from the character of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more motivated than Thornton, who sank a 3-pointer on
the Red Storm's next possession. Ron Artest, who led St. John's
with 20 points and four blocked shots, took over from there,
swatting away a Cavaliers' attempt, hustling downcourt and hitting
a 3-pointer on the other end to make it 31-25. Then the 6-6 forward
blocked another shot, which led to a layup by Thornton off a
beautiful pass from Erick Barkley (12 points, seven assists).
</P>
<P>
   When Artest opened the second half with a 3-pointer to put St.
John's up by 18, the rout was on.

UCLA HUSTLES PAST UNLV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The game began with aerial acrobatics and
exhilarating alley-oops, as these December duels often do. But it
ended quite differently _ on the floor, with a slap, a scoop and a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA freshman forward JaRon Rush knew it, too. He knew the easy
baskets would disappear, the large lead would diminish and the
decisive plays would come at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   So he waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the hustle points were going to matter,'' Rush
said after UCLA's 72-67 victory over Nevada-Las Vegas on Saturday
before 9,855 at Pauley Pavilion. ``My jumper wasn't falling, and
when that happens I try to go to the basket, get offensive
rebounds, get points that way. That's how you win games, with the
hustle points.''
</P>
<P>
   With 40 seconds remaining and the Bruins leading 68-67, Rush
slapped the ball from UNLV's Kevin Simmons as Simmons charged into
the heart of UCLA's defense. Baron Davis grabbed the loose ball,
was fouled, and made two free throws for a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rush wasn't done. With 10 seconds left and UCLA leading 70-67,
he beat two Rebels to a loose ball, scooped it up and scored from
under the basket to secure the victory. Simple as that _ a slap, a
scoop and a smile, jumpers and dunks need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved UCLA's record to 5-2 and moved the Bruins
one win closer to the 18 or 19 they'll need for an NCAA Tournament
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to recent seasons, when veteran UCLA teams could
count on 12 to 14 conference wins to pad the total, this year holds
no guarantees _ what with the most competitive Pac-10 in memory and
a lineup of freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will be heavily favored in their remaining December
games (Cal State Northridge, American, Loyola Marymount) and should
enter Pac-10 play with an 8-2 mark. What happens after that is
anyone's guess _ they could win 12 Pac-10 games or they could win
eight, such are the inconsistencies of youth. But each victory this
month increases their margin for error down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get satisfied,'' sophomore forward Travis Reed said.
``That's what happened (Saturday). We got that big lead and we got
satisfied. We got ahead early and thought we'd roll over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush's play typified UCLA. He started with a burst as the Bruins
built a 20-6 lead, then lapsed into a prolonged funk of fatigue and
frustration. Despite the double-digit deficit, UNLV never wavered
from its zone defense, and it slowly smothered the hard-charging
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels dominated the middle 20 minutes, outscoring UCLA
38-12 and building a 13-point lead with 13 minutes remaining.
UCLA's athleticism and energy gave way to its inexperience with
sloppy ballhandling, ill-timed shots and lethargic defense.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rush _ and the Bruins _ snapped out of it, using their best
defense of the season to hold UNLV without a field goal for 10
minutes. The frenzy on defense became efficiency on offense. Earl
Watson atoned for sloppy ballhandling with two 3-point shots during
UCLA's game-changing charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins tied it with five minutes left on Davis' dunk and
took their first lead of the second half with 1:57 remaining on Dan
Gadzuric's free throw. The rest was left to Rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a way of making it interesting,'' Bruins
coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's hustle points aside, the other lasting impression was
Davis _ or, rather, Davis' influence on Watson. When he's on the
bench and Watson must run the offense, the Bruins stagnate. When
Davis takes charge and Watson moves to the wing, where he can roam
and create without ballhandling responsibilities, the Bruins are at
their best.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that Watson's crucial 3-pointers came
from the left wing, on feeds from Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something Earl didn't look to do last year, but he's a
good offensive player,'' Davis said. ``We need him to be aggressive
for us to win.''

SELECTIVE SERVICE OR FICKLE FLOP?  
 DESPITE CRITICS, BCS BRINGS SANITY TO BOWLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Its family tree can be traced to 1991, when
something called the Bowl Coalition was formed. That begat the Bowl
Alliance in 1994, which has produced the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your point of view, the BCS, which debuted this
season, is either a brilliant idea produced by great thinkers or
the ugly byproduct of an antiquated system.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the bowls and conference officials have
tried to devise a system that would ensure the health of the bowl
system while pacifying those who have cried for a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   It's debatable whether their latest invention is working.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents point to this season's Fiesta Bowl, where No. 1
Tennessee will play No. 2 Florida State on Jan. 4, as proof that
the system works. The winner of that game surely will be the
consensus national champion, and the last few weeks of the season
have never been more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents point out that there easily could be have been three
undefeated teams this year, meaning one would have been left out of
a so-called title game. And, they say, there are at least six other
teams in the Top 10 that deserve a shot at the national title at
least as much as the once-beaten Seminoles do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things worked out for us; we were lucky,'' Florida State Coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``And yet, there are several other teams who
probably deserve to be in there as much as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first year of the Bowl Championship Series, which
was formed when the Rose Bowl joined the system, assuring that the
Pac-10 and Big Ten champions would be available to play in a
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS agreement involves four bowls _ the Fiesta, Sugar,
Orange and Rose _ and guarantees berths to six conferences _ the
Atlantic Coast, the Big East, Big 12, Southeastern, Big Ten and
Pac-10 _ and, in some cases, Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS agreement is for four years, with an option for three
more.
</P>
<P>
   A formula comprised of the two polls, strength of schedule,
record and the average of three computer polls was devised to
determine the top two teams that would meet at one of the bowls on
a rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
   When the formula was announced, officials cautioned that its
only intent was to identify the top two teams in the country. The
other three bowls were still free to make their own match-ups after
conference tie-ins were honored.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations of the system grew during the first season. As
perceived flaws were detected, the cry for a playoff system became
louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't designed to do all the things we thought it would
do,'' said Jim Livengood, Arizona's athletic director. ``We thought
it would be able to make coffee and straighten up furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   What it wasn't able to do was overcome the inherent unfairness
of bowl games, which have always existed to provide intriguing
match-ups, sell tickets and bring tourists to town. The bowls'
mission hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the national title game, the main goal of the other
games is to fill seats and provide an entertaining game. It's not
about matching up the No. 3 and No. 4 teams in the country, or
making sure No. 5 team (this year, Arizona) is assured of a spot in
a major bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar and Orange bowls were free to take two at-large teams,
Ohio State and Florida, even though both were ranked behind No. 3
Kansas State. And even though Florida has two losses, one more than
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   There was no joy in Manhattan, Kan., when the Wildcats were left
out of BCS bowls, which pay each team about $13 million, and ended
up in the Alamo Bowl, which pays about $1 million to each team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I would start thinking more of a championship format of an
eight-team playoff than I would have, say, one week ago,'' Kansas
State President Jon Wefald told reporters Monday. ``Based on the
numbers of calls I've had (from the media), I think people feel
that we got hosed. When something like that happens, sometimes
reform gets in the air, so we'll have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, there was no expression of outrage from the Wildcats last
year, when the Fiesta Bowl passed over UCLA and North Carolina to
take Kansas State, which was ranked lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process that helped Kansas State last year maybe hurt them
this year,'' said John Junker, the executive director of the Fiesta
Bowl. ``I tend to look at our business over a period of years. No
matter what we say about the system, the greatest rewards go to
those who win the most and the latest.''
</P>
<P>
   That, critics maintain, is one reason why there should be a
playoff. Why should Florida State, beaten by North Carolina State
in September, have a shot at a national title when Kansas State,
which lost in double overtime in the Big 12 title game, does not?
</P>
<P>
   ``An early loss is less troublesome to people, and I don't think
that will ever change, no matter what the format,'' Junker said.
``That's just human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Bowden and Livengood, thinks the BCS system
has brought college football closer to a playoff. But that doesn't
mean a playoff is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much sentiment among college presidents for
extending the season, said Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen, even
though it's done at other levels of NCAA football.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA studied the playoff issue a few years ago but rejected
it. One big factor is that the players on the study committee, Rob
Zatechka of Nebraska and Derrick Brooks of Florida State, said
athletes would want to share in the money the venture was sure to
make.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drove people away from it,'' Hansen said. ``If you were
only paying players who participated, how do you stop the horrible
inequity for the teams that get in every year? It would take the
first coach about a tenth of a second to say, `We're going to pay a
lot more money than the other team you're considering because we're
going to be in the eight-team playoff.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If you spread the money throughout Division I-A college
football, that might cause problems among a school's athletes, some
of whom were getting paid and some who weren't, Livengood said.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula and selection process is likely to undergo a
lengthy review process in the off-season. Some officials think the
automatic berths for conference champions should be reviewed. It's
unfair, they say, that this year's Big East champion, 18th-ranked
Syracuse, is playing in a BCS bowl when Kansas State and Arizona
are not.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula itself also will be examined. For example, some
people think the three computer rankings carry too much weight. But
it likely will be only a tuneup. Love or hate it, the BCS won't be
going away any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's a system that, whether or not we say it's perfect,
all the parties have agreed will be followed,'' Junker said. ``That
allows for a little sanity in the process that was missing 10 years
ago. It is a better system than has been employed in the past.''

AFC EAST, PLAYOFFS GET NEW LOOK WITH DO-OVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upon further review, these plays don't stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vaulting''  &UR; Vinny Testaverde, who apparently has learned to
crawl after he runs, is down at the 1-yard line, preserving the
Seahawks' victory over the New York Jets last week.
</P>
<P>
   New England wide receiver  &UR; Shawn Jefferson's fourth-down catch
on the sideline against Buffalo two weeks ago is out of bounds,
allowing the Bills to hold on for the win and saving team owner
 &UR; Ralph Wilson $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is awarded the ball in overtime when running back
 &UR; Jerome Bettis calls ``tails.'' The Steelers score on their first
drive and beat the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   So these corrections in the NFL standings should be made: Miami
and Buffalo now lead the AFC East with 9-4 records. The Jets are
8-5 and New England is 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh improves to 8-5, putting the Steelers in the AFC
playoffs if the season were to end today.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're doing do-overs, here are some other wrongs that can
be corrected this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas drafts Marshall wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss instead of
North Carolina defensive end  &UR; Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cutting him, Carolina tells quarterback  &UR; Kerry
Collins to stand in the corner until he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Referee  &UR; Phil Luckett is sent to NFL Europe, formerly known as
the World League, until he masters the coin toss and learns that a
player doesn't score until he crosses the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has another vote for its nickname and choose any name
except Titans. &QL; 
Don't you dare &QL; 
Don't even suggest to Tampa Bay Coach  &UR; Tony Dungy that that league
bring back instant replay for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He is opposed to changing the rules ``in midstream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can change intentional grounding,'' Dungy said,
sarcastically. ``Maybe we can play with 12 men instead of 11. If
they put it in for the playoffs, I'd throw a fit if I was Seattle.
I'd say, `Why didn't you put replay in the week before our Jets
game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be retroactive. Why wait for the playoffs. Everybody
knew the ramifications of no replay when they voted that way. You
can't say there's been too much pass interference, so we're going
to change the rules for the playoffs.'' &QL; 
Clouded vision &QL; 
The headlines in the New York papers after Testaverde's phantom
touchdown were classic. The back page of the ``New York Post''
tabloid said, ``GOD'S A JET FAN.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``New York Daily News'' said, ``CLOSE ENOUGH.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsday,'' sympathizing with the Seahawks, said, ``They Wuz
Robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not all of the Jets players agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson thinks Testaverde actually
scored. ``Television can do a lot of different things,'' he said.
``I think the referee actually saw Vinny's right hand go over the
goal line with the ball in it. Then when the players pushing guys
back in the pile, you can't get a true feeling right there.
Television cameras, for some reason, didn't see exactly what we
saw. We saw a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde still thinks he scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the angle of the slow-motion replay, you would think that
I was down just short of the goal line,'' he said. ``But if they
had a camera on the goal line looking from one flat to the other,
and I'm taking the word of some of my teammates, you'd see a
different view of where the ball was.'' &QL; 
Superstitious &QL; 
Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells, whose team plays at Miami today, might
be the most superstitious NFL coach of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He had dentist appointments on three consecutive Tuesday
mornings earlier this season, each preceding a victory. So on the
fourth straight Tuesday, he went to the dentist again ``even though
I didn't need anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had his teeth cleaned, and the Jets went on to win
their fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat there _ same chair, same time,'' Parcells said.
``But then the Colts beat us so I didn't have to go anymore.'' &QL; 
Overworked? &QL; 
Defensive lineman  &UR; Joe Phillips is the latest member of the St.
Louis Rams to complain about the grueling practices of Coach  &UR; Dick
Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said last week that Vermeil's training camp was
``abusive,'' joining former teammates  &UR; Leslie O'Neal and  &UR; Craig
Heyward in criticizing the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil doesn't think his practices are abusive but acknowledges
that they're ``very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   No team practices longer than the Rams' three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are responding,'' one Rams player said. ``The response is
we're 3-10.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Rams player recently asked of the team, ``How are
things at the slave factory?'' &QL; 
Beer bath &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Steelers fan was so upset with quarterback  &UR; Kordell Stewart
last week that he dumped beer on Stewart's head as he ran off the
field last Sunday at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was enraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's agitating walking off the field and people throwing beer
on you and saying this, that and other,'' Stewart said. ``I've
never had that happen to me in my life.'' &QL; 
Short people &QL; 
When Buffalo Bills quarterback  &UR; Doug Flutie was at a recent
autograph show, a woman came up to him and presented him with
Flutie's original NFL scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   The first two words on the report were ``extremely small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it went into all the superlatives after that,'' Flutie
said. ``I'm thinking, `If you have all these superlatives, then why
is being too small an issue.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known the game from my perspective all my life. I've
never played the game at 6-2. I don't know what it's like to be
6-2. I've been successful at this game in whatever league I've been
in, and I have to do things the way I do them.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
Without  &UR; Deion Sanders, the Cowboys have given up six touchdown
passes and 598 passing yards in losses to Minnesota and New Orleans
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There's hope for the Detroit Lions on Monday night in San
Francisco. They are 1-8 on Sunday afternoon and 4-0 on Thursdays,
Monday nights and Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre's six fumbles at Tampa last
Monday night make him the team's all-time leader with 67.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are 4-2 since their bye week, the third-best record
in the NFC. Only Atlanta (6-0) and Minnesota (5-1) have done
better.

</P>
<P>
   So these corrections in the NFL standings should be made: Miami
and Buffalo now lead the AFC East with 9-4 records. The Jets are
8-5 and New England is 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh improves to 8-5, putting the Steelers in the AFC
playoffs if the season were to end today.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're doing do-overs, here are some other wrongs that can
be corrected this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas drafts Marshall wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss instead of
North Carolina defensive end  &UR; Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cutting him, Carolina tells quarterback  &UR; Kerry
Collins to stand in the corner until he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Referee  &UR; Phil Luckett is sent to NFL Europe, formerly known as
the World League, until he masters the coin toss and learns that a
player doesn't score until he crosses the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has another vote for its nickname and choose any name
except Titans. &QL; 
Don't you dare &QL; 
Don't even suggest to Tampa Bay Coach  &UR; Tony Dungy that that league
bring back instant replay for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He is opposed to changing the rules ``in midstream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can change intentional grounding,'' Dungy said,
sarcastically. ``Maybe we can play with 12 men instead of 11. If
they put it in for the playoffs, I'd throw a fit if I was Seattle.
I'd say, `Why didn't you put replay in the week before our Jets
game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be retroactive. Why wait for the playoffs. Everybody
knew the ramifications of no replay when they voted that way. You
can't say there's been too much pass interference, so we're going
to change the rules for the playoffs.'' &QL; 
Clouded vision &QL; 
The headlines in the New York papers after Testaverde's phantom
touchdown were classic. The back page of the ``New York Post''
tabloid said, ``GOD'S A JET FAN.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``New York Daily News'' said, ``CLOSE ENOUGH.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsday,'' sympathizing with the Seahawks, said, ``They Wuz
Robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not all of the Jets players agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson thinks Testaverde actually
scored. ``Television can do a lot of different things,'' he said.
``I think the referee actually saw Vinny's right hand go over the
goal line with the ball in it. Then when the players pushing guys
back in the pile, you can't get a true feeling right there.
Television cameras, for some reason, didn't see exactly what we
saw. We saw a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde still thinks he scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the angle of the slow-motion replay, you would think that
I was down just short of the goal line,'' he said. ``But if they
had a camera on the goal line looking from one flat to the other,
and I'm taking the word of some of my teammates, you'd see a
different view of where the ball was.'' &QL; 
Superstitious &QL; 
Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells, whose team plays at Miami today, might
be the most superstitious NFL coach of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He had dentist appointments on three consecutive Tuesday
mornings earlier this season, each preceding a victory. So on the
fourth straight Tuesday, he went to the dentist again ``even though
I didn't need anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had his teeth cleaned, and the Jets went on to win
their fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat there _ same chair, same time,'' Parcells said.
``But then the Colts beat us so I didn't have to go anymore.'' &QL; 
Overworked? &QL; 
Defensive lineman  &UR; Joe Phillips is the latest member of the St.
Louis Rams to complain about the grueling practices of Coach  &UR; Dick
Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said last week that Vermeil's training camp was
``abusive,'' joining former teammates  &UR; Leslie O'Neal and  &UR; Craig
Heyward in criticizing the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil doesn't think his practices are abusive but acknowledges
that they're ``very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   No team practices longer than the Rams' three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are responding,'' one Rams player said. ``The response is
we're 3-10.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Rams player recently asked of the team, ``How are
things at the slave factory?'' &QL; 
Beer bath &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Steelers fan was so upset with quarterback  &UR; Kordell Stewart
last week that he dumped beer on Stewart's head as he ran off the
field last Sunday at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was enraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's agitating walking off the field and people throwing beer
on you and saying this, that and other,'' Stewart said. ``I've
never had that happen to me in my life.'' &QL; 
Short people &QL; 
When Buffalo Bills quarterback  &UR; Doug Flutie was at a recent
autograph show, a woman came up to him and presented him with
Flutie's original NFL scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   The first two words on the report were ``extremely small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it went into all the superlatives after that,'' Flutie
said. ``I'm thinking, `If you have all these superlatives, then why
is being too small an issue.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known the game from my perspective all my life. I've
never played the game at 6-2. I don't know what it's like to be
6-2. I've been successful at this game in whatever league I've been
in, and I have to do things the way I do them.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
Without  &UR; Deion Sanders, the Cowboys have given up six touchdown
passes and 598 passing yards in losses to Minnesota and New Orleans
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There's hope for the Detroit Lions on Monday night in San
Francisco. They are 1-8 on Sunday afternoon and 4-0 on Thursdays,
Monday nights and Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre's six fumbles at Tampa last
Monday night make him the team's all-time leader with 67.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are 4-2 since their bye week, the third-best record
in the NFC. Only Atlanta (6-0) and Minnesota (5-1) have done
better.

HOLIK NOT THRILLED BY VICTORY

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was less than eight minutes to
play Saturday, and the New Jersey Devils trailed the Colorado
Avalanche by a goal. That might lead you to believe that the Devils
had their opponents right where they wanted them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had rallied from behind in five of the previous six
games, winning four and tying two, and on this day, they did it
again, dominating the third period to win 5-3 at Continental Arena.
But the Devils were hardly celebrating after this one, aware that
eventually they may dig themselves a hole from which they cannot
escape. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils seemed to wake up for the final period. They outshot
the Avalanche 15-3 in the final 20 minutes, scoring four goals.
Although their seven-game unbeaten streak leaves them with a
league-best 37 points, the Devils were not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to even talk about it,'' said Bobby Holik, who
scored two of the third-period goals. ``This is not the way we want
to play, just cruising through the first two periods and then
picking it up in the third. It's not the way the team is built to
play. It's going to stop happening. We feel we can do it, but what
we did in the third period, let's do it from the start.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils seemed poised to, scoring a power-play goal by Denis
Pederson just 1 minute 26 seconds into the game. But the Avalanche,
in the final game of a four-game trip and playing without its
captain, Joe Sakic, tied the score when Christian Matte deflected
the puck past Martin Brodeur with his skate with 2:08 remaining in
the first period. Jeff Odgers scored midway through the second
period, and Colorado carried a 2-1 lead into the final period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holik, playing in the third period on a line with Randy McKay
and Krzysztof Oliwa, tied the score at 4:49 of the third period.
Holik's slap shot from just inside the blue line was turned away,
and goaltender Criag Billington turned deflected Oliwa's attempt on
a rebound. The puck bounded right to Holik, who stuffed it in the
open right side. But Colorado took the lead just 2:09 later, making
Saturday's comeback a little more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston tied the score with 7:48 to play, stealing a
cross-ice pass in the Colorado zone and skating in on net, faking a
forehand and then slipping a backhand shot into the lower right
corner. The Devils kept the pressure on, and 1:04 later, Holik won
a faceoff from Chris Drury in the Colorado zone, sending the puck
to Sheldon Souray at the right point. Holik headed toward the net
and Souray's slap shot was redirected off his stick past
Billington. Holik fed McKay for a goal with 29 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way we want to play,'' Holik said. ``Yes, we
have the ability and it's in the back of our minds, but let's not
use it too often. It's very draining mentally and physically on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Oliwa was the victim of a vicious check by Colorado's
Wade Belak earlier this season, and the two squared off just 1:34
into Saturday's game. Belak's right leg was twisted awkwardly
beneath him. He had to be helped off the ice and was taken to a
hospital, where it was determined that he had a bruised knee.

FUTURITY FAVORITE DESTROYED AFTER FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Those who claim horse racing produces the highest
highs and lowest lows in sports could call no better witnesses than
Bob Baffert, the nation's leading trainer, and Hal Earnhardt, one
of his veteran owners.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was one of the lows.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's and Earnhardt's 2-year-old colt Premier Property, the
odds-on favorite in the $393,000 Hollywood Futurity, broke down
shortly after finishing third to Tactical Cat and had to be
destroyed as he lay on the Hollywood Park track.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey David Flores, thrown under the inner rail, got to his
feet in a minute and was fit to ride in the next race. But Premier
Property suffered a severe fracture of his left front cannon (shin)
bone, and track veterinarian Dr. Ray Baran quickly decided to
administer a lethal injection, while an equine ambulance shielded
the 9,883 fans from the unpleasant sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal and I have had some good times and some bad times
together,'' Baffert _ who trained Earnhardt's Indian Charlie to win
the Santa Anita Derby in April _ said with a shake of his head as
he walked from the track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Baffert said. ``The consolation is that
David Flores didn't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Premier Property, a brown son of Out of Place who had won his
first three starts after being purchased for $100,000, led the
five-horse field into the stretch in the 1 1/16-mile Futurity. But
he tired and was passed on the outside by Baffert-trained Prime
Timber and Chris McCarron. Both were then passed by D. Wayne
Lukas-trained Tactical Cat and Laffit Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   Tactical Cat (who paid $15.80) won by half a length, giving
Lukas and the 51-year-old Pincay their fourth Juvenile victories
and their second together.
</P>
<P>
   Their performance was overshadowed by Premier Property's
accident, as were early-afternoon victories by front-running Lazy
Lode and Corey Nakatani in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup and the
filly Love That Jazz and Kent Desormeaux in the $100,000 Vernon O.
Underwood sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tired,'' Baffert, trainer of the past two Kentucky
Derby winners, said of Premier Property, who had set fast
fractions. ``When they get hurt, it's when they get tired. It's
just a bad break. He took a bad step. It's not the track's fault or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to give it (the lead) up. He kept trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the split second after the Futurity, this was a great day
of racing:
</P>
<P>
   _A $270,000 pick-six carryover produced a big payoff of $151,673
for each of six perfect tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _Nakatani, who would have ridden favorite and runner-up Yagli in
the Turf Cup if not for a new contract binding him to Thoroughbred
Corp.-owned horses, controlled a slow pace aboard Lazy Lode
($13.20) as they became the first wire-to-wire winners in 18
runnings of the 1{-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   _Love That Jazz ($5) rallied along the rail to beat 55-1 Peyrano
by a length to be the third female winner of the 6-furlong
Underwood and give Desormeaux and trainer Neil Drysdale their 21st
stakes victory together this year.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Bob Baffert-trained Excellent Meeting is 4-5 on the
morning line for today's Hollywood Starlet. This is one 2-year-olds
race Baffert hasn't won. D. Wayne Lukas, who trained the past four
Starlet winners, doesn't have a filly in the field of six. . . .
Laffit Pincay, with six wins in the past three days, has 8,672 in
his career, 161 shy of Bill Shoemaker's record. The Hollywood
Futurity was Pincay's first Grade I stakes victory since he and
Tipically Irish won the 1995 Oak Leaf for Lukas. . . . The $15.2
million wagered Saturday was a Hollywood Park fall-season record
for a non-Breeders' Cup day. . . . Apprentice Ariel Smith got a
10-day suspension from the Hollywood Park stewards _ five for each
of back-to-back disqualifications Friday. The ruling effectively
ends the 16-year-old's California career for now: He was already
scheduled to ride in New York after the Hollywood season ends Dec.

HOUSE COMMITTEE PASSES FOURTH ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST
CLINTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN C. HENRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee pushed
through a fourth and final article of impeachment against President
Clinton Saturday and rejected a Democratic measure to censure and
rebuke the president.
</P>
<P>
   With the stage already set for a historic vote by the full House
later this week, the Judiciary Committee voted 21-16 to add abuse
of power to other charges already recommended as grounds to
terminate Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse of power article _ which was pared down considerably
by the committee _ accuses Clinton of providing ``perjurious, false
and misleading'' answers to some of the 81 questions from the
committee concerning his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the committee approved three other articles of
impeachment _ two alleging that Clinton lied under oath and another
accusing him of obstructing justice. Each cleared the committee
without a single vote from the panel's Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans showed comparable solidarity against the Democratic
censure resolution, which Clinton embraced a day earlier. The
measure accused Clinton of violating the trust of the American
people and dishonoring the office of president with his
``reprehensible behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was mocked by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who is among
the president's harshest critics. ``This isn't group therapy. This
isn't a feel-good session,'' Barr said. ``This is the Congress of
the United States and we have a solemn duty here ... to uphold the
Constitution. Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting down the censure resolution, the Republicans by
voice vote _ and no debate _ refused a Democratic request for the
committee to submit the measure as a minority report when the
impeachment issue reaches the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., sent a
letter to incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston, R-La., saying it
would be inappropriate for the full House to consider censure. ``A
resolution or amendment proposing censure of the president in lieu
of impeachment violates the rules of the House, threatens the
separation of powers, and fails to meet constitutional muster,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new speaker responded in a letter concurring with Hyde's
conclusions, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   White House special counsel Gregory Craig denounced the
Judiciary Committee vote and predicted that impeaching the
president will ``divide the country, gridlock the government and
defy the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   If the full House approves any of the four articles from the
Judiciary Committee, Clinton would become the second president ever
impeached. He would then face a trial in the Senate similar to the
one that ended with President Andrew Johnson's acquittal in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   If two-thirds of the senators were to vote to convict, Clinton
would be removed immediately from office. Vice President Al Gore
would then become president.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after debate began Saturday on Article 4 _ the abuse of
power allegation _ the raw partisanship that has marked the
committee's three-month impeachment inquiry was once again laid
bare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does sometimes, to some people, begin to take on the
appearance of a coup,'' said Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the
committee's top-ranking Democrat. ``It's staggering. It's
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans bridled at Conyers' characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that impeaching a president of the United
States is a momentous act. But this is not a legislative coup
d'etat. This is a constitutional process,'' said Rep. Charles
Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C. disputed charges he and his colleagues
were seeking vengeance in their pursuit of Clinton. ``We are not
being vengeful. We are not a lynch mob over here. I've had knots in
my guts all week,'' Coble said. ``I don't take it lightly. I don't
take it gleefully at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the abuse of power article, the panel voted
29-5 to remove three allegations of wrongdoing by the president,
leaving only the accusation that Clinton lied in several answers to
the 81 questions.
</P>
<P>
   As originally written, Article 4 had alleged the president
``frivolously'' asserted executive privilege in the investigation
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. It also had accused Clinton
of making false statements to Cabinet members, aides and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they did not believe the deleted allegations
rose to the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard set by the
Constitution for impeachable offenses. Democrats claimed the
Republicans drafted the article broadly so they could look fair and
bipartisan when they removed portions of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an orchestrated dance to create an illusion of
reasonability that I don't think people should fall for,'' said
Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   All four articles of impeachment _ which are outlined in a
resolution calling for Clinton's removal from office _ grew out of
his sworn statements and subsequent behavior in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit and, later, his testimony before a
federal grand jury used by independent counsel Kenneth Starr to
investigate the president's affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 alleges Clinton committed perjury during his August
testimony about the Lewinsky affair before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Article 2 alleges perjury during his January deposition in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Article 3 alleges obstruction of justice in seven instances when
Clinton attempted to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal''
evidence related to the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The censure resolution _ written by four of the committee's
Democratic members, including Houston Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee _
used words like reprehensible and despicable to describe Clinton's
behavior. While rebuking him, the resolution would also have left
him vulnerable to criminal and civil prosecution once his term ends
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure (of the president) is right for this nation. It causes
us to rise above the political divide. And it is not
unconstitutional,'' Jackson Lee said shortly before the resolution
was rejected, 22-14. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., voted with the
Republicans and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. refused to take sides
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde argued against the censure resolution, comparing it to
``yelling at a teen-ager'' when angry. ``It purges you of your
emotional feelings, but I don't know what it accomplishes,'' he
said.

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The New York Mets kept waiting Saturday in
negotiations for Rickey Henderson and Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips said that he had amended his
offer to the free-agent outfielder Henderson during a 20-minute
meeting with his representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the financial terms, though,'' Phillips said of the offer,
which is believed to be for one year at about $1.7 million with
incentives and an option for a second year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were scheduled to meet with Henderson's representatives
again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clemens, who has demanded a trade, Phillips said he had
spoken briefly with Toronto GM Gord Ash Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't tell us we were out,'' Phillips said.

2 SOLID GOALIES PLUS WINNING SEASON EQUALS NO WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In just about any other NHL city, if a backup goalie such as the
Coyotes'  &UR; Jimmy Waite were getting this many starts and playing
this well to boot, headlines no doubt would be screaming, ``Goalie
controversy!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin's status as the club's No. 1 man would be
analyzed and scrutinized. Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld's decision to keep
turning to Waite every third game would be hashed and rehashed.
There would be whispers of discontent, rumors of clashing heads.
</P>
<P>
   But not in sunny Phoenix, where everything, including any form
of potential negativity, seems to get absorbed by the Coyotes'
amazing start this season. When you're winning as much and as often
as this team is _ the Coyotes were undefeated in 17 of their
previous 18 before Saturday's game at Ottawa _ everyone wears a
happy face.
</P>
<P>
   From forward  &UR; Jim Cummins, who hasn't blown up despite being a
healthy scratch for a dozen straight games, to the two goalies,
Khabibulin and Waite, each of whom legitimately could gripe about
wanting more starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so good about that team, besides the great defense
they're playing and the skill of their forwards,'' Ottawa Coach
 &UR; Jacques Martin said, ``is that you could throw either one of those
goalies in there and you'd feel real good about your chances. It's
quite a combination for Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   It has worked better than the  &UR; John Vanbiesbrouck-Ron Hextall
combo in Philadelphia. Or Carolina's pair of  &UR; Arturs Irbe and
 &UR; Trevor Kidd. Or the duo in Edmonton of  &UR; Mikhail Shtalenkov and
 &UR; Bob Essensa. It's better than  &UR; Patrick Roy and  &UR; Craig Billington
in Colorado and the Senators' own twosome of  &UR; Damian Rhodes and
 &UR; Ron Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said Khabibulin (10-3-1 before Saturday) and the
undefeated Waite (6-0-2) deserve credit for making the part-platoon
system work, although it remains clear that Khabibulin is still the
main man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what the people involved allow it to become,'' Schoenfeld
said of a potential goalie rift. ``You could write a great story
about there being this big controversy. Two Number 1's. Who's going
to be the Number 1 guy? Who's going to be the guy in the playoffs?
Or you could write nothing because nothing's there. But it's not
about that. It's how they (Khabibulin and Waite) interpret it, how
they respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an organizational point of view, we're thrilled to have
two goalies playing as well as they are. Both goalies should be
happy, too. Look, this is great for Nik that Jimmy can lessen the
load and Nik can be more effective by playing less games and be
physically, mentally and emotionally sharper when we need him to be
his best in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   There. He said it. Khabibulin is still the No. 1 guy. There's no
controversy. As for Waite, Schoenfeld said he'd like the backup to
make between 20 and 25 starts on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be more or less,'' he said, ``but based on the way
Jimmy's playing, there is no reason he's not going to get at least
that, if not more, if he keeps playing the way he's been
playing.'' &QL; 
Coffey talk
</P>
<P>
   We saw the premature ending of Cam Neely's career. Can  &UR; Paul
Coffey be very far behind? Sadly, it looks that way.
</P>
<P>
   The former perennial Norris Trophy winner has been battling a
series of lower-back and leg injuries all season and although he's
finally worked himself back into a position to play, it probably
won't last. But at least Coffey knows what went wrong with him
after his problems flared up during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   He recently went to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to find out why
his right leg kept going numb. According to Coffey, the doctors
told him he suffered nerve damage from the needle of an epidermal
block he took way back in the first week of October. The shot,
administered by the Blackhawks' medical staff, was supposed to ease
his lower back pain, but only exacerbated the problem and
apparently made everything worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I feel so much better,'' he said. ``I've been going
crazy. They hit a nerve. I'm bitter that it happened, but I don't
have any axes to grind. I just wish I would have known sooner so I
wouldn't be tormenting myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks' chief physician,  &UR; Mark Bowen, said Coffey is
mistaken, that the procedure didn't directly lead to his problems.
Tell that to GM  &UR; Bob Murray, who plunked over $2.5 million to pay
Mr. Coffey after his draft-day trade to Chicago. &QL; 
Behind bars
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nelson Slalbania, the man who signed  &UR; Wayne Gretzky to his
first professional hockey contract in 1978, has been sentenced to a
year in jail in Vancouver for the the theft of $100,000. Slalbania,
a player in the real estate game in western Canada, signed Gretzky
to a seven-year deal worth $850,000 when the superstar was only 17,
and he began his pro career with the Indianapolis Racers of the
WHA.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Slalbania sold Gretzky's rights to  &UR; Peter
Pocklington, who had purchased half of the Edmonton Oilers from
Slalbania for a Rolls Royce, a 14-carat diamond ring belonging to
his wife, Eva, and a painting by Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, bad luck _ and bad investments _ finally
caught up to Pocklington as well. The former Oilers' owner owes a
reported $60 million to a Canadian bank, and several of his
personal possessions have been repossessed in recent weeks. &QL; 
Head case
</P>
<P>
   For years, rumors have been circulating through the NHL that
Buffalo goalie  &UR; Dominik Hasek, the NHL's two-time Hart Trophy
winner as Player of the Year, is double jointed in the knees and
therefore enjoys some semblance of unfair advantage over his
puck-stopping peers.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash. True or false, Hasek doesn't shy away from blocking
shots no matter where the puck hits him. Even if it's in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to stop the puck with my head,'' Hasek said.
``I try to do it sometimes in practice. Not every day, but once in
a while. I say to my teammates, `Shoot me in the head and I'll try
to stop the puck.' I'm not afraid at all of the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice and the bravery have paid off for the Dominator. &QL; 
Fastest draw in West
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have their fair share of faceoff specialists in  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Corkum, Jeremy Roenick, Mike Stapleton and  &UR; Juha Ylonen. But as
good as they are, they all pretty much pale in comparison to Dallas
Stars center  &UR; Joe Nieuwendyk, who had won 209 of 297 total draws
before Friday _ an incredible 70.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During a 3-3 draw with San Jose on Wednesday, Nieuwendyk won 20
of 21 faceoffs, and a couple of his final circle wins directly led
to goals. &QL;

Optimism vanishes after short session
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Just one day after talk that a new agreement was on the horizon,
Saturday's talks between the National Basketball Players'
Association and NBA owners broke down after just 30 minutes, again
putting the season in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting nowhere,'' said NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik. ``We learned today that basically nothing has changed at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   No new talks have been scheduled _ secret or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern and union executive director Billy
Hunter had reportedly been trying to hammer out things themselves,
hoping to work out many points of contention in the proposals for a
new collective bargaining agreement. But, as has been the case in
almost all other discussions in this acrimonious labor war, once
larger committees got involved, things broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more explosive ups and downs before the lockout, now in
its 166th day, gets settled.
</P>
<P>
   The owners were represented by Stern, Granik and their
attorneys, while Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing, Herb
Williams and lawyers represented the players.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem Saturday was that the union was reportedly
still insisting on 57 percent of basketball-related income (BRI)
and that they were unwilling to consider a maximum salary tied to a
percentage of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was worth it, we would have stayed,'' said Stern. ``We
have to go back and report to ownership that we're quite far
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik was equally pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has moved on this track from Day 1,'' he said, ``and
despite the passage of time it didn't move today either.''
</P>
<P>
   The players blamed the owners for the stalemate, saying they
dropped a proposal to relax the changes to the league's timing
rules, which would prohibit teams that sign another team's free
agent from exceeding the salary cap to re-sign their own Larry Bird
exception free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Owners had changed their stance on this demand, allowing it to
be phased in over a period of years and including limited
exceptions, but players say those modifications were taken off the
table during recent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed general issues we thought were pertinent,''
Hunter said. ``They basically said they had nothing more to say and
they thought it was not necessary to continue to meet, and they
basically left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the issues that we raised were extremely
significant and pertinent, but they continue to be intransigent.
We're trying, we'll continue to try, but it's still a situation
where it's necessary for us to fall on the sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being extremely reasonable, but how much is enough?
That's the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The league already is sharpening the swords.
</P>
<P>
   It is rumored that Stern is now making plans to shut down the
league office in New York, which is run on the six percent of gate
revenues it receives from every team in the league. Without games
being played, there are no gate revenues being generated, so Stern
is mulling plans to save money.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it has come to _ a $2 billion industry is now
reduced to counting paper clips.
</P>
<P>
   But the players are holding on to the notion that had their
spirits up Friday _ that an agreement will be reached before
Christmas and that games will begin in late January or early
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explored where we can go, they felt that it wasn't enough
and the meeting ended,'' said Ewing of Saturday's meeting. ``I
think that there will be a season. It's in no one's best interest
to blow the season up. The repercussions of them doing that would
be severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the mood of the players entering Saturday's meeting was
one of optimism _ a sharp contrast to the mood just 30 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost two weeks since the full committees have been
involved in a session, last meeting on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't have another meeting for
several days,'' said union attorney Jeffrey Kessler. ``But I also
wouldn't be surprised if we get a phone call from them tomorrow.
The problem is that they (the owners) don't think they have to make
any compromises in order to get a deal that will save the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of saving the season, which looked so bright on
Friday, dimmed _ again _ just 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still optimistic, Hunter said. ``You still can't convince
me that we're not going to get a deal or a season.''

LIGHTNING BOLTS STRIKE THREE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Two weeks before the second and final time he was
killed, Department of Public Safety officer Doug Knutson was ALMOST
killed, attacked and beaten outside his car while his terrified
wife, Sharon, huddled inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family has been through a lot,'' Sharon says. ``And, sure,
maybe I do feel a little picked on. But I don't believe our
experiences speak well of the justice system. Call it whatever you
like _ lightning striking the same place three times. Fate.
Tragedy. Bad luck. Whatever you call it, it wouldn't be justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Knutson died first on Feb. 22, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He died a second time, for good, on Jan. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a year after she lost him, it's the incident between
her husband's two deaths that most haunts Sharon Knutson. She found
out over Thanksgiving weekend that charges against the suspects in
the beating may be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `Oh, no, not again,' '' she says. ``But
it happened. Again.''
</P>
<P>
   In late February 1983, the Knutsons' 6{-year-old son, Ricky, was
walking along 40th Street with an aunt, who pushed a stroller
holding Ricky's sister and a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Driving by that day was 19-year-old Cole Dean Sorenson, then a
student at Arizona State University. Police would later find a vial
of cocaine on the car seat next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, Sorenson's Camaro jumped the curb and struck
Ricky, narrowly missing the others.
</P>
<P>
   The boy died.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and father, notified soon afterward, died with him.
As any loving parent would.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN SLATE &QL; 
Sorenson eventually pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and
soliciting to possess cocaine. He spent 14 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after that, Sorenson went before a judge and got his
record expunged, his slate wiped clean. The Knutsons found out
about it in 1990. I spoke with Sharon Knutson at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out that the charges (against Sorenson) had been
dismissed,'' she said, ``it made it seem like everybody was saying
it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That was eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if that weren't horror enough, it happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Last Jan. 2, while DPS Officer Doug Knutson stood near his
motorcycle, waiting for a tow truck to remove an abandoned car from
a ramp of the Loop 202 freeway, he was struck and killed by a truck
driven by 22-year-old Bret Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the accident, the state Legislature passed a law
making it illegal to cross the white lines called a ``gore point''
on freeway ramps.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck that killed Knutson, however, was not
charged with a ny crime. &QL; 
`SENSE OF LOSS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of loss I could never get across to you,'' Sharon
says. ``The shock. The way you say to yourself, `This can't be
happening.' Particularly, since it occurred only a couple of weeks
after Doug had nearly gotten beaten to death.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the week before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Knutson and Sharon were in his pickup truck, stopped at 24th
Street and Washington. After the light turned green and they
started forward, Sharon remembers a car running the red light and
clipping a vehicle near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car just kept going, so Doug said, `We have to follow it,'
'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Knutson tailed the hit-and-run driver to a house near 30th
Street and Oak. When the car pulled into a driveway, he pulled in
behind it and got out of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as he got to the driver's door,'' Sharon says, ``Doug was
jumped by six or eight men. One of them had a gun and he put it to
Doug's head and just hit him with it. Then Doug was on the ground
and they were punching and kicking him.''
</P>
<P>
   The windows of the truck were tinted. Sharon slouched down where
she couldn't be seen. At one point in the struggle, Knutson
wrestled a semiautomatic handgun from one of the suspects and
tossed it into his truck. When police arrived, two men were taken
into custody and booked for assault. The driver of the car, a
woman, was charged with driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, on Thanksgiving weekend, I was told the county attorney
wanted to drop the charges,'' Sharon says.
</P>
<P>
   The men who beat Knutson claimed self-defense. They said Knutson
didn't immediately identify himself as a police officer, which is
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that,'' Sharon says. ``As if that gives six
or eight men, one with a gun, the right to beat on an unarmed man.
If they thought Doug was the bad guy, why did they all run when the
police arrived? This was an assault, and now that Doug is gone, the
prosecutors want the charges to go awak.''
</P>
<P>
   JUSTICE DESERVED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Sharon and her remaining two children, 20-year-old Justin
and 19-year-old Misty, that's not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And it shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Any reasonable interpretation of the
People-Who-Have-Been-Through-Enough Rule tells us that, for once,
the Knutsons deserve a shot at justice. They deserve something to
show for the two graves they must visit over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley told me
Friday afternoon that, while one staff prosecutor has suggested the
case be dismissed, a final decision has yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is still under review,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good chance prosecutors could lose in court, and they
know it. Losses lower the big conviction rate percentage they like
to brag about, and for that reason they still may drop the assault
charges without taking a swing at the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   They've gone to the plate for the Knutsons twice before and
stood there while the ball sailed by for called strikes.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the family is concerned, what works for the crooks
should apply to the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Three strikes and you're out. &QL;

FREE SPENDING BREEDS DISDAIN FOR DIAMONDBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ About a year ago, the Diamondbacks became one of the
most vilified franchises in baseball, which was quite an
achievement considering the club still was months away from playing
its first game.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' controversial signing of shortstop Jay Bell to
a five-year, $34 million contract, in which they basically bid
against themselves, and their often brash statements of contending
in their first season made them an easy target for opposing front
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Their perceived disregard for the game's financial structure,
punctuated when they signed third baseman Matt Williams to a
five-year extension worth $45 million, had many opposing general
managers and owners stewing and steaming.
</P>
<P>
   The general thought among those who disliked the Diamondbacks
centered on thoughts such as, ``Just who do these young punks think
they are?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the resentment from opposing clubs originated from the
small-market clubs, the ones who realize they have virtually no
chance to compete as long as the current economic structure remains
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a sense that they had not suffered enough,''
a prominent American League general manager said. ``It was a case
of a new kid emerging on the block and immediately throwing their
weight around. That ticked off a lot of other clubs who basically
wished they could spend the same kind of money. I think a lot of it
centered around envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Diamondbacks remain on the short list of
the most-hated franchises in the majors. Whereas they were fairly
well despised a year ago, the Diamondbacks now find themselves
accepted by one faction, the large-market clubs capable of spending
big-time money.
</P>
<P>
   The small-market clubs, the ones who wanted the Diamondbacks to
follow the path of every previous expansion club, building from
within, still have no love for Arizona or its smooth point man,
Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not written in any constitution that expansion clubs
cannot sign free agents,'' Atlanta General Manager John Schuerholz
said. ``If they can afford the money, then they should be commended
for spending it on player payroll and not just sticking it in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that hasn't stopped the anti-Diamondbacks faction from
rearing its head. When the Diamondbacks started signing free agents
this off-season, which began with the additions of reliever Greg
Swindell at three years for $5.7 million and Greg Colbrunn at two
years for $1.8 million, several clubs looked on rather
suspiciously, wondering what direction the Diamondbacks were
headed.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came quickly. Starters Todd Stottlemyre and Randy
Johnson joined Arizona's rotation for a combined $84.4 million for
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of days, the Diamondbacks had re-emerged on the
hate list of about 20 clubs, most from small markets. The feelings
about the Diamondbacks appear to be split between the haves and the
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got absolutely no problem with the direction the
Diamondbacks are headed, and I don't think anyone else should
either,'' Cleveland General Manager John Hart said. ``How can
anyone really get on a club when they're just trying to win?''
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly where part of the problem lies with the
perception of the Diamondbacks. Some opposing general managers
resent the Diamondbacks for not building their major league roster
through traditional avenues, meaning the often slow process of
waiting for draft picks to make their way to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   By basically circumventing that process and buying themselves a
contender, it's no wonder the Diamondbacks drew the ire of many
clubs, particularly those who can't afford to go the same route.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the basic response from the club has remained the
same. ``Don't penalize us because we have the means to go about our
business in this manner'' has been the company line given for
months by Colangelo, the club's managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, he seems to have a valid case. Nobody really bats an
eye when the New York Yankees or Los Angeles Dodgers go out and
spend tens of millions of dollars for premier free agents. That's
his primary argument whenever anyone mentions Arizona's spending
spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in this simply for a sip of champagne,'' Colangelo
said. ``We will not tear this thing down if we end up winning in a
short time span.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment is a pointed criticism of former Florida Marlins
owner Wayne Huizenga, who began tearing apart the 1997 World Series
champions that he basically built through free agency, within weeks
of beating Cleveland for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga has taken heat for his dismantling of the Marlins from
the moment it began in November of last year with Moises Alou's
trade to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks plan to fill their roster with proven veterans
now and wait for the fledgling minor league system to spit out
major league players, a process that can take as long as four or
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really go in any direction until you know what
you've got,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said. ``What
every club needs is players coming up from the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Diamondbacks realize they will continue to
feel the wrath of some opposing clubs. The clubs that have a
dislike for Arizona can dictate which league the Diamondbacks are
assigned to for 2000, when a major shuffling of the leagues is
expected to take place.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' fate in the National League will be in the
hands of opposing teams after next season because of the expansion
agreement that the Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay signed when they
became the 29th and 30th major league clubs. &QL;

LIGHTNING BOLTS STRIKE THREE TIMES

   PHOENIX _ Two weeks before the second and final time he was
killed, Department of Public Safety officer Doug Knutson was ALMOST
killed, attacked and beaten outside his car while his terrified
wife, Sharon, huddled inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family has been through a lot,'' Sharon says. ``And, sure,
maybe I do feel a little picked on. But I don't believe our
experiences speak well of the justice system. Call it whatever you
like _ lightning striking the same place three times. Fate.
Tragedy. Bad luck. Whatever you call it, it wouldn't be justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Knutson died first on Feb. 22, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He died a second time, for good, on Jan. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a year after she lost him, it's the incident between
her husband's two deaths that most haunts Sharon Knutson. She found
out over Thanksgiving weekend that charges against the suspects in
the beating may be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `Oh, no, not again,' '' she says. ``But
it happened. Again.''
</P>
<P>
   In late February 1983, the Knutsons' 6{-year-old son, Ricky, was
walking along 40th Street with an aunt, who pushed a stroller
holding Ricky's sister and a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Driving by that day was 19-year-old Cole Dean Sorenson, then a
student at Arizona State University. Police would later find a vial
of cocaine on the car seat next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, Sorenson's Camaro jumped the curb and struck
Ricky, narrowly missing the others.
</P>
<P>
   The boy died.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and father, notified soon afterward, died with him.
As any loving parent would.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN SLATE &QL; 
Sorenson eventually pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and
soliciting to possess cocaine. He spent 14 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after that, Sorenson went before a judge and got his
record expunged, his slate wiped clean. The Knutsons found out
about it in 1990. I spoke with Sharon Knutson at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out that the charges (against Sorenson) had been
dismissed,'' she said, ``it made it seem like everybody was saying
it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That was eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if that weren't horror enough, it happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Last Jan. 2, while DPS Officer Doug Knutson stood near his
motorcycle, waiting for a tow truck to remove an abandoned car from
a ramp of the Loop 202 freeway, he was struck and killed by a truck
driven by 22-year-old Bret Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the accident, the state Legislature passed a law
making it illegal to cross the white lines called a ``gore point''
on freeway ramps.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck that killed Knutson, however, was not
charged with a ny crime. &QL; 
`SENSE OF LOSS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of loss I could never get across to you,'' Sharon
says. ``The shock. The way you say to yourself, `This can't be
happening.' Particularly, since it occurred only a couple of weeks
after Doug had nearly gotten beaten to death.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the week before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Knutson and Sharon were in his pickup truck, stopped at 24th
Street and Washington. After the light turned green and they
started forward, Sharon remembers a car running the red light and
clipping a vehicle near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car just kept going, so Doug said, `We have to follow it,'
'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Knutson tailed the hit-and-run driver to a house near 30th
Street and Oak. When the car pulled into a driveway, he pulled in
behind it and got out of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as he got to the driver's door,'' Sharon says, ``Doug was
jumped by six or eight men. One of them had a gun and he put it to
Doug's head and just hit him with it. Then Doug was on the ground
and they were punching and kicking him.''
</P>
<P>
   The windows of the truck were tinted. Sharon slouched down where
she couldn't be seen. At one point in the struggle, Knutson
wrestled a semiautomatic handgun from one of the suspects and
tossed it into his truck. When police arrived, two men were taken
into custody and booked for assault. The driver of the car, a
woman, was charged with driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, on Thanksgiving weekend, I was told the county attorney
wanted to drop the charges,'' Sharon says.
</P>
<P>
   The men who beat Knutson claimed self-defense. They said Knutson
didn't immediately identify himself as a police officer, which is
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that,'' Sharon says. ``As if that gives six
or eight men, one with a gun, the right to beat on an unarmed man.
If they thought Doug was the bad guy, why did they all run when the
police arrived? This was an assault, and now that Doug is gone, the
prosecutors want the charges to go awak.''
</P>
<P>
   JUSTICE DESERVED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Sharon and her remaining two children, 20-year-old Justin
and 19-year-old Misty, that's not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And it shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Any reasonable interpretation of the
People-Who-Have-Been-Through-Enough Rule tells us that, for once,
the Knutsons deserve a shot at justice. They deserve something to
show for the two graves they must visit over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley told me
Friday afternoon that, while one staff prosecutor has suggested the
case be dismissed, a final decision has yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is still under review,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good chance prosecutors could lose in court, and they
know it. Losses lower the big conviction rate percentage they like
to brag about, and for that reason they still may drop the assault
charges without taking a swing at the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   They've gone to the plate for the Knutsons twice before and
stood there while the ball sailed by for called strikes.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the family is concerned, what works for the crooks
should apply to the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Three strikes and you're out. &QL;

ANGERED BY CRITICISM, LARUSSA STRIKES BACK AT GANT, BRANTLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE - It didn't take long for St. Louis Manager  &UR; Tony La
Russa to take exception to disparaging remarks made by former
Cardinals  &UR; Ron
 &UR; Gant, who said  &UR; Mark McGwire should have batted fourth instead of
third in order to help the Cardinals lineup, and  &UR; Jeff Brantley,
who said he had a terrible working relationship with pitching coach
 &UR; Dave Duncan. La Russa lashed out at both last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup worked for  &UR; Ray Lankford and  &UR; Brian Jordan and
 &UR; Delino
 &UR; DeShields and  &UR; J.D. Drew in his few games in September,'' La Russa
said. ``The only one it didn't work for was Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was whiff, whiff, whiff. I really hope he goes to Philly
and whiffs for them like he whiffed for us. And we'll see what
excuse he makes. The last two years, he made these comments to me
about the fans not being behind him. I couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Ron, in any other city, if you had struck out that
many times, you wouldn't be able to show your face on the street.
These people cheer anything you do that's positive. They don't even
boo you when you get announced.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watched us seven games a week, in five games Ron was a
non-factor, 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. In the other two games,
he'd do something crucial to winning. You'd think, `Man, if he
could do that more often, we're in business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for Brantley, La Russa said, ``Here's a guy who had 14 saves
and eight blown saves. He must have had a memory loss during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a half dozen of those flameouts, it got a little ugly.
Duncan went to bat for him a hundred times. If we pitched him, he
got booed. If we didn't pitch him, people wrote that he deserved a
chance. What Brantley said, he embarrassed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are down on him, so they're not going to believe him.
And Duncan's reputation is unanimous. The other players know that
Dunc is the best. Jeff should have said, `The manager misused me.'
That's a better sell. The manager's not as highly regarded as the
pitching coach.'' &QL; 
Park's avenue &QL; 
Los Angeles right-hander  &UR; Chan Ho Park may be pitching for his
freedom this week when he takes the mound for the South Korean
national team, which is competing in the Asian Games in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who turns 26 next June 30, has received several deferments
for the mandatory two-year military service time every South Korean
male must complete before his 27th birthday. Park has been able to
defer his time because he has hidden behind the status of student
while he takes English courses.
</P>
<P>
   Park's status as a national hero in South Korea has helped him
slide back home. Last week, Park told reporters covering the event
in Bangkok that he has a deal set up with the South Korean
government that might allow him to bypass military service if he
helps lead his team to the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Park could be forced to lose up to two years of big-league
service if his government forces the issue and makes him do his
military time. More important, Park, who was 15-9 with a 3.71 ERA
last season, could easily lose upwards of $10 million if that
becomes the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't care about that now,'' Park said. ``I only care
about winning (in Thailand).''
</P>
<P>
   That's a stark contrast to what he told reporter Ken Daley four
years ago: ``Of course the military duty is a law, and I have to
abide by it. But if the Korean government does give me more time to
stay here and play a little bit more baseball, that would be
greatly appreciated. . . . If I become an important player here,
hopefully they will.'' &QL; 
On thin ice? &QL; 
The Atlanta Braves say they are between $5 and $8 million over
budget for the 1999 season. The Braves are looking at a payroll of
nearly $75 million right now.
</P>
<P>
   The one player who should be most worried about his future with
the club is left fielder  &UR; Ryan Klesko, whose $4.75 million salary
for next season is just about the amount the club wants to cut in
order to meet its 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko should also worry since the club recently signed
outfielders
 &UR; Brian Jordan and  &UR; Otis Nixon, who is the only true leadoff hitter
on the club's 40-man roster. Klesko is fully aware that his name
has been mentioned most often in trade rumors this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Making Klesko's status with Atlanta more tenuous were his 18
home runs last season, his lowest total since his rookie season in
1994. Add his .259 average with just two home runs in the second
half of the season and it's no wonder the Braves are shopping
Klesko. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; You'd think the guy would step up to the $100 tables now:  &UR; Randy
 &UR; Johnson, new ace of the Diamondbacks staff, was spotted playing
blackjack in Las Vegas last week at a $5 table.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There is joy in Mudville, well, at least Detroit:
 &UR; Ernie Harwell, the Hall of Fame voice behind the Detroit Tigers for
32 years ending in 1991, will return behind the mike in 1999.
Harwell is arguably the most popular sports figure in the Motor
City.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Roy Smalley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here's a sign Arizona should hope it never sees: For the fourth
consecutive year, the Cleveland Indians expect to sell out every
home game before they begin spring training. Of course, that means
no one can ever walk up and buy a ticket to a game this summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last time he said this he wound up playing one game
 &UR; in the outfield for Boston: Jose Canseco insists he wants to play
the outfield next season for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who signed
the one-time Most Valuable Player to a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trivia for the buffs: Hats off to  &UR; Si Johnson, the last man to
strike out  &UR; Babe Ruth. Johnson was a young pitcher for Cincinnati
when he whiffed the mighty Bambino three times in one game on May
29, 1935, one day before Ruth played his final game. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Could there possibly be any higher compliment than the one
delivered by Minnesota Manager  &UR; Tom Kelly last week after  &UR; Paul
Molitor retired? Kelly said, ``Paul Molitor? On the baseball field,
he's a moving clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Only  &UR; Mark McGwire,  &UR; Barry Bonds,  &UR; Sammy Sosa,  &UR; Andres
 &UR; Galarraga,  &UR; Mike Piazza and  &UR; Matt Williams have more 30-homer
seasons in their careers than Philadelphia's new left fielder,  &UR; Ron
Gant.
</P>
<P>
   Of the players on Atlanta's 40-man roster, only 10 have appeared
in a World Series game for the Braves. They are:  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Glavine,  &UR; Andruw Jones,  &UR; Chipper Jones,  &UR; Ryan Klesko,  &UR; Javier
Lopez,  &UR; Greg
 &UR; Maddux,  &UR; Eddie Perez,  &UR; John Smoltz,  &UR; Mark Wohlers and  &UR; Otis Nixon,
who returns to Atlanta next year.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, which offered then free-agent pitcher
 &UR; Kevin Brown a five-year deal worth $55 million and was willing to
take it up to six years and $70 million, had never negotiated a
contract higher than the three-year, $15 million deal it gave  &UR; Greg
Vaughn last year.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest reason  &UR; B.J. Surhoff turned down Pittsburgh's
four-year offer for $16 million was the franchise's uncertainty of
getting its new stadium built, which, in turn, leads to uncertainty
the Pirates will remain in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds will make subtle changes in their uniforms
for the 1999 season, adding the ever-popular color of black to
their trim. In addition, the club will rid itself of the red-billed
white caps, the ones that made the players look like ice cream
salesmen. More drastic changes are planned for the uniforms when
the club moves into its new digs in 2002. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota General Manager  &UR; Terry Ryan receives several weekly
phone calls about the availability of pitcher  &UR; Brad
 &UR; Radke, turning each one away with ease. However, if Seattle were to
offer, say,  &UR; Ryan Anderson, the Twins might be willing to part with
Radke.
</P>
<P>
   Of Baltimore's top three prospects _ first baseman
 &UR; Calvin Pickering, second baseman  &UR; Jerry Hairston Jr., and third
baseman
 &UR; Ryan Minor _ the Orioles appear willing to part with Minor, the
former All-America basketball player at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Orel Hershiser, just 10 victories shy of reaching 200 for his
career, is talking about signing with either Florida or Tampa Bay,
both of which are a short flight or drive away from his Orlando
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has its eyes on  &UR; Bill Haselman and may make the
free-agent catcher a contract offer within a matter of weeks, if
not days. Part of the reason the Tigers are so interested was a
glowing recommendation from  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre, now with the
Diamondbacks.``'' &QL;

NO BIG DEAL, BUT BAN ON HUNT CONTESTS IS NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You may not want to hear any more about Predator Hunt
Extreme or any predator hunting contests.
</P>
<P>
   It's a frustrating topic. The number of predator hunters is
minuscule. Will the media-generated furor over these contests never
go away?
</P>
<P>
   No, it won't. And that's why we must address it again.
</P>
<P>
   Predator Hunt Extreme was promoted by two Mesa men early this
year. It offered a $10,000 prize for the hunter who killed the most
coyotes, bobcats or foxes.
</P>
<P>
   The media jumped on the story, and public outrage caused the
event to be canceled. Those who sponsored it thought they were
doing a good thing. Reduce predator numbers, they believed, and
deer populations would grow. More hunting opportunities, of course.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking is flawed. You can trap, shoot, poison or run down
coyotes with sight dogs. You might reduce their numbers
temporarily, but they are almost as adaptable as a cockroach.
They'll fill their niche.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love coyotes. I sat in a boat at Lake
Pleasant last week and forgot fishing as a coyote worked its way
along the shoreline. They are marvelous animals.
</P>
<P>
   I've called coyotes any number of times. I used to shoot them
but now just like to see them approach after being attracted by the
call of a wounded rabbit or the like.
</P>
<P>
   Predator hunts aren't the only contests being staged in Arizona.
In northwest Arizona, prairie dog hunts have some enthusiasts. A
.243 rifle, a good scope and patience pays off when the prairie
dogs come to sit above their burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Even anti-hunting groups will admit that predator hunting
contests have almost no impact on populations. It's calling in a
coyote that matters most, not shooting it. The number of predators
killed during contests is extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   I have a friend who is a good shot and an avid coyote hunter.
Yet he misses more than he hits. I suspect his heart is not in
killing the animals, just calling and seeing them. And I must admit
that seeing a coyote running toward you and jumping over you at the
final moment is pretty thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   But Game and Fish commissioners have another problem here:
public perception. A vast majority of the public doesn't hunt.
Arizona has become an urban state. Most citizens don't mind
hunting, but killing for prizes turns them off.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights people call them body-count contests. That's
roughly true.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter to the general public that the hunts have
little or no biological impact. They don't like the idea of bounty
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish commissioners know the biological impact _
nothing. But they also know that the non-hunting public doesn't
favor these contests.
</P>
<P>
   Know what? At their March meeting in Tucson, commissioners
probably will vote to impose a rule that will eliminate organized
hunting contests. They probably have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   They admitted at a public meeting in Phoenix on Friday that if
they don't impose such a rule, that a vote on an initiative by the
people probably will.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of initiative killed trapping on public land in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   All of this doesn't sit well with some commissioners. Wildlife
management in this state has advanced in leaps and bounds. But
despite that management, the courts have taken over some wildlife.
The public wants to manage others.
</P>
<P>
   That's neither good nor bad. Wildlife belongs to the people.
They may not be able to make biological decisions about it, but
they seem to know what they want.
</P>
<P>
   My gut feeling is that rule making on the proposal should be
ended. Hunting contests are such a small part of Arizona hunting
that they mean nothing. Another restrictive rule probably isn't
just.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm a hunter. My non-hunting friends tell me I'm a monster
for not condemning these contests. I may be a monster but not for
thinking this isn't a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to ``The Republic'' last week carried the thought that
newly introduced Mexican gray wolves would be hiding in the bushes
waiting to eat schoolchildren. That is a completely uneducated
view. That simply doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   But wildlife is public domain. Educated or not, the public has a
right to have its say in wildlife management, except if it hurts
the resource. &QL;

ISLANDERS LAUGHABLY BAD IN 2-1 LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ On most nights, the Tampa Bay Lightning looks
like the league laughingstock. Saturday night, the Lightning had
company.
</P>
<P>
   The game against the New York Islanders at Nassau Coliseum was
funny, all right. But not in a good way.
</P>
<P>
   The league-worst Lightning was laughably bad, and so were the
slumping Islanders. There were so many misfired shots. There were
more than a few errant passes. And there were two games worth of
play stoppages. It made for a game that was almost unwatchable.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed fitting that the Islanders lost, 2-1, on an own
goal with 43 seconds left in overtime. It was scored by Benoit
Hogue, who was standing behind the goal. His shot deflected off of
Islanders' defenseman Scott Lachance's knee, off of Tommy Salo, the
Islanders' goalie, and finally into the back of the netting.
</P>
<P>
   The goalies played well, at least. Salo made 24 saves. Corey
Schwab made 34 saves for the Lightning, who withstood a late flurry
by the Islanders. The Islanders' Claude Lapointe hit the post for
the second time Saturday night with 6 minutes 22 seconds left.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Islanders came into Saturday night's game having lost six
straight and nine of their last 11. They came in with a chance to
end their miserable slide against the Lightning, which the
Islanders had beaten six straight times, including four straight
shutouts. When the Islanders were mired in an 0-10-1 slide last
season, they beat the Lightning in Tampa for some temporary relief.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow and sloppy first period, both teams scored once in
the second period. Karl Dykhuis gave the Lightning a 1-0 lead with
a slap shot that beat Salo over the shoulder 43 seconds into the
period. He was set up by Chris Gratton, who was obtained from the
Flyers this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Dykhuis' goal ended the Islanders' shutout streak against the
Lightning at 277 minutes 44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Linden scored a shorthanded goal for the Islanders at
17:14 to tie the score at 1-1. He stick-handled out of the corner
to the slot, where he slapped the puck through Schwab's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the start of Saturday night's game, the
Lightning re-acquired Gratton, a talented center, for offensive
right wing Mikael Renberg in a four-player deal. Tampa Bay also got
Mike Sillinger; Philadelphia got Daymond Langkow. In August 1997,
the Lightning lost Gratton, then a restricted free agent, to the
Flyers, who tendered a front-loaded, $16 million offer sheet.
Rather than send five first-round draft picks as compensation,
Philadelphia sent Renberg to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard above center ice at Nassau Coliseum will be
replaced by a new $3 million scoreboard. which will be in place for
the Islanders' next home game, on Dec. 22. The old scoreboard,
which has a broken video board and does not show replays, penalty
time or shots on goal, was part of the off-season legal battle
between Nassau County and the team. The team said the hoist holding
up the scoreboard was unsafe and later moved out of the arena.
...The Islanders scratched Jason Dawe, Eric Brewer, David Harlock
and Mike Hough. ... Islanders enforcer Steve Webb was groggy after
a hard hit into the end boards by Karl Dykhuis in the first period.
He did not return.

PLAYER AGENTS LEARN THE VALUE OF NO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Scott Boras, the agent responsible for
negotiating Kevin Brown's record-setting $105 million contract,
went through law school and honed his skill as a haggler with
nearly two decades of experience. His approach would bankrupt him
in a flea market, but it works in baseball. When a team makes an
offer, Boras says, ``No.'' He does not make a counteroffer, he just
tells the team their offer is not good enough. He does not make a
specific demand. Boras just says no. And he waits.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, most teams continue to forward blind bids to Boras,
whose tactics are being adopted by other agents, and the blind bids
redefine the salary structure. The agents say, no, teams increase
their bids in increments of tens of millions of dollars, and
baseball's competitive disparity worsens. Brown's annual salary of
$15 million for the Los Angeles Dodgers will be nearly double the
payroll of the Montreal Expos next season. If he pitches 220
innings, he will earn $68,182 per inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, major-league baseball's executive vice
president, leaned against a door in the press room here just after
the Dodgers announced the deal. Alderson wore a slight smile, his
expression somewhere between bemused and disgusted, and made it
very clear that the contract appalled him. As the payrolls
escalate, he said, more and more teams in baseball's middle class
will be inclined to slash their payrolls and not bother pretending
to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   How many teams, Alderson was asked, could win the World Series
next year? ``Twelve to 15 can get into the playoffs,'' Alderson
said. That means that when the season opens, 15 to 18 teams don't
have a chance to make the playoffs. Fans of 15 to 18 teams will be
buying tickets to watch clubs that cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson does not blame the proficiency of the agents or the
incompetence of those negotiating for the teams, feeling only that
the agents understand how to exploit the competitiveness of the
big-market teams. But Alderson was being far too charitable: the
teams have been incompetent in negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some examples. The Baltimore Orioles opened
negotiations with first baseman Rafael Palmeiro last month by
offering a three-year, $22.5 million contract, and when Palmeiro
balked, the Orioles increased their bid to $32 million over four
years. At the time, Palmeiro appeared to have no other comparable
offers. He wanted to sign with Texas, but the Rangers were bidding
heavily for Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles could have given Palmeiro a deadline. They could
have negotiated aggressively and created their own leverage by
courting Clark simultaneously, and forcing Palmeiro to risk losing
his best offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles waited just long enough for Texas to fall out of
the running for Johnson and then forward a five-year, $45 million
offer to Palmeiro. Only after they lost out on Palmeiro did the
Orioles sign Clark to a two-year, $11 million deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees offered Bernie Williams a five-year, $60 million
deal. Boras, who represents Williams, said no, not good enough. The
Arizona Diamondbacks' first bid to Williams: eight years, $100
million, with much deferred money that reduced the actual value.
Boras said no. The Boston Red Sox stepped in with a seven-year,
$91.5 million offer. Boras said no.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Yankees offered Williams a seven-year, $87.5
million deal, a package $50 million greater than they offered a
year ago. There was no haggling with Boras. He kept saying no. The
Yankees went from $37.5 millions to $60 million to $87.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most executives around baseball believed that few teams would
seriously contend with the Mets for the services of catcher Mike
Piazza. The Mets extended a six-year, $78 million deal offer, a
package worth $15 million more than any deal given to a position
player, a staggering bid. Piazza's representatives said no. The
Mets increased their offer by a year and $13 million; his
seven-year, $91 million deal was a record for exactly 47 days. The
Dodgers surpassed that record by about 15 percent with their deal
for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Diamondbacks officials met to consider all their
options for a starting shortstop, and they generated a list that
had Jay Bell at the top. Bell is an aging, steady shortstop with
above-average offensive ability. Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks'
owner, reportedly left the room for about 20 minutes, then
returned. ``You've got your guy,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was out of the room, Colangelo had called Boras, who
represents Bell, and offered a five-year, $34 million deal;
executives with other teams estimated Bell's worth to be little
more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   For once, Boras had said yes immediately. He knows a good deal
when he hears one. Teams, on the other hand, are still trying to
understand what a good deal is. &QL;

DIMAGGIO SHOWS DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ With his family preparing for a funeral, Joe
DiMaggio made yet another remarkable comeback, one that left his
doctor thinking of upgrading his condition from critical to serious
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable improvement,'' Dr. Earl Barron told The
Associated Press. ``He was awake and talking to us. He is back to
where he was on Thanksgiving Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron credited the 84-year-old Hall of Famer's dramatic
improvement to an antibiotic _ Rifampin _ being administered
intravenously rather than orally after doctors realized that the
medicine was not being absorbed into DiMaggio's bloodstream. That
had been suggested by Dr. Nelson Zyde, an infectious-diseases
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this discovery had not been made, we would not be talking
about a live person,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's longtime friend and attorney, said
DiMaggio's two granddaughters, their husbands and the four
great-grandchildren flew home to California on Friday night,
thinking the situation was hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaughters ``were crying hysterically yesterday, and
they said their goodbyes,'' he said. ``I really said goodbye to
him, too. I thought that was the last time I'd see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said he even called an airline to make reservations to
the San Francisco area _ the planned site of the funeral. DiMaggio
had awakened from a coma on Friday, but Engelberg went home
thinking the worst.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's fever went down overnight, and his
white-blood-cell count had improved dramatically, Barron said.
X-rays showed an infected lung was largely clear of fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the X-rays today,'' Engelberg said. ``Before, you
couldn't see the lung. Now you can actually see his rib cage,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron daily has given Engelberg a rating of 1 to 10 on
DiMaggio's health, with 10 the best. Saturday, Engelberg said he
gave him a 5, the highest since DiMaggio had his first major
setback on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sitting in a chair and sees and comprehends things,''
said Joe Nachio, DiMaggio's friend of 56 years. ``Now he's got a
fighting chance _ a 50-50 chance.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Engelberg, Nachio has been trying to lift
DiMaggio's spirits since he arrived on Tuesday from Panama to visit
DiMaggio at Memorial Regional Hospital here, where the former
Yankees center fielder has been since Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a funny guy,'' Engelberg said. ``He said, `Joe, there's
no center-field job open for you up there yet. Remember, you've got
bad knees.'''
</P>
<P>
   After lung cancer surgery on Oct. 14, DiMaggio has been near
death now four times, Barron has acknowledged, and Engelberg has
taken to calling him the Miracle Man.
</P>
<P>
   Nachio suggested Saturday that DiMaggio sign some baseballs
inscribed, ``the Miracle Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' Engelberg said. ``I kid around with `Miracle Man,' but
he'll always be the Yankee Clipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said DiMaggio squeezed his hand Saturday. He said
DiMaggio was trying to talk, but could not because of his
tracheotomy. ``I said, `Joe, I brought you in here Oct. 12, and I
promised to bring you home,'' he said. ``Now don't you dare let me
down.' He squeezed my hand three or four times.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said the head nurse treating DiMaggio advised them on
Friday to turn his respirator off, signifying that she felt there
was no hope and meaning he would likely die within a half-hour.
Engelberg, whom DiMaggio empowered to make such a decision, said he
asked Nachio's opinion, and they agreed not to.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg paused, basking for a moment in this latest good news.
``Some people may think it's like we're writing a script here,'' he
said. ``But if you see the hospital records, it's happening. And
it's a miracle.''

IOC OFFICIAL SAYS SITE VOTES WERE SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ It was a day of mixed signals and
inflammatory allegations at Olympic headquarters, and by the time
it ended, Marc Hodler, a senior International Olympic Committee
member, had expressed his belief that Salt Lake City was not the
only Olympic city that had tried to buy favors and votes in the
bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, a certain part of the votes always have been
given through corruption,'' said Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss who
is a former president of the International Ski Federation and a
member of the elite IOC executive board that is meeting here until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of remarkable conversations with reporters, Hodler
said Saturday that at least four individuals he termed ``agents''
have offered blocks of IOC members' votes to cities bidding for the
Games, in exchange for payments ranging from $500,000 to as much as
$5 million in case of victory. Hodler said one of the agents was an
IOC member, although he declined to name him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promises that he will give enough votes so they can win,''
Hodler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, who is responsible for establishing the Olympic Games'
bid procedures, said he believed that ``5 to 7 percent'' of the
IOC's 115 members asked for financial support in exchange for their
votes. Without offering specifics, he also suggested that both
Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, circumvented the rules in their
successful bids to host the 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Nagano's bid, Hodler said, ``Certainly they had to
do things which were not legitimate.'' Asked whether Atlanta had
been clean, he initially answered, ``Certainly not''; later he said
that it was difficult to imagine that ``Atlanta could have been
facing this blackmail'' from agents without ``doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler's comments came the day after Bruce Baird, an Australian
politician formerly in charge of Sydney's bid for the 2000 Summer
Olympics, told The Sydney Morning Herald that he was approached by
someone who told him he could secure African IOC votes in exchange
for bribes. John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic
Committee and a member of the bidding team, confirmed that account
Saturday in Lausanne, and said Sydney had broken no bidding rules
in its attempt to secure the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's hard to believe, but I give them the benefit of
the doubt,'' Hodler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler wants to strip the right to select Olympic cities from
the general IOC membership and give it to the 11-member executive
board, perhaps in conjunction with members of the small committee
that now evaluates bids on technical merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People we trust; people we know,'' Hodler said in describing
his ideal voting group. ``Don't forget that about 50 IOC members
are not interested in Winter Games and are not familiar with winter
sports. They ask their wives where they want to spend holidays in
the winter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hodler said IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch had encouraged
him to lobby for electoral change at the next general meeting in
Seoul, South Korea, in June. But Samaranch and the executive board
clearly were not in full accord with Hodler's comments Saturday. In
the late afternoon, the executive board released a statement
disassociating itself from Hodler's allegations ``in connection
with the Olympic bid process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These allegations come as a surprise to us,'' said Francois
Carrard, the IOC director general, who added, ``Hodler is a very
highly respected IOC member who expresses his personal views.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch had to wait for the stage early in the afternoon
inside Olympic headquarters while Hodler continued detailing his
allegations during an impromptu news conference. After belatedly
taking his seat, Samaranch said: ``The spokesmen for the IOC
executive board are Carrard and myself. All the other comments are
personal comments, not official comments.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive board formed a special commission on Friday to
investigate scholarship payments made to relatives of some IOC
members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful bid to
hold the 2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee had
said that the payments came from a privately financed $500,000 fund
that was started in 1991, the year it lost the bidding for the 1998
Games to Nagano.

DODGERS BLASTED FOR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown will make $15 million per season
for the next seven seasons, which means he'll make roughly $500,000
every time he takes the mound to start a game.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year, $105 million deal Brown agreed to Saturday sent
shockwaves throughout baseball, and not many people outside the
Dodgers organization were happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, the former general manager of the Oakland A's
and now the executive vice president of baseball operations in the
commissioner's office, was one of the most outspoken in his
criticism of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good baseball deal. This is not a decision made
by a baseball man _ I don't believe,'' Alderson said, implying the
deal was ordered by Fox executives.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group purchased the Dodgers last spring
from Peter O'Malley for a record $311 million. Some worried a
Murdoch-owned franchise would wreak havoc on the baseball market,
and now they believe their fears have been realized.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, however, defended the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers do not take payroll disparity and economic
responsibility lightly,'' general manager Kevin Malone said in a
statement. ``We are sensitive to the financial concerns of the
industry. This type of monetary commitment to a player of Kevin
Brown's abilities would enable us to field a championship-caliber
club now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner (Bud Selig) is completely frustrated,''
Alderson said in response to the statement. ``The commissioner held
a meeting last week in Chicago that wasn't even attended by the
people who made the decision. To me, that was an affront to the
commissioner. The media comments you have in the release are an
affront to the commissioner and an affront to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, who went to the World Series with Brown in
1998, were in the running for the 33-year-old pitcher but simply
couldn't come up with good reason to offer a deal like the
Dodgers'. Padres owner John Moores had lobbied to keep Murdoch from
buying the Dodgers because he believed Murdoch would hurt the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to criticize Kevin Brown, but it's a truly tragic
day for baseball,'' Moores said. ``It's extraordinary. It confirms
my worst fears about what would happen if we let Murdoch buy the
Dodgers, and I think it represents a continuation of a very bad
series of events in baseball after a spectacular season.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brown, the Padres have lost center fielder Steve
Finley and third baseman Ken Caminiti from last season's National
League champions.
</P>
<P>
   Moores said the Padres' top offer to Brown was six years for $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were holding our nose on that because six years for a
pitcher is absurd,'' Moores said. ``But we were going to step up to
it because he's obviously a great pitcher and we wanted to give it
our best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the system is at the point of absolutely breaking
down. A number of people ought to be held responsible. Not just the
agents, but the players' association and the ownership of major
league baseball. We're on the verge of destroying the
competitiveness of many, many ballclubs. Maybe this will be the
straw that broke the camel's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Indians general manager John Hart said the Brown deal
only amplifies what has been taking place this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the horse is already out of the barn,''
Hart said. ``We are starting to see a separation from those clubs
that are almost going to a supergroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, Brown's agent, said the reaction to the deal is an
overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry behavior will always reflect that the contract of the
moment is the death knell for the society as a whole,'' he said
sarcastically. ``That's the drum that's going to be pounded _
especially close to L.A.'' &QL;

NBA NEGOTIATIONS BREAK OFF 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The chances of the National Basketball Association having a
season looked even dimmer Saturday after labor talks in Manhattan
broke off after only 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Though no progress was made, neither the league nor the players
union characterized the private negotiating session as divisive.
But with about a month required to restart the season, the pendulum
is swinging more and more toward losing the entire 1998-99
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``No progress was made,'' said Russ Granik, the NBA deputy
commissioner. ``Nothing's really changed. We're no closer on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said: ``We didn't
leave on bad terms. We had indicated to them we had some general
parameters pertaining to certain issues that we would be prepared
to take back to our negotiating committee. When we indicated what
they were, they took the position that it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, we felt we should just end the meeting while it
was still amicable.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether there had been any movement in the
percentages of total revenue demanded by the two sides, a key
issue. The players have proposed receiving 58 percent, while the
owners have said they envision a system in which the players would
receive between 52 percent and 53.5 percent for the first few years
of a new agreement. No further talks have been planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always hopeful,'' Hunter said, regarding whether an
agreement could be signed before the season is lost. ``I don't
believe in `no.' It's not in my vocabulary and it's not conducive
to negotiations.''

NEW SPEAKER TO VOTE FOR IMPEACHMENT, OPPOSE CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Leads with new comments from interview.) 
(rl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMOND, La. _ Rep. Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the
House, said Saturday night that he adamantly supported impeachment
of President Clinton and would fight to prevent a censure
resolution from a vote in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   After the House Judiciary Committee voted Saturday night to barr
a censure resolution offered by Democrats, Livingston said for the
first time that he considered it to be an attack on the rules, and
therefore an attack on the speaker and on the majority party.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack on the rules is an attack on the chair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in an interview before returning to Washington from New
Orleans, Livingston also said he would vote to impeach the
president on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had committed perjury and added, ``That's not
acceptable and must be dealt with in the only constitutional
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he opposed censure because it was ``not
envisioned in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a constitutional responsibility to charge or not
charge, impeach or not impeach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Livingston raised the issue of Watergate to buttress his
argument. He said the president's sex scandal was as
``inconsequential'' as the ``third-rate burglary'' that led to the
Watergate scandal except, he said, that he believed Nixon had not
perjured himself whereas he believed Clinton had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon faced impeachment because he covered up a burglary
committed by others,'' he said. ``He did not perjure himself in
that cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said Clinton, however, had admitted ``certain acts
that he covered up and admits to having covered up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for
Clinton?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was particularly adamant that he would reject a
written request from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt asking for
censure. Such a penalty, Livingston, ``is outside the rules of the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Livingston has been deliberately ambiguous about
whether he would allow such a vote. As one who strongly supports
the committee system, Livingston has been at pains to avoid
sounding as if he were interfering with the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks earlier in the day, he suggested that Clinton's
apology to the nation on Friday was not enough to influence his own
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief talk with reporters before he gave the commencement
address at Southeastern Louisiana University, Livingston, a former
criminal prosecutor, evinced a clear displeasure with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has his own actions to justify,'' he said. ``I
will not seek to give him counsel at this late date. A year has
gone by, and we've concentrated on little other than his actions in
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that judging by the reaction of his colleagues to the
president's newest expression of regret, ``it doesn't appear that
it's made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than responding to these questions, Livingston seemed to
revel in his distance from Washington this weekend. He delivered a
commencement speech here Saturday that was void of any reference to
the goings-on. Rather, he painted a self-deprecating portrait of
himself as a kind of knockabout who achieved what he has by having
a lot of luck and a good mother.
</P>
<P>
   He told the students that from today on, they should make the
right choices, ``not sell out for money or betray my friends or my
conscience or my religious convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make the wrong choices, if you do take that short way
out,'' he added, ``you might get by with it, but sooner or later,
the piper's got to be paid and you'll fall in the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure has been building in Washington for Livingston to step
into the breach. He has talked behind the scenes with Democrats,
including Gephardt and John Podesta, Clinton's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the 31 Democrats who had voted to
allow the Judiciary Committee to proceed with the impeachment
inquiry wrote a letter urging Livingston to allow a vote on an
alternative to impeachment when the full House took up the matter
next week.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With impassioned prayers, adoring serenades, candles
and wave upon wave of red roses, thousands of Mexican immigrants
across New York rejoiced Saturday in the Feast of Our Lady of
Guadalupe, celebrating the Virgin they revere as their patron in
Masses, at neighborhood fiestas and with an early morning marathon
in which hundreds of the faithful carried flaming torches across
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the marathon, Antorcha Guadalupana '98, would be
an annual event and was intended to draw attention to the plight of
Mexican workers. Many of of these workers hold the lowest-paying
jobs in service industries _ in kitchens, as cooks and dishwashers;
in groceries, as clerks and stock handlers; behind the counters of
delicatessens and pizza shops; in factories, or among construction
and cleaning crews.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Joel Magallan, a Jesuit who works for the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New York as its liaison to Mexican immigrants, had
urged workers to attend the festivities even if it meant defying
their employers. ``We don't have any kind of day off for them,''
Magallan said. ``Some are people who are working 70 hours a week.
And they are working seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tepeyac Association, a Mexican cultural group, had predicted
that the holiday observance would amount to a general strike. But
Magallan and dozens of other people interviewed Saturday said few
had jeopardized their jobs by skipping work. Some, interviewed
after they had attended pre-dawn Mass, said they were on their way
to work and would rejoin the festivities later. Others said they
had arranged to take the day off without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than working, it's important to pay respects,'' said
Ramiro Resendic, 25, a deli worker in midtown Manhattan who took
the day off. He said the celebration was worth losing a day's pay
of about $70. ``All Mexicans are more united because we have a day
to celebrate here,'' he said. ``We are taking this day to tell more
people and more people we want to live in the United States with
all the rights everybody else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high number of illegal immigrants, it is
difficult to measure the Mexican population in New York City, but
estimates by the federal government and scholars put the number
somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Resendic was standing in an early morning chill waiting for the
marathon to begin outside the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe on
West 14th Street. Gathering around him were groups of runners from
dozens of parishes throughout the city and from churches in
Yonkers, White Plains, and Newburgh, N.Y. Many wore white warm-up
jackets with a multicolored drawing of the Virgin on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The feast commemorates the Virgin Mary's appearance to Juan
Diego, an Aztec peasant, in 1531. The vision restored the faith of
Mexican natives who were in danger of losing their land, culture
and traditions after the Spanish conquest. The Virgin filled Juan
Diego's cloak with roses and left an image of herself on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest religious holiday of the year,'' Magallan
said. ``We say that we are more Guadalupanos than Mexicans. We say
that because Our Lady Guadalupe is our symbol, our identity. Our
Lady Guadalupe is stronger in the United States because she is the
mother of the oppressed people, of the people who are being
discriminated against. She is the protector, and so in New York
City when we are feeling we are suffering that kind of situation,
she becomes a stronger symbol to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   As the runners assembled, many waved the flag of Mexico. Chants
erupted from the crowd. Worshippers packed the church for the dawn
Mass to sing mananitas, the traditional songs greeting the Virgin.
Many carried roses, which they kissed and touched to a huge image
of Guadalupe on the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Juvier Mejia of the Bronx said, ``I came to observe the
Virgin and asked her to help me with work and with money and to
help my family.''
</P>
<P>
   David Solano, 24, a vendor on West 14th Street selling churros,
the Mexican fritters, and champurrado, the chocolate and corn meal
drink, said, ``We have faith in her. She's like the mama of all the
Mexicans.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Dec. 05,

<P>
   &UR; THE UNIVERSAL DONOR &LR;  By Craig Nova. Norton, $13. A Los Angeles
doctor, trying to save his lover after she is bitten by a snake
that she is studying, is forced to track down a psychopathic
criminal who shares her rare blood type. Part love story, part
thriller, this novel explores ``highly emotional conflicts without
resorting to either sentimentality or cliche,'' Scott Bradfield
wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CRYSTAL FRONTIER: A NOVEL IN NINE STORIES &LR;  By Carlos
Fuentes. Translated by Alfred Mac Adam. Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$13. In a series of tales centering on a powerful tycoon and his
family, the prolific Mexican author explores the troubled relations
between his native country and the United States. Last year New
York Times reviewer Jay Parini found the stories uneven but said
that at their best they display ``acute observation'' and a fine
``sense of satire.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECCENTRIC NEIGHBORHOODS &LR;  By Rosario Ferr. Plume, $12.95. This
is a sweeping novel about the shifting fortunes of two upper-crust
families in Puerto Rico, one representing the nation's agrarian
past and the other its industrial future. ``The author's voice is
bright and vital,'' Mark Childress wrote earlier this year. ``The
magic in Ferr's fiction arises from the intertwined experiences of
human beings, carrying the story of 20th-century Puerto Rico in the
arc of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MRS. KEPPEL AND HER DAUGHTER &LR;  By Diana Souhami. St. Martin's
Griffin, $14.95. This chronicle of adultery, homosexuality and
intrigue among the British aristocracy focuses on Alice Keppel, the
winsome mistress of Queen Victoria's eldest son, both as prince of
Wales and as King Edward VII, and her daughter, Violet, whose heart
was broken when her affair with the writer Vita Sackville-West hit
the skids. The result is a ``fascinating, richly textured story,''
Kennedy Fraser wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE QUEEN: A BIOGRAPHY OF ELIZABETH II &LR;  By Ben Pimlott. Wiley,
$18.95. A professor of politics and contemporary history at the
University of London argues that the queen's dutiful, passive reign
is in keeping with Britain's sense of itself and its history. In
1997 the New York Times reviewer, Andrew Sullivan, called this a
``superbly judicious biography'' with ``a wry awareness of the
paradox of a populist monarchy being at the center of a
constitutional democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRUEST PLEASURE &LR;  By Robert Morgan. Algonquin, $11.95. In
this historical novel, set in rural North Carolina early in the
century, a religious woman tells of her difficult marriage to an
industrious, practical-minded man, and their conflicting views of
salvation and devotion. ```The Truest Pleasure' is a quietly
audacious book,'' Richard Bausch wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1995. ``It contains characters and situations that aren't
easy to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAN WHO ATE EVERYTHING: AND OTHER GASTRONOMIC FEATS,
DISPUTES, AND PLEASURABLE PURSUITS &LR;  By Jeffrey Steingarten.
Vintage, $14. In these obsessively omnivorous essays, the food
critic for Vogue describes his far-flung gastronomic adventures,
stopping along the way with morsels of culinary advice and medical
and scientific digressions. ``Steingarten writes with marvelous
ease and clarity and humor,'' Alexander Chancellor said last year.
``His facts are fascinating and so are his recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OLIVES: THE LIFE AND LORE OF A NOBLE FRUIT &LR;  By Mort Rosenblum.
North Point, $15. This is a journalist's freewheeling homage to
Athena's gift to mankind, crammed with history, recipes and health
tips. This is an ``edifying new book,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt
wrote in The New York Times in 1996. ``Pit by pit, his savory
details add up.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FIREWALL: THE IRAN-CONTRA CONSPIRACY AND COVER-UP &LR;  By Lawrence
E. Walsh. Norton, $18. The independent counsel in the Iran-contra
affair answers his many critics, charging that Congress,
conservative judges and, above all, Reagan administration officials
prevented him from meting out justice. ``Walsh's book is a useful
record of the scandal and its aftermath,'' John B. Judis wrote in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUN DANCER &LR;  By David London. University of Nebraska, $14.95.
This first novel is about a bloody confrontation between federal
agents and Indian protesters in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
The result is an ``unflinching look at the conflicts among the
Sioux, and ... the pervasive cynicism and slow-burn despair that
accompany a history of frustrated attempts to set right several
generations of wrongs,'' Scott Martelle said in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOONSHINE: A LIFE IN PURSUIT OF WHITE LIQUOR &LR;  By Alec
Wilkinson. Hungry Mind, $12.95. This profile of a brave and cunning
federal agent named Garland Bunting is also a history of
bootlegging, which these days mostly exploits alcoholics among the
rural poor. In 1985 the reviewer Bob Lancaster found the author's
``reporting style so sharp and economical that the prose fairly
crackles.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FOUDINI M. CAT &LR;  By Susan Fromberg
Schaeffer. Fawcett, $10.95. A precocious house cat recounts his
life and times, from his abandonment as a kitten to his adoption by
a couple he named Warm and Pest. ``This entertaining cat's-eye view
of life ... can be recommended even to those who are less than
entranced by felines,'' Kimberly B. Marlowe wrote last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A touch of dignity and a heavy dose of uncertainty
surround the capital on Saturday, as what seems to be the only city
in the United States that takes impeachment seriously looks toward
a House vote on articles calling for President Clinton to be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   While few are predicting the result with much confidence, there
is one area of agreement _ that the outcome depends on a dozen, or
20, maybe even 30, undecided members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where broad generalizations break down _ as they
have throughout this 11-month agony. The best example came Friday,
when Clinton's latest apology speech was dismissed as a failure,
because he did not say ``I committed perjury'' or ``I lied'' or
even ``I did not tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said they might have been won over by such a
confession, and were disappointed. But that hardly proves that
other lines in the speech, the greater level of expressed sorrow
and even the apology for putting the nation through this mess, did
not matter, either by persuading some other member or by keeping
someone on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   For this process is now in a singular stage, where hundreds of
White House officials and reporters and politicians deal with a
speech heard by several million people, and no more than 30 of the
potential listeners matter.
</P>
<P>
   They are individuals, and even friends who know them well do not
know just what will move them when they have to vote this week. For
some it might be an admission; others may still be wrestling over
the strength of the evidence, or whether the offenses alleged
actually rise to a level demanding impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious example is Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, who said after the
speech that he was disappointed Clinton did not say, ``I didn't
tell the truth under oath.'' But, Ney said, ``It didn't alter me in
any direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ney really seems to be worrying about how he ought to vote, a
position that leaves him vulnerable to a clamor from the right,
which generally approves his conservative voting record. To him
this is a solemn occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The committee seemed to be grappling with solemnity on Saturday,
too, after days of debate in which opposing arguments were
ridiculed as ``smokescreen'' or ``shell game.'' On Saturday
morning, Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's Democratic senator-elect,
said an abuse-of-power count was so broad that its terms could
apply to George Washington, and every president since him.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble of North Carolina, sometimes a fierce
attacker, insisted, ``I'll have knots in my guts next week when I
cast my vote,'' and added, ``I don't take this lightly at all.'' He
said the last time he felt an issue so heavily was nearly eight
years ago when he voted to send U.S. troops into combat in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But while the committee's often petty and almost always partisan
and personalized consideration of the question may be weighed in
history _ no Barbara Jordans were heard last week _ it probably has
no impact whatever on what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   By now most members of the House have made up their minds on
charges, either on the evidence or on their sense of political
survival. In the insular world of the House of Representatives, few
members really have to fear the other party. Among the Republicans
re-elected last month, for example, only 10 won with 52 percent or
less of the vote. Among the Democrats, only five did.
</P>
<P>
   But there are real risks in going against your own party. One is
the din of complaint from old supporters. Another is a possible
primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
   So the focus comes back to those 30 or fewer truly undecided
members _ most, but not quite all of them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders seem sure that defections will be few
enough so they will win the impeachment vote. They are plainly
trying to build momentum with a series of announcements from
members who say they were previously undecided. Some were; some
were just unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   They count on pressure from the Republican base, and sometimes
use the argument that the vote is really inconsequential because
the Senate will ultimately acquit the president.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House and the Democrats, the issues are more
complex. Their target is 11 more Republican defectors than
Democrats who desert the president.
</P>
<P>
   This White House has always had dismal relations with House
Republicans and knows few of them well. It is hard to find a way to
approach them directly.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some careful hopes among those involved in
preserving Clinton's presidency from impeachment and trial.
</P>
<P>
   One belief is that most of the people who say they are undecided
really are.
</P>
<P>
   The second, more dubious hope is that Speaker-designate Robert
Livingston of Louisiana will have to confront a group of
fence-sitters demanding a chance to vote for censure, and arguing
that without one they _ and with them the Republican majority _ are
at risk in 2000. But Mr. Livingston made it clear Saturday night
that he would fight against that option, and it is a fight he will
very likely win.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their hopes are even more uncertain. They think the
public will be alerted by the committee votes, angrily discovering
that the impeachment that pundits so easily dismissed after the
elections is real after all.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that such a suddenly intense unhappiness
will be communicated to members. Once again, just as with the issue
of how Clinton described his dubious statements about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky on Friday, this is not something that can be
measured on a national scale. If three old friends come up to one
wavering Republican after church on Sunday and are furious about
impeachment, that could decide one vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's expectations about the country's mood have
proved wrong all year long _ and the polls that show the public
does not want Clinton thrown out do not reflect much intensity.
Except among African-Americans, it is hard to locate pockets of
dedication to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument to be used _ and perhaps by the president if he
is heard from again before the House vote _ is that the country and
the Congress should not be distracted from real business by the
debilitating experience of a Senate trial, with the undertone that
the exercise is pointless since everyone knows how it will come
out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic counsel,
raised that idea on Thursday when he said impeachment would ``doom
the country to additional months of this ordeal and government
paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that a trial would last months, although no
one ever got rich betting on the Senate to do things quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But it might take it a while to get started, because several
serious procedural questions have not really been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
rattled off a list of those questions on Saturday morning, like a
rules change to explicitly allow the Senate to conduct other
business along with a trial, questions over whether there would be
limits on evidence and numbers of witnesses or the time of
cross-examination, and whether a select committee could be given
some of the Senate's tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
explained last week that he and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
Republican leader, ``are not preparing anything'' pending the House
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch offered a solution, too, to a drawn-out trial when 45
Democratic senators could almost certainly deny the two-thirds
majority required for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Although for months the House Republicans' biggest problem has
been finding a way to put the impeachment genie back in the bottle,
Hatch said the rules make it clear ``that the Senate could at any
time say `We have heard enough''' and end the trial without a
verdict. That, of course, takes one back to the historic difficulty
the Senate has in doing things quickly.

GRAPEVINE RUNNING BACK GETS HIS CHANCE IN 4A TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS NOTEBOOK-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID THOMAS and RICK HERRIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Grapevine senior running back Taylor Farden, who wore a
special shoe to protect broken bones in his foot, played in his
first postseason game yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Farden's numbers for the day: nine carries for 34 yards and a
bunch of big smiles in Grapevine's 22-0 Class 4A Division I
state-title game at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' said Farden, who played in only four games
this season because of foot injuries. ``I didn't think I'd get this
chance. They told me they'd get me back in there, and we kept
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Farden carried five times on Grapevine's final drive. His last
carry took the ball to Bay City's 2-yard line. But on the next
play, quarterback Jordan Wilson took a knee to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So how bad did Farden want to score on that last possession?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad. Very bad,'' he said. ``I just couldn't break that last
tackle.'' Stop right there Bay City ran 11 plays inside Grapevine's
30 in the first half. But the Black Cats accounted for minus-1 yard
on those plays. Bay City had losses on five plays, gains on four
plays, one incompletion and one interception. --- &QC; 
Grapevine coach Mike Sneed told his team this week that if it won
the Class 4A Division I state championship, he would bleach his
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed is about to go blond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be calling me Old Yeller pretty soon,'' Sneed
said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Sneed's second playoff bet payoff. After defeating
favored Greenville in the third round, Sneed had to come to school
dressed as a woman. --- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Give an assist to the Grapevine offense for the Mustangs only
shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bay City coach Warren Trahan said Grapevine's big-play offense
was why he chose not to attempt field goals on three trips inside
the Mustangs' 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their high-scoring offense, three points wouldn't do us
any good,'' Trahan said. ``We had to have seven points every time
we got down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Black Cats got no points.
</P>
<P>
   On their first possession, the Black Cats were stopped on
fourth-and-1 at Grapevine's 27. On their next possession, Cliff
Roberts was intercepted in the end zone on a fourth-and-8 halfback
pass from Grapevine's 22.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-0, Trahan opted to go for it on fourth-and-5 from
Grapevine's 12 late in the first half. Chad Lee was sacked for an
8-yard loss. Then Grapevine drove 80 yards in seven plays for a
17-0 lead. --- &QC; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine running back Josh Cook's 72-yard run in the first
quarter was 33 yards more than he averaged per game during the
regular season. ... Bay City was shut out in both of its losses. In
Week 8 of the regular season, El Campo blanked the Black Cats,
20-0. ... Grapevine quarterback Jordan Wilson passed the 3,000-yard
mark for the season. His 146 yards extended his single-season
school record to 3,070 for the season. His two touchdowns gave him
27 for the season. ... Grapevine has won two of the three Class 4A
Division I state championships. La Marque has won both 4A Division
II titles and will play for its third next week.

   IRVING _ Believe it again. Somehow.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapevine Mustangs' unforeseen playoff ride exceeded
expectations one more time.
</P>
<P>
   In maybe their finest performance of the season, the Mustangs
were transformed from almost counted out in the regular season to
convincing state champions.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine overwhelmed Bay City, 22-0, in the Class 4A Division I
state championship game yesterday before 11,500 at Texas Stadium.
It was the Mustangs' only shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The title is Grapevine's second in three years and was achieved
in the opposite manner of the Mustangs' undefeated, talent-laden
1996 championship team. The Mustangs, who finished second in
District 11-4A, had to win their final two regular-season games
just to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream,'' said Grapevine coach Mike Sneed, tightly
clutching the title trophy. ``To win a championship, I always
thought you needed better talent. This shows what a bunch of good
players, a good coaching staff and a good system can do.''
</P>
<P>
   A .500 team after eight weeks, the Mustangs (11-4) capped their
season with their best game. Grapevine performed well from the
start, instead of needing another second-half revival that had
marked its playoff run. The Mustangs had this title wrapped up by
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bay City (12-2) was a threat early, penetrating Grapevine's
30-yard line on three of its first four possessions. But those
opportunities equaled nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't pull anything off,'' Bay City coach Warren Trahan
said. ``Everything we tried just seemed like it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything worked offensively for Grapevine. Senior running back
Josh Cook rumbled for 223 yards on 26 carries, surpassing Tellis
Redmon's 219-yard effort in the 1996 state championship game. Cook,
who had his second 200-yard game of the playoffs, ran for 718 yards
in the postseason and finished the season with 1,108 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cook exposed a defense expecting Grapevine to pass. Actually,
the Mustangs did that, too. Quarterback Jordan Wilson threw two
touchdown passes to receiver Jason Schindler and finished with a
respectable 146 yards to surpass the 3,000-yard mark for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Schindler, who had three catches for
57 yards. ``I never could in any way think this was possible. I was
joking around with the guys saying we are so terrible, how did we
do this?''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Grapevine's defense finished off its most
impressive effort of the season. Bay City, which entered the game
averaging 320 yards per game, was held to 6 yards in the second
half. Led by outside linebacker Matt France, who finished with a
team-high eight tackles, Grapevine's defense was everywhere Bay
City fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was domination,'' said France, one of eight junior
defensive starters. ``We didn't expect it, but we got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay City quarterback Chad Lee was sacked five times and his
offense was held to 163 yards _ the third team the Mustangs held
under 200 yards in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best game the Grapevine Mustangs have played all
year long,'' Grapevine junior nose guard J.J. Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   As Grapevine's defense stonewalled the Black Cats' offense, Cook
steadily pounded their defense. He averaged 8.5 yards per carry and
ran for 10 of Grapevine's 20 first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine finished the season one playoff victory from equaling
their regular-season win total. The Mustangs defeated four
consecutive teams with at least 10 victories. Bay City was pummeled
under that roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the kids we've been talking about having our best game
of the year, and we had it today,'' Sneed said.

LONGHORNS FIND BANK OPEN LATE IN UPSET OF NO. 25 UTES

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If there was any doubt that Texas was due a
break, it was erased with just over a minute to play last night in
the Erwin Center when Gabe Muoneke banked in a 3-point shot from
the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke's perhaps ill-advised shot with 1:11 to play gave the
Longhorns their biggest lead of the night at 67-61. And despite
some suspect free-throw shooting over the last five minutes, Texas
held on to knock off No. 25 Utah, 73-68.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge win for this team and the program,'' said center Chris
Mihm, who posted a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds.
``A big statement game. There was a real feeling of elation in our
locker room tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas (2-5) won for only the second time this season, but has
now won two of three. Utah, which has three starters back from the
team that lost the NCAA championship game to Kentucky, fell to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Texas beat us is because they are a better team,''
Utah coach Rick Majerus said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the first for Texas over a ranked team under new
coach Rick Barnes and the 31st Top 25 win for him in 11 seasons as
a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I've ever had a team that needed it more,''
Barnes said. ``I've kept telling our team if we'll continue to work
hard we'll make things happen, and maybe we'll get some luck along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight that rim was good to us on a few of those free throws,
and then on Gabe's three from the top of the key, we actually set
that up for him to bank it. That was a really big play at the time.
But I knew we would be ready to play, because in the locker room
before the game that was the most emotion we've had as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played 40 minutes tonight, really a team win. Our most
complete game. It was a great day for Texas. Ricky won the Heisman,
and we won this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris Clack's 18 points led the Longhorns, who also got 14 from
Muoneke. Another key was the defensive job Texas did by holding
Utah guard Andre Miller to 12 points. Chico Vazquez led, with help
from Ivan Wagner and William Clay. UT also picked a season-high 11
steals.
</P>
<P>
   Blanked the first half, Miller scored six of his 12 points to
lead the Utes to a 9-2 spurt to open the second half and turn
around Texas' 35-31 halftime lead. Utah went up 49-42 before Clack
ignited a 10-0 run with assists on a Clay trey and Vazquez's
driving layup. Clack then drove for two and nailed a three with
10:35 left to put Texas back up, 52-49.
</P>
<P>
   The lead changed five times before Clack stole the ball and
scored on a breakaway jam at 5:29 for a 59-57 lead that Texas never
lost _ despite hitting only five of 11 free throws over a
three-minute period until Muoneke and Mihm netted the final four
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real confidence builder for us,'' Clack said. ``We've worked
so hard and to come out and get a victory over a good team like
Utah is really good for us. And we've got a chance to get a lot
better if we keep playing as hard as we did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas plays Wisconsin (9-1) on Tuesday night.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After winning two prestigious awards, Ricky Williams
spent Thursday night in Orlando, Fla., up until 5:30 a.m. talking
football with some of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got about a half-hour of sleep,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, before the biggest night of his 22-year-old life,
Williams and Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop were out until
an ``undisclosed time'' exploring the Big Apple's night life.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky, does the term Up All Night mean anything to you?
</P>
<P>
   What better way to celebrate winning college football's most
prestigious award. Williams was named the 64th winner of the
Heisman Trophy during ceremonies last night at the Downtown
Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not tired,'' Williams said of his social calendar that
will get busier. ``I had no problems sleeping when I got in, but I
had a long night. When did I get in? ... No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams treated the Heisman voting like an opposing defense.
Before the announcement was made after 55 minutes of preliminaries,
Williams said that he was nervous and ``my heart was really beating
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason to get stressed. Williams was first on 714
of the 920 ballots cast. His winning margin of 1,563 votes was the
fourth-largest in Heisman history. He was the first Heisman winner
since Rashaan Salaam in 1994 to finish first in the voting in all
six regions.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's Bishop was second, UCLA's Cade McNown was third
and Kentucky's Tim Couch was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Williams' accomplishments, the landslide was not
surprising. Williams finished with 2,124 yards, leading the
Longhorns to an 8-3 record. In his career, he set 16 NCAA and 44
school records. His most impressive achievement was gaining 6,279
yards in his career, surpassing Tony Dorsett's 22-year-old Division
I-A record of 6,082 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams became Texas' second Heisman Trophy winner; Earl
Campbell won the award in 1977. Campbell and Dorsett both attended
last night's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' whirlwind continues tonight when he'll attend a
private dinner with other Heisman winners. Tomorrow, he's scheduled
to ring the starting bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and
tomorrow night, he'll attend a $250-a-plate Heisman banquet.
Tuesday night, he's scheduled as a guest on the ``Late Show with
David Letterman''.
</P>
<P>
   This Heisman triumph started in January when Williams announced
he would stay in Austin for his senior season instead of declaring
himself eligible for the NFL draft. And, for a person whose e-mail
address is heisman &LR; mail.utexas.edu, it was apparent that Williams
dreamed big dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching the awards show when I was a little kid,''
Williams said. ``I always thought it was pretty cool because it
said the winner was the best player for that season.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Heisman Trophy goes to the best player on a
successful team. Williams' statistics proved his worth; he needed
his team to perform much better than last year's 4-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the day he said he was staying, we felt the pressure,''
said Texas first-year coach Mack Brown. ``The expectations for the
team were higher. People talked about him gaining 1,800 yards; I
thought that would be impossible because people would be gunning
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so competitive and he always set his goals so high. There
are so many things that were against the odds of him doing
everything he did.''
</P>
<P>
   College football's most prestigious award has been as much about
Hype as Heisman. But Texas' sports information department,
acknowledging Williams' role as the preseason favorite, kept their
campaign subtle. The school's ``campaign'' included three postcards
and a weekly conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that the best thing we could do was to have Ricky
talk to as many people, do as many interviews as he could,'' said
UT sports information director John Bianco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a night like this special,'' Brown said. ``It
wouldn't be special if we had someone representing us who wasn't
classy, who didn't stand up for the right things. When I've talked
about how good he is, people have rolled their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so unselfish and humble, but he's got so much confidence.
He's been a pleasure to be around. He's taught us all a lot of
lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Meet The People campaign worked. While Williams' image has
been skewed by his dreadlocks, tattoos (four) and piercings (four),
his Mr. Nice Guy personality _ plus his overwhelming numbers _ won
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me I'd never win the Heisman because of my hair,
because of the piercings,'' said Williams, a silver stud flashing
in his tongue. ``I always said that if that's why they didn't want
to pick me, then I don't want the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people saw I was a good person. It all worked out for
me.''
