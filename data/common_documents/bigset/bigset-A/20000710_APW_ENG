<HEADLINE> Fewer protesters expected in Philly than Seattle  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The Republican National Convention is not
likely to draw as many people as the Seattle demonstrations did
last fall, protest organizers and police say with less than a month
before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10,000 people are expected in Philadelphia - far less
than the 40,000 who flooded Seattle, according to interviews with
veteran organizers and local group leaders. Up to 100,000 had been
forecast for the July 31-Aug. 3 event, but organizers quietly are
saying they expect much fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Several local organizers and police officials have said the buzz
on Internet discussion groups and among East Coast activist groups
is smaller for Philadelphia than it has been before recent large
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to tell, but I don't get the sense that this is
going to be as big as the other ones,'' Deputy Police Commissioner
Robert Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers in Los Angeles say up to 30,000 people could attend
demonstrations during the Democratic National Convention. But, the
West Coast event is likely to draw upon the same group of
demonstrators that protested the World Trade Organization meetings
last fall in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the GOP convention will attract mostly East Coast
activists, including some of the 10,000 people who protested the
International Monetary Fund talks in Washington, D.C., in April.
More than 1,300 people were arrested, but police generally describe
the event as a success because there were few reports of property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty decentralized movement. There are so many
groups, we don't know who will come,'' said Beka Economopoulos of
the Rainforest Action Network, which was a primary organizer in
Seattle and has a smaller role in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the buzz was being created in Seattle. We knew it was
going to be big. There was buzz in Washington. And there's buzz for
the conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest event, Unity 2000 on July 30, is expected to attract
up to 10,000, organizers estimate. The smaller Poor People's March
on July 31, which does not have a permit, is likely to draw fewer
than 3,000, Kensington Welfare Rights Union leader Cheri Honkala
said. And organizers of the July 29 march for universal health care
are predicting several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance could skyrocket with the recent endorsement of Unity
2000 by the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, which could bring thousands of
union workers to the protests. The Seattle movement gathered so
many people, in part, because of the unique partnership between the
unions and environmental advocates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges facing both conventions is that
colleges are not in session.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at Seattle and Washington, a lot of the people who
were there were students who organized on their campuses. They
organized together, then took buses together,'' said Deidre Sinnott
of the New York-based International Action Center, an anti-death
penalty group that plans to send about 100 members to protest the
GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the most populous protests in
Philadelphia have been rallies for death row inmate Mumia
Abu-Jamal. More than 8,000 people attended a ''Millions for Mumia''
march to commemorate Abu-Jamal's 45th birthday in April 1999. And
more than 6,000 people attended a $15-per-head rally at Madison
Square Garden in New York this past May.
</P>
<P>
   But the Philadelphia-based Abu-Jamal support group plans only to
''have a contingent'' in the larger rallies. A day of direct action
- nontraditional street theater, human blockades and spontaneous
hotel rallies - is planned Aug. 1 to oppose the ''prison industrial
complex'' and support Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   But a key indicator could be this weekend's poor showing at a
rally during the National Governor's Meeting in State College.
Fewer than 200 people turned out for rallies in the central
Pennsylvania college town, despite the participation of key leaders
of events planned during the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Unity 2000 leader Michael Morrill, who spoke in State College
Sunday, has publicly predicted up to 50,000 people during the GOP
convention. But he agrees the numbers will be lower in Philadelphia
than Los Angeles or Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be thousands, it could be more. You never know until
it gets closer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tremors Wear on Japanese Residents  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIYAKEJIMA, Japan (AP) -- Keiko Okinaka keeps a helmet and a
packed bag by her bed at night, just in case the earth should begin
to rumble again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sleep with my clothes on so I can get up and run,'' said the
62-year-old resident of Miyakejima, an island off Japan's west
coast that has been rocked by earthquakes, buffeted by a typhoon
and seen its highest peak spit out volcanic ash in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Few on Miyakejima are strangers to the brutal forces of nature.
The volcanic island has erupted several times in the past 60 years,
including a 1940 blast that killed 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   But ongoing tremors and worries about what will happen next have
begun to wear on the island's 4,000 inhabitants. While past
eruptions usually came and went in just days, the latest seismic
activity began in June and has yet to show signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the area was jolted by a magnitude 6.1 earthquake
that sent rocks and mud tumbling from cliffs, cracked roads and
burst a water pipe. Most of the damage occurred on Kozushima, an
island about 100 miles south of Tokyo and in the same chain as
Miyakejima.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama, Miyakejima's highest peak, had coughed up a cloud
of yellowish ash just hours before. The eruption, which showered
cars, houses and streets with tiny stones, did not include lava
flow, and officials said they did not plan to issue an evacuation
order.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time the volcanic island erupted in recent
weeks. In late June, magma moving beneath its rocky surface
triggered an undersea explosion just off its western coast.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people were evacuated. The order was lifted after
experts said magma was flowing away from the island under the
seabed, lessening the chance of the volcano spewing lava onto
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Miyakejima and neighboring islands have since been rattled by
tens of thousands of quakes, including about 3,500 strong enough to
be felt, as part of the area's latest bout of volcanic activity.
Fallen rocks killed a motorist in a magnitude-6.4 tremor on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a typhoon that left at least three dead elsewhere
in Japan dumped torrential rain on Miyakejima last week.
</P>
<P>
   Innkeeper Gentaro Kikuchi said the recent seismic activity has
scared away many potential visitors to the lush green island, which
is a haven for dolphin watchers, fishermen and other outdoor
enthusiasts. Travel agents have canceled many tours for the rest of
the month, and most inns and hotels are almost empty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kikuchi said he had no intention of closing down his inn
and leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a beautiful island,'' he said. ''I hope the volcano will
quiet down soon.''

<HEADLINE> Professors, Student in Thesis Clash  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Brown's faculty advisers had no
problem with the science in his master's thesis on abalone shells.
</P>
<P>
   But after reading his two-page ''disacknowledgements'' section
peppered with profanity and insults of faculty members, they
refused to put it in the school's library.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has Brown, 28, and the University of California at
Santa Barbara at an impasse: Is the critique protected speech, or
merely an untenable degree of disrespect?
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who believes it's his First Amendment right to preface
his paper the way he wants, has sued the university seeking to
force the school to put the thesis -- offending section included --
in the campus library.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all places, the University of California, the place where
the Free Speech Movement started 30 years ago should not be
engaging in this kind of suppression of speech,'' said Paul
Hoffman, who is representing Brown in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   University administrators -- who didn't grant Brown his degree
for almost a year -- said he has the right to his opinions but that
they have a right not to endorse them.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the university is saying is, 'It is your
disacknowledgement, you go ahead and publish it,''' said Charles
Li, dean of the university's Santa Barbara's graduate division.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Brown turned in his paper on the growth of abalone
shells to be filed in the campus library alongside the stacks and
stacks of other graduate student outpourings.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers had already approved the scientific content of his
paper titled ''The Morphology of Calcium Carbonate: Factors
Affecting Crystal Growth.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed after a librarian noted that instead of the usual
acknowledgments section thanking faculty, Brown had written a
''disacknowledgements'' section critical of faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Among the comments: ''To the Dean and staff of the Graduate
Division, You fascists are the largest argument against higher
education there has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The faculty refused to grant a degree with the section included
and the battle began. Brown later removed the four-letter words,
but the professors still weren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after a number of appeals, the university granted Brown
his master's degree in science. Brown notes the decision came after
the school was contacted by a network news reporter; Li says the
timing was coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   However, the university still wouldn't allow the paper in the
library with insults attached. That prompted Brown's suit, filed
this month in federal court in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Li conceded it would have been simpler to let Brown's original
version languish quietly on library shelves. But he said the
faculty does not ''wish to put their stamp of approval'' on Brown's
vitriol.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, now working as a computer analyst for an Internet
company, said his case is about more than a frustrated graduate
student's lament.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's two issues -- writing what I wrote and there's the
issue of my ability to write what I wrote,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fire 75, Mystics 58  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Sophia Witherspoon scored 26 points to
lead the Portland Fire to a 75-58 victory over the Washington
Mystics on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Crawley added 17 points for the Fire (5-12), who trailed
most of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw had 15 points and 12 rebounds to lead the
Mystics (8-10), while Nikki McCray scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Tully Bevilaqua started the Fire on a 27-9 run
that gave them a 56-39 lead with 10:18 remaining as the Mystics did
not make a field goal for a span of 6:47.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw then scored seven straight points, including a
3-pointer, to cut the lead to 10.
</P>
<P>
   But Witherspoon made a layup to end Portland's 2:44 scoring
drought, and Michelle Marciniak's two steals helped the Fire
increase the lead to 69-49 on DeMya Walker's layup with 4:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Crawley picked up her third foul and sat down midway through the
first half, and the Mystics took the lead with 5:09 left when
Markita Aldridge hit a deep 3-pointer, starting an 8-2 run as
Washington took a 29-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Alisa Burras of Portland sprained her right knee in the
first half and did not return.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Left Fielder Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shane Spencer of the New York Yankees will be
lost for the season after injuring his right knee fielding a ball
in left field in the first inning Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder tore the anterior cruciate ligament during the
Yankees' 2-0 loss to the crosstown-rival Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shane's pretty distraught,'' general manager Brian Cashman
said. ''A lot of times you see this injury on a football field. He
needs a knee reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer stumbled while fielding Melvin Mora's first-inning
double, and immediately left the game, replaced by Felix Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The injury was originally called a twisted knee, but an
examination at Beth Israel hospital revealed the more serious
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said surgery would be delayed for at least a week until
swelling goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was hitting .282 with nine homers and 40 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-N. Korea Missile Talks Start  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- U.S and North Korean officials
warmly greeted each other Monday before resuming talks about the
communist nation's missile program, and the top American negotiator
said the meeting was being held against a ''promising backdrop.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be prepared to move step by step toward a
fundamentally improved relationship with'' North Korea, said Robert
Einhorn, assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, at the
beginning of the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This is possible, he said, because ''the North Koreans (have)
addressed issues of concern to the United States and its allies,
and particularly the nuclear missile questions we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation was led by Jang Chang Chon, head of
the country's U.S affairs bureau. He did not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When the two sides met in Pyongyang in March last year, North
Korea rejected a U.S. demand to halt its missile development and
exports. Pyongyang said it would never change its missile policy
under pressure from the United States -- a position maintained
during three previous rounds of talks in New York and Berlin since
1996. North Korea also reportedly demanded $1 billion annually for
three years to compensate for losses from curbing missile exports.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks in Kuala Lumpur were being held in a positive
atmosphere, due partly to the June summit between North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on tests of
long-range missiles in exchange for an easing of U.S. sanctions. It
also opened official talks with Japan, moved to establish
diplomatic relations with many countries in Asia and Europe, and
joined a security forum of Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of these developments provide a positive, promising
backdrop to the talks we are about to have here,'' Einhorn told
reporters. ''We had a comprehensive review of U.S. policy toward
North Korea during that period, led by former secretary of defense
Bill Perry. That review produced a new framework for U.S. policy
toward North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has developed its own missile technology from Soviet
Scud missiles. Its Taepondong missiles are known to have a range of
over 900 miles. In mid-1998, Pyongyang rattled the region by
test-firing a missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the United States failed in a test of the
Pentagon's proposed missile defense project, which aims to protect
America against attacks by small potential nuclear states like
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still identifies North Korea as the world's
No. 1 exporter of missile equipment and technology and accuses it
of providing Pakistan and Iran with technology to test medium-range
missiles.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns of Mideast Turmoil  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of an Israeli-Palestinian summit at
Camp David, President Clinton urged the two sides to work hard
toward a peace accord or watch tension and hostility rise in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the parties do not seize this moment to make more progress,
there will be more hostility and more bitterness -- perhaps even
more violence,'' Clinton says.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there clearly is no guarantee of success, not to try
would guarantee failure,'' the president writes in the latest issue
of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine appears on newsstands Monday, the day before talks
are to begin between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the presidential retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was due to arrive late Monday at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington and go directly to Camp David. Barak was
expected to make a quick visit to Alexandria, Egypt, to confer with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, before returning to Israel, where
opponents scheduled three no-confidence votes in the parliament.
Barak was to arrive at Andrews early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high on all sides, Clinton wrote, as he began to
apply subtle pressure on the two leaders to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs a peace that can fulfill his citizens' quest for
security and recognition and a real reconciliation with the
Palestinians, Clinton said. Arafat needs a settlement that fulfills
his people's aspirations to determine their own future on their own
land.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest issue appears to be Jerusalem's future, with Arafat
seeking to wrest control of East Jerusalem from Israel and make it
the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delay is no longer an option: the parties themselves have set
a September deadline for resolving the final issues dividing them.
Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict knows no status quo. It
can move forward toward peace, or can slide back into turmoil. It
will not stand still,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, meanwhile, Arafat consulted Sunday with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in the latest in a series of regional
diplomatic whistle-stops by Israeli and Palestinian leaders
preparing for the summit. Arafat and Mubarak met alone and then
with top aides for almost an hour. They did not speak to reporters
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Barak's political troubles worsened as his biggest
coalition partner, the Shas party, said Sunday it planned to bolt
the government and Foreign Minister David Levy, a moderate, said he
was not going to the summit with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout came hours after Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet
dissident, withdrew his Russian immigrant party over prospective
concessions to the Palestinians, including a toehold in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party is leaving as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister is the best judge of his politics, but we
think he's committed to pursue an agreement that provides for
Israel's security and that if he's successful, the Israeli people
will support him,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Sunday.
''I think he's faced the same kinds of situations previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's strength comes largely from the left wing of Israel's
political spectrum. His concessions to the Palestinians far exceed
any made by an Israeli prime minister, including his mentor, the
late Yitzhak Rabin, who started the process of an Israeli pullback
on the West Bank in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Final Push for China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corporate executives are knocking on the doors
of all 100 senators. Other business leaders, with a few clicks of a
mouse, are e-mailing their lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a last-minute effort to prod the Senate into
quickly passing legislation granting China permanent normal trade
status. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he planned
to bring up the bill before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the debate agree that there are enough votes to
pass the legislation once it reaches the Senate floor. The business
community wants the bill free of amendments, thus eliminating the
need to send it back to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge gamble to predict they can get this legislation
passed again,'' Business Roundtable spokeswoman Johanna Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are making their presence known with campaign
donations as well. In May, as the House voted to pass the trade
bill, members of the Business Roundtable contributed $805,000 to
the fund-raising arms of the Senate Democrats and Republicans.
Unions gave $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the AFL-CIO, which led the campaign against the bill in
the House, has little activity planned, the business lobbying
effort is focused on moving the bill quickly, before Congress
recesses at the end of the month for the national political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't let it run up against the conventions,'' Chamber
President Tom Donohue said. ''Then it becomes a political issue.
And we believe it is best to move quickly because there are world
events going on all the time that could end up slowing it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pro-trade businesses continue to pour money into
political campaigns. Since Jan. 1, 1999, the corporations whose
chief executives comprise the Business Roundtable have made $58
million in contributions to congressional candidates and the
political parties, while labor unions have contributed $29 million,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics and FECInfo, two
nonpartisan groups that study money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The donations proved to be an accurate barometer of how House
members voted when they approved normal trade relations by a
237-197 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 lawmakers who received the most money from members of
the Business Roundtable since Jan. 1, 1999, all voted for the
motion. Of the 10 lawmakers who received the most money from labor,
nine voted no. The only exception was Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas,
the only lawmaker to be among the top 10 recipients of both union
and business donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another example of the way money influences policy in
Washington,'' said Donald Simon, general counsel of Common Cause, a
group that advocates changing campaign finance laws. ''In vote
after vote, you see a strong correlation between contributions and
the votes of members. This isn't a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Business Roundtable spokesman John Schachter said the group,
which is nonpartisan, hasn't made any contributions nor asked its
members to do so. The companies make their own decisions on whether
to make campaign contributions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber has ratcheted up its campaign contributions. Since
Jan. 1, 1999, the chamber gave more unregulated soft money to the
political parties -- $102,350 -- than it did during the entire
24-month period from Jan. 1, 1997, to Dec. 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you truly want to be an aggressive and active player in
Washington, you need to be there to support your friends,'' chamber
spokesman Frank Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue, normally pro-labor House members
who voted for China trade may find less enthusiasm among union
members, AFL-CIO Political Director Steve Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money that unions bring to the table is insignificant to
what the corporations bring,'' Rosenthal said. ''Our biggest
contribution is our ability to mobilize union members. This vote
has made that piece of our work that much harder.''

<HEADLINE> Dempsey: Threats in Cup Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The soccer official who handed
Germany the 2006 World Cup by abstaining from the FIFA site vote
said Monday that he was threatened by European interests.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Dempsey, the Oceania Football Confederation president,
defied the organization's mandate to support South Africa if
England had been knocked out. By abstaining Thursday in the third
round of voting, he allowed Germany to win the ballot 12-11.
</P>
<P>
   ''The night before the FIFA meeting I received a number of calls
which disturbed me, one of them was a threatening call,'' said
Dempsey, who announced his retirement as OFC president Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had also been made clear to me by influential European
interests that if I cast my vote in favor of South Africa there
would be adverse effects for OFC in FIFA.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dempsey, 78, voted for South Africa to make it 12-all, FIFA
president Sepp Blatter would have cast the deciding vote. Blatter
had campaigned heavily for the African nation.

<HEADLINE> Bush Resumes Outreach to Minorities  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush will spend the next two weeks
pushing his theme of ''compassionate conservatism'' and offering
himself to nontraditional audiences as a Republican who can bridge
the decades-long gap between his party and minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush speaks Monday at the NAACP national convention in
Baltimore, where aides said he'll engage in frank talk about racism
in America. During the rest of his swing, the Texas governor plans
to announce new programs to help low-income people deal with
welfare, food stamps and foster care.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the National Associated for the Advancement of
Colored People, Bush will do something that is ''not very
Republican'' by acknowledging that racism is alive in America,
spokesman Ari Fleischer said. Bush believes the best way to push
minority issues to the forefront is ''for both parties to take up
recognition that racism exists,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won't announce any initiatives to address racism, but the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee will talk about his plans to
improve education, highlighting his record in Texas where black
fourth graders have the highest math test scores in the nation,
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are going to see someone who is remarkably comfortable in
an environment that is mostly Democratic,'' said Fleischer. ''He is
going to make the case why African-Americans should join'' him.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said Bush must better define
''compassionate conservatism'' and develop a plan to help end
racial disparities in income, health, education and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like some definition on 'compassionate conservatism,'
quite frankly,'' Mfume said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''There are
questions out there that really have to be answered, not just
rhetorically about education, but in terms of a plan, an action
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Bush trailing Democratic rival Vice President
Al Gore among minority voters, Bush has been courting blacks and
Hispanics over the last two weeks. He appeared before the Congress
of Racial Equality, an organization of conservative blacks, and two
Hispanic groups, the League of United Latin American Citizens and
the National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching out to minority audiences, Bush speaks often of
improving education so minority children can have a better chance
in life. He favors better accountability of and more training for
teachers and has called for giving parents of kids in failing
schools federal vouchers to help pay tuition at private schools of
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said the plan would benefit only a small fraction of
children and said voucher systems could further weaken public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe in people having the right to choose, but we
believe all people should have that right and no child should be
left behind,'' said Mfume.
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, Bush's positions have produced mixed opinions
among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   He was applauded when two plaques bearing Confederate symbols --
considered racist by many blacks -- were removed from the lobby of
the Texas Supreme Court building, but was criticized for declining
to call for Confederate flag to be removed from atop the South
Carolina Capitol. Bush said the issue was for South Carolinians to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also supported the execution of Texas death row prisoner
Gary Graham. The NAACP called it a ''gross travesty of justice''
and has called for a national moratorium on all executions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had some healthy disagreements with him,'' said Gary
Bledsoe, president of the Texas NAACP. Despite this, Bush could win
points by indicating that he ''supports our overall objectives in
eliminating color distinctions and discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Bush would stick to his positions, even when they
are unpopular among minority voters, and would continue to
emphasize that his brand of Republicanism is sensitive to their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   That recipe seemed to work for Bush in Texas. In his 1994
campaign for governor, he won 15 percent of the black vote,
according to exit polls. In 1998, when he was re-elected, exit
polls showed he had nearly doubled his support among black voters
to 27 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Drug Suspect's Lawyer Slain  </HEADLINE>
By GLORIA PEREZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) -- A second attorney for a man accused of
being a major drug trafficker was found shot to death five weeks
after the suspect was ordered to stand trial on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico State attorney general's office confirmed that the
bullet-riddled body of Eugenio Zafra Garcia was found Sunday in
front of his house in Toluca, the state capital west of Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   Another attorney, Gustavo Galvez Reyes, was found tortured and
suffocated to death in Mexico City after failing to win Jesus
Labra's release from house arrest following his arrest in Tijuana
on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers caught Labra while he was watching a youth football
game in which his son was a player. U.S. and Mexican officials
claim Labra is the financial mastermind of Mexico's most violent
drug organization, the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix brothers.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, a judge ordered both Labra and Ismael Higuera
Guerrero, alleged to be one of the gang's top operators, to stand
trial: Labra on weapons charges and Higuera on allegations of
aiding and financing drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Both are being held at Mexico's maximum security prison at
Almoloya de Juarez, north of Toluca.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Zafra had accused Mexico City police of
raiding and searching his office in Mexico City, but was unable to
produce proof that the police had committed the search.
</P>
<P>
   Zafra also had been the attorney for two men who had been
accused of participating in the March 1994 murder of presidential
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. In June 1995, he won the release of
Vicente Mayoral and his son, Rodolfo.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ruled that analysis of videotapes and other evidence
failed to support prosecution assertions that the Mayorals helped
clear the way for the assassin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 70 years of complaints about mud, dust
and wandering cows, the years following the Civil War saw the
backwater capital on the banks of the Potomac suddenly become a
magnet for new wealth and the height of expensive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three decades of the 19th century, new money
established a beachhead, millionaires rolled in, old society felt
itself eclipsed and the sometimes sleepy, sometimes turbulent
national village changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   The years immediately after the war marked the capital as a
place where newly minted, self-made millionaires from the western
gold mines, or make-a-buck cities like Chicago or Cincinnati, could
find acceptance, build palatial mansions and fill their lavish
parties with Cabinet members, senators, foreign envoys, and perhaps
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Established, old-money Washington was aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ill-gotten and well-gotten wealth have usurped the leadership
of society,'' a newspaper observed in 1878. ''It is a custom, we
are informed, for a society woman to dazzle, not by her beauty or
conversation, but by the quality of her dress and the value of her
jewels, and that a costume is not remarked upon as being in good
taste or becoming, but as having cost so many hundreds dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, the invasion of wealth continued until it
transformed the city with new mansions and lavish parties and
speeding carriages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington is like no other city on the world ... There is a
fairy-tale sense of instability about it,'' society columnist Frank
Carpenter, writing under the byline ''Carp,'' said in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Carp, describing the social season of 1885: ''There is
enough silk worn here every winter to carpet a whole state. There
are pearls by the bushel and diamonds by the peck.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age where there were few pressing national problems, Carp
began to count diamonds:
</P>
<P>
   ''At the White House the other night there were at least 500
women wearing diamonds of various sizes. I counted 50 pairs of
solitaire earrings whose stones were as big as the end of my thumb,
and 30 diamond stars and pendants, any one of which would buy a
large farm.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman in a flowing red gown alone yielded a count of 85
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ''She shook at least $5,000 this way and that every time she
moved her head,'' the journalist reported.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Mark Twain called it ''the gilded age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The rich newcomers captured the leadership of Washington high
society in the 80s, and their flag waved atop the social pinnacle
for the rest of the century,'' writes Kathryn Allamong Jacob in
''Capital Elites,'' an account of the era of ''the rootless rich''
published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newcomers shared three things in common: they had
started life among the working poor and amassed their money by luck
or pluck or by practices that skated the purely ethical.
</P>
<P>
   But then they found themselves rich but unloved by the
established social order in the towns in which they lived, frozen
out of the social whirl in cities like New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Washington offered a more fluid environment, even for those who
lacked the common social graces.
</P>
<P>
   These were people, said Carp, who ''have nothing but their money
to recommend them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Many use bad grammar, the men cannot avoid mentioning their
wealth, and the women, whether their figures make it advisable or
not, dress in the most extravagant extremes of fashion,'' he wrote.
''Stories of the crudities of these people are legion.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Washington society, called ''the antiques'' by some, felt
itself pushed aside and was not pleased, even when some newcomers
appeared to have gold-edged credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Violet Blair Janin, the granddaughter of Francis Preston
Blair and a member of one of the oldest Washington families, was
not impressed when scholar Henry Adams became a Lafayette Square
neighbor even though Adams numbered Presidents John and John Quincy
Adams among his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it may be nicer to have had your great-grandfather
and grandfather presidents than to be one yourself,'' she icily
told her diary in 1893.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, as those who went before the great-grandfather were
very plain people, we of older blood do not think of him (Henry
Adams) as such a great aristocrat.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, the income tax and economic depressions, the fortunes
of Washington's wealthy class sagged and many of its members
abandoned the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their surviving mansions are now embassies. That
includes the Massachusetts Avenue palace -- now the Embassy of
Indonesia -- built in 1903 by Irish immigrant and former laborer Tom
Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh had struck it rich in Colorado gold and used the money to
buy his family a place in Washington society.
</P>
<P>
   His family's pockets became so deep that his daughter, Evalyn
Walsh McLean, had no trouble finding the money to buy the Hope
Diamond. It is now the star of the Smithsonian Institution's gem
room.

<HEADLINE> Mounting Tensions in Northern Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Belligerent and unbowed,
Orange Order leaders say they will mount a second week of
violence-prone street protests if the Protestant brotherhood isn't
permitted to parade through Portadown's main Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest resumed overnight, with Protestant hard-liners scuffling
with police in a few Belfast neighborhoods. The mounting tensions
come in advance of Wednesday's massive parades across Northern
Ireland, when the Orange Order commemorates a 1690 military triumph
over Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, 30 miles southwest of Belfast, an estimated 3,000
Orangemen and supporters marched Sunday until they reached a
British army barricade erected to prevent them from reaching nearby
Garvaghy Road, where Catholics decry the town's annual Orange
parade as offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the march, a car bomb planted by Irish Republican
Army dissidents detonated in Stewartstown, north of Portadown. The
blast wounded an officer and demonstrated that Northern Ireland's
1998 peace accord faces threats from both extremes of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in front of the 20-foot-high steel wall blocking their
path, Portadown leaders of the Orange Order promised they would
eventually get their way and march down Garvaghy Road by wearing
down British authorities through mass civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Portadown's senior Orangeman, Harold Gracey, denied
responsibility for encouraging the Protestant riots of recent days
-- then in the same breath called for even more intense
demonstrations starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey noted that British governments in the past had been
forced to change policies when faced with street mayhem. ''So I
would say to our people: Continue,'' he said to enthusiastic
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant hooligans took to the streets after dark in several
places, pelting police and soldiers with stones and firecrackers.
They erected barricades of burning cars and furniture in two
Belfast neighborhoods, while police seized nail bombs, slingshots
and a dagger following scuffles in Larne to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has insisted it won't back down in the face of
Protestant unrest, deploying 2,000 soldiers in Portadown to back up
police in case the situation escalates out of control.
</P>
<P>
   At the Portadown confrontation zone, soldiers were dropped by
helicopter into pastures to drive back Protestants trying to get
through barbed-wire coils and invade Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order represents a sizable chunk of Protestant
opinion opposed to the 1998 deal.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the car bomb planted outside an unoccupied police
station in Stewartstown was the work of the Real IRA, a dissident
group representing IRA members opposed to the outlawed group's 1997
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bombers were trying to inflame an already tense
situation,'' said Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who today is a Sinn
Fein member of Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, called
the bombers ''people of no credibility who are locked in the past
and have nothing to offer the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual collision of rights at Portadown -- where Orangemen
insist they have the right to free assembly, Catholic residents to
live free of sectarian harassment -- has defied solution for years.
It has triggered widespread violence regardless of whether security
forces blocked the parade or forced it through.
</P>
<P>
   Since its formation in 1998 a government-appointed Parades
Commission has ordered Portadown Orangemen to stay away from
Garvaghy Road. The joint Catholic-Protestant commission this year
emphasized the only way it would sanction an Orange parade through
the area would be after constructive face-to-face negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, however, has refused to meet Garvaghy Road
residents since Catholic militants there began blocking the annual
parade in 1995. Orangemen cite the IRA background of the Catholic
protest leader, Breandan MacCionnaith, as justification for
rejecting direct talks.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants got their chance to vent their hatred of the
Catholic protesters, particularly MacCionnaith, when the Orange
parade passed a Catholic church near Garvaghy Road en route to the
security-force blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Several Protestants at the tail-end of the march spotted
MacCionnaith at the front of a crowd of Catholic onlookers,
standing safely behind a row of riot police, gun-toting soldiers
and armored cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''You IRA scum certainly go out of your way to be offended,''
shouted one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't get to you now, Breandan, but a bullet'll get you
someday,'' said a teen-age boy.

<HEADLINE> Showdown Near on Roadless Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fight between Western Republicans and
environmentalists that has been looming since President Clinton
announced a plan to protect 43 million acres of forests is about to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate this week is expected to take up a proposal by Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, that would delay Clinton's plan until 60 days
after a panel reviews the effort and submits a report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say Craig's proposal is a thinly disguised
attempt to put off the plan until Clinton leaves office, with the
hope that Republican George W. Bush is elected and scraps the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is trying to use administrative rulemaking to prevent
road building and other development on more than one-fifth of all
federal forests. His plan, announced last October, sets broad
criteria for logging, grazing and recreational activities, and
leaves it up to local foresters to decide whether roads should be
banned on parcels of 5,000 acres or less.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists call the effort a crowning achievement of the
Clinton presidency and one of the most important conservation moves
of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   But Western Republicans, timber companies and recreation
interests say the move would unfairly limit access to public lands
and hurt local economies. They denounce the rulemaking as an end
run around Congress, since the plan can be implemented without
lawmakers' approval.
</P>
<P>
   Craig will offer an amendment to a $15.5 billion Interior
Department spending bill would take $1 million from federal timber
accounts to pay for an advisory committee to study the roadless
initiative and another proposal that would dictate when new roads
can be built.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said such a committee needs to review the rulemakings to
ensure they are done right and legally.
</P>
<P>
   He and Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, have held hearings of
the forest oversight subcommittees they chair to argue that private
meetings between Clinton administration officials and
environmentalists to discuss the roadless proposal before the
initiative was announced violated laws governing open meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The environmental community behind closed doors convinced this
administration to pump out a roads policy,'' Craig said. ''What I
do is simply reverse that process ... . I just cannot believe
anyone serving in the U.S. Senate would condone a closed-door
process.''
</P>
<P>
   While Craig and Chenoweth have been laying the groundwork for a
challenge on Capitol Hill, Forest Service officials have continued
with 400 planned public meetings nationwide on the draft of the
roadless plan they unveiled in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   A Forest Service spokesman said the meetings -- not more study --
are the best way to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''This represents to me a truly fascinating turn of events --
we're desperately seeking debate on the substance of an issue and
others are relentlessly turning back to and arguing for more
process,'' Chris Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Hayden, legislative director of Earthjustice Legal Defense
Fund, said the Craig amendment would derail the public process with
''hope that the next administration is less favorably disposed to
protecting roadless areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig disagrees. One of his aides said Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman could quickly appoint the review panel and complete the
study and roadless initiative before Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within reason, this is something that could be done
promptly,'' said Mark Rey, a staffer at the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fights over environment-related amendments to spending bills --
so-called anti-environmental riders -- have been common during the
Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen spending bills, including the interior measure, must
pass Congress each year to keep the government operating. Lawmakers
in both parties view the bills as excellent vehicles for key policy
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has usually won the fights over environmental riders.
Republicans last year attached a rider to the Interior bill to
prevent oil companies from paying higher royalties for drilling on
public land, but during budget talks Clinton forced the GOP to drop
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Some riders have become law. Western Republicans in 1995
convinced Clinton to waive normal environmental protections and
block citizen appeals of logging so dead and dying trees at risk of
burning could be more quickly removed.
</P>
<P>
   The public comment period on the proposed roadless plan closes
July 17. Then, administration officials will start drafting a final
rule that could be in place this fall, provided Craig's effort
fails.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A twin-engine plane crashed Sunday on a farm and
burst into flames shortly after taking off south of the capital, killing at
least 13 people, authorities said. Seven injured passengers were pulled from the
charred wreckage of the Curtis C-46, and one died later at a hospital.One of the
aircraft's engines apparently caught fire in flight. However, authorities said
they were just beginning to investigate the crash outside Villavicencio, a state
capital 45 miles from Bogota.

Fiji's Hostage Crisis Ends

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels who have held Fiji's government hostage for 52 days
got much of what they were looking for Sunday, signing a deal to release their
captives in return for destruction of the country's multiracial democracy. The
agreement between the rebels and Fiji's military government calls for the
captives to be freed Thursday, ending this Pacific island nation's long hostage
crisis. But Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the military head of state looked
morose as he bowed to indigenous Fijian rebel leader George Speight's demands to
disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indian minority.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has commuted the prison sentences of
four women who were convicted of drug crimes but received much harsher sentences

spokesman Jake Siewert. ''They received much more severe sentences than their
husbands and boyfriends.'' The women freed under Friday's order were Louise
House, Shawndra Mills, Amy Pofahl and Serena Nunn.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Manila Dump Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A mountain of rain-loosened garbage
collapsed at a giant Manila dump Monday then burst into flame,
burying dozens of squatter houses and killing at least nine people,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 36 people were missing and 20 others injured among the
impoverished squatters who make a living by scavenging recyclable
materials from the stinking Payatas dump in Quezon City, the
largest garbage disposal site in metropolitan Manila.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of garbage buried an area the size of about four
basketball courts -- as many as 200 shacks, residents said, though
officials could not confirm the number. Some shanties were
completely buried by the burning heap while others lay half
covered, their crumpled tin roofs showing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like thunder and in an instant, our house was
gone,'' said one squatter, Gloria Alano, who was at a store when
the rotting garbage collapsed, burying her husband and three
children.
</P>
<P>
   She sobbed and yelled at rescuers using a heavy bulldozer on a
heap of garbage to search for survivors and bodies. ''Backhoe, use
only backhoes, not bulldozers, I want to get the bodies of my loved
ones,'' she cried.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known what triggered the fire that
engulfed part of the area. Residents said the debris may have been
ignited by fallen power cables or stoves being used in huts covered
by the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks were unable to reach the area because of limited
space, so they parked on a main road several blocks from the
dumpsite. Fire hoses were pulled by fire fighters through crowded
alleys.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were unable to search much of the area because of the
fire, mud and thick smoke. In one area, they pulled out three
victims, including a burly man who was badly burned but still
breathing. Red Cross volunteers doused his body with water and
tried but failed to revive him, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   A week of heavy rains apparently loosened the mountain of
garbage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have tried in recent years to relocate the
hundreds of scavengers and junk yard workers living around the
dumpsite, but most have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Ranola, an injured scavenger taken to a Quezon City
hospital, said they refused to be relocated because they could not
afford the cost. The relocation sites are also far from areas where
they could eke out a living, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump, along with a former dump in Manila's Tondo
slum district called Smokey Mountain, have been home to hundreds of
scavengers who earn their living by rummaging for scraps.
</P>
<P>
   The garbage dumps have long symbolized the wrenching poverty in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, ordered
Smokey Mountain to be leveled in the mid-1990s and built apartment
buildings on the site.

<HEADLINE> Woman leaving church suffers fractured skull in cement attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 25-year-old woman walking from a Manhattan
church suffered a fractured skull when a would-be robber struck her
with a 5-pound chunk of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Goldberg, 25, was in front of 105 E. 29th St. just after
noon Sunday when the man hit her with the concrete, tried
unsuccessfully to snatch her purse and then ran away, police said.
</P>
<P>
   She was in critical but stable condition Monday at Bellevue
Hospital. She was alert and oriented, and there was no apparent
sign of neurological damage, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty firefighter who had been driving by the scene of the
assault aided Goldberg, cradling her bleeding head and holding her
hand, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was just floored,'' area resident Deborah Brown told The
New York Times. ''But she was conscious, because she was squeezing
the hand of this guy who was helping her.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a waitress who moved to New York four years ago, was
struck on the back of the head. In addition to the fractured skull,
she suffered two chipped teeth, cuts and bruises when she fell to
the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   She remained conscious throughout the day and was able to answer
questions from detectives, but she had no recollection of the
attack, police said. She spoke by telephone to her father in
Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people witnessed the attack and described the
assailant, a man apparently in his 30s, as disheveled and possibly
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents said building security cameras captured the
attack, but police would not comment on that. The chunk of cement,
believed to be a piece of sidewalk, was found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg recently moved into Manhattan from Brooklyn and planned
to attend Columbia University later this year. She had just left
the Marble Collegiate Presbyterian Church, on 29th Street and Park
Avenue, and was heading for a nearby uptown subway station when the
attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the third such attack in New York during the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a 30-year-old Queens woman was hit by a brick and
robbed.
</P>
<P>
   And last November, Nicole Barrett, 27, was hit on the head with
a paving brick in midtown Manhattan while walking to work. She
underwent two brain operations and has returned to her home in
Texas for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Drake, an ex-convict and drug abuser, was charged with
second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal
possession of a weapon in connection with Barrett's attack. He has
pleaded not guilty.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nepalese Sex Slaves Help Victims  </HEADLINE>
By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Nisha and Geeta watch every woman who
crosses out of Nepal at the Kakarvitta border point, trying to spot
those destined to be sold into brothels in India.
</P>
<P>
   They know what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   The two female border guards, ages 19 and 21, had been lured
from their mountain villages and sold as sex slaves to Bombay
brothels by people who promised them jobs in the city and escape
from hard rural life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were deceived and taken across the border to serve as sex
slaves, but we can still prevent more of them from facing the same
fate,'' said Geeta, who for the past two years has stood guard 12
hours a day at the border post 330 miles east of Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
   She and her partner, who talked on condition their full names
not be used, nab at least 20 potential victims and traffickers a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police were too busy checking for criminals and smuggling
at the border, they had no time or did not even bother to check for
traffickers,'' said Anuradha Koirala, who runs Maiti Nepal, a
shelter for women who escape and make it back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now these women who already have the bitter experience can
point them out for the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Maiti Nepal operates patrols at six border points and plans
eventually to cover all 26 crossings into India.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 Nepali women work as prostitutes in Indian
brothels. Now the Nepalese government, police and organizations
such as UNICEF have joined forces to combat trafficking of women to
India.
</P>
<P>
   Finding traffickers is made more difficult by the long, open
border the two countries share, and the fact that Nepal and India
do not require visas to cross into each other's territory.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 7,000 women are taken to Indian brothels every
year, yet only 130 trafficking cases have been prosecuted,
according to advocate groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to the lack of evidence, about 58 percent of these cases
end up in a not-guilty verdict,'' said Sapana Malla, an advocate
with the Katmandu-based Forum for Women and Development. ''The only
evidence we have here is the story of these women, which often is
not enough to convince the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   A legal process that can take years also discourages those who
do escape, women's advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the case does come up in court, the law says intention of
sale has to be proved, which is difficult. Most cases are dismissed
on technical grounds,'' Malla said.
</P>
<P>
   Her group and other agencies have proposed legislation that
would lessen the women's burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted traffickers face up to 20 years in prison. But Malla
said those who are arrested and jailed are mostly poor, without the
backing of powerful people with money.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an organized crime where even members of parliament
have been involved in the past,'' Malla said.
</P>
<P>
   At Katmandu's central jail, half of the 84 female inmates have
been charged with trafficking and face sentences averaging 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The actual traffickers and their leaders are never arrested.
We have often seen the real traffickers get released from this very
jail,'' said Nirmala Lama, 30, serving a 10-year sentence for
trafficking. ''Simla Tamang, a very notoriously known trafficker,
served only two years sentence and left after offering a bribe of
$2,850.''
</P>
<P>
   Nepal police have opened a separate department staffed by female
officers to deal with cases of women and child victims, and run
awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not only sensitizing the community but also our own
force so they know how to deal when victims come forward,'' said
Govind Prasad Thapa, deputy superintendent of police.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of Nepalese women continue to end up in
brothels in the Indian cities of Bombay, New Delhi, Ahmadabad,
Silguri and Patna every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a big business and powerful people are involved. It is a
spreading and growing phenomenon,'' UNICEF Director for South Asia
Nigel Fischer said.	   Experts say the economic conditions in Nepal, where more
than 40
percent are poor, is part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real problem here is the low value placed on women,''
Fischer said. ''For people in South Asia, it is a sin to be born
poor and a woman.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Votes for Assad in Referendum  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- A month after President Hafez Assad's
death, his son took the final step toward succeeding him Monday,
standing as the only candidate in a nationwide presidential
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the vote is not in doubt. The only uncertainty is
how much of a percentage of ''yes'' votes Bashar Assad will
receive. In four of five referendums, all of them like this one
orchestrated by the ruling Baath party, his father won between 99.6
and 99.99 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament meets Tuesday for an extraordinary session in which
it will announce the referendum result and approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's 9.44 million eligible voters -- more than half the
population -- began casting their ballots when the polls opened at 7
a.m. Syria's voters have a choice of checking either a green ring
that says ''yes'' or a gray one signifying ''no.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use the offered pens, some voters pricked their
thumbs with sewing needles provided by voting officials and smeared
blood to mark their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our blood and our souls we sacrifice ourselves to you,''
crowds supporting Bashar Assad chanted as they went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The main theme of the campaign leading up to the referendum had
been that Bashar Assad was the only Syrian capable of continuing
his father's policies. In his 30 years in power, the autocratic
Hafez Assad gave Syria stability after years of political upheaval,
coups and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   That Syria needed another Assad was drummed into voters by the
nation's powerful propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the hope that promises prosperity for Syria and a
continuation of the late president's path which brought greatness
to this country,'' said Maher Qotranji, 42, a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall continue the march with our leader Bashar,'' said a
banner near one of the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled Syria Times said in an editorial
Monday that Syrians ''stress their allegiance to the principles and
values of the late great leader ... through casting their 'Yes'
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The huge loss of the great leader has not killed the hopes for
the revival of his sublime values,'' the paper added.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is the last in a series of steps that the
political apparatus Hafez Assad left behind has taken to ensure the
succession of his son, a former eye doctor with little political
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of his father's death June 10, parliament amended
the constitution to lower the minimum age for a president from 40
to 34, Bashar Assad's age. In the days that followed, Bashar Assad
was promoted from colonel to general and declared commander of the
armed forces. The Baath party, which has enjoyed a monopoly in
Syria since 1963, made him its leader and nominated him as its
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians have been holding victory parties since the People's
Assembly, Syria's 250-member parliament, approved the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people turned out for huge rallies supporting
Bashar Assad, jamming the capital's streets, tooting horns and
waving portraits of the young leader.
</P>
<P>
   Giant portraits of both father and son are displayed on
government buildings and banners pledging allegiance to the younger
Assad are draped around squares.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitality tents have sprung in several Damascus neighborhoods,
where both bitter coffee and sweets are served to express sadness
over Hafez Assad's death and joy over his son's imminent
succession. Blazing torches held high by Arabian spears surround a
tent set up by Rami Makhlouf, Bashar Assad's cousin. A giant screen
projected a five-hour film on the Assad family.

<HEADLINE> Harold Sack, buyer of $12 million Newport desk, was 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEANSIDE, N.Y. (AP) - Harold Sack, who paid $12.1 million for
an 18th century Newport desk-bookcase in 1989, died Saturday. He
was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Sack, America's foremost period furniture dealer, bought the
mahogany secretary at Christie's for what was then the highest
auction price ever for an item other than a painting.
</P>
<P>
   The desk, which he bought for a Texas financier, originally was
owned by Nicholas Brown, of Providence, R.I., and his family, for
whom Brown University is named.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s to the 1990s, Sack shattered auction price
records for American furniture. In 1977, he set the record of
$135,000 when he bought a Boston bombe chest. Three years later, he
pushed the record to $396,000, for a block-front Newport chest.
</P>
<P>
   He set the record again in 1983, paying $687,500 for a Newport
kneehole desk at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.1 million Sack paid for the mahogany desk-bookcase in
1989 still is the record for American furniture. An 18th century
Italian cabinet sold at Christie's in London in 1990 for $15.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Sack, president of the Israel Sack gallery in
Manhattan, sold an 18th century Philadelphia Pembroke table for
more than $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Sail cruise commemorates 175th anniversary of the Erie Canal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. (AP) - About 40 pleasure boats sailed down the
Erie Canal Sunday to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the
waterway by boating from one end of the canal to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Canal Cruise and Trail Trek is a 17-day journey consisting
of a caravan of boaters and bikers who stop at 36 canal-side towns,
cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cruise is held to promote awareness of the canal as a
recreational entity and promote awareness of the trail along the
canal,'' said John R. Jermano, former canal director and a
participant in the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise began Friday in Whitehall in Washington County and
will end on July 23 at the Inner Harbor in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie Canal, which connected the Hudson and Lake Erie in
1825, was once an important commercial trade route that connected
the ports of New York and Albany to the western frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But the last remnants of commercial shipping left its banks in
1994 and it is now used exclusively for recreational purposes.

<HEADLINE> Africa: AIDS Cuts Life Span To 30  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- The populations of some
AIDS-stricken African countries will soon begin to fall as millions
die of the disease, and by 2010 life expectancy will plunge to
around 30 -- a level not seen in at least a century, according to
new estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released Monday are demographers' latest attempt to
grasp the devastation of the AIDS epidemic, which has swept across
southern Africa during the past few years with staggering speed and
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to comprehend the amount of mortality we will see in
these countries,'' said Karen Stanecki of the U.S. Census Bureau,
which compiled the projections.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki presented the new figures at the 13th International
AIDS Conference, which is being held for the first time in Africa,
ground zero of the epidemic. Thousands of AIDS experts from around
the world are participating.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at Monday's meeting struggled for superlatives to
describe the scope of this disease in the poorest parts of the
globe, especially sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly three-quarters
of all HIV-infected people live.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem will get much worse before it gets better,'' said
Dr. Roy M. Anderson of Oxford University. ''This is undoubtedly the
most serious infectious disease threat in recorded human history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin DeCock of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control called
the epidemic ''Africa's worst social catastrophe since slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 25 million Africans are already infected
with HIV, the AIDS virus, and most of them will die within the next
five to eight years. In Botswana, the world's worst-hit country,
more than one-third of all adults carry the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki said that by 2003, the populations of Botswana, South
Africa and Zimbabwe will begin to fall because of AIDS deaths and
dropping fertility resulting from the epidemic. In those countries,
the populations will drop between one-tenth and three-tenths of 1
percent. Without AIDS, they would have grown between 1 percent and
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki said this is the first time the census bureau has
projected negative population growth due to AIDS. The population
growth of several other countries -- including Malawi, Namibia,
Swaziland and Zambia -- will be near zero because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS already has sharply reduced life expectancy in many African
countries. For instance, it is now 39 in Botswana, instead of 71,
as it would have been without the disease. And the numbers will
only get worse, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki projected that by 2010, life expectancy will be 29 in
Botswana, 30 in Swaziland and 33 in Namibia and Zimbabwe. Without
AIDS, it would have been around 70 in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are a level of life expectancy that have not been seen
since the start of the 20th Century,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that programs to educate people about condoms and
other ways of avoiding infection clearly can work in southern
Africa. Because of early efforts, the epidemic never occurred in
Senegal, and Uganda has reversed its high infection level.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS medicines have dramatically improved survival in the United
States and Europe, but the drugs are simply too expensive and hard
to deliver for most of the world's infected. Five drug companies
have pledged to lower their prices in the developing world, but
health officials in poor countries note they still lack the health
care services necessary to offer the medicines to the sick.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation, created by
Microsoft's founder, said it will spent $50 million in Botswana to
strengthen that country's health care system. Merck &AMP; Co. said it
will match the donation in Botswana, mostly by providing AIDS
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, at Sunday's AIDS conference opening ceremony,
South African President Thabo Mbeki defended his government's AIDS
policies by saying he is simply looking for an African solution to
the scourge.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has endured a hail of criticism since he convened a panel
of scientists to investigate whether the HIV virus causes AIDS -- a
fact long-accepted by most AIDS experts -- and refused to provide
medicine to pregnant women to reduce risks for mother-to-child
transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some in our common world consider the questions that I and the
rest of our government have raised around the HIV/AIDS issue ... as
akin to grave criminal and genocidal conduct,'' he told delegates.
''What I hear said repeatedly, stridently is 'Don't ask
questions.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Mbeki spoke, hundreds of people walked out of the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Commutes 4 Women's Sentences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has commuted the prison
sentences of four women who were convicted of drug crimes but
received much harsher sentences than men involved in the cases, a
White House spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president felt they had served a disproportionate amount
of time,'' said spokesman Jake Siewert. ''They received much more
severe sentences than their husbands and boyfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   The women freed under Friday's order were Louise House, Shawndra
Mills, Amy Pofahl and Serena Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Alain Orozco, also was ordered freed after serving time
on a drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were joking with me at first,'' Nunn told ABC
News, which first reported on the commutations. ''After I realized
it was actually happening, I began to tremble and one of the staff
members asked me if I wanted to take a seat. Right after that, the
tears just started flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Nunn was convicted after being drawn into a
Minneapolis drug ring by her boyfriend, but received a stiff
14-year sentence after refusing to inform on him. She served 10
years before her release.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who sentenced her lobbied the White House for
her early release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I frankly have never written a letter to the president before
asking that one of my sentences by commuted,'' U.S. District Judge
David Doty told ABC News. ''Ms. Nunn was obviously guilty of a
crime, but a crime that did not deserve the penalty the court was
required to impose under the sentenciung guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to guidelides imposed by Congress in the 1980s,
requiring mandatory sentences for a number of drug violations. The
guidelines have be criticized by a number of federal judges who
complain they strip them of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahl was convicted along with her husband, a Stanford
University Law School graduate and wealthy Dallas businessman, in
connection with the drug Ecstasy. While he received three years
probation, she was sentenced to 24 years without parole.
</P>
<P>
   My knees buckled,'' Pofahl told ABC News. ''I was overwhelmed. I
just felt incredible that I was free to do things without someone
looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pofahl case was profiled in Glamour magazine last year and
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis wrote about the Nunn case in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the House and Mills cases were not available from the
White House.

<HEADLINE> Gates, Merck Help Africa AIDS Fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Bill Gates' charity and the
pharmaceutical giant Merck announced plans Monday to give tens of
millions of dollars to help Botswana fight its crippling AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 36 percent of adults in Botswana are HIV infected, the
highest rate of infection in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the charity founded by
the Microsoft founder and his wife, pledged $50 million over five
years to help Botswana strengthen its primary health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Merck and Co., which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J.,
promised to manage the Gates program and donate the expensive
antiretroviral medications that help control the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the magnitude of the public health challenger we are
facing, Botswana welcomes the inauguration of this unique
public-private partnership,'' Botswana's Health Minister Joy
Phumaphi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made in Durban, South Africa, where the
13th International AIDS Conference is underway.
</P>
<P>
   The project will focus on awareness campaigns, voluntary testing
and counseling programs for those infected.
</P>
<P>
   The project will also work with German drug company
Boehringer-Ingelheim's recently announced plan to offer a drug
reducing risks for transmission of the virus from mother to child
during birth free for five years to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Imitators on the Way  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When television networks began jumping gleefully
into the reality pool, NBC was content to lay back, playing it
cool. Maybe its programmers preferred a nice game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's perceived there's a treasure lying at the bottom
of the pool, that decision has come back to haunt NBC's
entertainment team, Scott Sassa and Garth Ancier.
</P>
<P>
   Their corporate bosses have been barking at them for not chasing
after ideas for reality programming. Every week that ''Survivor''
pulls big audiences for CBS tightens their collars just a little.
</P>
<P>
   The pool is getting mighty crowded now with everyone thrashing
about.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wants to be left out,'' said Bruce Nash, one of
Hollywood's top reality show producers. '''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire' was seen as something of a fluke, but 'Survivor'
proved that reality could work. When 'Survivor' hit, the networks'
appetite for these kinds of shows grew overnight and just became
insatiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect a flood of these new shows on the air during the next few
months, including:
</P>
<P>
   --''The Mole,'' a game where a group of people try to complete a
series of tasks. The hitch is that one of them is trying to subvert
the process, and no one knows who ''the mole'' is.
</P>
<P>
   --''Master Game,'' a game show that brings back the unpleasant
experience of cramming for college finals. Contestants study for a
series of tests over several days, battling fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   --''The Runner'' and ''Wanted,'' both based on the idea of
pursuit. In ''The Runner,'' an idea developed by actors Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon, a person is set loose somewhere in the country and
it's up to TV viewers to find him, while ''Wanted'' sets a pack of
former bounty hunters after a series of contestants.
</P>
<P>
   --''Krypton Factor,'' a game that tests quick-thinking and mental
agility.
</P>
<P>
   --''I Want a Divorce,'' a forum like ''Divorce Court'' where a
real-life divorcing couple compete against each other for their own
property. Fortunately, kids aren't included.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just on ABC and Fox. CBS isn't talking about its
future plans, but with ''Big Brother'' on five times a week over
the next three months and a second ''Survivor'' series scheduled
for the winter, it is already busy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is trying quickly to catch up. The network is reportedly
negotiating to import a Dutch show, ''Chains of Love,'' in which a
woman is chained to four men and must let go one man a day until
she's left with her dream date.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in which a rival network made a big splash with
original programming during the repeat season -- ABC last August
with ''Millionaire'' and CBS now with ''Survivor'' -- NBC has
assigned a staff and resources just to develop summer and
alternative programming, spokeswoman Shirley Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   The network has essentially taken this summer off. The pickings
are so slim that NBC is airing a few episodes of a new fall series
scheduled to run on its little-watched sister network, Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure on Sassa and Ancier is the general sense
that NBC's new fall shows are weak, potentially squandering the
promotional platform that several weeks of prime-time Olympics
coverage will provide.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has fallen behind in the reality game because ''we made our
traditional programming -- dramas and comedies -- that ran during the
season our top priority,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst believes that despite the criticism, NBC had its
priorities right. Advertisers still don't value reality shows as
highly as hit comedies or dramas, said Tom DeCabia, executive vice
president of the media buying firm Schulman Advanswers NY. And
chances are there will be far more failures than successes in the
upcoming flood of shows, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just have to get out of the summer and they'll be fine,''
DeCabia said. ''This storm will blow over.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has not only steered clear of the reality shows, it seemed
to stick up its nose at them. It sees itself as a network devoted
to serving an upscale, educated young audience.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many reality shows don't work unless they are
somewhat edgy and raw, Nash said. It means NBC not only has to
fight for the best ideas in an extremely competitive marketplace,
it must be careful not to go with ones that alienate their
audience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've always seen themselves as devoted to quality TV,'' he
said. ''Now here comes reality -- people eating rats on an island.
All of a sudden, NBC is caught between the devil and the deep blue
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
   REGIS PARTNER: Don't expect an announcement soon on who will
replace Kathie Lee Gifford as Regis Philbin's partner on their
daytime talk show. Gifford bows out on July 28. ''We're still
looking and we will continue to look,'' said Philbin, denying that
there is any ''short list'' of candidates. Only four people have
tried out for the role, and that's ''far too few'' to make such a
big decision, he said. ''This process may go on to the fall,''
Philbin said at a news conference last week.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has abandoned plans for a
family vacation this summer, opting instead to spend extended
weekends raising money for the Democratic Party, the White House
said Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Is Up 7; Nasdaq Slips 23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors mulled the
impact of a slowing economy: steadier interest rates but the
potential for weaker corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   At midmorning on Wall Street, The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 7.78 at 10,643.76, while the Nasdaq composite index was off
23.90 at 3,999.30.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.67 at 1,477.23.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were trading cautiously today as they digested a
positive jobs report from the government on Friday. The report gave
the latest evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing in response to
the Federal Reserve's six interest rate increases since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for
the next few months. While that's good news for investors who were
unnerved earlier this year by the Fed's actions, there is still a
great deal of concern in the market that the cumulative effect of
the rate hikes will be a drop in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also nervously awaiting the flood of second
quarter earnings reports, which start this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of waiting and watching until corporate
earnings announcements hit full stride the end of this week,'' said
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant surprise came this morning from aluminum producer
Alcoa, whose earnings came in higher than expected. Alcoa rose
$2.375 to $30.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Takes Yellow Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOURDES-HAUTACAM, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong surged into the
overall lead in the Tour de France on Monday with a stunning climb
in the Pyrenees that placed him second in the 10th stage.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who came back from cancer to win last year's Tour,
overtook 1998 winner Marco Pantani and contender Richard Virenque
on the final climb in cold, driving rain.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was in his element.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was about good tactics,'' he said. ''It was a good day
for me. I like these conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Texan started the day in 16th place, 5:54
behind, but his stirring performance gave him the yellow jersey for
the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The only rider he couldn't catch was Spain's Javier Ochoa, who
won the first tough climb that was roughly the halfway point of the
21-stage race.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, who rides for the Kelme team, won the 127-mile stage from
Dax to Lourdes-Hautacam in 6 hours, 9 minutes, 32 seconds.
Armstrong finished 42 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ochoa rode hard and led for so long,'' Armstrong said.
''Probably 99 percent of the people there were Spaniards cheering
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who rides for the U.S. Postal Service Team, has said
all along that he can dominate other top riders in the mountains.
The Tour is won and lost in those grueling stages, with good
climbers able to make up dozens of minutes in the overall
standings.
</P>
<P>
   The vital moment of the day -- and perhaps the whole Tour -- came
eight miles from the end.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was well behind Ochoa, in a group with Pantani, Alex
Zulle and 1997 Tour champion Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani attacked. Armstrong stayed with the shaven-headed
Italian, but Zulle and Ullrich struggled to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong suddenly accelerated, storming past Pantani and
attacking the group ahead of him, which included France's Virenque,
last year's King of the Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armstrong came through like a plane at the end,'' Virenque
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chilling winds, driving rain, mist and temperatures as low as 45
made it a day for brave riding. Several riders skidded down
treacherous mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's brilliant ride Monday was similar to his showing a
year ago, when he won the first tough mountain leg -- the race's
ninth stage -- to increase the overall lead he had taken the stage
before.
</P>
<P>
   He never relinquished the yellow jersey thereafter, and is in
position to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tour de France is very tough this year so I am not
counting on anything,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: 2006 World Cup Vote Is Final  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Soccer's governing body Monday upheld
the contentious vote for the 2006 World Cup that was won by
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   One New Zealand member of FIFA's executive committee has said
threats from ''influential European interests'' gave him no
alternative but to abstain from the final balloting in which South
Africa lost by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''For legal reasons, the vote is over, it's final,'' FIFA
spokesman Andreas Herren said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The executive committee decided on the procedure itself, and
the procedure was then carried out in the presence of a Swiss
public notary and in complete compliance with the Swiss law,''
Herren said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Zurich's Radio Z, FIFA general secretary Michel Zen
Ruffinen also stressed the election cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Germany won 12-11 on Thursday in the vote by the 24-member
committee to upset South Africa, the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   If Charles Dempsey of New Zealand voted for South Africa to make
it 12-12, FIFA president Sepp Blatter would have cast the deciding
vote. Blatter had campaigned heavily for the African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey described the threat as a simple one: ''It said if I
didn't vote for Germany I could be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, 78, announced his retirement as president of the
Oceania Football Confederation, on Sunday. He is a 36-year veteran
of international soccer administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't think his abstention would jeopardize South
Africa's bid. He added that other delegates had voted contrary to
expectations after a ''frenzy of bartering for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey's conduct sparked outrage in South Africa and
condemnation by international soccer and political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey refused to reveal the source of the threats. But his
daughter, Josephine King, the secretary-general of the Oceania
confederation, said her father had been pressured by UEFA.
</P>
<P>
   King said UEFA helped the fledgling Oceania confederation in the
past and was calling in favors, the New Zealand Press Association
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA and UEFA, European soccer's ruling organization, declined
to comment on Dempsey's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said he was exhausted from lack of sleep before the vote
because his telephone didn't stop ringing.
</P>
<P>
   A conversation with former South African president Nelson
Mandela didn't resolve his dilemma, Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He appreciated and could understand,'' Dempsey said. ''And he
told me to do whatever I thought was right. Obviously, he wanted me
to vote for South Africa, there was no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   A bribery scandal threatened to overshadow the ballot until a
German magazine claimed credit for placing hoax bribe letters under
the hotel doors of several delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said he raised the attempted bribe with FIFA but was
unaware it was a hoax until the vote was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''What really brought me down to earth was the bribe ... that's
when I took real fright,'' he said. ''That night was a nightmare in
my life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Monday as investors mulled the
impact of a slowing economy: steadier interest rates but the
potential for weaker corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on Wall Street, The Dow Jones industrial average was
up 24.39 at 10,660.37, while the Nasdaq composite index was off
13.01 at 4,010.01.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.58 at 1,480.48.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were trading cautiously as they digested a positive
jobs report from the government on Friday. The report gave the
latest evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing in response to the
Federal Reserve's six interest rate increases since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for
the next few months. While that's good news for investors who were
unnerved earlier this year by the Fed's actions, there is still a
great deal of concern in the market that the cumulative effect of
the rate hikes will be a drop in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Second quarter earnings annoucement begin in earnest this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of waiting and watching until corporate
earnings announcements hit full stride the end of this week,'' said
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The first Dow component to report profits, Alcoa, reported
higher-than-expected earnings. Shares of the aluminum producer rose
$2.25 to $29.875.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, expected to release its earnings report on Tuesday, fell
$4.625 to $111.875.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities upgraded its rating on several beaten down
retailers, including Best Buy, up $3.063 to $73.813 and Circuit
City Stores, up $2.688 to $37.688.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers upgraded chip maker Applied MicroDevices, which
rose $4.313 to $86.313.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 345.45 million
shares, down from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 1.23 to 529.45.

<HEADLINE> Wells, Johnson Are All-Star Starters  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Toronto's David Wells will start against
Arizona's Randy Johnson in Tuesday night's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when seven of 16 elected starters are unable to play,
the starting lineups announced Monday by AL manager Joe Torre and
NL manager Bobby Cox were vastly different from the ones selected
by fans.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Roberto Alomar -- who is ''iffy'' according to Torre
after getting hit by a pitch Sunday -- is tentatively down to lead
off for the AL and play second base.
</P>
<P>
   New York shortstop Derek Jeter bats second, followed by Yankees
teammate Bernie Williams in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland first baseman Jason Giambi bats cleanup, followed by
Boston's Carl Everett in left field, Texas' Ivan Rodriguez at
catcher, Kansas City's Jermaine Dye in right field, Cleveland's
Travis Fryman at third base and Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter replaced Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, Fryman subbed for
Baltimore's Cal Ripken and Everett for Cleveland's Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unfortunate how many players we lost due to injuries
the last couple of weeks,'' Torre said. ''You feel that something's
missing, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre chose Jeter over Boston rival Nomar Garciaparra, partly
because he plays for him on the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an easy decision because you know you're picking from
prime stuff all the time,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox wasn't even sure of one spot in his lineup, waiting until
later Monday to choose between Gary Sheffield of the Los Angeles
Dodgers and Vladimir Guerrero of the Montreal Expos in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero has first dibs ''if he wants to play left field and
start,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The original idea was to have him pick up (Sammy) Sosa in
right field,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's lineup has Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin leading off,
followed by Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones, Guerrero or
Sheffield, and Sosa hitting cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco second baseman Jeff Kent bats fifth, followed by
Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga, St. Louis center fielder
Jim Edmonds, Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds of San Francisco
had been elected to start in the outfield, St. Louis' Mark McGwire
at first base and the New York Mets' Mike Piazza at catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Wells leads the major leagues in wins, going 15-2 with a 3.44
ERA. Johnson tops the NL in victories, going 14-2 with a 1.80 ERA
and 198 strikeouts in 144 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Pedro Martinez, who started for the AL last year and
struck out five batters at Fenway Park, also is on the disabled
list and wasn't picked for the AL team.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a seven-time All-Star, while Wells was picked for the
third time.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will make a second journey
to Africa next month for a brief visit to Nigeria, the White House
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Nigeria on Aug. 25-27 to meet with
President Olusegun Obasanjo, said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart. The two plan to discuss U.S. support for the ''impressive
democratic transformation'' in Nigeria under Obasanjo, who pledged
to curb corruption and stabilize democratic rule when he took
office last year.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cutting Africa Life Expectancy  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Life expectancy in countries worst
hit by Africa's staggering AIDS epidemic is expected to fall to
around 30 within a decade -- the lowest in a century -- as the
disease kills tens of millions more in its sweep across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate, released Monday, is the latest attempt to
quantify the incredible breadth and effect of the epidemic on
sub-Saharan Africa, where 15 million have died of AIDS and 25
million more infected people almost certainly will die in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to comprehend the amount of mortality we will see in
these countries,'' said Karen Stanecki of the U.S. Census Bureau,
which compiled the projections.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki presented the new figures at the 13th International
AIDS Conference, a high-profile meeting being held for the first
time in Africa, ground zero of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS already has sharply reduced life expectancy in many
southern African countries. For instance, in Botswana, where more
than one-third of adults are infected with HIV, life expectancy is
now 39 instead of 71, as it would have been without the disease.
And the numbers are expected only to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki projected that by 2010, life expectancy will be 29 in
Botswana, 30 in Swaziland, 33 in Namibia and Zimbabwe and 36 in
South Africa, Malawi and Rwanda. Without AIDS, it would have been
around 70 in many of those countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are a level of life expectancy that have not been seen
since the start of the 20th century,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the meeting struggled for superlatives to describe
the scope of this disease in the poorest parts of the globe,
especially sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly three-quarters of all
HIV-infected people live.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem will get much worse before it gets better,'' said
Dr. Roy M. Anderson of Oxford University. ''This is undoubtedly the
most serious infectious disease threat in recorded human history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin DeCock of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention called the epidemic ''Africa's worst social catastrophe
since slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki predicted that by 2003, the populations of Botswana,
South Africa and Zimbabwe will begin to fall because of AIDS deaths
and dropping fertility resulting from the epidemic. In those
countries, the populations will drop between one-tenth and
three-tenths of 1 percent. Without AIDS, they would have grown
between 1 percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stanecki said this is the first time the Census Bureau has
projected negative population growth due to AIDS. The population
growth of several other countries -- including Malawi, Namibia,
Swaziland and Zambia -- will be near zero because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that programs to educate people about condoms and
other ways of avoiding infection clearly can work in southern
Africa. Because of early efforts, the epidemic never occurred in
Senegal, and Uganda has reversed its high infection level.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS medicines have dramatically improved survival in the United
States and Europe, but the drugs are simply too expensive and hard
to deliver for most of the world's infected. Five drug companies
have pledged to lower their prices in the developing world, but
health officials in poor countries note they still lack the health
care services necessary to offer the medicines to the sick.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation, created by
Microsoft's founder, said it will spend $50 million in Botswana to
strengthen that country's health care system. Merck &AMP; Co. said it
will match the donation in Botswana, mostly by providing AIDS
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Soccer Stampede Kills 13  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A stampede left 13 people dead in the
nation's worst sports tragedy, triggered when police fired tear gas
at unruly soccer fans during a World Cup qualifying game.
</P>
<P>
   Players from South Africa and Zimbabwe choked and writhed on the
field, covering their faces as tear gas spread through National
Sports Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital authorities said 12 victims were dead on arrival
Sunday, and another fan died of injuries Monday. Many others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor said most of the deaths were from internal injures
consistent with being crushed.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe on Monday accused opposition agitators
of provoking the violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said a group of agitators had been planted at the stadium to
shout slogans and display opposition party symbols before throwing
bottles and other things on the field, the official Zimbabwe news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sport should never turn into warfare,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Welshman Ncube, the third ranking official in the main
opposition party, accused Mugabe of attempting to defend ''criminal
overreaction'' by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if people shouted slogans, it was spontaneous and this
was clearly unjustifiable action by the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA, soccer's governing body, expressed ''sincere condolences
to the bereaved families,'' and said it will investigate. The
Zimbabwe Football Association said Monday it also will look into
the tragedy and report to FIFA.
</P>
<P>
   Fans hurled bottles and other items onto the field after South
Africa scored its second goal in the 84th minute, giving the
visitors a 2-0 lead in the game, part of the second round of
African qualifying for the 2002 tournament in Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Police then fired tear gas at the crowd of more than 50,000. A
stampede broke out as the fans scrambled to leave the stadium. A
fire hydrant was torn from its mountings, spraying water over
fleeing fans.
</P>
<P>
   The game was called off with about 10 minutes remaining, but
South Africa's 2-0 victory over Zimbabwe was ruled official.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths follow three other stadium tragedies in recent years
during World Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Nine were crushed during a stampede at in Zambia in 1996. At
least 78 were killed in a stampede that October at Guatemala City,
and at least three died on April 23 in Liberia in an overcrowded
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players in Sunday's game were three who play for
English clubs -- Quinton Fortune and Eric Tinkler of South Africa
and Peter Ndlovu of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came three days after South Africa was denied in
its bid to become the first African country to hold the World Cup.
Germany was awarded the 2006 tournament in a 12-11 vote by the
executive committee of FIFA, soccer's Swiss-based governing body.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa made it to the first round of the 1998 World Cup
and placed third in this year's African Nations Cup. Zimbabwe has
never qualified for the World Cup and did not qualify for this
year's African Nations Cup.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Discuss Summits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton spoke by phone Monday with
Russian President Vladimir Putin, in preparation for their meeting
in Japan later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Putin initiated the 15-minute call, said White House national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley. Putin told Clinton of his plans to
stop in China and North Korea on his way to Okinawa, site of the
annual economic summit of leading industrialized nations, and
Clinton told Putin of his Mideast peace summit beginning Tuesday at
Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the second time that President Putin has picked up the
phone and called President Clinton, so that is evidence they are
establishing a businesslike relationship,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said Clinton and Putin agreed to continue their
discussion of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, ''particularly
with respect to Iran,'' during their Okinawa session. Putin noted
Saturday's failed test of the U.S. missile defense system, and both
leaders said they would discuss missile defense in Okinawa as well,
Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also discussed Chechnya, with Clinton telling
Putin ''there had been a lot of concern in Congress'' over
rescheduling Soviet debt with the Chechen conflict continuing,
Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin thanked Clinton for his executive order last month that
cleared the way for resumed shipments of processed Russian uranium
to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Wave of Interest in Vermeer Grows  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Johannes Vermeer's modest output of quiet,
domestic masterpieces has inspired numerous works imagining him and
his world -- most recently a flurry of novels and, now, an opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Writing to Vermeer'' has its U.S. premiere Tuesday at the
Lincoln Center Festival. It is primarily a study of domestic
harmony, with libretto by filmmaker Peter Greenaway, better known
for provocative, often rough material in movies such as ''The Cook,
the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' ''Prospero's Books'' and the
recent ''8&AMP;frac12; Women''.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway was trained as a painter and says his interest in the
17th-century Dutch painter is longstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel I'm part of the current wave of Vermeer
enthusiasm,'' Greenaway says. ''My enthusiasm started when I was an
art student.'' He notes that his 1985 film, ''A Zed and Two
Noughts,'' touched on Vermeer ''as a master of light.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Writing to Vermeer'' grew out of a lecture that Greenaway gave
at a showing of Vermeer paintings at the Hague in 1996. The same
exhibition, which showed in Washington the year before, also
inspired the authors of four recent novels: Tracy Chevalier, who
wrote ''Girl With a Pearl Earring''; Susan Vreeland, ''Girl in
Hyacinth Blue''; Deborah Moggach, ''Tulip Fever''; and Katherine
Weber, ''The Music Lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Vreeland, whose novel traces the provenance of a painting
through the generations, speculates that Vermeer's appeal lies in
his works' serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to do with our fast-paced lives and the calm and
tranquility of the lives that he is picturing,'' she says. ''He
presents, very often, a woman in a contemplative moment, alone in
her house, with gorgeous, honey-colored light coming in from a
window, bathing her and an object. I think he loved to suggest the
value of things. It's a spare interior but just by that spareness,
we notice a loaf of bread or a pitcher of milk or a woman holding
up a string of pearls.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway's libretto emphasizes similar themes.
</P>
<P>
   For his lecture at the Hague, Greenaway wrote 18 fictional
letters to Vermeer from his wife, mother-in-law and a model while
the painter was away from his home in Delft in 1672. (Vermeer
really did make a rare trip away from home in 1672 to appraise some
paintings at the Hague.)
</P>
<P>
   For the lecture, Greenaway and colleague Saskia Boddeke used
three actresses to portray the women and read the letters. In the
audience was Pierre Audi, head of the Netherlands Opera, who
suggested that Greenaway turn the work into an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway and composer Louis Andriessen had had a success with
their first opera collaboration, ''Rosa,'' at the Netherlands Opera
in 1994. It told the tale of a South American composer of Westerns
who loved his girlfriend and his horse, especially the horse. All
three met gory ends. Nonesuch Records released ''Rosa'' on CD in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway says he and Andriessen saw ''Writing to Vermeer'' as a
gentle answer to ''Rosa.''
</P>
<P>
   '''Rosa' was very violent. Women were depicted in a completely
different way. We wanted this to be about something you could say
was the complete opposite,'' says Greenaway, whose films, too, have
sometimes generated controversy over their treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   Andriessen used about a third of the text from the letters for
his one-hour, 40-minute opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were low-key, about domestic matters, about the
children,'' Greenaway says. ''We think Vermeer was a very domestic
man. He had 11 children. They were about the price of canvas and
where to buy good ultramarine'' for paint. Vermeer himself isn't a
character in the opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our starting point was celebrating the domestic serenity
Vermeer was so successful at capturing,'' Greenaway says. ''His
paintings show women who have their own space and dignity. Our job
was to make a worthwhile work of art about domestic harmony which
had some profundity about it and wasn't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ''But harmony is difficult to show.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Greenaway, Boddeke rightly realized that ''To
understand harmony, you oppose it with its opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Boddeke, who directs the opera, inserted additional scenes
depicting the harshness of the outside world, in contrast to the
Vermeers' family life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opera is about harmony, the warm family life. But the
outside world, through violence, is bringing the harmonious world
out of balance,'' she says. ''We have brief 'inserts' which stop
the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch composer Michel van der Aa wrote electronic music for the
inserts,which depict Holland's economic crisis when tulips became
too expensive; a fatal explosion of stored arms in Delft; street
riots between Catholics and Protestants; a killing by a mob; and
the deliberate flooding of Holland to drive out the invading
French.
</P>
<P>
   Boddeke added two characters -- a milkmaid and a servant. For
her, important aspects of the opera are the strength, independence
and education of the women, and people's need to find balance and
live a good life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Writing to Vermeer'' premiered in Amsterdam last Dec. 1 and
was performed at the Adelaide Festival in Australia in March. Its
Lincoln Center performances will be Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The main singers are Kathryn Harries as the mother-in-law, Susan
Narucki as the wife and Barbara Hannigan as the model.

<HEADLINE> Ratings for 'Big Brother' Sink Fast  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- What if they built a house, equipped it with 28
television cameras, threw in 10 strangers and no one watched?
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite panic time for CBS, but ratings for the
summer-long reality series ''Big Brother'' are sinking fast after
four days on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The show's debut, airing directly after the hit ''Survivor''
last Wednesday, drew 22.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen
Media Research. The next night, the audience sank to 11.6 million
viewers, but the show still beat a repeat of NBC's ''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's audience was 8.6 million and Saturday's episode -- a
wrapup of the first week -- drew 6.5 million. That's less than a
third of the audience for the first night.
</P>
<P>
   In CBS's defense, July weekends aren't big TV-watching times and
Saturday is traditionally the least-watched night of the week. CBS
spokesman Chris Ender said that when ''Big Brother'' aired in
Europe, the show got a big first-night audience, sank in the
ratings but revived when people began to be voted out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the trend can't be heartening for CBS, which is committed to
airing the show five nights a week through September.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to have a really hard time turning this
around,'' said Marc Berman, a TV analyst for Media Week Online.
''It's pretty grisly.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans afoot to retool the show or cut back on its
schedule, Ender said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's unfair to compare ''Big Brother'' ratings to
''Survivor,'' which grew in viewership its first four weeks on the
air to the point where it was the most popular show on TV the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday's show, the ''Big Brother'' housemates spent time
worrying about the health of a pet chicken that had a scratch on
its eye.
</P>
<P>
   That should at least please animal rights activists, who were
annoyed when the island castaways on ''Survivor'' chopped off the
head of a chicken and had it for dinner.

<HEADLINE> 'The Patriot' Spurs British Anger  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Already smarting from Hollywood's revisionist bent
in a succession of quasi-historical films, Britons are demanding a
public apology and a retraction from the makers of Mel Gibson's
latest blockbuster, ''The Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary War saga doesn't open here until August, but
British historians and journalists already have savaged the epic
for its flag-waving simplification of events.
</P>
<P>
   ''With their own record of killing 12 million American Indians
and supporting slavery for four decades after the British abolished
it, Americans wish to project their historical guilt onto someone
else,'' historian Andrew Roberts wrote in the Daily Express
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Truth is the first casualty in Hollywood's war,'' The Daily
Telegraph chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes on the heels of other questionable film
revisions, including ''Saving Private Ryan,'' which ignored the
D-Day contributions of Britain and other countries, and the recent
''U-571,'' which showed Americans capturing a German Enigma coding
machine to break Nazi communications. The feat actually was
accomplished by the Brits in 1941 -- before the United States
entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot,'' released in the United States in time for the
July 4th box-office bonanza, is set during the 1775-1781 American
War of Independence. Gibson plays the fictional Benjamin Martin, a
reluctant rebel swept into the war when his family is threatened by
King George III's nasty British Redcoats.
</P>
<P>
   The film's main villain is the bloodthirsty Col. William
Tavington, leader of Britain's Green Dragoons, who in one scene
shoots a child and in another rounds up screaming villagers, locks
them in a church and torches them alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Liverpool City Council, incensed by what it called the
''character assassination'' of native son Banestre Tarleton -- a
former Liverpool lawmaker and Green Dragoons leader on whom
Tavington is based -- has fired off a letter to Columbia Pictures
demanding a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollywood has a habit of taking away the character of notable
English people and demonizing them,'' Liverpool Mayor Edwin Clein
said. ''We know it happened with 'Braveheart' and it is readily
accepted with 'Titanic.' It's annoying this happens when the
Americans make a film purporting to be factual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, Tarleton was a ruthless soldier,'' Clein added, ''but the
film goes a lot farther than that and assassinates his character
altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   No evidence exists that Tarleton was involved in infanticide or
any incidents such as the church arson and murders, said Scott
Withrow, historian at South Carolina's Cowpens National
Battlefield, where the Redcoats were defeated in 1781.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, it did not happen,'' said Withrow, though he
noted Tarleton had a reputation for brutality. ''Somehow the
Patriot forces latched onto Tarleton and used him for propaganda.
The Patriot army were masters of this at that time and they built
him up as a hated person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. historians and critics -- also angered by the loose
grip ''The Patriot'' shows on the facts -- have noted that the
church incident closely mirrored an act committed by the Nazis in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Pictures has not responded to Liverpool's demand for an
apology. Spokesmen for the studio and for Mel Gibson and actor
Jason Isaacs -- who portrays Tavington -- did not answer requests for
interviews from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But Gibson, already derided by Scottish historians for
inaccuracies in the film ''Braveheart,'' readily conceded the
factually challenged aspect of ''The Patriot'' in an interview with
London's Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not historically accurate. In the broad strokes, yes --
on other levels, it is sheer fantasy. It's a movie,'' Gibson said,
justifying the fallacies as an educational experience. ''It's a
good thing that historians are going to harangue this and say,
'It's not accurate.' Good. It'll make somebody pick up a book.''

<HEADLINE> 'Blade Runner' Character Not Human  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Director Ridley Scott has confirmed what many
sci-fi fans have long suspected -- Deckard, the hard-bitten hero
played by Harrison Ford in 1982's ''Blade Runner,'' is not quite
human.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a replicant,'' Scott was quoted as telling Britain's
Channel 4 television, referring to the genetically engineered
androids Ford's 21st-century Los Angeles cop is charged with
tracking down.
</P>
<P>
   Film fans have debated the character's nature since Scott
released his director's cut of the movie in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial flop when it was initially released -- with a
studio-imposed voiceover and a tacked-on happy ending -- ''Blade
Runner'' became a cult classic.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary airs on Saturday.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The move from NBC News White House correspondent

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Eagle Don Henley is enjoying life in
the slow lane now that he has left Los Angeles and returned to his
native Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe I've discovered my better self,'' Henley, who
married Sharon Summerall in 1995 and is raising three children,
told the Daily News of Los Angeles over the weekend.
</P>

   The change is evident in ''Inside Job,'' his first release of

<HEADLINE> Leno: Hardest-Working in Show Biz?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- James Brown, move over. Jay Leno may be the
new hardest-working guy in show business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to putting in marathon work days as the host of
''The Tonight Show,'' Leno performs stand-up comedy at private
shows -- as many as 100 performances per year.
</P>
<P>
   Leno earns an estimated $14 million per year at NBC. He gets as
much as $100,000 per appearance by corporate customers eager to see
the late-night talk show host perform in a more intimate venue, the
Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he still working so hard at the peak of his success?
</P>
<P>
   Leno said many people outside of show business work just as hard
as he does, without the recognition. But he doesn't discount the
financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''People always say, 'Oh, money can't make you happy,''' Leno
said. ''But if you're already happy, money can make you happier.''

<HEADLINE> 'Harry Potter' Sales Break Records  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Harry Potter provided some cash register magic
for the nation's bookstores over the weekend, many of which tallied
record-breaking sales thanks to the much-hyped release of the
fourth book in the children's series.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers -- big and small, on and off the Web -- reported
Monday that crowds packed their stores continuously since early
Saturday, when ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' went on sale
at 12:01 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   Some chains even said that they were running low on books and
had already started talking with U.S. publisher Scholastic Inc. to
get more. Scholastic, meantime, already plans to print about 2
million more copies of the $25.95 book in the next few months,
adding to the 3.8 million copies generated during the first U.S.
print run.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. had its biggest weekend in history, selling
502,000 of the new Harry Potter books as of the close of business
on Sunday night. That included about 100,000 through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for the New York-based chain,
added that the huge crowds helped boost overall sales, as the
people who flocked to the stores ended up buying other books as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, too, had a stellar weekend, with 389,000 total
orders coming in. Eighteen percent of the orders came from new
customers to its Web site, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 were pre-ordered before the book even went on sale
and about 40,000 orders were tallied since early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx Corp. delivered 250,000 copies for Amazon on Saturday, 95
percent of the orders arriving at customers' homes by 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Amazon said it still has plenty of copies of the
new book.
</P>
<P>
   The giant retailers weren't the only ones pulling in the big
crowds. The St. Paul, Minn.-based Red Balloon Bookshop had a steady
stream of shoppers visit over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Bassett, a full-time bookseller at The Red Balloon, said
the store had about 500 pre-orders and then sold an additional 150
to 200 books. The bookstore still has around 100 books left.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rush has somewhat ended, but the books are still easing
out the door at a nice pace,'' Bassett said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 59; Nasdaq Up 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly Monday as investors mulled
the impact of a slowing economy and searched for corporate
stalwarts that could withstand tougher economic times.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon on Wall Street, The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 59.04 at 10,695.02, while the Nasdaq composite index was up
2.13 at 4,025.33.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 6.53 at 1,485.43.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were trading cautiously as they digested a positive
jobs report from the government on Friday. The report gave the
latest evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing in response to the
Federal Reserve's six interest rate increases since last June.
</P>
<P>
   A slowing economy signals steadier interest rates but also the
potential for weaker corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for
the next few months. While that's good news for investors who were
unnerved earlier this year by the Fed's actions, there is still a
great deal of concern in the market that the cumulative effect of
the rate hikes will be a drop in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of waiting and watching until corporate
earnings announcements hit full stride the end of this week,'' said
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The first Dow component to report profits, Alcoa, reported
higher-than-expected earnings. Shares of the aluminum producer rose
$2.25 to $29.875.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, expected to release its earnings report on Tuesday, fell
$6.188 to $110.313.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities upgraded its rating on several beaten down
retailers, including Best Buy, up $4.313 to $75.063 and Circuit
City Stores, up $2.688 to $37.688.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating of computer chip maker
Applied MicroDevices, which rose $3.313 to $85.313.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 3531.75 million
shares, down from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 3.72 to 531.94.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Secretary West To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West Jr.,
whose two-year tenure was marred by accusations of mismanagement,
is stepping down with less than seven months left in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under his leadership, the VA has begun to confront some
long-neglected problems head-on, reaching out to more than 400,000
veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, pressing for answers to
the Gulf War syndrome and proper care for those who suffer from
it,'' President Clinton said Monday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   West, a former Army secretary and lobbyist who plans to return
to the private sector, will be succeeded by his deputy, Hershel
Gober of Monticello, Ark., a veteran of both the Army and the
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hershel has already made his mark on the critical issue of
veterans' health care,'' Clinton said, referring to the more than
400 outpatient clinics the VA has opened during the administration
to help serve more than 3 million veterans and their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   West's tenure as head of the federal government's second largest
department was problematic.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the department's inspector general reported that the
agency's congressional affairs office was in disarray, saying it
responded so late to congressional inquiries that some documents
were backdated to ''hide ... processing delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators previously reported that the
department used $61 million in travel funds for salaries and
equipment and allowed some top administrators to approve their own
expenses. Another inspector general report said West violated
government regulations and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars by
using military aircraft in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Autry, a spokesman for the Disabled American Veterans,
which has accused West of not pushing the administration to spend
more on veterans, said he was troubled by the timing of West's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate conferees are just preparing to finalize
funding for the agency, including more than $20 billion in
discretionary funds for veterans' health care. Without strong
leadership at the agency, Congress could reduce these health care
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The funding levels are anything but set in stone,'' Autry
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Dump Fire Kills 31  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A mountain of garbage loosened by
rain collapsed and burst into flames Monday at Manila's biggest
dump, flattening squatters' shanties and killing 31 people,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 29 other people were injured and at least 68 remained
missing late Monday, Red Cross spokeswoman Tess Usapdin said. The
victims were poor people who earn a living by scavenging garbage in
the Payatas dump.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers dug through the wall of rotting garbage late into the
night, but were hampered by the stench and lack of equipment,
including adequate lighting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One scavenger, Gloria Alano, sobbed and yelled at rescuers using
a heavy bulldozer on a heap of garbage to search for survivors and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Backhoe, use only backhoes, not bulldozers, I want to get the
bodies of my loved ones,'' she cried. Her husband and three
children were buried under the tons of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   After collapsing onto the shanties, the wall of garbage burst
into flames, engulfing the area. Residents said the debris may have
been ignited by fallen power cables or stoves being used in huts
covered by the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the Payatas dump in Quezon City, the largest in
metropolitan Manila, often smolder from the spontaneous combustion
of rotting garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks could not reach the area because of limited space
and parked on a main road several blocks from the dump. Hoses were
pulled through crowded alleys by firefighters, who extinguished
most of the blaze after several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Castro, whose shanty was perched alongside the mountain
of garbage, said he felt the ground shift in the morning, before it
finally collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I left the house because I needed to sell outside, so I left
my wife and child,'' he said. ''When I came back my house was gone
and my wife and child are buried underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   The wall of garbage buried an area of squatter houses about the
size of four basketball courts. About 100 houses were covered,
Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay said.
</P>
<P>
   About 780 people were taken to an evacuation center at city
hall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one area, rescuers pulled out three bodies, including a man
badly burned but breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross volunteers doused his body with water from a fire hose
but failed to revive him, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   A week of heavy rains followed by a thunderstorm early Monday
apparently caused a crack in the upper portion of the mountain of
garbage, Manila police chief Edgar Aglipay said.
</P>
<P>
   The dumpsite was to be closed permanently last December but the
plan was postponed until later this year after residents at a
garbage landfill in San Mateo in nearby Rizal province refused to
allow waste from metropolitan Manila to be dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have tried in recent years to relocate the
hundreds of scavengers and junk yard workers living around the
Payatas dumpsite, but most have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Ranola, a hospitalized dump resident, said they
declined to be relocated because they could not afford the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump and a former dump in Manila's Tondo slum
district called Smokey Mountain long symbolized the wrenching
poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, ordered
Smokey Mountain leveled in the mid-1990s and built apartment
buildings at the former eyesore.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Rage Throughout SE Europe  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Hundreds of wildfires sparked by a
prolonged heat wave raged through southeastern Europe on Monday,
spurring officials in Bulgaria and Greece to declare states of
emergency as meteorologists forecast a new spike in temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters battled large wildfires in Bulgaria, Greece,
Italy and Serbia's Kosovo province, medical services geared up for
resurgent heat. Daytime temperatures in much of the region remained
above 100 degrees, and some spots were expecting the mercury to
approach 110 degrees Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two pensioners were reported dead in Italy on Monday, and 13
people died in Cyprus and Turkey over the weekend. A total of more
than 50 people have died throughout the region since last week --
killed by everything from heatstroke to drowning or falling off
roofs while trying to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   ''The forecast for the coming days shows a worsening of these
weather conditions,'' Greek Interior Minister Vasso Papandreou
said.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes have stretched the region's firefighting capabilities
to the breaking point, preventing one country from helping the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at what happened in Italy,'' Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said. ''Our neighbor asked for help, but we did not
have the capability of offering it because we are using our forces
on our own fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires persisted the Italian countryside Monday. Authorities said
two fires were devastating scrubland in one of Italy's most
beautiful nature spots -- in the mountains of the national park
above the northeastern coast, near Portafino.
</P>
<P>
   In Bulgaria, a state of emergency was declared in the southeast
as a fire spreading on an estimated 60-mile-wide front swept
through rural areas. State radio quoted Prime Minister Ivan Kostov
as saying more than 1,000 acres of wheat fields and more than
10,000 acres of forest had burned. There have been a reported 1,500
fires around Bulgaria since July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Fires also were burning in four of Kosovo's five military
sectors. One blaze destroyed several houses near Planeja in
southern Kosovo and forced the evacuation of residents. NATO said
firefighters there were hampered by the large number of land mines
and unexploded ordnance left over from the conflict between the
Serb government and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the government again made climate-controlled halls
and stadiums available to people without air conditioners while
nearly 5,000 firefighters battled more than 150 blazes around the
country. The fires were fanned by winds and temperatures expected
to rise from Monday's 102 degrees up to 109 degrees on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious blaze was on the Aegean Sea resort island of
Samos, a popular tourist destination and birthplace of the ancient
mathematician Pythagoras. A state of emergency was declared there
Thursday. On Monday, thousands of firefighters, soldiers and
volunteers and a dozen aircraft were fighting the fire, which has
so far burned about one-fifth of the island.
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency was also declared in the central Greece. In
addition, firefighters fought blazes near ancient Delphi and on the
Ionian Sea resort islands of Corfu and Zakynthos.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, four people died of heat in Cyprus over the weekend
and nine people were killed in Turkey. Five drowned as they tried
to cool themselves in waterfalls, rivers and canals, two died after
they rolled off roofs where they slept seeking relief and two were
felled by heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures are forecast to stay near or above 104 degrees
until Wednesday, when a cold air mass breaks through a high
pressure barrier that has brought hot air north from the Sahara.
Average regional temperatures swing from about 86 to 95 degrees in
July.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Boasts Thriving Energy Sector  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba now produces more of its own crude petroleum
and gas than it did before it lost crucial oil subsidies with the
collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago, plunging the island
nation into a severe economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba this year is projected to produce 2.8 million tons of
petroleum, Economics and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
said. Before the Soviet breakup, Cuba produced only 1 million tons
of its own petroleum annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez' comments were carried late Sunday by Cuba's Prensa
Latina news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The minister said that Cuba also has moved into the extraction
and production of other energy products that were ''practically
nonexistent'' here in the 1980s, such as natural gas. Cuba is
projected to produce 600 billion cubic meters of natural gas for
domestic consumption this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the decade-long austerity program known here as the
''special period,'' Cuba has been forced to learn to be
self-sufficient, producing many of the products it once received
free or heavily subsidized from its former communist allies in the
Soviet bloc.

<HEADLINE> A Failed Summit Could Hurt Barak  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Clinton invited Israel and the
Palestinians to come and talk peace at Camp David, he said there
was much to gain and little to lose by bringing the two sides
together now. That may no longer be true.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodied by political infighting, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak may find it impossible to tarry long in the United States
while right-wing opponents continue to campaign against him at
home.
</P>
<P>
   And the meltdown of Barak's governing coalition on the eve of
the summit might have left him so weakened that even if a landmark
accord were struck at Camp David, he could have trouble selling it
to the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never before has a national leader embarked on such a crucial
mission for his country amid such weakness,'' commentator Yoel
Marcus wrote in Monday's editions of Israel's Haaretz newspaper.
''And it certainly makes it difficult for Yasser Arafat, who will
not know whether whatever is agreed upon is ... signed only in
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have made it clear they think it is the wrong
time for dealmaking. Arafat agreed under U.S. pressure to come to
the summit, but his top aides expressed pessimism over the chances
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't trust the Israelis,'' Palestinian negotiator Yasser
Abed Rabbo said flatly as the Palestinians prepared to depart for
the United States. Upon arrival, Palestinian delegation sources
predicted the summit would lead to little more than an agreement to
hold another one later.
</P>
<P>
   Even with low expectations on the Palestinian side, failure
could intensify the kind of frustration that already fuels a daily
war of attrition in the Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
   After a Palestinian woman was killed and four others wounded
Sunday by Israeli army troops in the Gaza Strip near a Jewish
settlement, Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji
protested furiously, brushing aside an Israeli apology that the
civilians had been caught in accidental cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people's lives are not cheap,'' he said, warning that an
''explosion of violence'' could occur if no peace accord is
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, writing in Newsweek magazine, acknowledged that the
ugly climate on the ground heightens the dangers should the summit
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the parties do not seize this moment to make more progress,
there will be more hostility and more bitterness -- perhaps even
more violence,'' Clinton wrote in the magazine that appeared on
newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak can continue to govern despite the defection Sunday of
three rightist parties that accused him of being willing to concede
too much to the Palestinians. But without his parliamentary
majority, he can expect to be constantly harried by opponents as
they graphically demonstrated Monday when they delayed his
departure for the summit by staging no-confidence votes.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's political foes also put him on notice that
they will try to force early elections, which would put peacemaking
efforts on hold at a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go to elections -- you have done enough damage!'' hawkish
former defense minister Ariel Sharon told Barak during Monday's
stormy parliamentary session. ''I call on ... everyone who wants a
better peace to join in calls for new elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak might very well win another election -- he won handily the
first time -- but an electoral campaign would mean Israel and the
Palestinians likely would miss a Sept. 13 deadline for signing an
accord. The Palestinians have said they will declare statehood that
day, treaty or no treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat already put off a statehood declaration once while Barak
was campaigning, in May 1999, and might have little appetite for
doing so again.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister insists that despite the worst political
turmoil of his year in office, ordinary Israelis still support his
peace efforts. The polls suggest he is right about that.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey published Monday in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper,
conducted among 502 Israelis with a margin of error of 4.5
percentage points, 53 percent said he had a mandate to make
concessions to the Palestinians, while 44 percent said he did not.
</P>
<P>
   But that support could slip while Barak is at Camp David. In his
absence, Jewish settlers -- infuriated by Barak's acknowledgment
that a peace accord could leave 50,000 of them outside the umbrella
of Israeli sovereignty -- intend to step up a campaign of mass
street protests.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Barak's worries, political foes including conservative
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are increasingly claiming
the spotlight and finding a sympathetic audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am worried about the future and safety of the state of
Israel,'' Netanyahu said Monday as he toured northern Israel, where
many people are jittery over the pullout of Israeli troops from a
buffer zone in south Lebanon. ''I don't know details about promises
made to the Palestinians, but I am certainly worried over what I do
know.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Drug Firms Pledge Millions for AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- With the international AIDS
conference under way, pharmaceutical companies have begun
announcing donations of medicine and money to help Africa fight the
disease that is ravaging the continent.
</P>
<P>
   But many government officials and activists are unimpressed:
They accuse the companies of trying to distract people from the
high price of their vital AIDS medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want giveaways. ... We'd rather they reduce the price
of (all) their drugs,'' said Sharon Ekambaram of the HIV/AIDS
People's Treatment Action Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest round in a long-running battle over AIDS
drugs, which are crucial for sufferers to live longer but so
expensive that many people -- and governments -- in Africa cannot
afford them. Drug companies say they're merely trying to recoup
money spent developing the drugs; activists say the companies are
set on reaping huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical giant Merck and Co. announced Monday it would
join the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in donating $100 million
worth of medicine and money to help fight AIDS in Botswana, where
nearly 36 percent of adults are infected.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates foundation pledged $50 million over five years to help
the country strengthen its health care system. Merck promised to
match the value of the Gates' gift by managing the program and
donating antiretroviral medications that help control the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to make a world of difference for people living
with HIV in Botswana and that is something that cannot be
ignored,'' said Merck spokesman Jeffrey Turchio.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a pledge by German drug company
Boehringer-Ingelheim. It promised Friday to offer the drug
nevirapine free for five years to developing countries to help
reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer-Ingelheim and Merck are two of five major drug
companies that announced May 11 they would work with governments in
Africa and other poor regions to sharply cut the overall costs of
HIV/AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Though two months have passed since the announcement, the
specifics of that promise have yet to be worked out. Meanwhile, the
24.5 million Africans infected with the virus that causes AIDS
continue to suffer and die, activists say.
</P>
<P>
   High Court Justice Edwin Cameron, the most prominent member of
South Africa's government to openly talk of his HIV infection, on
Monday condemned the ''inequitous and immoral drug pricing and
international patent regime'' and issued ''a call to action for the
drug companies to immediately and without further delay, without
further dialogue, reduce prices dramatically and instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other activists dismissed the drug companies' offers as efforts
to generate good publicity during a conference where the companies
have been roundly condemned.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've all been trying to jump on the bandwagon of this
Durban 2000 conference,'' Ekambaram said. ''We know where their
interest lies -- not in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Many donations are limited in amounts and time, she said,
asking: ''What happens after that?''
</P>
<P>
   Turchio, the Merck spokesman, said the companies are working to
solve the problem of high drug prices. He defended the offer made
in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just a vague promise as I've heard it called. We have
made a firm commitment to do that,'' he said. ''We're not
undertaking this lightly. It's a serious commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the AIDS conference in Durban, speakers of varying
political stripes have almost uniformly united to demand cheaper
medicine. Nearly 5,000 people marched Sunday to demand greater
access to drugs for people in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, head of the African National
Congress' Women's League, told a rally before the march:
</P>
<P>
   ''The war against AIDS begins with the struggle against the drug
companies. It is incontestable that there are medicines that can
extend and dramatically improve the lives of people living with
HIV/AIDS. The struggle is now to get hold of them.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 57 As Nasdaq Slips 19  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading
Monday as investors traded cautiously ahead of a rush of corporate
earnings reports expected later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 57.63 at 10,693.61, while the Nasdaq composite index
was down 19.10 at 4,004.10.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.06 at 1,481.96.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were still digesting a positive jobs report from the
government on Friday. The report gave the latest evidence that the
U.S. economy is slowing in response to the Federal Reserve's six
interest rate increases since last June.
</P>
<P>
   A slowing economy signals steadier interest rates but also the
potential for weaker corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for
the next few months. While that's good news for investors who were
unnerved earlier this year by the Fed's actions, there is still a
great deal of concern in the market that the cumulative effect of
the rate hikes will be a drop in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of waiting and watching until corporate
earnings announcements hit full stride the end of this week,'' said
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The first Dow component to report profits, Alcoa, reported
higher-than-expected earnings. Shares of the aluminum producer rose
$2.125 to $29.75.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, expected to release its earnings report on Tuesday, fell
$6.50 to $110.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating of computer chip maker
Applied MicroDevices, which rose $3.313 to $85.313.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a five to three margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 3531.75
million shares, down from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 3.72 to 531.94.

<HEADLINE> Upper House Rejects Putin's Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The upper house of Russia's parliament on Monday
rejected President Vladimir Putin's bid to expand his powers and
reform the chamber, and warned of ''unpredictable consequences''
for the country if Putin succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house, or Federation Council, made the warning in a
six-point list of objections to Putin's moves that it submitted to
the lower house, the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has proposed a package of bills aimed at trimming the
authority of regional governors who make up the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
   The president describes his package as an attempt to force
regional bosses to comply with the country's 1993 constitution, but
critics say he is trying to eliminate checks and balances on
presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Duma approved one of the proposed laws, allowing
Putin to fire local officials and mayors, but the Federation
Council voted down another one, also previously approved by the
Duma, which would let the president dismiss governors who violate
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation Council already has rejected the third measure,
which would have replaced governors in the upper chamber with
appointed senators. It later agreed to form a joint commission with
the Duma to work out a compromise on that bill.
</P>
<P>
   The two houses of parliament have been engaged in an intense
battle over Putin's plan, with the more powerful State Duma
strongly supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   In the list of objections submitted to the Duma, the upper house
insisted that there was no need to change the current structure of
the council, which complied with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It said Putin's plan, if implemented, would entail
''unpredictable negative consequences for the functioning of
institutions of state authority,'' Russian news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's co-chairman of the conciliatory commission, Valery
Grebennikov, said the list included ''radical objections,''
suggesting compromise may be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Federation Council of seeking to ''complicate the
work of the conciliatory commission, if not block it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member, Duma lawmaker Viktor Pokhmelkin, said
that because the upper house's disagreements were so large, he was
''afraid that in this situation the first meeting of the
conciliatory commission tomorrow will be its last.''
</P>
<P>
   If the compromise fails, the Duma can override the Federation
Council's veto with a two-thirds majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, provincial governors have assumed wide
authority in their regions. Putin, an advocate of strong-handed
federal policy, says tightening control over the regions is
essential to deal with economic problems and keeping Russia from
falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   While the two houses of parliament were locked in conflict, the
Kremlin was toying with the idea of creating a State Council made
up of selected regional leaders, Russian media reported, citing
well-informed Kremlin sources.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authority of this proposed body was unclear, it
appeared to be an attempt at splitting the Federation Council by
appeasing the most powerful governors.

<HEADLINE> Pope Gunman Lashes Out at Vatican  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Less than a month after Italy pardoned
him for shooting Pope John Paul II, gunman Mehmet Ali Agca accused
the Vatican on Monday of being the ''enemy of God and humanity''
and called on the pope to resign immediately from ''devil's
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Agca's outburst came as he stood trial in Istanbul for the armed
robbery of a soda plant, the theft of a car he used to escape the
scene and the robbery of a jewelry store, all in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Italy pardoned Agca and extradited him to Turkey on June 13
after he served almost 20 years for the 1981 shooting, and after
the Vatican had reassured the government that John Paul supported
the act of clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In his last hours in Italy, Agca offered profuse thanks to the
pope, who had personally forgiven and comforted his would-be killer
during a 1983 visit to Agca's prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   But as he was moved out of the Istanbul courtroom Monday, Agca,
white-haired after nearly two decades in jail, shouted: ''The
Vatican is the enemy of God, it is the enemy of humanity!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make the Vatican empire -- the enemy of humanity -- feel
remorse,'' he said. ''I have launched a cultural war against the
Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   Agca also issued a handwritten statement through his lawyer
accusing the Vatican of ''changing'' the secrets of Fatima and of
orchestrating the 1981 assassination attempt against the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh My Dear Brother Pope: RESIGN!, resign right away and return
to Poland,'' Agca wrote. ''You are a good man. You cannot sit at
the top of the devil's center, the Vatican and at the top of
history's dump.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Catholic brothers, I love you, why do you not abandon a
Vatican which arranges the assassination of its own pope?''
</P>
<P>
   The judge refused to let Agca read the statement in court.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesmen were not available for comment. But last
month, the Vatican published the text of the so-called ''third
secret'' of Fatima, what the Virgin Mary is said to have told three
shepherd children in Fatima in 1917. According to the Vatican, it
foretold Agca's attempt on the pope's life.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary laying out the Vatican's interpretation of the
secret, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger contested earlier suggestions by
Agca that he was merely an instrument of God's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Agca has a history of such outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly disrupted proceedings in his 1985 conspiracy trial
for shooting the pope, at times shouting that he was Jesus Christ
and insisting that he was not crazy.
</P>
<P>
   He was an inconsistent witness. He told the judge that some of
his testimony had been lies and often contradicted himself. There
was never any suggestion from the prosecutors or the defense that
he was insane.
</P>
<P>
   Agca, who is serving a 10-year prison term in Turkey for killing
a liberal newspaper editor, rejected accusations Monday that he was
involved in the 1979 robberies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have devoted my life to an ideal and to my country,'' Agca
said. ''I am not in need of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The court adjourned the hearing, the second in the case, until
Aug. 9 to give Agca time to prepare a defense. Agca faces between
15 and 30 more years in prison if convicted on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's sweltering heat, Agca was wearing an
indigo-blue sweater and jeans. His brother, Adnan Agca, said he had
caught a cold in prison, where he is kept in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Agca was brought to court under heavy security. Sharpshooters
stood watch from rooftops, and armored personnel carriers patrolled
the streets for hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Agca is thought to have been close to an ultranationalist group,
the Gray Wolves. He is admired by some right-wing extremists, who
consider him a patriot who fought leftists in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   While in an Italian prison, Agca was convicted in absentia for
editor Abdi Ipekci's death.
</P>
<P>
   Agca had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979 where he was
awaiting trial in the killing. He confessed while in prison to
killing Ipekci, but later retracted his statements.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey welcomed Agca's extradition last month as an opportunity
to shed more light on the assassination.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bets on Colombia Drug Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRES ESQUINAS MILITARY BASE, Colombia (AP) -- Rebels guarding
drug crops will have at least one tough commander breathing down
their necks when a controversial U.S.-backed counter-narcotics
offensive begins.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mario Montoya is eager to get into action with U.S. combat
helicopters and about 3,000 troops trained by U.S. Special Forces
under a new $1.3 billion U.S. aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they have links to the drug trade, we will attack them,''
the general barked into a megaphone to foreign journalists last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts doubt the military will be able to retake the
thick jungles of Colombia's Amazon basin from the armed groups that
run a lucrative protection racket in this South American country's
cocaine trade.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package passed by the U.S. Congress includes 60
Blackhawk and Huey helicopters, trainers, high-tech intelligence
and communications equipment and night-vision gear.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-trained troops will be sent to secure coca-growing
areas, allowing low-flying planes to spray the plants with
herbicides and soldiers to destroy laboratories that turn coca
leaves into cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have vowed to arm coca farmers and say they might
even use surface-to-air missiles to combat the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guerrillas will try everything they can to defend their
business,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Military operations will be run out of Tres Esquinas, a base
perched above a river dividing Caqueta and Putumayo, two southern
states that produce two-thirds of Colombia's total coca crop.
</P>
<P>
   But even with U.S. aid, striking into jungles swarming with at
least 2,000 well-armed rebels of the leftist Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, is a tall order for a military that
has largely been on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of soldiers and police died in attacks during the past
four years by the wealthy, 15,000-strong FARC, which now controls
about a third of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The most humiliating defeat occurred just east of Tres Esquinas
in March 1998, when the FARC ambushed a 150-man counterguerrilla
squad, killing at least 63 soldiers and taking dozens more
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Such debacles convinced Washington that Colombia's military was
in trouble -- although U.S. officials insist the aid package is for
fighting drugs, not the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The defeats exposed failings in military leadership, tactics and
intelligence-gathering that Colombia's generals say they're working
to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned a lot of lessons,'' Montoya said, citing basic
tactics like not camping in the same place too long and the
importance of moving at night and sleeping during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've grown a lot and we've improved technically, physically
and tactically to be able to carry out this mission and to avoid
failures,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Special Forces have already trained one 1,000-man
anti-narcotics battalion, and two are expected to be ready before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Army Maj. Jose Parra, the second-in-command at Tres
Esquinas, said the Green Berets have showed the importance of
practicing skills, like shooting or rappelling from a helicopter,
until they sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our culture,'' Parra said, ''We tend to practice once,
twice, maybe three times and then we think we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The military has fared better of late -- reducing casualties by
pulling back vulnerable units and using its air advantage to strafe
rebel columns from the air. Troops under Montoya's command routed a
FARC unit in Caqueta last week, the military said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Washington's big gamble is a safe bet or a losing
proposition won't become evident until the newly trained and
equipped counter-drug battalions get into action.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the aid may draw the United States into a quagmire,
but proponents believe that, aside from stemming the flow of drugs
into the United States, it may shore up Colombia's beleaguered
democracy and force the rebels to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''In all honesty, everybody here in Washington has got their
fingers crossed,'' said Myles Frechette, a former U.S. Ambassador
to Colombia who supports the aid package.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Leads Tour de France  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOURDES-HAUTACAM, France (AP) -- This was where Lance Armstrong
wanted to be, in the mountains and in striking distance of the lead
in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't waste the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong surged through the Pyrenees and into first place
Monday, grabbing the leader's yellow jersey for the first time in
defense of the title he won last year after coming back from
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service team rider from Austin, Texas, used a
dramatic attack in the final climb to finish second in the day's
stage, a 127-mile trek from Lax that was the first mountain portion
of the race and 10th of 21 stages overall.
</P>
<P>
   In rain and cold, Armstrong -- starting the day in 16th place --
stormed past challengers, turning a deficit of almost six minutes
into a lead of 4:14 over second-place Jan Ullrich, the 1997
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armstrong came through like a plane at the end,'' Frenchman
Richard Virenque said.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Javier Ochoa emerged from the clouds, shrouded in steam,
to hold off Armstrong by 42 seconds. But the 28-year-old Texan, who
said before the Tour began that the race really started with the
mountains on July 10, was the big winner for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was about good tactics,'' Armstrong said. ''It was a
good day for me. I like these conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Ochoa deserved the stage victory, but he was
delighted with his own performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ochoa rode hard and led for so long. Probably 99 percent of
the people there were Spaniards cheering him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the other main contenders were well back, Armstrong
wasn't looking too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''With two weeks to go, the Tour de France is still anybody's
race,'' he said. ''The Tour de France is very tough this year, so I
am not counting on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's powerful late surge took him past 1998 winner Marco
Pantani, 1999 third-place finisher Fernando Escartin and Virenque,
and was reminiscent of his blistering form a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It also made him the overwhelming favorite to retain the title.
Armstrong took the lead last year in the eighth stage, a time
trial, and never let it go as the Tour wound through the mountains
and finished on the Champs-Elysees
</P>
<P>
   One of four riders to break away from the pack in the first half
of the race, Ochoa won the stage in 6:09:32, after starting the day
in 122nd place, 13:01 behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was looking forward to the stage, saying all along
that he can dominate other top riders in the mountains, where the
Tour usually is won and lost as good climbers make up dozens of
minutes in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   While Ochoa looked exhausted at the end, Armstrong was virtually
sprinting in the final miles. But about two-thirds of the way
through the stage, he had problems.
</P>
<P>
   Led by strong climbers Kevin Livingston and Tyler Hamilton, U.S.
Postal led a charge from the pack approaching Col D'Aubisque, 37
miles from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy initially worked, with Armstrong moving away from
his main rivals, but Livingston and Hamilton couldn't keep up the
pace, leaving Armstrong isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead, in the second-place pack, Virenque and Escartin
battled, and the vital moment of the day -- and perhaps the whole
Tour -- came about eight miles from the end.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was more then 10 minutes behind the leader, in a group
with Pantani, Alex Zulle and Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani attacked, followed easily by Armstrong, but Zulle and
Ullrich struggled to keep up. Armstrong suddenly accelerated,
surging past Pantani and going after the group ahead of him, which
included Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong overtook Virenque and clearly had plenty of energy
left, falling short of only Ochoa before the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was waiting for Pantani to attack,'' Armstrong said.
''When he attacked, Zulle and myself responded and the race really
started.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on my own without any teammates. My only choice was to
wait. I was waiting for the attack from Pantani; sure enough, he
did attack, and that is what started the finale.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Elli, who started the day in first place for the
Deutsche Telekom team, was 99th in the stage 31:59 behind, and
dropped to 56th overall, 25:35 behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The race continues Tuesday with a hilly 135-mile stage from
Bagneres-de-Bigorre to Revel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teens Having Sex Less  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- U.S. teen-agers are clearly getting
the message about AIDS, new data show. Compared to a decade ago,
they wait longer to have sex, use condoms and have fewer partners.
</P>
<P>
   The data, released Monday, are part of a generally encouraging
view of the AIDS epidemic in the United States that contrasts with
the gloomy picture from much of the rest of the world, especially
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
some upbeat trends, especially falling HIV infection rates among
U.S. women. But at the same time, officials caution that infection
rates are unacceptably high among blacks in some Northeastern and
Southern cities, and there are worrisome hints that young gay men
may be turning away from condom use.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an increasingly complex picture of HIV/AIDS,'' said
the CDC's Dr. Ronald Valdiserri. ''Balancing our successes is a
need to sustain our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   A letup in teen-age sexual activity was first noticed by the CDC
two years ago. But officials say the latest data, which cover the
entire decade, prove that is a clear trend and not merely a
statistical blip.
</P>
<P>
   Based on five school-based surveys, the CDC found:
</P>
<P>
   --50 percent of teen-agers reported ever having had sex in 1999,
down from 54 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   --16 percent said they'd had four or more partners, down from 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   --8 percent had sex before age 13, down from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --58 percent said they used a condom the last time they had sex,
up from 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means fewer U.S. high school students are engaging in
sexual activity that puts them at risk for HIV infection,'' said
the CDC's Dr. Laura Kann.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers attributed the change to the widely repeated
dual message of sexual abstinence and condom use.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the CDC estimates that 40,000 new HIV infections occur
in the United States each year, and this rate has stayed constant
through the '90s. At the epidemic's height in the 1980's, there
were 100,000 new infections annually.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the last decade, health officials worried about a
possible epidemic of heterosexually spread AIDS among U.S. women,
but the latest data show this did not happen. Figures from 25
states show that the number of HIV infections in women actually
declined by 9 percent from 1994 to 1998. But officials caution that
even though infections dropped steeply among older women, they
actually doubled among those in their early 20s. Nevertheless, the
number of reported new infections in young women is small, just 498
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of all new U.S. HIV infections are in blacks,
while 15 percent are in Hispanics. The CDC surveyed cities with
large black and Hispanic populations and found a wide range of
infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   Among blacks, the highest infection rate is in Jersey City,
N.J., where 2&AMP;frac12; percent have the virus. This rate is 13 times higher
than in Flint, Mich., the city with the lowest. Among Hispanics,
infections are highest in Newark, N.J., and lowest in Albuquerque,
N.M. The data do not include HIV rates in New York and Florida,
which are not available.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study is especially important because it shows that each
community faces unique prevention needs, but in many areas,
primarily in the Northeast and the South, communities of color are
dramatically affected,'' said Dr. Robert Janssen of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Dr. Helene Gayle, the CDC's AIDS chief, said gonorrhea
rates are increasing in several cities among HIV-infected gay men,
a sign of a possible return to the risky sexual behavior that
caused explosive spread of the virus among homosexuals in the
1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the CDC estimates that between 2 percent and 4 percent
of the U.S. adult population -- 4 million to 5 million people --
still put themselves at high risk. This includes having six or more
sexual partners annually, having sex with an HIV-infected person,
prostitution, having male homosexual contact, using crack cocaine
or injecting drugs.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Tense in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAIRTUP, Russia (AP) -- Russian soldiers suspiciously eyed
Chechen boys on the outskirts of this village Monday, fearing the
worst -- that the boys were spies for rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian servicemen said the boys, who can be seen near any
village in the southern breakaway republic, count passing vehicles
and can alert Chechen militants once there is a large concentration
of federal troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and tension are everywhere in Mairtup, 20 miles southeast
of the Chechen capital Grozny. The village school, which serves as
the federal army headquarters, is sealed off with barbed wire and
concrete plates, and parts of it are heavily mined to block rebel
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The stench of a makeshift toilet permeates the rooms, where
bullets and spent cartridges litter the floor. The soldiers here
say they can't wait until they are replaced in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to be in constant tension. At any moment, fighting
might start here. And if the militants come, one third of the
village will take up arms,'' said a 20-year-old sergeant, Andrei
Tikhomirov.
</P>
<P>
   He glanced at Chechen men talking quietly in small groups,
passing women carrying buckets and bags, the elderly men sitting on
benches in front of their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rebel attacks in Chechnya have heightened tension among
federal troops and sent Moscow scrambling to assert its control
over the area.
</P>
<P>
   Russian army columns, accompanied by helicopter gunships and
jets buzzing overhead, were on the move across Chechnya on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft pummeled suspected rebel positions in the Itum-Kale and
Vedeno regions of southern Chechnya, and heavy artillery bombarded
the thick forests of the southeastern Nozhai-Yurt district, near
the border with Dagestan, said a Chechen government official in the
northern town of Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops clashed with rebels near the Dagestani border,
killing five militants, the military said. No Russian casualties
were reported, but both sides tend to underplay their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces also stepped up security on the ground,
reinforcing police stations and checkpoints in the wake of the July
2 series of truck bombings that killed at least 33 Russian
servicemen and wounded scores more.
</P>
<P>
   At checkpoints along Chechnya's roads, Russian troops
scrutinized pedestrians traveling from village to village. Most of
the civilians on the roads were women, as many Chechen men stay in
their villages, fearing run-ins with Russian troops suspecting them
of having rebel ties.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops nominally control most of Chechnya after having
rolled into the region in September, and are chasing rebel bands
hiding in the southern mountains. But they remain vulnerable to
sniping, bombings and hit-and-run attacks in lowland areas they
captured months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The artillery is crushing them during the night. But what's
the use, they hate us and we hate them,'' said Sgt. Dmitry Kizilov,
a serviceman stationed in Mairtup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The psychology of these children must be changed,'' he said,
pointing at the boys. ''Their heroes are (warlord) Shamil Basayev
and (Chechen President Aslan) Maskhadov. And they hate us because
they were told we're the enemy.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Ewizman Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman handed in his
resignation Monday, effectively ending a seven-year term that
turned sour when he was found to have acted improperly by accepting
gifts while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the day marked ''the end of an era'' Weizman's top aide,
Aryeh Shumer, delivered the resignation letter to Avraham Burg,
speaker of Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the resignation takes effect 48 hours later. There
will be no Israeli president until July 31, when lawmakers will
vote by secret ballot between former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
and legislator Moshe Katsav of the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have accomplished a lot, and I am leaving feeling good and
satisfied,'' Weizman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's resignation came after the attorney general ruled that
Weizman had acted improperly. However, the 76-year-old president
had said previously that he would resign sometime this year, citing
ill health and the implications of a police investigation into more
than $300,000 in gifts he accepted from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman became embroiled in controversy after a journalist
alleged he had received $453,000 from Edouard Sarousi, a French
textiles magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Police concluded that Weizman's failure to report the money
constituted fraud and breach of public trust, but that the statute
of limitations on those charges had run out.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman has admitted receiving $350,000 but insisted the money
was a private gift and never affected any of his decision-making
while president.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the Oslo
Accords which launched the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, is
considered the front-runner in the race. However, the current
political turmoil stemming from the collapse of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition on Sunday could affect the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party that dealt a serious blow to
Barak by pulling out on Sunday, is also seen to be playing a strong
role in determining the results of the presidential race, with its
17 votes.
</P>
<P>
   He received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for trying to end the
decades-long conflict. Although he is revered abroad as a
statesman, he has drawn criticism from the more hawkish elements at
home as being too conciliatory to Israel's Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Secretary West Is Leaving  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West Jr.,
whose two-year tenure was marred by accusations of mismanagement,
is stepping down with less than seven months left in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under his leadership, the VA has begun to confront some
long-neglected problems head-on, reaching out to more than 400,000
veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, pressing for answers to
the Gulf War syndrome and proper care for those who suffer from
it,'' President Clinton said Monday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   West, a former Army secretary and lobbyist who plans to return
to the private sector, will be succeeded by his deputy, Hershel
Gober of Monticello, Ark., a veteran of both the Army and the
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hershel has already made his mark on the critical issue of
veterans' health care,'' Clinton said, referring to the more than
400 outpatient clinics the VA has opened during the administration
to help serve more than 3 million veterans and their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Clinton picked Gober to be secretary of veterans
affairs, but Gober withdrew his nomination after lawmakers went
public with allegations of sexual misconduct involving Gober. He
was accused in 1995 of making an inappropriate sexual advance
toward a woman during a 1993 celebration of the Marine Corps. Gober
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   West was sworn in as veterans secretary in 1998, but his tenure
as head of the federal government's second largest department also
has been problematic.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the department's inspector general reported that the
agency's congressional affairs office was in disarray, saying it
responded so late to congressional inquiries that some documents
were backdated to ''hide ... processing delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators previously reported that the
department used $61 million in travel funds for salaries and
equipment and allowed some top administrators to approve their own
expenses. Another inspector general report said West violated
government regulations and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars by
using military aircraft in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Autry, a spokesman for the Disabled American Veterans,
which has accused West of not pushing the administration to spend
more on veterans, said he was troubled by the timing of West's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate conferees are just preparing to finalize
funding for the agency, including more than $20 billion in
discretionary funds for veterans' health care. Without strong
leadership at the agency, Congress could reduce these health care
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The funding levels are anything but set in stone,'' Autry
said.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Russian Executive Killed  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXEI VLADYKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) -- Two gunmen killed the general
director of Uralmashzavod, one of Russia's biggest machine-tool
manufacturers, in a brazen daylight attack Monday in this Ural
Mountains city.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Oleg Belonenko was one of the most high-profile
homicides in the Russian business community, and came as Moscow is
trying to show a strong hand in dealing with crime and corruption
while trying to woo investors into its aging industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone should feel the danger,'' Kakha Bendukidze, chief
executive officer of the Uralmash-Izhora Group, told reporters in
Moscow. Uralmashzavod is a subsidiary of his group.
</P>
<P>
   Belonenko was shot outside the company dormitory where he had
been living, as he was getting into his company car to go to work.
He died in surgery, said Tatyana Stepanova, a spokeswoman for
police in Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Belonenko's driver was wounded in the chest, and he, too, died
in the hospital, Stepanova said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, eyewitnesses saw two men in track suits with
hoods running away, NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police could not immediately cite a motive for the killing, but
they were questioning Uralmashzavod employees about whether
Belonenko had received threats and any recent business discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what this killing could be connected with,'' said
Yevgeny Porunov, chairman of the regional parliament. ''Oleg
Belonenko was a manager, not a stockholder, so it's difficult to
speak about a (dispute over) redistribution of property.''
</P>
<P>
   Bendukidze said he believed the killing was a contract murder,
but professed surprise that Belonenko or Uralmashzavod were
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this type of thing took place only where there was
an evident conflict'' or criminal activity, he said. He said there
was neither at Uralmashzavod.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the huge plant has been a target of
organized crime groups intent on winning control over Russian
industry. One of the biggest mob groups in Russia even co-opted the
name.
</P>
<P>
   Belonenko's predecessor as general director, Viktor Korovin,
reportedly was unable to parry criminals' efforts to infiltrate the
plants. Under his watch, more than 100 commercial firms were
created on the plant's premises to sell spare parts, but the
profits did not return to the holding -- and some of them were
controlled by criminal groups, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Belonenko, 52, was named general director of Uralmashzavod in
December, after serving two years as deputy director. Before
joining the Urals giant, he served as a vice president of the huge
Kamaz truck plant.
</P>
<P>
   Belonenko launched a campaign to improve labor discipline at the
plant, including allowing workers to smoke only in designated
areas.
</P>
<P>
   He also took on the Uralmashzavod mob, filing lawsuits against
the commercial firms and demanding that they stop using the name or
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The plant flourished under Belonenko, winning profitable
contracts to provide metallurgical equipment to Russian
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   It was additionally buoyed by high world oil prices and the weak
ruble, which have helped revive Russian industry by making imports
less competitive. Bendukidze said that the company's order book had
swelled by 70 percent this year over last.
</P>
<P>
   According to company data, the plant's productivity rose 58
percent this year, and the average wage rose 89 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Mideast Peace Deal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About to kick off a last-ditch summit,
President Clinton said Monday there is no more difficult conflict
in the world than the dispute he will try to settle between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to not
be distracted by his political woes at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really, I think, a matter of trying to come to grips
with the issues on the merits,'' Clinton said in an exchange with
reporters before flying to Pennsylvania for a governors'
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Barak barely survived a no-confidence motion in the 120-member
Israeli parliament Monday. The opposition, anxious about his
projected concessions to Yasser Arafat on territory and Jerusalem,
outpolled the government, 54-52, but it could not muster the 61
votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, possibly referring to a recent poll, said a solid
majority of Israelis ''want him to come and want him to pursue
peace.'' In the same vein, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said the prime minister can make peace despite the defection of
three political parties from his government
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not going to make an agreement that jeopardizes his
people,'' Albright said in an Associated Press interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll published Sunday by the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, 52
percent of Israelis said Barak should go to the summit while 45
percent said he should stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, will be remaining in
Israel. Levy has served in both Likud and Labor governments, and is
considered a barometer of Israeli public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in a statement before his departure for the summit, told
the Israeli people that ''this is the time to take decisions and to
bequest a better future to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the negotiations would be ''heart-rending'' and that
''no deal is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality of life is highly complicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, nearing the end of an eight-year presidency in which he
has dealt with conflict in the Balkans, Ireland and the Persian
Gulf, said the Israeli-Palestinian dispute ''is perhaps the most
difficult of all the peace problems in the world, certainly dealing
with the most difficult issues of the whole Middle East peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Barak and Arafat both ''have the vision, the
knowledge, the experience and the ability and sheer guts to do what
it takes, I think, to reach an agreement, and then to take it back
to their people and see if they can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ''I am going to try to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement designed to bolster Barak's already considerable
confidence and resolve, Clinton said the prime minister was able to
negotiate with the knowledge the Israeli public would have the
final say in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the President said he hoped an overall settlement
could be reached within a few days. He is due to fly to Japan for
an economic conference with the leaders of seven other countries on
July 19.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton said the two sides already ''have a pretty
clear idea of what the various options are'' and 'it's not as if we
don't know what's out there to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he did not want to set ''an artificial deadline for
these talks,''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts doubt an agreement can be forged quickly,
particularly one that deals with the emotional issue of Jerusalem.
''My guess is you can't achieve an agreement in eight days,''
Samuel Lewis, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is going to have to be a tougher talker with Arafat
than he has been with other leaders,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Singer, a lawyer who helped draft the 1993 Oslo accords
that started Israel on the course of pulling back on the West Bank,
said Barak ''clearly does not have a majority in the Israeli
Knesset'' and if he had to get approval for the package he is
likely to propose to Arafat ''he would fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Shibley Telhami, a University of Maryland professor, said Arafat
''comes as a weak leader.'' Polls among Palestinians show declining
confidence in him, Telhami said. ''People doubt his ability to
deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has signaled a willingness to surrender most of the West
Bank, accept a Palestinian state cut a deal over Jerusalem that
would give the PLO a toehold in the city.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Telhami said the Palestinians have made no
concessions on any of the core issues. And yet, he said, ''the
perception in the Arab world is that Arafat is giving away the
store.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, meanwhile, Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman
for the Palestinians, challenged the idea that both sides ''have to
give.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that would mean the Palestinians must violate
international law and their right to the land occupied by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross issues 'blood emergency' in Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Blood supplies remained tight in Connecticut on
Monday, the
first full day after the American Red Cross said its inventories
had reached dangerously low levels, but hospitals reported no
immediate problems.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecticut on Sunday became one of 31 Red Cross regions across
the nation that have declared blood emergencies. Thirty-six regions
make up the national Red Cross system, accounting for about half of
the nation's blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Managers at hospitals in Hartford, New Haven and elsewhere said
they were keeping a close eye on supplies, but said no surgeries
had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently, we are being very cautious with the blood we use,''
said Dr. Edward Snyder, director of the blood bank at Yale-New
Haven Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital is particularly low on negative blood types, Snyder
said. In an emergency, Yale-New Haven would use positive blood
types. Still, he said, the Red Cross keeps an emergency supply
which would likely be tapped in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert Silver of Hartford Hospital said while there is no
current problem, a major trauma could change that situation
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   One hospital that has maintained its full inventory - 50 units
each of types O and A and 15 units of other types - was William W.
Backus Hospital in Norwich. The region around the hospital is
bracing for tens of thousands of visitors this week attending a
''tall ships'' festival in New London.
</P>
<P>
   The last blood emergency in Connecticut was declared more than a
year ago, Red Cross spokeswoman Lynn Townshend said.
</P>
<P>
   The blood supply in Connecticut was depleted by a monthlong
strike of Red Cross blood collection workers that ended on June 3.
The Red Cross warned last month that a shortage of blood was
reaching a crisis point in Connecticut, forcing the agency to
restrict the amount of blood distributed to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to donate blood can reach the Red Cross at 1
(800)-GIVE-LIFE.

<HEADLINE> HMO dropouts worry seniors, lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - Sebastian Boscarino, 78, suffers from
diabetes, has had two heart attacks and takes nine prescription
drugs a day.
</P>
<P>
   So he was not happy to hear that his Medicare health maintenance
organization, Anthem Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield, plans to quit the
Connecticut market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of boxed in,'' Boscarino said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week 20 private health insurance companies announced that,
beginning next year, they will pull out of more than 440 counties
around the country where they now provide ''Medicare Plus Choice''
plans to about 875,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, three HMOs that currently offer Medicare Plus
programs are withdrawing: Anthem Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield, Aetna
U.S. Healthcare and Cigna Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth HMO, Physicians Health Services, is pulling out of
Litchfield and Middlesex counties.
</P>
<P>
   Boscarino said he considers himself lucky because the company he
retired from, Accurate Forging of Bristol, agreed to pay for his
health insurance as part of his retirement package.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to ask my company to find me another HMO or give me
the money to pay for supplemental health insurance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boscarino was one of about 200 senior citizens who packed the
Milford Senior Center on Monday to discuss the recent withdrawals
by several Medicare HMOs in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who organized meetings in
Milford and Hamden, urged seniors not to panic, noting that the
pullouts will not become effective until Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got some time here to make the right decisions for
yourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are four other HMOs that will continue to offer Medicare
Plus programs in all or part of Connecticut. The number of choices
remaining varies from county to county.
</P>
<P>
   Many senior citizens enroll in Medicare Plus to get prescription
drug coverage and other benefits they can't get with the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. They pay an
additional premium and must stay within the HMO network of
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the seniors who attended the meeting in Milford said
they will shop around for another HMO or revert to traditional
Medicare, but then be forced to buy a supplemental policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Benoit, 69, also covered by Anthem Blue Cross &AMP; Blue
Shield, said he's concerned supplemental insurance will be too
costly for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having a tough time now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the American Association of Health Plans
found that 14 of 18 companies leaving the program cited inadequate
federal reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Connecticut Democrats - U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson and
U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd - held a similar meeting Monday in
Middletown.

<HEADLINE> Service Weathers Forecast Storm  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the National Weather Service, the
forecast for the New York Mets' home opener: scattered showers over
Shea Stadium, with heavier rainfall expected to hold off until
after the game. ''THIS FORECAST WILL BE UPDATED LATER THIS MORNING.
GO METS!'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   The April 3 announcement seemed innocent enough but it angered
commercial forecasting companies, a $250 million to $300 million a
year business. They saw it as unwelcome competition -- an attempt by
the weather service to provide for free the information they sell.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service acknowledged the ''site specific'' forecast
violated its policy and says it took action. But now Congress has
gotten involved.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a spending measure that includes language
making it illegal for the weather service to provide information
and services handled by commercial companies. Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan., may add it to the Senate version of the bill, which is
stalled in the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we were hearing from a number of people is that they're
getting a lot of direct competition from the weather service,''
said Brownback, who serves on the Commerce panel.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service, created in 1870, is the official voice for
severe weather watches and warnings. It also provides, for free,
weather and climate forecasts to government agencies, private
companies and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Private forecasting companies, which emerged in the 1960s and
'70s, package the free weather service data and sell it to
newspapers, television and radio stations, agriculture and
transportation companies, sports teams and other customers.
</P>
<P>
   Creating forecasts for special events or venues is not part of
the weather service's mission, said Ed Johnson, the agency's acting
director of strategic planning and policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a major, major wholesaler of weather information that
drives the whole weather information business,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service and other foes of the legislation say it
could force citizens and local governments to pay private companies
for information they now get for free.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Sierra, president of the National Weather Service
Employees Organization, said private companies have already started
to provide information that used to be disseminated by the weather
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the reason we were forced out of providing service to
the agricultural community,'' said Sierra, who works at the weather
service office in Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed competition clause says the weather service ''shall
not provide, or assist other entities to provide, a service if that
service is currently provided or can be provided by commercial
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Commercial enterprise'' means businesses such as Wichita,
Kan.-based WeatherData Inc., which puts out a weather page used by
some newspapers as well as site-specific forecasts WeatherData does
for railroad and airline companies.
</P>
<P>
   Company President Mike Smith is lobbying for the legislation, as
are State College, Pa.-based AccuWeather and other commercial
forecasters. Smith argues the agency should stay out of the
specific business-to-business element of weather forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other government agencies don't do that,'' he said, ''and
neither should the weather service.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was moved to action because he says the weather service
offered a high-resolution radar service to a Norman, Okla.,
company, but not his. Whenever possible, the agency is supposed to
share such technology with any company or agency that wants it.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service says not every site -- including its own
field offices -- is equipped to handle the service. In this case,
Johnson said, radar was provided to the University of Oklahoma and
not the company, although the university was involved in setting up
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Since debate began on Capitol Hill, the weather service has
offered the radar service to Smith's company.

<HEADLINE> Kids in Demand for Drug Studies  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's the dirty little secret of pediatrics:
Unknown to most parents, the majority of drugs prescribed for
children have never been tested in youngsters to determine how well
they work or even the best dose.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians often must guess how to use medications originally
developed for adults -- from allergy relievers and antibiotics to
painkillers -- in their tiniest patients.
</P>
<P>
   That's finally changing: Clinical trials of medications in
children are suddenly booming, and the Food and Drug Administration
expects more than 18,000 youngsters to participate in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   But how do families pick a safe study? After all, the government
recently shut down several adult clinical trials for breaking vital
patient-safety rules, including one study that killed an
18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Children's studies also broach new ethical questions. Already,
researchers are offering enticements like gift certificates to Toys
'R Us to reward kids for getting poked and prodded, and about
one-fourth pay families. Typical payments are $200 to $400, but
parents have been offered $1,000 to sign up their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Although ''we are very excited'' that crucial research is
finally under way, ''there are special issues involved in pediatric
trials,'' stressed FDA pediatrics chief Dr. Dianne Murphy, who is
leading efforts to ensure children are studied properly.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have had no incentive to study children because
doctors legally can prescribe adult products to youngsters. That
changed two years ago when Congress granted manufacturers an extra
six months of patent protection if they voluntarily test products
pediatricians prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this December, an FDA rule will mandate that any new adult
drug that could be used in children with the same disease must
undergo pediatric study.
</P>
<P>
   Some 180 pediatric drug trials have begun or are being planned,
and the FDA has requested another 129 even before the December rule
kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are not just small adults,'' explained Gregory Kearns,
pediatric pharmacology chief at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas
City, Mo., one of the few places that specializes in testing
children's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bodies handle drugs differently at different ages. A
tragic example: In the 1960s, several newborns died because doctors
didn't know their immature livers couldn't process the adult
antibiotic chloramphenicol. In contrast, some of today's
antibiotics require a 50 percent higher dose for a 1-year-old than
for a teen, because the toddler's body eliminates those drugs
faster, Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   Studies aren't just for sick kids. Say your child is prone to
hay fever but is not sniffling today. She'd be a candidate to
swallow one dose of an adult antihistamine and have blood samples
drawn to check metabolism, thus confirming the right dose. These
dosing studies require spending up to a day in a clinic, giving
blood and a small side-effect risk, in hopes doctors can improve
treatment of future patients.
</P>
<P>
   Longer studies are usually for sick kids, and sometimes involve
a placebo. Take the inhaled antibiotic Tobi, approved to treat a
lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients at least 6 years old.
Taking Tobi before age 6 might ward off the infection instead of
just treating it, but it also might be dangerous. Comparing Tobi
with a dummy pill in babies and preschoolers is the only way to
know, but some parents find that a tough choice, says Dr. Pamela
Zeitlin of Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   How should parents weigh studies?
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure you fully understand a study. Kearns spends up to an
hour discussing a study before ever handing parents a consent form,
which should explain risks in laymen's terms.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask who's running the study. University-based research,
particularly at pediatric specialty centers, may get more careful
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   --Look for pediatric expertise. If your child will test a stomach
drug, look for a pediatric gastroenterologist. Adult doctors can
miss children's subtle signals of side effects, like not playing or
eating less.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask not only about drug side effects but about study
procedures. How will doctors minimize blood tests and pain?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Janine Berardi. The Canton, Mass.,
woman pored over a 17-page consent form before letting 6-year-old
Nichole test an adult immune-system drug called Avonex for her
juvenile arthritis. Still she was surprised when Nichole screamed
at the weekly injections -- until the doctor suggested simply
rubbing an anesthetic cream onto her skin before the shots. Now
Nichole's swollen joints are much better, and the shots quieter.

<HEADLINE> Five indicted in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The judge hearing the case of the young men
accused of attacking women in Central Park last month said Monday
that he expects the defendants to go to trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thompson, spokeswoman for the Manhattan district
attorney's office, said 26 men have been indicted on felony charges
in the June 11 incidents; one is charged with misdemeanors. The
number could change as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Most are charged with sex abuse and riot for allegedly dousing
women with water, chasing them, stripping some and fondling others.
Nearly 60 women complained they were molested.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried scheduled dates for
pretrial conference and motions after some lawyers said they wanted
time to review amateur videotapes that captured the activities of
some of their clients. The also wanted a chance to talk to
prosecutors about possible plea deals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fried released defendant Isaiah Forbes, 18, who is
charged with sex abuse and riot, after Assistant District Attorney
Leemie Kahng told the judge that her office was consenting to his
release without bail pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants in this case have been released with the
consent of prosecutors when preliminary investigations have failed
to show definitely that the defendants were involved in the attacks
on the women.
</P>
<P>
   Fried set a trial date of Sept. 11 for all defendants who have
been indicted. He scheduled the arraignments for July 24 and July
31.
</P>
<P>
   Kahng told Fried that the felony defendants have been indicted
but those indictments had not been filed with the court. This meant
that the defendants could not be arraigned until later this month.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust film director Laurel Vlock dies at 74  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOODBRIDGE, Conn. (AP) - Laurel Vlock, a producer and director
whose films about Holocaust survivors served as models for Steven
Spielberg's Shoah Foundation, has died. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Vlock died Saturday from injuries sustained in a car accident
Friday. A private funeral service was held Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 she founded the Holocaust Survivors Film Project Inc.,
which videotaped testimony from Holocaust survivors. The films are
deposited at the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies
at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Vlock won an Emmy Award in 1981 for ''Forever Yesterday,'' a
documentary about Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Michael Vlock, said his mother feared the lessons of
the Holocaust would be lost if survivors' stories were not
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had to dig - and dig deep - to find people and convince
them to open up and speak about experiences they didn't want to
open up about,'' Michael Vlock said.
</P>
<P>
   Vlock had hosted the television program ''Dialogue with Laurel
Vlock'' since 1966. Her other television credits include ''Meet the
President'' in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   She received her bachelor's degree from Cornell University and
her master's degree at Queens College. She was born in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Vlock is survived by her 102-year-old mother, Rose Fox; her
husband, Jay Vlock; three children; and nine grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Woman accused of bilking grandfather, others  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A 27-year old woman was arrested for
duping 26 people, including her grandfather, into giving her over
$1 million, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In a scheme that began six years ago, Tina Marie Hannan
allegedly told her grandfather, who raised her, and people he knew
that she worked for a prominent Poughkeepsie insurance company.
Saying that the Internal Revenue Service was closing the company
for bookkeeping errors that were not legitimate, she convinced him
that she was suing the IRS in a multi-million dollar lawsuit,
according to state police Investigator John Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan told contributers that she needed money lawyers, interest
penalties and fees. Ryan said she promised victims ''an inordinate
payoff'' for their efforts and money.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan was charged with two counts of second-degree grand
larceny. The investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Police said her grandfather unwittingly persuaded his friends to
contribute large sums of cash to Hannan. Police said he lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars and has since moved to a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Working on a tip, police apprehended Hannan on Sunday as she
came to her grandfather's trailer to pick up $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dover Plains is 75 miles north of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Relatively few reap benefits of programs to lower power costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Sam Teresi's lights burn just as brightly
as Tony Caprino's. But Teresi's electric bill is a fraction of his
Village of Lakewood neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Jamestown, where Teresi lives, is one of 46 small
cities, towns and villages in New York to qualify for Niagara Power
Project electricity, the cheapest in the nation, and run their own
electric systems. Federal law guarantees 40 percent of Niagara
power to the state's municipal utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood and the rest of the state have to contend with rates 62
percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Caprino, mayor of Lakewood for the past 20 years, pays Niagara
Mohawk 12 cents a kilowatt hour, while Teresi, in his first year as
mayor of his Chautauqua County city, pays four cents.
</P>
<P>
   Caprino would like Lakewood to start its own municipal utility,
but is finding out it is an expensive prospect. The state's Public
Service Commission ruled in 1998 that communities wanting to leave
a private utility had to pay an exit fee based on the utility's
past investments in the area. That is in addition to paying for the
electric lines a municipal utility would take over.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, Niagara Mohawk estimates the exit fee alone at $900
million.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Alfred Coppola, who pushed for a city municipal power
system while a member of the Buffalo Common Council, calls that
figure inflated. His experts put the exit fee at $295 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''They blame everyone but themselves,'' he told The Buffalo
News, citing Niagara Mohawk's costly forays into troubled nuclear
power. ''The exit fee is basically to cover their poor management
over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk says it's only fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the regulatory contracts we operate under are attempting
to prevent is unfair cost shifting,'' spokesman Stephen Brady told
the newspaper. ''If Community X decides to leave our network, we
have incurred costs to serve these customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the state allows communities to leave without paying those
costs,'' he said, ''those costs are going to be passed on to the
existing customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood is haggling with Niagara Mohawk over its final bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''They started out at $39 million,'' Caprino said. ''We're down
to $14.5 million, and we're still working on it. I think it's
looking pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The village has hired Washington, D.C., attorney Cathy Fogel,
who helped Massena start the state's last municipal utility nine
years ago. That northern New York city has cut power rates from 13
cents to four cents a kilowatt hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Fogel said new municipal power systems should not expect
such immediate benefits because most of the power is allocated
through long-term Niagara contracts with existing municipal
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown, a busy furniture- and metal-manufacturing city in the
early part of the 20th Century, got into the electricity business
when it bought out a private electric company in the 1920s under
the leadership of Mayor Samuel Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was his Swedish stubbornness and his belief in municipal
ownership of every kind that did it,'' said historian Helen
Ebersole. Jamestown stopped buying private electricity and
generated its own power at the Samuel A. Carlson Plant but never
bought much hydroelectric power until the administration of former
Mayor Stan Lundine, who later became a congressman and lieutenant
governor under Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was kind of a silly pride in generating our own power,''
Lundine said. ''I remember asking, how much did it cost to generate
power? It was about 4.5 mils (cents per kilowatt). And about how
much to buy Niagara power? It was about 1 mil.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Well, let's see how much we can buy.' I mean, you
have to take advantage of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown today gets Niagara's third-largest allocation - 72
megawatts - behind fellow municipal utilities Plattsburgh and
Fairport. The Carlson Plant is capable of producing an additional
53 megawatts of power but usually generates only one-third of what
the city needs. It is a selling point for Jamestown to keep
manufacturers, such as Monofrax, a power-intensive company that
makes glass bricks for kilns.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were to lose this allocation, I'm concerned many of the
larger companies would say, 'If the rates are going up, we're going
to have to go where it's more economical,''' said Michael Darroch,
deputy general manager of Jamestown's Board of Public Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides delivering bargain-rate electricity, the city's public
utilities last year contributed $2.16 million to the city and
school treasuries in lieu of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Niagara Mohawk and New York State Electric &AMP; Gas are out to
make a profit,'' Darroch said. ''Our object is to keep our utility
rates low. Our profit is returned to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2.4 million-kilowatt Niagara Power Project is up for its
first relicensing in half a century in 2007. C.D. ''Rapp''
Rappleyea, as chairman and chief executive of the New York Power
Authority, will oversee negotiations for the project's new license
but refused to speculate on who will get what when negotiations are
over. He said the power authority won't start the process until
2002.

<HEADLINE> Judge sets trial date in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The judge hearing the case of the young men
accused of attacking women in Central Park last month said Monday
that he expects the defendants to go to trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thompson, spokeswoman for the Manhattan district
attorney's office, said 26 men have been indicted on felony charges
in the June 11 incidents; one is charged with misdemeanors. The
number could change as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Most are charged with sex abuse and riot for allegedly dousing
women with water, chasing them, stripping some and fondling others.
Nearly 60 women complained they were molested.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried scheduled dates for
pretrial conference and motions after some lawyers said they wanted
time to review amateur videotapes that captured the activities of
some of their clients. The also wanted a chance to talk to
prosecutors about possible plea deals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fried released defendant Isaiah Forbes, 18, who is
charged with sex abuse and riot, after Assistant District Attorney
Leemie Kahng told the judge that her office was consenting to his
release without bail pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants in this case have been released with the
consent of prosecutors when preliminary investigations have failed
to show definitely that the defendants were involved in the attacks
on the women.
</P>
<P>
   Fried set a trial date of Sept. 11 for all defendants who have
been indicted. He scheduled the arraignments for July 24 and July
31.
</P>

that the defendants could not be arraigned until later this month.

<HEADLINE> Barak Leaves for Camp David Summit  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- His plane fueled and waiting, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak narrowly survived a no-confidence vote Monday and rushed
off to a high-stakes summit at Camp David, badly weakened but still
convinced the Israeli people trust him to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government did not fall and I am continuing onward to Camp
David,'' a grim Barak said, minutes after the opposition Likud
party failed to muster the necessary 61 votes in parliament to
topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a satisfying victory; the no-confidence motion
gathered 54 votes to 52 for Barak. Seven legislators abstained, and
seven were absent. A second planned no-confidence motion was
postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped a dizzying two days during which Barak's
coalition partners first deserted him, then punished him further
with the no-confidence vote. Throughout, they expressed fear that
he would make far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians without
a mandate, and anger that they had been left out of the loop on key
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, tried again and again to appeal directly to
the people that elected him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear the genuine voice of the Israeli citizens who support
me,'' he said before boarding his plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has come time to put an end to the conflict. This is the
time to make decisions and to leave our children a better future, a
different reality than our generation and our parent's generation
has known.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the most decorated soldier in Israel's history, evoked
his military past to display his devotion to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a simple soldier, as a commander and an army chief, I am
connected to the geography of Israel,'' he said. But, he added:
''There is no peace with no price, just as there is no peace at any
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the Knesset, Barak was repeatedly heckled when he
asserted that he was ''not going alone'' to the Camp David summit
because he had a mandate from the people. At one point he appeared
so rattled by the din -- raucous even by Knesset standards -- that he
asked quietly: ''Can I even speak here?''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the vote, Israeli commentators struggled to find
adequate words to describe just how ''alone'' Barak is as he heads
to the crucial summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak leaves today for Washington like an astronaut who has
lost contact with the mother ship,'' wrote Shalom Yerushalmi in the
Maariv newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in Yediot Ahronot that ''Barak
wants to climb Mount Everest without a rope, without a ladder and
without a sweater.''
</P>
<P>
   But many also praised what they called Barak's courage in
forging ahead single-mindedly towards peace, and they called on
those Israelis who normally refrain from public demonstrations to
openly voice their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is not Barak's emotional greatness, but the
willingness of a dovish public to support him, and not only be
keeping their fingers crossed and whispering in the streets,''
wrote author Amoz Oz.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Monday, Barak was clearly trying to present
himself as one in a long line of Israeli leaders who have had to
counter fierce opposition before they achieved momentous feats.
</P>
<P>
   In his Knesset speech, he evoked David Ben-Gurion when he
established the state of Israel, Menachem Begin when he made peace
with Egypt, Yitzhak Rabin when he talked peace with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated pledges he has made before: that he would not
agree to Israel's withdrawing to pre-1967 borders, that a united
Jerusalem would remain under Israeli sovereignty and that Israel
would ''not take moral or legal responsibility'' for the problem of
the Palestinian refugees who wish to return home.
</P>
<P>
   But former defense minister Ariel Sharon, the head of Likud,
said essentially that he didn't trust Barak with the nation's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister who wanted to be prime minister of
everybody within a year has become a prime minister of almost no
one,'' Sharon argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my dismay, you are conducting a dangerous process,'' he
added. ''A prime minister who can't make peace in his nation, let
alone his own government, can't make peace with the Arabs.'' He
called for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow, Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, stayed
home. He said Sunday he was boycotting the summit because he hadn't
seen any flexibility from the Palestinians. Many thought, though,
that Levy was upset about being left out of the inner circle making
decisions about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Levy voted against the no-confidence motion, however.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was said to be heartened Monday by a poll published in the
Yediot Ahronot newspaper, in which 55 percent of respondents
thought Barak should go to the summit despite the political
developments, and 45 percent thought he shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether, considering the developments, Barak still
had a mandate to make concessions to the Palestinians, the results
were similar: 53 percent said yes, and 44 percent said no. The poll
was conducted among 502 Israelis, with a margin of error of 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although many said the prime minister could be fatally weakened
at the summit by his political problems, others saw differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm slightly more optimistic about the summit than I was two
days ago,'' said Uri Savir, a legislator who negotiated the 1993
Oslo interim accords.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the pressure is really on. We have less time. The
Palestinians should know it could be now or never.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Judges Tosses Out Fraternity Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge has ruled that Hamilton
College did not violate antitrust laws by requiring students to
live on campus and not in fraternity houses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue found that ''there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact'' in the 1995 antitrust case
and ordered that it be dismissed in its entirety in a decision
rendered June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities sued the college under the Sherman Antitrust
Act, arguing that the residential life plan adopted by the school
in 1995 had made the college a ''monopolist'' in providing services
to students.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, all students were required to live in
campus-provided housing and purchase a five-meals-a-week dining
plan. College officials said the rule was necessary to integrate
academic and social life and to cut down on the use of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Mordue sided with Hamilton's lawyers, who had argued that
because the college is only one of many competing institutions, it
cannot monopolize any collegiate market by itself. The judge added
that the fraternity's antitrust claims were no longer at issue
because current students are made aware of Hamilton's residential
policies before enrolling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think Judge Mordue was clearly right when he ruled that
Hamilton College competes with a number of other colleges to enroll
students and that a market definition that fails to take account of
that is legally insufficient,'' attorney Robert Bell, the school's
lawyer, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. District Judge Rosemary Pooler dismissed the lawsuit
in 1996 only to have the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverse
her ruling. The appeals court concluded that the fraternities had
not been given a sufficient opportunity to plead their case and
sent it back to the district court.
</P>
<P>
   College president Eugene M. Tobin praised Mordue's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We maintained that the market definition used by the
fraternities in this lawsuit was legally indefensible, and we're
pleased the court agreed with the college on that fundamental
point,'' Tobin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the plan has achieved its intent, which was to
produce ''a stronger pool of applicants, especially among high
ability female students, a more intellectually focused student body
and an improved academic reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Allowing the fraternities' definition to stand might have been
precedent-setting in a number of other ways colleges conduct their
businesses,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities' law firm was still reviewing the decision and
not able to comment, said attorney Cheryl Browning.
</P>
<P>
   The 188-year-old liberal arts college, located in Clinton, N.Y.,
has an enrollment of about 1,700 students. The fraternities which
filed the lawsuit were the Psi Chapter of Psi Upsilon Inc., the
Hamilton Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi Inc., Beta of Sigma Phi Society
Inc. and Delta Kappa Epsilon Society of Hamilton College.

<HEADLINE> 'Off-Islander's' Guide to Nantucket  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME MINERVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) -- Being on an island somewhere out in the
Atlantic has its advantages. There is the sense of getting away
from it all and rediscovering what makes life worth living.
</P>
<P>
   And that quite simply is the allure of Nantucket. But with that
allure comes a price.
</P>
<P>
   The following is an ''off-islander's'' unofficial guide to what
to look for on the island.
</P>
<P>
   BEST VALUE: The 2000 visitor pass for all nine offerings by
the Nantucket Historic Association for $10; the 90-minute sail
aboard Endeavor for $22.50; and the $1 shuttle bus around the
island.
</P>
<P>
   WORST VALUE: A $20 taxi ride from Siasconset to Miacomet.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Jared Coffin House (29 Broad St., 800-248-2405) offers
a seafood buffet on Sunday and Wednesday for $26.95. The
smorgasbord offers every shellfish imaginable, plus two types of
fresh fish and to top it off, half a lobster. If you want to feel
like royalty, then 21 Federal (21 Federal St., 508-228-2121) is
the place. Entrees run from $25-$33, but its worth it just for the
ambiance and service. Chanticleer (9 New St., Siasconset,
508-257-6231) is unmistakably French and the only four-star
restaurant on the island. Breakfast at Topper's (120 Wauwinet
Road, Wauwinet, 508-228-0145) is said to be an out-of-body
experience.
</P>
<P>
   PUB FOOD: Atlantic Cafe (15 South Water St., 508-228-0570) is
the most popular and for good reason: The food is good and the
price is reasonable.
The Brotherhood (23 Broad St.) Try the Cheddar soup and wash it
down with a Whale's Tail ale.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHTLIFE: Mondays are fun at the Rose and Crown (23 South
Water St., 508 228-2595) It's karaoke night Sunday and Monday, and
DJ Ken Wade pulls no punches with some very over-the-top humor.
The Muse (44 Surfside Road, 508-228-MUSE) serves up the best live
entertainment on the island. And if singalongs are your thing, then
The Club Car (Lower Main St., 508-228-1101) is for you. The bar
is a former Nantucket Railroad car, the last remnant of a railroad
derailed in 1918 when its engine was sold to France.
</P>
<P>
   BIKING: There are at least a half dozen bike trails. If you're
only going to do one, try the 16-mile loop out Polpis Road toward
Wauwinet and Siasconset and back on Milestone Road to town. Along
the way you'll see The Life Saving Museum, Sesachacha Pond, Altar
Rock, The Moors, a cranberry bog, Sankaty Head Golf Club and
finally Siasconset village.
</P>
<P>
   GOLFING: Miacomet Golf Club (12 West Miacomet Road,
508-325-0333) is the best public course on the island. It's $29 for
nine holes.
Siasconset Golf Club (Milestone Road, 508-257-6596) is the easiest
to get onto and the cheapest ($25 for nine), but it's below par in
quality.
</P>
<P>
   TOURING: Nantucket Bike Shop (Steamboat Wharf, 508-228-1999)
has mo-peds and bicycles. Young's Bicycle Shop (Steamboat Wharf,
508-228-1151) has bicycles and rents jeeps. Nantucket Whalewatch
(Straight Wharf, 800-322-0013) Reservations are recommended for
this excursion, which runs from the end of July to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Jared Coffin House (see listing above) is the most
popular. Rates are from $100 to $325. Honorable mention goes to the
Cliff Lodge (9 Cliff Road, 508-228-9480) with rates from $150 to
$300. The best value is
The Periwinkle Guest House (North Water St., 800-588-0074) with
rates from $55 to $475.
</P>
<P>
   TRANSPORTATION: The Steamship Authority (508-548-5011) and
Hy-Line Cruises (508-778-2600) run nearly continuous ferry service
to the island from Hyannis, Mass. Short on time? The Flying
Cloud@, a high-speed ferry, gets you there faster. Several major
and local airlines have regularly scheduled flights to Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   FISHING: You can surf cast from almost anywhere on the island,
but the points (Great, Eel and Smith's) are considered the best.
There are several sport fishing charters for hire. Most go for
about $65 for two and one-half hours. Bluefish and stripers are
running until the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   BIRDWATCHING: Author Ken Blackshaw recommends using the five
wharves in town to view the island's indigenous birds. Bring a pair
of binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   COMING EVENTS: The Actors Theatre of Nantucket will be
presenting an abridged version of the play ''The Complete Works of
William Shakespeare.'' Performances will run from the middle of
July to the middle of August in the lower level theatre of the

<HEADLINE> Nantucket Is a Summer Isle Escape  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME MINERVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) -- For years, the Santos-Kissam family had
vacationed in various places all over New England. When it came
time to pick a permanent summer getaway, Richard Santos and Nancy
Kissam asked their three daughters where they wanted it to be.
</P>
<P>
   The choice was unanimous -- Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a uniqueness about it. It has a huge charm,'' Santos
said, standing outside their gray-shingled house in Brant Point.
''It's absolutely matchless on a gorgeous day.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone who encounters the ''Faraway Island'' would
concur.
</P>
<P>
   The 3&AMP;frac12;-by-14-mile island some 30 miles out in the Atlantic off
Cape Cod has an intrinsic beauty. Herman Melville called it ''a
mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.''
But upon closer examination, it's more than that. Nantucket has an
unmistakable passion for its whaling heritage, coupled with quaint
New England charm.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Martha's Vineyard can present a breathtaking view at
almost every turn, Nantucket revels in its basic, rustic, natural
state.
</P>
<P>
   And the island, from Great Point to Madaket, is not nearly as
scenic as its rival island 20 miles to the northwest. But here, it
doesn't matter. And to be sure, it hasn't stemmed the flow of
tourists in the busy summer months.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the centuries-old tradition of Nantucket
town, a walking tour offered by the Nantucket Historical
Association is a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Here a town historian will guide you through just what it was
like in Nantucket's heyday when it was the whaling capital of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   No, you won't explore all 100 pre-Civil War buildings, but
enough ground is covered in the 90-minute tour for you to get a
pretty good feel for an island that was sold in 1659 for 30 English
pounds and two beaver hats.
</P>
<P>
   From the bustling Straight Wharf to the majestic Hadwen House,
the walking tour covers the volatile -- yet profitable -- years when
whale hunters set sail for the Pacific and Indian Oceans to harpoon
whales and extract from the sea giant its valuable oil to light
their lamps and lubricate their machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The tour makes note of the fire of 1846 that burned one-third of
town to the ground, paving the way for the new circa of buildings
that stand today.
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Foulger Museum plays host to the ''Essex'' exhibit,
the saga of the ill-fated whaleship Essex and its 21 crew members
in 1820. As it's told, an enraged sperm whale rammed the bow of the
Essex in the middle of the Pacific off the coast of Peru, sinking
the 238-ton vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the three-month ordeal detail human horrors, such
as weathering fierce storms, starvation, death and cannibalization.
The account, written by first mate Owen Chase, was the inspiration
for Melville's 1851 masterpiece ''Moby Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're done taking in the island's rich history, you can
set out for a little adventure yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to tour the pork chop-shaped island is by
mo-ped. Nantucketers may loathe it, but the entire island (and
nearly every point of interest) can be covered in a day. You might
even have time to kick back, get takeout from Claudette's Lunch Box
and picnic on Siasconset Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Heading east out of town toward Siasconset on Polpis Road is
fairly uneventful (and lacks the ever-changing views of Martha's
Vineyard). Uneventful, however, until you reach the ethereal scenes
of Sankaty Head Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   The private, links-style golf course with its ocean view and
well-kept fairways remind visitors more of Scotland than New
England. Adding to the course's mystique is the Sankaty Light
House, a red-and-white beacon built in 1849. The original lens can
be seen at the Whaling Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes from the course is the former fishing village of
Siasconset, or ''Sconset.'' Codfish Park, a residential area,
boasts the most unique lay of the land. These cottages, formerly
the dwelling places of cod fishermen, are arranged in a multilayer,
checkerboard fashion overlooking the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion on Siasconset Beach is among the worst on the island. In
fact, a small cottage on Beach Street went recently for $240,000,
cheap by Nantucket standards. The reason for the fire sale? Two
powerful storms in the past decade washed a row of houses into the
sea, eroding at least 100 feet of beach in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Farther to the north (en route to Great Point) is Wauwinet and
an elegant inn -- The Wauwinet. Built by two ship captains in 1876,
the inn overlooks Head of the Harbor and the peninsula of Coatue.
One gets a decidedly European feel here -- perhaps it's the croquet
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also find a friendly and professional staff -- but at a
cost. A guest bedroom starts at $330, while entrees at Topper's run
between $40 and $60. The rates are somewhat cheaper in the spring
and fall.
</P>
<P>
   The inn also offers four-wheel drive tours up to Great Point,
one of the best places to surf cast on the island. Seal sightings,
especially in the winter, are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   If you love the beach, there's no better place to head than to
the western half of the island. Most of the island's dozen or so
beaches, from Jetties to Surfside, can be found here.
</P>
<P>
   Jetties is the best beach within walking distance of town. With
its shore on the calm Nantucket Sound, it's ideal for kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the southwest corner of the island lies Madaket Beach, the
first of the great beaches on the Atlantic, along with Cisco,
Surfside and Siasconset.
</P>
<P>
   South out of town down Hummock Pond Road on the way to Cisco
Beach lies the best public golf course on the island, Miacomet Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Further east of Cisco is Surfside Beach, but surfers prefer the
ride at Nobadeer Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is more to do on Nantucket than going
sightseeing and building sandcastles. The restaurants in town aim
to suit every palate. But even its moderately priced eateries are
high by mainland standards.
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, there is always something going on in Nantucket.
The annual Nantucket Film Festival is held in June. The festival is
renowned for rewarding superior screenwriting while eschewing
Hollywood glitz.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the best values on the island is a 1&AMP;frac12;-hour sail
aboard the 41-foot sloop Endeavor. For $25, Capt. Jim Genthner will
put you to work raising the sail. The excursion takes you northwest
past the historic Brant Point Lighthouse, around the jetties and
out toward Eel Point. And be sure to get the crew to point out
where Tommy Hilfiger's mansion is on Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
   As for anglers, they can book a private charter for $65 for 2&AMP;frac12;
hours in search of striped bass and bluefish. And if tennis is your
game, there are many clay courts.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of shops, boutiques, art galleries and
antique huts lined by the cobblestone roads of Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind the summer season is short, from the end of June to
the end of August. Then comes wretched weather until the calm of
spring sets the cycle in motion again.

<HEADLINE> Nation facing blood shortage  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An ever-increasing demand for blood combined
with summer's customary donor drop-off have created a critical
nationwide shortage, blood bank officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross said there is a critical need for all
blood types.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patients who need blood in emergency situations absolutely
depend on a readily available supply,'' said Red Cross President
and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Bernadine Healy. ''No patient
should ever be left to wonder if the lifesaving blood they need
will be available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has reached crisis proportions in the New York
metropolitan region, said Dr. Robert Jones, president and CEO of
the New York Blood Center. He said the shortage has forced the
center to reduce blood shipments to New York and New Jersey
hospitals by as much as 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless there is an immediate and dramatic donation increase,
these reduced blood shipments will continue or grow worse, placing
hospital and trauma patients at severe risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said there are several reasons for the
shortage including the fact that fewer donors are available with
colleges and high schools not in session during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   They said that despite an overall increase in collections this
year, the supply has not kept pace with demand, in part because
more advanced medical procedures such as organ transplants and
cancer treatments are being performed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Blood Center, which is the majority supplier for
200 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, northern and central
New Jersey and the Hudson Valley, currently has approximately 1,000
pints of O positive blood and 200 pints of O negative - a one-day
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''We typically like to have about a five-day supply,'' said
blood center spokeswoman Linda Levi.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and the blood center are urging eligible donors to
give blood. To donate blood one must be healthy, at least 17 years
old and at least 110 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge all eligible blood donors to help us during this
critical shortage by scheduling an appointment to donate blood -
the gift of life,'' said the Red Cross' Healy.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE - Donors can call the American Red Cross at
1-800-GIVE-LIFE or the New York Blood Center at 1-800-933-BLOOD
(2566) to schedule an appointment.

<HEADLINE> Karl To Stay With Bucks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- George Karl will remain coach of the
Milwaukee Bucks and not pursue the coaching job at North Carolina,
his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, it's best for everyone if I remove my name from the
process, so the university can continue its search and I can
concentrate on continuing to build what we've started in
Milwaukee,'' Karl said Monday in a statement released by the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Former North Carolina coach Dean Smith called the Bucks on
Friday and asked for permission to speak with Karl about the
opening created by the retirement of Bill Guthrdige. Karl had to
get the Bucks' permission to discuss another job because his
contract does not include a buy-out clause.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm flattered and honored to be approached about what I
consider the best coaching job in college basketball,'' Karl said.
''Right now, however, I also have a loyalty to an organization that
has treated me very well, an owner who has shown a great deal of
faith in me and a team that's on the verge of something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl has led the Bucks to two consecutive playoff berths.
Milwaukee took Eastern Conference champion Indiana to five games
before losing in the first round this season. The Bucks had gone
seven seasons without a playoff appearance before his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand what a terrific coach we have in George Karl,''
Milwaukee general manager Ernie Grunfeld said. ''The improvement
since he arrived has been remarkable, and we're confident that the
future will be even brighter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I speak for the Bucks organization, our players and for
fans throughout Milwaukee and the state of Wisconsin when I say
that we are very fortunate to have him.''

<HEADLINE> Horror Spoof Takes Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two horror flicks were the box-office
surprises last summer. The surprise of the season so far this year
is the horror parody ''Scary Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The anything-goes gross-out comedy took in $42.3 million in its
opening weekend, the best debut ever for an R-rated movie and the
second-highest premiere this year, after ''Mission: Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and starring
his brothers Marlon and Shawn, also brought in more than two of
this summer's most anticipated movies did in their debuts last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney's ''The Perfect Storm'' opened over the busy
Fourth of July weekend with $41.3 million, and Mel Gibson's ''The
Patriot'' grossed $22.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood analysts had expected ''Scary Movie'' to top the box
office this weekend but had figured its take would be in the $30
million range.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it would be big,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office. ''I wasn't
surprised it was No. 1, but I was surprised at the sheer size of
its numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax distributed the movie that pokes fun at its own
''Scream'' franchise and other horror hits such as ''The Sixth
Sense'' and ''The Blair Witch Project. Co-chairman Bob Weinstein
said Miramax and Wayans tailored the movie for the broadest
possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the movie goes beyond the 'Scream' audience,''
Weinstein said. ''Comedy is a bigger genre than horror. Everybody
wants to go to the movies and laugh. It's like Keenen said, if it
gets a laugh, it's in the movie. If it doesn't, it's out.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie borrowed one critical thing from the three ''Scream''
movies. The first ''Scream'' originally was titled ''Scary Movie,''
but Miramax felt that name sounded too much like a spoof, Weinstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans' movie had been titled ''Scream if You Know What I Did
Last Halloween,'' but Miramax decided to appropriate ''Scary
Movie'' because it had wider appeal, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Since ''Scream'' in 1996, horror movies have had a resurgence.
''Scream 3'' topped the box office when it opened in February, and
last summer's horror hits included ''The Haunting'' and the
surprise blockbusters ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was perfect timing for 'Scary Movie,''' said Robert
Bucksbaum, a film analyst for Reel Source Inc. ''In the last few
years, we've seen just about everything we can in the horror genre,
and along comes a film that pokes fun at that and the whole
genre.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 11; Nasdaq Loses 42  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in a quiet session Monday as
investors traded cautiously ahead of a rush of corporate earnings
reports due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.31 at 10,647.29,
according to preliminary calculations, while the Nasdaq composite
index slipped 42.49 at 3,980.71.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.39 at 1,474.51.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of waiting and watching until corporate
earnings announcements hit full stride the end of this week,'' said
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, the first Dow component to report second-quarter results,
had higher-than-expected earnings. Shares of the aluminum producer
rose $2.063 to $29.688.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, expected to release its earnings report on Tuesday, fell
$6.50 to $110.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were still digesting a positive jobs report from the
government on Friday. The report gave the latest evidence that the
U.S. economy is slowing in response to the Federal Reserve's six
interest rate increases since last June.
</P>
<P>
   A slowing economy signals steadier interest rates but also the
potential for weaker corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for
the next few months. While that's good news for investors who were
unnerved earlier this year by the Fed's actions, there is still a
great deal of concern in the market that the cumulative effect of
the rate hikes will be a drop in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Monday's announcement by JDS Uniphase, a big
fiber-optics company, that it was buying rival SDL for $41 billion,
sent JDS tumbling $15.063, or 13 percent to $101.125. SDL rose
$25.375, or 9 percent, to $320.689.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities upgraded its rating on several downtrodden
retailers, and that sent Best Buy climbing $3.375 to $74.125 and
Circuit City rising $3 to $38.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating of computer chip maker
Applied MicroDevices, which rose $2.25 to $84.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a five to three margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 851.70 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 2.59 to 530.81.
</P>
<P>
   In overseas trading, the Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1
percent, Germany's DAX index was up 0.26 percent, Britain's FT-SE
100 was down 0.48 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Killer pleads in murders of Holocaust survivor and her caretaker  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - A man pleaded guilty Monday to beating
two women to death in a burglary that netted only a broken VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Crumpton, 37, who was described by one detective as a
''one-man crime wave,'' faces consecutive life prison terms -
altogether, 126 years without parole - for the slayings of
Holocaust survivor Dora Birnbaum, 86, and her live-in caretaker,
Beatrice Cabarrus, 84, of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had planned to seek the death penalty against
Crumpton when his trial began next month. But he slit one of his
wrists last week in a suicide attempt and then told his lawyers he
wanted to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The state agreed because the plea spared family members the
ordeal of a trial while ensuring that Crumpton would die in prison,
First Assistant Atlantic County Prosecutor Murray Talasnik said.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, the thickly muscled Crumpton stood solemnly,
giving one-word answers to all but one question posed to him by
Superior Court Judge Manuel Greenberg and defense attorney John
Bjorklund.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he broke in, he said: ''Burglarize the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-9-inch, 100-pound Birnbaum was a native of Slonim,
Poland, who fled the Nazi occupation as a young woman, hiding in
woods near her village.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and 3-year-old daughter were captured and killed by
Nazis, but she survived, married again and later moved to the
United States, where she raised a family.
</P>
<P>
   Her family hired Cabarrus to look after her in 1988. By Nov. 19,
1998, when Crumpton broke into her first-floor apartment at 311
Oriental Ave., she was too weak to get off her couch by herself.
</P>
<P>
   Crumpton told authorities he ''lost it'' after breaking in and
proceeded to bludgeon the women.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum died at the scene after choking on her own blood.
Cabarrus was beaten into a coma and died four months later, of
oxygen deprivation to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Crumpton, already a suspect in a series of similar burglaries in
the neighborhood, got only a VCR that never worked after being
bought at a yard sale by Birnbaum's son.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a one-man crime wave, all by himself,'' said a former
police detective who investigated Crumpton but has since retired.
He would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plea to two counts of felony murder, pending charges
against Crumpton from other burglaries will be dismissed.
Sentencing was set for Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum's son, Charles Birnbaum, 53, of Hammonton, watched
Crumpton's court appearance from a gallery seat. He was accompanied
by Dorthea Joyce, 49, of Atlantic City, a neighbor who found the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a relief to not have to go through the trial process and
open up a lot of wounds,'' he said. ''But that doesn't bring back
my mother, and it doesn't bring back Beatrice.''

<HEADLINE> Federal judge tosses out fraternity lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge has ruled that Hamilton
College did not violate antitrust laws by requiring students to
live on campus and not in fraternity houses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue found that ''there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact'' in the 1995 antitrust case
and ordered that it be dismissed in its entirety in a decision
rendered June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities sued the college under the Sherman Antitrust
Act, arguing that the residential life plan adopted by the school
in 1995 had made the college a ''monopolist'' in providing services
to students.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, all students were required to live in
campus-provided housing and purchase a five-meals-a-week dining
plan. College officials said the rule was necessary to integrate
academic and social life and to cut down on the use of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Mordue sided with Hamilton's lawyers, who had argued that
because the college is only one of many competing institutions, it
cannot monopolize any collegiate market by itself. The judge added
that the fraternity's antitrust claims were no longer at issue
because current students are made aware of Hamilton's residential
policies before enrolling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think Judge Mordue was clearly right when he ruled that
Hamilton College competes with a number of other colleges to enroll
students and that a market definition that fails to take account of
that is legally insufficient,'' attorney Robert Bell, the school's
lawyer, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. District Judge Rosemary Pooler dismissed the lawsuit
in 1996 only to have the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverse
her ruling. The appeals court concluded that the fraternities had
not been given a sufficient opportunity to plead their case and
sent it back to the district court.
</P>
<P>
   College president Eugene M. Tobin praised Mordue's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We maintained that the market definition used by the
fraternities in this lawsuit was legally indefensible, and we're
pleased the court agreed with the college on that fundamental
point,'' Tobin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the plan has achieved its intent, which was to
produce ''a stronger pool of applicants, especially among high
ability female students, a more intellectually focused student body
and an improved academic reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Allowing the fraternities' definition to stand might have been
precedent-setting in a number of other ways colleges conduct their
businesses,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities' law firm was still reviewing the decision and
not able to comment, said attorney Cheryl Browning.
</P>
<P>
   The 188-year-old liberal arts college, located in Clinton, N.Y.,
has an enrollment of about 1,700 students. The fraternities which
filed the lawsuit were the Psi Chapter of Psi Upsilon Inc., the
Hamilton Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi Inc., Beta of Sigma Phi Society
Inc. and Delta Kappa Epsilon Society of Hamilton College.

<HEADLINE> Irvington cop gets 10 months for 'riding shotgun' for drug dealers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An Irvington police officer was sentenced
Monday to 10 months in prison by a judge who rejected a government
motion that could have kept the disgraced cop from serving jail
time.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Clark said the officer, Wendell
Huggins, cooperated with investigators when his crimes came to
light.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the cooperation was certified in a letter to the
judge that remains sealed, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation allows U.S. District Judge William H. Walls to give
a lesser sentence than the guidelines for a crime. Huggins faced
six to 12 months under the guidelines, and his lawyer, Anthony J.
Fusco Jr., asked for no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Walls sternly refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe ... that this defendant should be, in effect,
applauded for violating his oath of office,'' Walls said. ''For me
to slap him on the wrist, as the government would have me do, I
simply will not do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a police officer. He, in effect, rode shotgun for a drug
dealer,'' Walls said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would have given Huggins a reduced sentence if
the officer had faced a term longer than six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Walls also ordered Huggins to pay a $2,500 fine and repay $1,000
to prosecutors. He said he received that sum from drug dealers on
four trips in which he helped transport illegal drugs and money
from drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted providing protection against police interference
from November 1998 to February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, an officer for 10 years, is to surrender within 30 days
and is ineligible for parole. He was suspended without pay earlier
this year. Fusco said Hugins would resign and lose his pension.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, 35, pleaded guilty in February on a single charge of
obstructing interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   His assistance to drug dealers operating in Essex County was
uncovered by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Huggins, agents were taping conversations he had had
with at least one unnamed dealer, and watched Huggins drive a
dealer and pick up packages believed to contain drugs on several
occasions, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   During one trip, on Feb. 18, 1999, Huggins and an unnamed person
discuss transporting heroin to other locations where it could fetch
a higher price, according to court papers filed by the FBI.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller, Pataki administration keep up sniping  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state inspector general's office keeps
poor track of official cars and doesn't put out annual reports,
state Comptroller H. Carl McCall said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually sharp response to a McCall audit, the inspector
general's office fired back that the comptroller played up minor
problems because he was thwarted in proving an alleged
preconception, namely that the inspector general's office ''had
engaged in misconduct by ignoring serious complaints of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's auditors were ''forced to admit that there exists not a
shred of evidence to support any of the allegations,'' the
inspector general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   It was another aggressive response by the Republican Pataki
administration to an audit or a report from the Democratic
comptroller. McCall is thinking about running for governor in 2002,
when he could well face Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has insisted that political ambitions do not play a part
in what programs and agencies his office audits.
</P>
<P>
   The state inspector general's office is headed by Roslynn
Mauskopf and is in charge of investigating fraud, waste and
corruption in the executive branch of state government.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said his auditors found some inspector general
investigations dragged on too long, that the office had poor
controls over how its 35 vehicles for staffers were being used and
did not produce an annual report on how many cases it had opened,
investigated or closed in a given calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, McCall said, his auditors were surprised at finding
staff at the inspector general's office ''so resistant'' to having
their books examined.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office countered that ''wholesale
access'' to its files about former and ongoing investigations would
''jeopardize the lives and safety of whistleblowers, witnesses and
investigators.'' Some materials were properly shielded from
McCall's auditors for security reasons, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   Mauskopf's office also said it was unfair of McCall, who knew
about the security concerns, to suggest that the inspector general
was stonewalling the comptroller's auditors. A deal was worked out
more than a year ago under which the inspector general would
withhold sensitive documents but not the fiduciary-related papers
McCall's auditors were seeking to review, inspector general's
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauskopf complained Monday because McCall portrayed those
limitations on seeing sensitive materials as Mauskopf and her aides
putting a ''condition'' on the release of information to McCall.
</P>
<P>
   McCall spokeswoman Theresa Bourgeois said correcting some of the
problems, such as with oversight over use of the inspector
general's vehicles, was delayed due to the resistance McCall's
auditors got from Mauskopf's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office also got in barbs at McCall's
office for taking ''baseless and irresponsible press leaks'' and
trying to build an audit around them. At the time the audit began
in 1998, the New York Post was reporting that McCall's auditors
were exasperated that the inspector general was not doing more with
the possible malfeasance they were unearthing among state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mauskopf's predecessor, George Moresco, also accused Mauskopf in
the Post of socializing too much with Gov. George Pataki's inner
circle and of not maintaining the distance from the administration
Moresco said is necessary to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Mauskopf's office said a public registry of all the inspector
general's cases and all investigative activities is on file at her
office for public review. The inspector general also said its
auto-use policies adhere to state laws and that the effectiveness
or success of an investigation cannot be judged by how long they
take to conclude.

<HEADLINE> Cohen To Cut Back Anthrax Vaccines  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska (AP) -- The Pentagon's
controversial program of vaccinating all troops against anthrax
will be cut back immediately to conserve dwindling vaccine
supplies, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said inoculations will be limited mainly to those troops
who already are taking the series of anthrax vaccine shots and
those who are preparing to deploy to the Middle East and South
Korea -- where, in the Pentagon's estimation, the threat of exposure
to the deadly anthrax virus is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen discussed his decision during an interview with reporters
traveling with him to China. His plane stopped to refuel at
Elmendorf Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively small, but increasingly vocal, number of military
members are refusing to take the vaccine. They fear potentially
damaging side effects, although the Pentagon insists the vaccine is
safe. Some members of Congress have urged Cohen to end the program
until a safer vaccine is found.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's only vaccine supplier, Bioport of Lansing, Mich.,
has not yet gained Food and Drug Administration certification for
its new manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said last week that
the Pentagon had only about one month's supply of vaccine on hand,
at the current rate of inoculations. An additional batch of vaccine
in storage has yet to receive FDA approval for use, so Cohen had to
decide on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he decided to reduce the inoculation program ''in a
way that preserves the program itself until such time as we can get
certification of additional supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now about 100,000 doses available, Cohen said, adding
that it should last until the end of the year. By that time,
Bioport's new manufacturing plant should be certified, the Pentagon
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a naturally occurring virus. Dry anthrax spores, when
inhaled, can be deadly to humans.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Michael Irvin To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The spinal injury that ended Michael
Irvin's 1999 season has forced the Dallas Cowboys' receiver into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which has been expected for months, will
become official with a news conference Tuesday at Texas Stadium. It
comes a month after longtime teammate Daryl Johnston also called it
a career because of a neck injury and a week before Dallas opens
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Great hands made Irvin one of the best receivers in NFL history
and a loud mouth made him one of the game's great showboats.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin loved taunting opponents with an exaggerated first-down
motion after a big catch. He made enough big catches that he was
nicknamed ''the Playmaker,'' a moniker he proudly had printed on
his license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, Irvin led the Cowboys
to three Super Bowl championships in a four-year span. Fans argued
over which ''triplet'' was the most important, yet it was
understood that each enhanced the others.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin finished his 12-year career with 750 catches, tied for
ninth in NFL history, for 11,904 yards, also ninth all-time. He
holds nearly every major career or single-season receiving record
in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   His insight and personality will help Irvin well in his next
career. The 34-year-old is expected to announce plans to go into
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   For all his on-field accomplishments, Irvin also will be
remembered for some serious off-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Irvin was arrested in a motel-room drug bust in the wee
hours of his 30th birthday. He pleaded no contest to a felony drug
charge that summer and received 800 hours of community service and
four years of probation, which was lifted last Thursday, 10 days
early.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin also was suspended by the NFL for five games. His image
and the team's were seriously tarnished and he lost most of his
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Irvin was falsely accused of sexually assault. At
training camp in 1998, Irvin was involved in ''Scissorsgate'' when
he cut the neck of a teammate during a playful scuffle prior to a
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin followed that with a down year in 1998, catching a
career-low one touchdown pass as then-coach Chan Gailey reduced his
role in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   His future in Dallas was questioned going into 1999, but Irvin
turned a hot topic into a non-issue by working hard and saying all
the right things. Then, on Oct. 10 in Philadelphia, he suffered the
most serious injury of his career.
</P>
<P>
   On a tackle following a reception, Irvin awkwardly slammed his
head into the hard turf of Veterans Stadium and was temporarily
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Tests revealed that he sustained a herniated disc, but they also
detected that Irvin was born with a narrow spinal cord. That
genetic condition became his primary concern because it puts him at
a much higher risk of serious injury if he takes another blow to
the head or neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been preparing for life without Irvin ever
since. In February, they acquired receiver Joey Galloway from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin never had the speed Galloway has, but he beat defenders to
the ball using smarts and size.
</P>
<P>
   He took advantage of his 6-foot-2, 207-pound frame to screen
cornerbacks, especially on the quick slant that was the trademark
play for Irvin and Aikman. On deeper passes, Irvin often stretched
the rules of contact by swatting away defenders' arms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his three Super Bowl titles in Dallas, Irvin won
a national championship in college at Miami, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was the final first-round pick by Tom Landry. Dallas took
him with the 11th overall pick in 1988 and a year later he was
reunited with his college coach, Jimmy Johnson. The Cowboys won the
Super Bowl following the '92, '93 and '95 seasons.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Sign Malakhov  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers signed defenseman Vladimir
Malakhov from the Stanley Cup-champion New Jersey Devils on Monday
to begin what is expected to be a key week for the club.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are getting ready to sign a new coach, presumably
Ron Low, and return Mark Messier to a team that has not been the
same since the club's last trip to the playoffs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov, who was acquired by the Devils from Montreal on March
1, signed a four-year, $14 million deal with a one-year option with
New York. Dallas and Florida also tried to lure the free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, I got an offer from the Rangers and decided to stay
in the Big Apple,'' said Malakhov, who began his career with the
New York Islanders. ''I really like it here.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Glen Sather decided not to re-sign defensemen
Kevin Hatcher and Mathieu Schneider and use that money on Malakhov.
He set his sights on the 31-year-old veteran of eight NHL seasons
during New Jersey's Stanley Cup run.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look through the NHL, there aren't many players who can
play with this kind of ability,'' Sather said. ''He was a player
that was available and we didn't have to give up any youth to get
him. I think he makes us a stronger hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is worth $3.5 million a year for four years, with a
club option of $4.25 million or a player option of $2.5 million for
a fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   Sather will return to New York on Tuesday after being out of
town for his son's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Once he gets back, the new GM is expected to close some big
deals. Sather disputed reports Monday that Messier, who had his
contract bought out by the Vancouver Canucks, had already signed a
two-year deal with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's totally untrue,'' Sather said. ''Mark has not agreed to
a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier captained the Rangers to the 1994 Stanley Cup, ending 54
years of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Low emerged last month as the top candidate to replace John
Muckler, who was fired along with GM Neil Smith with only four
games remaining in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov, who still owns a New York home, missed the Canadiens'
first 53 games with a knee injury. He was placed on the trading
block when the club found out that he took his family skiing during
the All-Star break even though he had not returned to the Montreal
lineup from a torn ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   He played his first game with the Devils four days after the
trade and had a goal and four assists in 24 games. Malakhov, who
also had a goal and four assists in the playoffs, spent a little
over two years with the Islanders before being sent to Montreal in
a deal involving Schneider in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should be in his prime,'' said Sather, who expects Malakhov
to get plenty of power-play time and take a lot of pressure off
captain and fellow defenseman Brian Leetch. ''He spent his years
learning in the NHL and now we should be able to watch him
flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who had the NHL's largest payroll last season at
$61 million, have missed the playoffs in each of the last three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think it was necessary to make some personnel changes
on the team, especially with what's gone on the past three years,''
Sather said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have also expressed interest in another member of
the Devils, forward Claude Lemieux. There is talk New York is set
to offer a contract to the three-time Stanley Cup winner, but none
has been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make some changes so we get into the playoffs,''
Sather said. ''We've got to make some attitude changes and that
might mean making some personnel changes as well and that's what
we're doing.''

<HEADLINE> Victim of concrete attack says assailant was once a troubled child  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An aspiring social worker bashed in the head
with a 5-pound concrete block was upbeat about her recovery Monday
and said the man who hit her was likely once a troubled child.
</P>
<P>
   ''This attack made me feel that the guy who attacked me, 20
years ago was probably a struggling kid,'' said Tiffany Goldberg,
who hopes to help disturbed children after attending graduate
school in social work at Columbia University in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   No suspect was in custody as of Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the third similar assault in New York during the
past year. Goldberg said that Nicole Barrett, who was hit with a
paving brick in November, has e-mailed her get-well wishes from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who was attacked Sunday as she left a Manhattan church
where she sings in the choir, was interviewed by The Associated
Press in her room at Bellevue Hospital, appearing upbeat, even
refusing an offer of hospital food with a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old native of Madison, Wis., had a black eye, a
bruise on her chin, a fracture in the back of her skull and two
chipped front teeth - but said she was grateful that her injuries
were not worse. Goldberg was released from the hospital late Monday
afternoon and said she would be staying with friends in the city.
</P>
<P>
   She told her ''two sets of parents'' - her biological parents
divorced when she was a baby and have remarried - that her injuries
were not serious enough for them to come from Wisconsin. Goldberg
told them her injuries were similar to wounds that might be
sustained if she had banged her head in a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very cup-half-full situation,'' she said. ''If he
would have been a little mightier or struck me in a different way I
might have been more seriously hurt or even killed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she does not remember feeling the block of concrete hit
her head.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who visited Goldberg on Monday, called
her ''a very brave young woman.'' He added, ''The police are doing
everything they can to find the person who did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a 1996 graduate of elite Sarah Lawrence College in
Westchester County, works as a waitress at the trendy Bryant Park
Grill in Manhattan. She has lived in New York City since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She has been described by friends as a talented singer who has
appeared in small-scale productions. Goldberg said that she's not
aiming to become a Broadway star - although ''if the opportunity
occurred I would take it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Goldberg had just left Marble Collegiate
Presbyterian Church on 29th Street and Park Avenue, where she sings
in the gospel choir, when a man hit her, tried to snatch her purse
and ran away.
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty firefighter, Lt. Jimmy Hurley, was driving by when
he saw Goldberg being attacked. Hurley said Monday he tried to
chase the attacker, but when he saw how badly Goldberg was
bleeding, he ran to help her, wrapping his white T-shirt around her
head, and held her hand.
</P>
<P>
   He said to her: ''I'm Jimmy. I'm a fireman.''
</P>
<P>
   And Goldberg said to him: ''Well, fireman Jimmy. Don't leave
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley called 911, and after Goldberg had been taken to the
hospital, he rode around with police, searching unsuccessfully for
the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley visited Goldberg in the hospital and said he has a sister
the same age as her who lives in the Murray Hill neighborhood,
where the attacked occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have been her. I'm very happy to hear that she's
fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people witnessed the attack and described the
assailant, a man apparently in his 30s, as disheveled.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said descriptions of the
attacker appeared to match that of a homeless man who frequents the
neighborhood; a city shelter is about two blocks away. Police began
distributing a sketch of the suspect on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents said security cameras in a nearby building
captured the attack, but police would not comment on that. The
chunk of concrete, believed to be a piece of sidewalk, was found
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a 30-year-old Queens woman was hit with a brick and
robbed.
</P>
<P>
   And last November, Barrett, then 27, was hit on the head with a
paving brick in midtown Manhattan while walking to work. She
underwent two brain operations and has returned to her family's
home in Athens, Texas, for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Said Goldberg: ''I felt that attack was random, just like this
attack on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said this of both attacks: ''I thought it was
pretty strange - like lightning strike twice in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who spent three days in a coma after her attack, was
shocked and saddened to hear of yet another rock assault in the
city, said her mother, Sharon Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Drake, an ex-convict and drug abuser, has pleaded innocent
to second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and
criminal possession of a weapon in connection with Barrett's
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's lawyer, Louis Zayas, said his client was mistakenly
arrested. He cited the similarities among the three attacks and the
matching physical descriptions of the man who attacked Drake and
Goldberg as evidence that Barrett's attacker is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir said the two attacks do not appear related. ''At this
point we have no reason or evidence to believe this attack has a
connection whatsoever to Nicole Barrett or any other case,'' he
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said the attack has not changed her mind about living
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel safe here,'' she said. ''My parents have never
objected to me living in New York City.''

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jermaine Dye had a bit of a fright Monday during
his first visit to Atlanta for Tuesday night's All-Star game since
the Braves traded him away four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old outfielder with the Kansas City Royals, who was
voted onto the American League team by the fans, said the
commercial jet was getting ready to land at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport when the plane suddenly went back into the
air and circled several times before landing without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were about 50 feet off the ground, basically getting ready
to land when the plane took off into the air again. It was kinda
scary,'' said Dye, who made the squad by hitting .319 with 22 home
runs and 65 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Dye, who homered on his first major-league swing on May 17,
1996, with the Atlanta Braves, has a career batting average of .279
with 72 homers and 265 RBIs in 470 games.
</P>

<P>
   LAWTON'S DREAM: A year ago, Minnesota Twins outfielder Matt
Lawton was wondering if his career might be over after getting hit
in the face with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He answered that question by making it to Atlanta for Tuesday
night's All-Star game as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year at this time I was rehabbing in Fort Myers, Fla.,
thinking if I was ever going to get my confidence back to play the
game of baseball again,'' Lawton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton was struck with the pitch June 9 and spent a month on the
disabled list with multiple fractures in his right eye socket.
</P>
<P>
   He came back but managed to end the season with a .259 average
and only seven home runs, after hitting 21 homers in 1998. He said
he went into the offseason with a renewed focus, though he never
dreamed about being an All-Star.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A-ROD'S KNEE: Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, voted onto the
AL All-Star team, won't play because of an injury Friday night
against the Los Angeles Dodgers while trying to break up a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez sustained a concussion when the knee of Los Angeles
shortstop Alex Cora struck him in the head, but he also twisted his
right knee, which was a bigger concern.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who came to Atlanta and took part in player
interviews, said he feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm walking around almost without a limp. I have
flexibility,'' said Rodriguez, who resisted taking an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever they take those MRI's, they tend to find things that
no one else can see, so I'm trying to stay away from them MRI
machines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he expects to be back in the lineup by Saturday
or Sunday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MADDUX OK: Greg Maddux, selected as one of the 10 pitchers for
the NL squad, was hit by a line drive on the top of his right
shoulder during batting practice Saturday in Boston and will miss
the game. He will dress and take part in all the All-Star
festivities, including shagging fly balls before Tuesday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   No, he won't be wearing a football helmet or shoulder pads.
''Just my glove,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Danny Graves replaced Maddux for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta right-hander, 10-3 with a 3.32 ERA, said he felt
much better and thought he might be able to start Thursday when the
Braves travel to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux missed his scheduled start Sunday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a bruise,'' Maddux said. ''It happened two days ago
and it's starting to feel a lot better. I should be ready by
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NO THOMAS: Despite hitting over .300 with 26 homers and 75
RBIs, Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas was left off the team.
AL manager Joe Torre said Thomas had been used as a DH most of the
season, playing little first base, and he had to choose between
Thomas and Edgar Martinez of Seattle, who also is a DH.
</P>
<P>
   The DH is not used because the game is played in an NL park.
</P>
<P>
   ''Edgar Martinez's numbers are so glaring that he needs to be on
the team,'' Torre said. Martinez is hitting .354 and leads the
league in RBIs with 87.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said leaving Thomas off wasn't done ''because I don't
respect what he's done and what he's done in the past and this
year. First base is very difficult. And he has been DHing most of
the time. We don't have a DH this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STAR STUFF: AL starting second baseman Roberto Alomar of the
Cleveland Indians, whose right elbow was badly swollen after being
hit by a pitch Sunday, said Monday it felt much better and the
swelling had just about disappeared, although the imprint of the
seam of a baseball where it struck him was clearly visible. ''It'll
probably be a game-time decision,'' he said about starting and
playing. ... In the hometown of Coca-Cola, free Pepsi was being
dispensed Tuesday outside Turner Field, where the temperature was
in the mid-90s. Pepsi, not Coke, is an official sponsor of major
league baseball.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Injuries Don't Disappoint  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Not everybody at the All-Star game is bummed out
about the injuries that have kept the sport's biggest names on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are too overjoyed at being fill-ins -- no matter
what the circumstances -- to have much sympathy for the disappointed
fans and their banged-up colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to enjoy it,'' said Jeffrey Hammonds, who found out
he was replacing Barry Bonds on the roster in the eighth inning of
Colorado's game Sunday night against Anaheim. ''It's not a burden.
This is what it's all about. It's ironic that it took an injury,
but if that's what it's going to take ...''
</P>
<P>
   With a record eight players selected for the team -- Bonds, Mark
McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Mike Piazza, Greg Maddux, Cal Ripken,
Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez -- missing the game, there will be
more players in the training room than on the field this week.
</P>
<P>
   That will surely leave fans who paid between $100-150 a ticket a
bit unhappy -- and some players as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too bad because these are the guys I enjoy watching,
too,'' said Baltimore shortstop Mike Bordick, added to the team
when Ripken opted out with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad that NL manager Bobby Cox has put out a
cross-country alert for a third-string All-Star catcher to take
Piazza's place on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez went back home to Puerto Rico and Todd Hundley is
tending to a sick family member and turned down an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has put a bit of a damper on the game, but it will give
some up and coming players a chance to show what they can do,'' Los
Angeles outfielder Gary Sheffield said. ''A lot of people will get
to see what these guys can do for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is especially excited to watch Montreal slugger
Vladimir Guerrero, starting in left instead of the fans' choice,
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The six other fill-in starters are also in the All-Star lineup
for the first time in their careers: Jeff Kent, Jim Edmonds, Andres
Galarraga, Jason Kendall, Derek Jeter and Travis Fryman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys who are replacing everybody are still All-Stars,''
Griffey said. ''When you look at their numbers, they've done as
well as everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback stories of Galarraga and Kendall are particularly
touching. Galarraga missed all of 1999 battling cancer, while
Kendall's right ankle was nearly torn off in a frightful accident
about a week before last year's game.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is replacing McGwire, perhaps the most disappointing
no-show for fans who were eagerly awaiting Big Mac's Home Run Derby
power display.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall will start in place of Piazza, who sustained a slight
concussion after being hit in the helmet by a pitch from Roger
Clemens on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be cool to hear my name announced with all the other
great players in the lineup,'' Kendall said. ''It will be a
chilling moment. I just wish it were on different terms.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the injured players have accounted for 66 All-Star
appearances, led by Ripken's 17, putting a new face on this year's
game. There are 11 first-time starters, making pregame
introductions a must-see for casual fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the only upside to that is there are so many more
deserving players that the roster allows you to have,'' AL manager
Joe Torre said. ''Now you're able to honor more. It's a big thrill
to see the faces of these guys when they come into that
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be particularly odd for Fryman, who has made four
All-Star appearances before this year, backing up Ripken each time.
</P>
<P>
   As a shortstop with Detroit from 1992-94, Fryman played behind
Ripken. When he switched to third base in 1996, Ripken was there
too, ahead of him once again on the All-Star depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   With Ripken home this week, Fryman gets his first start.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an All-Star game if I'm playing behind Cal,'' Fryman
said. ''I've always been his caddie. The highlight for me is always
taking grounders with Cal and having a locker next to him. It will
be a different experience.''

<HEADLINE> Mounting Tensions in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Protestant hard-liners angry
over restrictions on their traditional July parades mounted mass
street protests Monday, forcing shops to close early and inspiring
more violence across Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls for peaceful protests by the leaders of the Orange
Order brotherhood, trouble broke out within minutes in Belfast and
other towns.
</P>
<P>
   Along the so-called ''peace line,'' a network of fences and
walls separating British Protestant and Irish Catholic communities
in west Belfast, youths on both sides traded salvos of bottles and
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five miles to the southwest in Lurgan, riot police
intervened to prevent Protestants from walking into the Catholic
side of the town, among the most bitterly polarized in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   And in neighboring Portadown, the mostly Protestant town at the
center of debate over Orange Order parades, riot police armed with
shields, clubs and attack dogs pushed demonstrators out of an
intersection. The crowd responded by pelting police with rocks and
bottles and torching a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders in Belfast, Portadown and several smaller towns
advised shops to close an hour before the protests to allow workers
enough time to get away. Almost everyone followed the advice, as
normally bustling shopping precincts became ghost towns by 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders condemned Orange tactics, saying the
Protestant fraternal group was placing its own disputed right to
march past hostile Catholic neighborhoods above everyone else's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most businessmen didn't want to close their premises, and
certainly do not support what the Orangemen are doing, but they had
a duty to ensure that their staff could get home safely,'' said
Bill Jeffrey, chairman of the Northern Ireland Small Businesses
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The mass exodus of motorists meant that when groups of Orangemen
and their supporters began rallying in predominantly Protestant
parts of Belfast -- some carrying placards reading ''Respect our
culture, restore our rights'' -- they had comparatively little
traffic to snarl.
</P>
<P>
   Units of riot police and British army helicopters kept watch
from a distance over Protestant crowds blocking roads. Each protest
ranged in size from a few dozen to several hundred. Some were
composed mostly of women and children, while others had a more
threatening air, with anti-Catholic terrorists among the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   British army bomb-disposal experts investigated a car that had
been hijacked and parked on a key overpass in north Belfast. The
alert forced a major highway to be closed for two hours before it
could be confirmed the car contained no explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Experts conducted a controlled explosion of a package left
outside the home of a Protestant member of the government-appointed
Parades Commission, which since 1998 has ordered restrictions on
traditional Orange Order demonstrations that pass near or through
Catholic areas. No explosives were found inside the package.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists driving to suburbs south of Belfast reported that
youths were trying to force people out of their cars. Successfully
hijacked vehicles were soon burning in Protestant parts of north
Belfast, too.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the Protestant leader of Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing government and an Orangeman himself, warned that
anyone committing violence this week ''will only bring dishonor and
disgrace on the cause they profess to support.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who rose to prominence in 1995 by championing the right
of Orangemen to continue parading annually through the main
Catholic section of Portadown, today argues that the town's Orange
leaders should drop their refusal to enter direct negotiations with
the Parades Commission and Garvaghy Road protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say this is the only way in which the issue will be
resolved,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Orange parades scheduled for Wednesday -- the 310th
anniversary of the triumph of Protestant King William of Orange
over his Catholic foe, James II -- also have been ordered to stay
away from predominantly Catholic villages and the Lower Ormeau
enclave of south Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak critic resigns from oversight council  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A leading critic of Amtrak resigned Monday
from a panel that oversees the national railway, accusing Amtrak
officials of stonewalling requests for information on its financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Vranich, who once was an Amtrak spokesman, also alleged
the railway is adding ''pork-barrel trains to the districts or home
towns of politically connected officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Vranich resigned from the Amtrak Reform Council, an independent
watchdog panel, but directed his complaints at the railway.
</P>
<P>
   Vranich said Amtrak ''disguises the nature and extent of its
losses through bogus accounting methods'' and refused to provide
the council with information about the cost of starting new freight
services and details on labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Amtrak has not been honest about the fiscal
implications of delays in the start of high-speed ''Acela Express''
service between Boston and Washington, D.C. The service, originally
scheduled to begin at the end of 1999, has been delayed until at
least August because of design and testing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Citing two new routes in the home state of Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, chairman of Amtrak's governing board, Vranich said Amtrak
is adding trains that are slow, unattractive or designed to appease
politicians rather than improve service.
</P>
<P>
   ''This so-called market-based network analysis is one huge
boondoggle,'' Vranich said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Jewell, a spokesman for Thompson, called Vranich's
accusation ''absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Thompson and the other members of the board are
committed to turning Amtrak around - apparently unlike Mr. Vranich,
who throws his hands up the air and throws pot shots on his way out
the door,'' Jewell said.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak spokesman Bill Schulz said Vranich proved himself unable
to be objective about Amtrak, so ''it's probably best for the ARC
that he is no longer with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak Reform Council Chairman Gil Carmichael said he shares
some of Vranich's frustrations but does not believe the council's
work has been impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the council in 1997, when it gave Amtrak five
years to wean itself from annual federal operating subsidies. The
council's mission is to keep track of the railroad's progress
toward self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the council released an initial report questioning
some of Amtrak's accounting methods. Amtrak maintained that some
costs, like equipment depreciation, should not be counted against
its bottom line because the government pays for them.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said the council will continue to be independent but
supportive of Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope Amtrak will reach self-sufficiency by 2002, and as long
as I'm chairman, I'm going to give them every benefit of the doubt
in order to make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vranich is the fourth person to resign from the 11-person
council since its formation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, appointed by former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich as the panel's first chairperson, resigned
after a few months to protest Congress' refusal to let the panel
hire its own consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Monin, a labor union representative, resigned his seat
earlier this year, as did Democratic consultant Donald Sweitzer.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Seeks 'Heritage' Control  </HEADLINE>
By MARCELO BALLVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- As foreign cosmetic and drug
companies race to exploit the biological riches of the Amazon,
Brazil is belatedly taking steps to protect what it calls the
country's ''genetic heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a decree the government issued in late June, a new council
linked to the office of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso must
approve all research and commercial use of ''biological material''
-- every living thing in Brazil, from trees to bacteria. Foreign
companies must share any royalties from the marketing of natural
resources with the government and local institutions. Those that
violate the decree face stiff fines.
</P>
<P>
   The new decree is about more than environmental protection: It's
also about money.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon rainforest spreads over 2 million square miles and
contains an abundance of animal and plant species. Pharmaceutical
and cosmetic companies see it as a cornucopia of everything from
new perfume fragrances to antibiotics and disease cures, and
Brazil's government wants to make sure it gets a piece of the
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing, no regulating mechanism before this, and we
needed it to prevent controversies about research agreements,''
said Ana Cristina Kauffman, spokeswoman for Bioamazonia, a research
group created by the government last year to focus on Amazon
development.
</P>
<P>
   The government decree was a reaction to criticism of a recent
agreement between Bioamazonia and Novartis Pharma AG, a Swiss
pharmaceutical company. The deal allowed the Swiss company to
develop drugs from up to 10,000 samples of fungi and bacteria
collected in the Amazon rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also allowed them to take samples out of the
country, an accord that now will be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and politicians said Bioamazonia, which is
linked to the government but operates independently, was selling
off genetic wealth. They complained that the Swiss company was
allowed to develop its drugs without the participation of Brazilian
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said that before the decree was issued, Novartis Pharma
agreed to pay $4 million to Bioamazonia and share 1 percent of
royalties from any drugs developed, though the patents would remain
in Brazilian hands. That deal is now suspended while a Bioamazonia
internal committee reevaluates it.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, meanwhile, are complaining about the
decree: They say the government now has virtually total control
over commercial use of the Amazon, leaving ecologists and Indian
groups out of the decision-making. Critics fear the new council
will be controlled by political and commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presidential decree disregards years of debate on the
issue in the congress and in society,'' said a joint statement
signed by private environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nilo Diniz, a spokesman for Sen. Marina Silva, an Amazon native,
said the decree allows the council to authorize the commercial
exploration of biological resources on Indian lands without their
consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indians should have the right to decide what is done with
their own property,'' Diniz said.

<HEADLINE> Scheduling of former porn star's extradition hearing delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) - Former X-rated film star Kathryn Gannon, wanted
in the United States on insider trading charges, will wait two more
weeks to learn the date of her extradition hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, 31, appeared briefly in a Vancouver court on Monday as
her lawyer asked for a delay in setting the date for the hearing on
whether she will be sent to New York to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Patrick Dohm agreed to the request for more time and
scheduled a July 25 court appearance to determine when the
extradition hearing would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, known as ''Marylin Star'' in X-rated movies and
publications, was arrested in May in the lobby of her Vancouver
residence. She is free on $33,800 bail with travel restrictions,
but received permission Monday to go to Alberta for personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon was charged in December along with James McDermott Jr.,
the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, a
firm that specialized in bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott was convicted in April of securities fraud for giving
Gannon inside information, prompting her to allegedly buy six
stocks illegally. She was accused of then giving the information to
a third defendant, Anthony Pomponio, who also was convicted in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were having extramarital affairs with Gannon at the
time, lawyers in the case have said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio and Gannon allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police commercial crimes section in compliance with an
extradition request from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she could face up to 10 years in prison on the
most serious insider trading charges.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, and Pomponio, 45, are scheduled to be sentenced
July 17. Each could get up to 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Ellis, Abraham  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets signed defensive end
Shaun Ellis and linebacker John Abraham, the first two of the
team's unprecedented four first-round draft picks, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, from Tennessee, and Abraham, from South Carolina, were
selected 12th and 13th overall in April. Both will be in uniform
for the team's first training camp workout Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, 6-foot-5, 280 pounds, signed a five-year deal worth
$8.175 million. He received a $2.175 million bonus and the third
and fourth years of the deal are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In his rookie season, Ellis will have a base salary of $800,000.
That will escalate to $975,000 in 2001, $1.175 million in 2002,
$1.375 million in 2003 and $1.575 million in 2004. He also has
$100,000 worth of workout bonuses through the life of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who like Ellis is expected to boost the Jets' weak pass
rush, received a $7.055 million five-year contract, with a $2
million signing bonus. His base salary for this season is $740,000,
and Abraham will earn $900,000 next year, then $1,085 million,
$1.275 million and $1.455 million. Like Ellis, Abraham has $100,000
worth of workout bonuses in the deal and is 2002 and 2003 salaries
are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Shaun and John, we have explosive players who add a lot
to our defense,'' coach Al Groh said. ''They both have the ability
to get after the quarterback and they possess the size, which is
important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Anthony Becht of West Virginia, drafted 27th overall,
signed in May. New York's only unsigned rookie is 18th overall
selection Chad Pennington of Marshall, rated the top quarterback in
the draft.

<HEADLINE> Bartow Retires As UAB Athletic Dir.  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Gene Bartow retired as UAB's athletic
director Monday, fighting back tears as he announced his decision
at the basketball arena named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there's no good time for something like this, I have
concluded that it's indeed time,'' said Bartow, wearing a tie in
the school colors of green and gold.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Bartow built UAB's basketball program from
scratch in 1977 after coaching at Memphis State and following John
Wooden at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got it all off and running,'' university president Ann
Reynolds said. ''He is our movie star. Everyone has heard of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartow held the dual role of basketball coach and athletic
director for 18 years. He turned over the job of basketball coach
to his son, Murry, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As athletic director, Bartow led the way as UAB was transformed
from a 10-year-old urban campus with no sports program to a
Division I-A member of Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds hopes to hire Bartow's successor by the time his
retirement takes effect Aug. 31. Football coach Watson Brown wants
the next AD to be a lot like Bartow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to see through some of the things he
envisioned,'' said Brown, hired by Bartow in 1995 to lead the
football program, which started as a club team 11 years ago and is
now Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   Bartow led UCLA to the Final Four in 1976, the year after Wooden
retired. He was hired by UAB the next year to construct a
basketball program where none existed.
</P>
<P>
   UAB made it to the NCAA round of 16 in 1980, its second season
with a team. Bartow led the Blazers to the final eight the next
year with a record of 25-6, his best season at UAB.
</P>
<P>
   Bartow plans to keep his home in Birmingham, but he may spend
time in San Diego or Memphis, where he led Memphis State to the
Final Four in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really have a thing, but I'm really not ready to quit
working,'' he said. ''I (just) think it's time for somebody younger
and more energetic here.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Fred Lane Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Fred Lane was remembered Monday by his
former NFL teammates and coaches for an unabashed running style on
the football field and a penchant for locker-room pranks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a lot of fun,'' Carolina Panthers offensive line coach
Tony Wise said at a church visitation for Lane, 24, who was shot to
death last week. ''He and I used to rib each other a lot in
practice. He just had a great attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Panthers head coach Dom Capers, linebackers coach Sam
Mills, cornerback Doug Evans and several other members of the team
were among about 500 mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kid had a chance to do something special,'' offensive
tackle Clarence Jones said outside the church. ''I'm disappointed
he won't ever get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane, the Panthers' career rushing leader who joined the
Indianapolis Colts this offseason, was killed Thursday inside his
home on the city's south side. Police said Lane's wife, Deidra,
shot him, but no charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   He will be buried Tuesday in his hometown of Franklin, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Capers spent a few moments at the open casket before talking to
other mourners inside University Park Baptist Church. Visibly
shaken, he declined to comment as he walked to his car.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mourners were fans, including one young man who
entered the church wearing Lane's No. 32 Panthers jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Football fans just loved him,'' said Walter Truesdale, who
called himself a friend of Lane. ''He was an all-around great guy
with the million-dollar smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane did not attend the visitation.

<HEADLINE> Estate Tax Repeal Said Facing Veto  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Senate Republicans gear up for debate on
repealing inheritance taxes, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is
warning that the measure is far too costly and faces a certain veto
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Summers estimated the 10-year revenue cost to the government of
repealing the federal estate tax will be $750 billion after it
takes full effect in 2010 -- seven times its cost during a gradual
phaseout from 2001 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be the most back-loaded piece of major tax
legislation ever,'' Summers wrote in an opinion piece published
Monday by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   This exploding cost in the later years, Summers added, ''would
come early in the next decade just as the baby boomers start to
retire. The result would be reduced pay-down of the debt, increased
interest rates and reduced investment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Summers said the bill would siphon away resources
needed to ensure the future solvency of Social Security and
Medicare, could reduce charitable giving by $6 billion a year from
people who now seek to avoid the tax and would mainly help the very
richest 2 percent of families in America.
</P>
<P>
   That message was reinforced Monday by Clinton in a speech to a
gathering of governors in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''One-tenth of 1 percent of the American people would get half
the benefits of the bill,'' the president said. ''Now, if you're
philosophically opposed to the estate tax, then it's just a matter
of principle, but if it's a matter of economics, and you're
sympathetic with small businesses and family farmers, there's a way
to get this done for much less money.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans can overcome some procedural hurdles in the
Senate this week, they will send the full repeal bill to Clinton
and dare him to veto it. Even if they cannot override the veto, GOP
leaders hope the measure's political popularity will work to their
advantage in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are just genuinely unhappy about it,'' said Sen.
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who
added the issue often comes up at meetings with voters. ''They want
some action. There's no issue that seems to bring more applause
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of complete repeal, Summers said the Senate should
consider a less costly alternative to the House-passed bill that
would concentrate tax relief on small businesses and farmers -- the
groups Democrats and Republicans alike say are most in need of
help. House Democrats proposed raising exemptions for those groups
and their Senate counterparts are working on a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet repealing the tax is drawing significant support from
Democrats, 65 of whom supported it in the House. Nine Democrats
signed on as co-sponsors to a similar Senate bill -- some of them in
difficult re-election races where taxes are a critical issue -- but
leaders are hoping they will opt for the less costly version.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can do it for a lot less than $750 billion,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also want to use the estate tax debate to stage votes
on some of their major issues, such as amendments that would create
a Medicare prescription drug benefit and tax credits for tuition
and long-term health care. The key hurdle could be a GOP attempt to
limit amendments and debate -- which requires 60 votes in favor --
unless a deal is struck with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't worked it out yet but that is always a
possibility,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thirteen charged in casino cheating scam  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Thirteen people have been charged in
a casino cheating scam that relied on the complicity of a dealer,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   State Police found out about the cheating plan in advance and
arrested all 13 on Thursday as they carried it out at the Claridge
Casino Hotel, according to Katherine Lyons, a spokeswoman for the
state Division of Gaming Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dealer, five of the other suspects work in
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, all but two of whom are Vietnamese, sent two
''recorders'' - gamblers - into a Mini-Baccarat pit to place small
bets and keep track of the cards dealt, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   The two, Kevin Dung Ly, 32, of Somers Point, and Dong Minh Pham,
34, of Atlantic City, quit when the time came for dealer Tam Nhut
Ho, 29, of Brigantine to shuffle the cards.
</P>
<P>
   But Ho allegedly faked shuffling, leaving the deck intact. Nine
of his alleged co-conspirators then began playing, using their
knowledge of the cards already dealt to figure out which ones were
likely to be dealt next, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Then they bet up to $3,000 per hand, winning more than $100,000,
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police assigned to the state Division of Enforcement
focused on the suspects because some had been the target of
cheating investigations before, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a pretty elaborate scam. Unfortunately, there are
dealers who want to try to work with people and make a quick buck.
Hopefully, we can weed them out by catching them before they do it,
like we did in this case,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged mastermind was Ky Van Pham, 47, of Brigantine.
</P>
<P>
   The casino employees involved were: Hung Ham Tran, 39, of
Northfield, and Pete J. Hoag, 20, of Brigantine, both valets at
Trump Taj Mahal; Hung Vu Do, 28, of Atlantic City, a valet at
Resorts Atlantic City; Tuan Kiet Le On, 34, of Vienna, Va., a
Bally's Park Place food server; and Quan M. Hguyen, 21, of
Northfield, a Tropicana Casino Resort dealer.
</P>
<P>
   All 13 were charged with theft by deception and conspiracy. Each
crime carries penalties of up to 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries to Force Tax Cut Veto  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans intend to pass
marriage penalty tax relief on a politically inspired schedule that
requires President Clinton to sign or veto the measure on the eve
of the GOP National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP aides said Monday they hope a veto would give them
an issue for the campaign to come, while a presidential signature
would blunt charges of a ''Do-Nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats expressed confidence that Clinton
would veto the GOP's stand-alone tax cut bill for married couples,
who often are obliged to pay more in taxes than if they were
single. Instead, the Democrats are expected to support a smaller
measure targeted more directly to low- and middle-income working
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Democrats will couple that proposal with suggestions
that the leftover funds be used on politically popular issues such
as a prescription drug benefit under Medicare or tax breaks for
long-term care insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the Republicans are doing is instead of working with
Democrats on a compromise that could ... actually get signed, they
are pushing through an unworkable bill that the president will
veto...,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed the issue during the day before the nation's
governors in comments that made no mention of a veto. Instead, he
noted, ''I asked Congress to bargain with me,'' offering to sign
their marriage penalty tax cut if they would approve a Medicare
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress just back from a weeklong break, the struggle over
tax relief for married couples is one of several issues likely to
occupy lawmakers' time in the three-week prelude to the GOP
convention, which opens July 31 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also laboring over spending bills needed to fund
the government for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Senate
began debate during the day on a bill to finance the Interior
Department and other agencies, and the House turned to a measure
for the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi
has said action is likely on House-passed legislation to grant
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are hoping to advance a second major tax cut to
the White House. This one would phase out the estate tax. Democrats
broke ranks over that measure when it cleared the House last month,
and passage in the Senate appears likely. Clinton has pledged a
veto, however.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for the marriage penalty tax cut drama was set last
spring, when Republican leaders made room in their budget for two
tax cuts to move through Congress under rules that sharply restrict
debate time and limit amendments. One, to be acted on in the fall,
is reserved for year-end bargaining with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The other consists of the marriage penalty measure, and will be
served up to the Democrats on a take-it-or-leave basis, Republicans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparring on the issue began as soon as lawmakers returned to the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at the GOP marriage penalty and estate tax cut bills,
Daschle said Republicans were ready for a ''trillion dollar week''
while ignoring Democratic priorities such as a patients bill of
rights, an increase in the minimum wage, Medicare prescription
drugs and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., a prominent advocate of reducing
the marriage penalty, noted that the House had passed a bill last
spring with the unanimous backing of Republicans and the support of
four dozen Democrats. Only Democratic stalling in the Senate, he
said, kept the bill from passing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton and Al Gore have paid lip service to eliminating
the marriage penalty and they've offered token relief that would
help very few,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the political implications, he added, ''Clearly if a
bipartisan vote places this on the president's desk, it's going to
be hard for him to justify why he should veto it.''
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to approve the measure Wednesday, and GOP
leaders hope for Senate action by week's end. One timetable calls
for the two versions of the bill to be reconciled quickly and the
final compromise sent to the White House early next week. Michele
Davis, a spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas,
said the goal was to get the bill to Clinton's desk by ''Monday
night so the 10 day window ends before convention starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution allows a president 10 days to sign or veto a
bill -- Sundays excluded -- starting from its arrival at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   A second, slightly slower timetable, calls for sending the
measure to the White House a few days later. That would allow
Republicans to talk about Clinton's choice during their convention.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Now Wants To Stay With Cubs  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sammy Sosa wants to stay in Chicago for the rest
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Or through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe through only this year.
</P>
<P>
   A day after telling the Chicago Cubs he would veto any trade
attempt, the star outfielder gave various positions on his future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to stay in Chicago,'' Sosa said Monday. ''They're
beautiful fans. They're beautiful people. They love baseball. I'm
looking forward to staying in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, thinking about the contract extension he
wants, his position shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't take care of me after this year is over, I'll
probably finish next year and go to another place,'' Sosa said.
''If they have a future with me, they'll close the deal. If not,
I'll probably go to another place.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a chance he would approve a trade during the
offseason -- if it's the right deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really have to wait until the year is over the find out the
whole situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, whose $42.5 million, four-year contract expires after the
2001 season, had wanted the Cubs to either give him a contract
extension now or trade him. Chicago had no intention of extending
his contract at the price Sosa wanted: $15 million to $20 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Following the collapse of trade talks with the New York Yankees,
Sosa's agents, Tom Reich and Adam Katz, told Cubs president Andy
MacPhail on Sunday that their client would block any deals. As a
10-year veteran who's been on the same club for the last five
years, he has that right.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa then would become eligible for free agency after the 2001
season and the Cubs would get nothing if he left.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa wouldn't say if the Cubs' refusal to extend his contract
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think now was maybe the right moment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Army Unveils $600M Education Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soldiers who choose the Army over school will
soon be able to spend evenings in their bunks working for a college
or technical degree.
</P>
<P>
   A new $600 million Army education program, designed to attract
and keep recruits while creating a more wired Army, will provide
laptop computers, printers and terminals in barracks to hook up via
the Internet to a worldwide online learning system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really important for recruiting, for retention and to
help educate the more technologically savvy soldiers that our
country is going to need in the 21st century,'' Army Secretary
Louis Caldera said in an interview on the new program unveiled
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, Navy and Air Force all are falling behind in
recruitment goals while enrollment at post-high school institutions
is skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Army University Access Online plan reflects the fact that
higher education, not the hot civilian job market, has become
military recruiter's chief competitor, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for educational institutions, Internet companies and
computer software and hardware companies to submit contract
proposals for classes that would come online as early as January.
Funding for the first year is budgeted at $48 million, with another
$550 million over the next five years, the Army said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, 1 million soldiers, other Army employees and family
members are expected to enroll in the system, which will include
tuition grants and Army-supplied or subsidized computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One aim is to keep and attract more young men and women by
offering the chance to earn a degree during a four-year enlistment,
making the Army an option for education rather than an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet, soldier students are expected to be able to
enroll in a wide variety of schools and keep up with their studies
no matter where they are based.
</P>
<P>
   Some soldiers also may use their laptops on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''We operate in an environment of network-centered battlefields
and digital communication,'' Caldera said, adding that the nature
of modern military duty also requires a broader education.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in very ambitious, thorny missions that require a
pretty good understanding of human behavior, psychology, history,
culture, religion and different kinds of fighting, peace keeping
and peace enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the military would make up for the lost time soldiers
might spend studying, Caldera said he's already talked to the
Army's sergeants about allowing more study time, and soldiers would
be expected to use their free time as well.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 Army personnel gain college or technical degrees
each year, with the military paying 75 percent of their tuition.
Nearly 100,000 are enrolled in some kind of class.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said that in issuing contracts for the system, the Army
would take advantage of its marketing power to drive prices down
for soldiers, so family member can also be included. He said the
plan is to have an open system that allows a large number of
universities, colleges, technical schools, computer learning
centers and other institutions to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the private in the infantry should have an e-mail account
and become information-age capable,'' Caldera said. ''It's a
misconception that all the Army is about is crawling in the mud.''

   HAVANA (AP) -- A pro-democracy group in Cuba said Monday it will
reach out to grass-roots groups in Cuba and the United States to
build popular support for a rapprochement between the two estranged
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A committee will be formed ''to handle new and greater points of
understanding and communication between both nations and to
collaborate with both states in the removal of the obstacles that
impede a positive and respectful rapprochement,'' the Reflective
Roundtable of the Moderate Opposition said in a document read at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundtable said it will contact other members of Cuba's tiny
civil society -- opposition groups, churches and professional
organizations not controlled by the government -- to stimulate
public discussion on rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would also deliver a copy of their proposal to
the U.S. Interests Section, which represents American interests in
the absence of formal relations, to be shared with interested
groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from distributing its proposal and getting people talking,
the group did not say what kind of concrete steps it was prepared
to take to push the two countries to resume normal relations, which
ended after Cuba's 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   A center-left group of intellectuals who favor gradual reform,
the Roundtable first emerged publicly last year when it presented a
detailed plan for communist Cuba to make a peaceful transition to
democracy and a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it has taken a low-key, intellectual approach to
opposition, calling for change primarily by drafting and
distributing documents. The Roundtable is considered more moderate
and thoughtful than many of the other small opposition groups here,
and it has not tried to draw attention by holding public protests,
fasts or the like.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundtable is technically an illegal organization because it
operates without government authorization, but it appears to have
been tolerated up to now.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 11; Nasdaq Loses 43  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Stocks were mixed in a quiet session Monday as
investors moved cautiously in advance of second-quarter earnings
reports that will begin in earnest later this week. High-tech
issues fell amid profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.60 to 10,646.58, while
the Nasdaq composite index slipped 42.91 to 3,980.29.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.28 to 1,475.62.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of waiting and watching until corporate
earnings announcements hit full stride the end of this week,'' said
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, the first Dow component to release second-quarter
results, reported profits that were 2 cents per share above Wall
Street expectations. Investors rewarded the aluminum producer,
sending its stock up $2.063 to $29.688.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold technology stocks after a brief run-up last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was some healthy profit-taking with the techs,'' said Bryan
Piskorowski, a market analyst with Prudential Securities. ''It's
earnings season now and these companies have to either put up or
shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft slipped $2.563 to $79.438 and Intel fell $1.50 to
137.813.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, scheduled to release its earnings on Tuesday, fell $6.50
to $110.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were still digesting a positive jobs report from the
government on Friday. The report gave the latest evidence that the
U.S. economy is slowing in response to the Federal Reserve's six
interest rate increases since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for
the next few months. While that's good news for investors who were
unnerved earlier this year by the Fed's actions, there is still a
great deal of concern in the market that the cumulative effect of
the rate hikes will mean a drop in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers that have been battered in 2000 due to slowing sales
had a turnaround Monday after Prudential Securities upgraded its
rating on several downtrodden merchants. Best Buy rose $3.375 to
$74.125, Gap was up $2.375 to $37.875 and Home Depot gained $2.375
to $57.75.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Monday's early announcement by JDS Uniphase, a big
fiber-optics company, that it was buying rival SDL for $41 billion,
sent JDS tumbling $15.063, or 13 percent to $101.125. SDL rose
$25.375, or 9 percent, to $320.688.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating of computer chip maker
Applied MicroDevices, which rose $2.125 to $84.125.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a five to three margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.01
billion shares, down slightly from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 2.61 to 530.83.
</P>
<P>
   In overseas trading, the Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1
percent, Germany's DAX index was up 0.26 percent, Britain's FT-SE
100 was down 0.48 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Africa Fuels Wars  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOME, Togo (AP) -- Rich in diamonds and oil, Africa is being
plundered of raw materials that fuel wars and are ''now the source
of all our misery,'' U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an impassioned speech at the opening of an Organization of
African Unity Summit in Togo's capital, Annan handed out blame and
praise to the world's poorest continent -- the only region, he said,
where ''conflicts are not decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who is from Ghana, also reserved harsh criticism for the
so-called ''global economy,'' which he said cared little for the
welfare of Africans and was only interested in the continent's
abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Civil wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and Congo were spurred in
part by rebels' trade in diamonds that eventually end up in Western
markets.
</P>
<P>
   These riches, ''instead of being exploited for the benefit of
the people, have been so mismanaged and plundered that they are now
the source of our misery,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he added that Africans bear much of the responsibility for
the deterioration of the continent's security and the withdrawal of
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not something others have done to us,'' Annan said.
''It is something we have done to ourselves. If Africa is being
bypassed, it is because not enough of us are investing in policies
which would promote development and preserve peace,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Young people in Africa see their countries going backward, he
said, citing a litany of the continent's ills.
</P>
<P>
   --Africa has almost half of the world's refugees and internally
displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   --It is the world's poorest continent and sits at the bottom of
the U.N.'s Human Development Report on quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   --Africa has 33 of the world's 48 least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also called on Africans to forge stronger economic and
security links similar to the European Union. He proposed that
Africans could similarly unite through an ''African Oil and Diamond
Community'' to administer resources that are the ''sinews of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Secretary-General also noted ''hopeful stories'' that he
said should inspire Africans and outsiders including AIDS reduction
in Senegal and Uganda, and flourishing democracies in many African
countries.

<HEADLINE> HOLD FOR RELEASE until 12:01 a.m. Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Long before the Piper Saratoga that John F.
Kennedy Jr. was piloting crashed off Martha's Vineyard on the hazy
night of July 16, 1999, Jackie Kennedy Onassis feared her son would
die in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the latter years of her life, Jackie had a recurring
premonition that John would be killed piloting his own plane. She
pleaded with Maurice (Tempelsman, her longtime companion) to do
whatever it took to keep John from becoming a pilot,'' says a new
book, ''The Day John Died,'' which chronicles the details
surrounding the fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   Although she encouraged her son to take chances - and he had
numerous brushes with disaster - his mother could not stand the
thought of his piloting a plane, says the book by Christopher
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   It also says that an American Airlines passenger jet changed its
course to avoid a collision with Kennedy's plane that evening, that
Kennedy and his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy had worked out the
difficulties in their marriage and were ready to have a family, and
that as early as January 1997 Kennedy had expressed an interest in
running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by New York's Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not follow through because he feared his wife might
not be able to stand the pressure of a heated political campaign,
it says.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, whose book is being released Tuesday by publisher
William Morrow, said it is based on interviews with hundreds of
family members, friends, classmates, teachers, co-workers,
neighbors, lovers, fellow aviators and employees, as well as
photographers and journalists who covered the Kennedy family over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   It is the final chapter of his Camelot trilogy, which also
includes ''Jack and Jackie'' (1996) and ''Jackie After Jack''
(1998). It also follows his similarly framed 1998 book on Princess
Diana, ''The Day Diana Died.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls Sunday to Kennedy's cousin, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, and to
Sen. Ted Kennedy, the traditional spokesman for the Kennedy family,
were not immediately returned. Andersen said John's sister,
Caroline Kennedy, and the family of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy did
not agree to be interviewed for the book.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who watched the days of media coverage surrounding
Kennedy's death last year, most of the material is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   There's the flawed weather report Kennedy saw on the Internet,
indicating that the weather was good when it was not. There's pilot
Kyle Bailey, who says he was the last to see Kennedy, his wife and
her sister Lauren as they took off from Essex County Airport in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the huge shrine of flowers, cards and other gifts
left outside Kennedy's TriBeCa loft at 20 North Moore Street. And
the private star-studded funeral on Manhattan's Upper East Side,
and Caroline Kennedy's wan smile and wave to the waiting masses on
Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the book's 60 photographs, tracing John's years as a
toddler in the White House through his days as a Manhattan golden
boy and magazine founder, are also etched in the public psyche:
Little John Kennedy peeping out from under President Kennedy's desk
in the Oval Office, his famous salute at his father's funeral, the
tabloid headline ''The Hunk Flunks'' about his failed bar exam, the
1995 unveiling of his magazine, ''George,'' and the photo of
Kennedy and his ethereal bride leaving the humble Georgia church
where they were wed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing I want to do is to set the record straight,''
Andersen said Sunday. ''First, there have been a lot of rumors and
stories that divorce was imminent. I found absolutely no evidence
of that. They had gone through a period of crisis and were through
the other end. They were on the verge of starting a family of their
own,'' he said. ''I also found no evidence behind rumors that
Bessette had a drug problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a lot of posthumous character assassination.
But I'm a warts-and-all biographer and if John had any character
flaws, I couldn't find them,'' he said. ''If anything, the surprise
was that people seemed more upset about John's death than I had
realized. More people burst into tears during interviews than you
can imagine. It is all just so painfully tragic.''

<HEADLINE> Irvington police officer gets 10 months for 'riding shotgun' for drug dealers </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An Irvington police officer was sentenced
Monday to 10 months in prison by a judge who rejected a government
motion that could have kept the disgraced cop from serving jail
time.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Clark said the officer, Wendell
Huggins, cooperated with investigators when his crimes came to
light.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the cooperation was certified in a letter to the
judge that remains sealed, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation allows U.S. District Judge William H. Walls to give
a lesser sentence than the guidelines for a crime. Huggins faced
six to 12 months under the guidelines, and his lawyer, Anthony J.
Fusco Jr., asked for no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Walls sternly refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe ... that this defendant should be, in effect,
applauded for violating his oath of office,'' Walls said. ''For me
to slap him on the wrist, as the government would have me do, I
simply will not do.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a police officer. He, in effect, rode shotgun for a drug
dealer,'' Walls said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would have given Huggins a reduced sentence if
the officer had faced a term longer than six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Walls also ordered Huggins to pay a $2,500 fine and repay $1,000
to prosecutors. He said he received that sum from drug dealers on
four trips in which he helped transport illegal drugs and money
from drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted providing protection against police interference
from November 1998 to February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, an officer for 10 years, is to surrender within 30 days
and is not eligible for parole. He was suspended without pay
earlier this year. Fusco said he would resign and lose his pension.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, 35, pleaded guilty in February to a single charge of
obstructing interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   His assistance to drug dealers operating in Essex County was
uncovered by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Huggins, agents were taping conversations he had with
at least one unnamed dealer, and watched Huggins drive a dealer and
pick up packages believed to contain drugs on several occasions,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   During one trip, on Feb. 18, 1999, Huggins and an unnamed person
discussed transporting heroin to other locations where it could
fetch a higher price, according to court papers filed by the FBI.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that were moving substantially or trading

Market.
</P>
<P>
NYSE
</P>
<P>
   Dole Food Co. Inc., up 12.50 cents to $15.688
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Dole juices and canned fruit posted
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, but results were down
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell International Inc., unchanged to $35
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Township, N.J.-based specialty chemicals and security
conglomerate is taking decisive actions to restore credibility,
said chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore, including
shedding 6,000 jobs. The stock took a hit recently when Honeywell
announced its second-quarter results would fall short of
expectations, but the company said Monday it is on track to meet
its reduced numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Geon Co., down $2.125 to $16.75
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland-based maker of vinyl compounds expects
second-quarter operating earnings to meet analysts' estimates. But
the company said operating results exclude charges for the closure
of an engineered films plant, the termination of a director pension
plan, and public debt financing costs.
</P>
<P>
NASDAQ
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys Inc., down 40.63 cents to $3.469
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based specialty retailer of consumer
entertainment electronics said it expects to report a loss for the
third quarter that is substantially lower than its $8.1 million
loss for the year-ago period. The company attributed the decline in
sales to the elimination of low-margin computers and home office
products and the de-emphasis of entry level offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Tenfold Corp., down $6.813 to $10.25
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City-based electronic business software company
said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of 1 cent to 3
cents a share, far below analysts forecasts. The results were lower
than expected due to a longer-than-anticipated sales cycle, higher
spending and delays in some existing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc., down $6.375 to $73.125
</P>
<P>
   Barron's said the Winston-Salem, N.C. based specialty donut
maker may be overpriced. The retro-trendy donut store chain may
face slowing sales and the fickle nature of consumer palates.

<HEADLINE> Parties seek candidates as convention dates approach  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Grousing that good candidates are hard
to find, state political leaders will meet over the next two weeks
to choose nominees for the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of seats for the state Legislature are going uncontested
or facing lackluster challenges. Party leaders in some
congressional districts are still trying to find opponents for
longtime incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats plan to hold their state convention Friday evening
at Southern Connecticut State University, to formally nominate U.S.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman to a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans plan to nominate Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano
to run against Lieberman. Their state convention is July 22 at
Sacred Heart University in Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   A June Quinnipiac College poll did not foreshadow much sizzle in
this race: Lieberman had about a 6-to-1 advantage over Giordano for
the November election.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any fireworks at the Democrats' annual meeting, it
they will revolve around a move by some party members to bar party
Chairman Ed Marcus from a fifth term. Efforts to oust Marcus
through party bylaws have failed before.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Paindiris, a Glastonbury lawyer who helped lead former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign in Connecticut, is trying to
change party rules so that the chairman is elected by the delegates
at the convention, rather than by the state central committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state convention's going to be very boring except for this
rules change,'' Paindiris said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said there will be a debate and a vote on the rule
change. He said he opposed the rule change, likening the current
system to the corporate world, where a board of directors elects
the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he has very much support. I don't think there's
any reason to try to do this,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' keynote speaker will be civil rights leader and
U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Other conventions at the local and district level will be held
over the next two weeks to put up candidates for Congress and the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3rd District U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a New Haven Democrat,
is without an announced challenger.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 2nd District Republicans nominated state Rep.
Robert Simmons of Stonington to run against U.S. Rep. Sam
Gejdenson.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP on Monday planned to anoint former Danbury Rep. Mark
Nielsen to try again to unseat U.S. Rep. Jim Maloney of the 5th
District.
</P>
<P>
   Former professional wrestler Bob Backlund was expected to get
the nod from Republicans in the 1st District to run against
one-term incumbent U.S. Rep. John Larson.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. Rep. Chris Shays was expected to get the Republican
Party's blessing to run again for the 4th District in Fairfield
County. The Democrats are supporting Stephanie Sanchez, a former
selectwoman from Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Nancy Johnson in the 6th District will face a
challenge from Watertown Councilman Paul Valenti. Her nominating
convention is scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats plan to hold district conventions for Congress on
July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Some races in the Legislature are marked by lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest of number of opportunities to take a seat under the
gold dome in Hartford are in Litchfield County, with the retirement
of many longtime state lawmakers including Senate Minority Leader
M. Adela Eads, R-Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were choosing state Senate candidates in district
conventions Monday. Most Republican committees planned to meet
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The most hotly contested House race is in the 36th District,
where Rep. Claire Sauer, D-Lyme, is retiring. Three Democrats and
three Republicans are vying for the seat which represents Chester,
Deep River, part of Essex, Lyme and part of Old Saybrook.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are holding a district convention Tuesday. Most
Republican committees meet July 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty civic-minded area,'' said Ronald Phillips, vice
chairman of the Lyme Democratic Town Committee.

<HEADLINE> Two stabbed in chest after crashing party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER , N.J. (AP) - Two Ocean County men were stabbed in
the chest after a group of party crashers got into a street fight
involving at least 20 people, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight began at about 2:15 a.m. Sunday after groups of
uninvited guests crashed a baptism party at Tommy's Restaurant,
police said. About 40 family members were in a dining hall of the
restaurant when a large group of people crashed the party,
according to police Lt. William Herkert.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts asked the party crashers to leave and the fight
erupted outside. Police said no fighting took place inside the
restaurant on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   At least one man flashed a knife during the fight, police said.
A folding knife was recovered at the scene, but police said a
security guard hired to patrol the party described the weapon used
in the stabbings as a kitchen knife.
</P>
<P>
   The guard also told police that some of the people were throwing
beer cans at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups scattered when the security guard called police.
Authorities said Monday it appears the men were stabbed after the
groups left the scene. Police said they haven't determined a motive
for the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   One man, identified as Juan Marin, 21, of Berkeley Township, was
taken to Community Medical Center with two stab wounds to the upper
chest at 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The other man, Antonio Ruiz, also 21 and of Berkeley Township,
was later found by Beachwood police and taken to Jersey Shore
Medical Center in Neptune. He was found near Route 9 and Anchor
Avenue in Beachwood, about a mile from the restaurant, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who are immigrants from Mexico, were to be released
from the hospital Tuesday, police said. It isn't clear if Marin and
Ruiz know the family that was hosting the party, Herkert said.
</P>
<P>
   Herkert said police brought in an interpreter to get statements
from witnesses because many of those at the restaurant speak
Spanish. Herkert said some witnesses may be reluctant to come
forward because they may be in the United States illegally.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two horror flicks were the box-office
surprises last summer. The surprise of the season so far this year
is the horror parody ''Scary Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The anything-goes gross-out comedy took in $42.3 million in its
opening weekend, the best debut ever for an R-rated movie and the
second-highest premiere this year, after ''Mission: Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and starring
his brothers Marlon and Shawn, also brought in more than two of
this summer's most anticipated movies did in their debuts last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney's ''The Perfect Storm'' opened over the busy
Fourth of July weekend with $41.3 million, and Mel Gibson's ''The
Patriot'' grossed $22.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood analysts had expected ''Scary Movie'' to top the box
office this weekend but had figured its take would be in the $30
million range.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it would be big,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office. ''I wasn't
surprised it was No. 1, but I was surprised at the sheer size of
its numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax distributed the movie that pokes fun at its own
''Scream'' franchise and other horror hits such as ''The Sixth
Sense'' and ''The Blair Witch Project. Co-chairman Bob Weinstein
said Miramax and Wayans tailored the movie for the broadest
possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the movie goes beyond the 'Scream' audience,''
Weinstein said. ''Comedy is a bigger genre than horror. Everybody
wants to go to the movies and laugh. It's like Keenen said, if it
gets a laugh, it's in the movie. If it doesn't, it's out.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie borrowed one critical thing from the three ''Scream''
movies. The first ''Scream'' originally was titled ''Scary Movie,''
but Miramax felt that name sounded too much like a spoof, Weinstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans' movie had been titled ''Scream if You Know What I Did
Last Halloween,'' but Miramax decided to appropriate ''Scary
Movie'' because it had wider appeal, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Since ''Scream'' in 1996, horror movies have had a resurgence.
''Scream 3'' topped the box office when it opened in February, and
last summer's horror hits included ''The Haunting'' and the
surprise blockbusters ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was perfect timing for 'Scary Movie,''' said Robert
Bucksbaum, a film analyst for Reel Source Inc. ''In the last few
years, we've seen just about everything we can in the horror genre,
and along comes a film that pokes fun at that and the whole
genre.''

<HEADLINE> Assault on family called random act of violence  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Guests, employees and the owner
of a motel where a woman was bound and raped, then held hostage in
a room with her children, say they're not afraid of more violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ernest Buffaloe, 23, of Camden, and a 14-year-old
boy from Gloucester Township broke into a room at the Howard
Johnson Express Inn late Saturday night, raped a Blackwood woman in
front of her two sons, ages 2 and 6, then held the family hostage.
When the father returned to the room, he also was bound.
</P>
<P>
   The family escaped after about 30 minutes, but the
hostage-takers barricaded themselves in the room for three hours
before surrendering, police said. They remained incarcerated
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have happened anywhere,'' Rose Anne Tomasello, head
of housekeeping, said Monday. ''It just happened to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gentile and his wife, Anne Neeley, both of New Orleans, stay
at the motel for a few days every summer while they visit their son
and grandson in nearby Erial. They chose it because it's the
safest, cleanest inn in the area, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's spooky, isn't it?'' Neeley said while lounging by the
motel pool. ''I always feel so safe up here, compared to living in
New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   But they said news of the attack didn't make them feel in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt it's going to be a regular thing,'' Gentile said.
''We're pretty careful in a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomasello said the housekeeping employees were not shaken by the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have any fears of someone lurking around. They're
not doing anything differently while they're cleaning the rooms,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the suspects had tried to break into at least one
other room on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Raj Parikh, who owns and operates the inn about 15 miles
southeast of Camden, said a security guard was on duty Saturday
night, as is the case every weekend night. He also said the
100-unit motel has chains, dead bolts and electronic locks on the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just have to take extra precautions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which was staying at the motel while looking for a
new place to live, had been there for about two months, Parikh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's break-in was the first incident to occur at the motel
on the Black Horse Pike since it opened 15 years ago, Parikh said.
He held a staff meeting Sunday to comfort his 15 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Miller, spokesman for the inn's parent company, Howard
Johnson International Inc., based in Parsippany, said the company
regrets the incident and is cooperating with law enforcement
officials in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Buffaloe and the teen were charged with robbery, aggravated
assault, sexual assault, kidnapping, conspiracy and cruelty to a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Buffaloe is being held at the Camden County Jail. Bail had not
been set Monday, and he had not been assigned a public defender, a
jail official said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffaloe was scheduled to be arraigned July 18 in state Superior
Court in Camden, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age suspect was taken to the Camden County Juvenile
Detention Center in Lakeland. He attended a hearing Monday morning,
at which it was determined that he should remain incarcerated, said
Gloucester Township Police Capt. Edward Smith.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Heating Oil Reserve  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton moved Monday to stockpile 2
million barrels of heating oil in the Northeast as politicians,
eying the November election, looked for political cover in event of
a repeat of last winter's sharp price spike in home heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil stocks are alarmingly low for this time of year as
refineries concentrate on pumping out as much gasoline as possible,
raising concern of another supply crunch in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the price of natural gas, which heats about
half of the nation's homes and is the primary heating fuel in the
Midwest, has doubled during the last year, causing many economists
to predict higher heating costs this winter across much of the
country just as voters head for the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters, Clinton criticized the Republican-led
Congress for failing to pass legislation creating a Northeast
heating oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is running out,'' Clinton said, explaining why he was
acting by executive order. '' ... If we don't do something now,
reserve stocks of heating oil may not be in place before the cold
weather comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP governors from the Northeast suggested the president
was thinking more about politics than heating concerns and
questioned why he did not create such a reserve long ago as
Northeast lawmakers have been demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can only be a political response because of the pressure
put on Al Gore,'' speculated New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman, who
has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic governors applauded the move. ''New England is
too dependent on heating oil and diesel to tolerate the price
volatility we saw last winter,'' said New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   While the peak heating season does not start until after
November, many suppliers begin stockpiling fuel in the fall, when
wholesale prices may already begin to go up if there are signs of
impending shortages, energy experts said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 37 million barrels of heating oil in inventory, about
half as much as last year at this time, said Gene Sperling, the
president's chief economic adviser. He said the administration also
was concerned about the rising natural gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   While prices have declined since last winter, wholesale heating
oil is selling for 84 cents a gallon, compared with 51 cents last
summer when stocks were high, the Energy Information Administration
says.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices, meanwhile, have doubled to their highest
levels in more than decade, averaging over $4 per thousand cubic
feet, compared with $2.12 a year ago, the EIA says. Even if there
isn't unusually cold weather, the price is predicted to go to $4.33
by December, causing many economists to anticipate sharply higher
heating prices.
</P>
<P>
   To address the heating oil problem, Clinton directed Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson to trade oil from the government's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve for 2 million barrels of refined
heating oil that will be put into Northeast storage tanks.
Officials said the goal is to have the fuel in place within 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the large oil
companies, expressed concern that the reserve ''could divert home
heating oil needed to build inventories'' in the coming months.
Administration officials discounted such concerns, saying the
amount needed for the reserve was small compared to overall
supplies. Sperling said the 2 million barrel amount was selected as
a ''delicate balance'' between providing a safety cushion, while
not disrupting private fuel stocks.
</P>
<P>
   However, senior administration officials said that without
congressional action, the fuel will not be available except for a
''severe energy disruption'' nationwide. Clinton urged Congress to
pass legislation formally authorizing the reserve and establishing
a trigger for the fuel's use in case of price spikes or local
supply problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House passed legislation that included
authorization to create a Northeast reserve to be used in case of
heating oil price spikes, but the Senate has not taken up the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Just as skyrocketing gasoline prices thrust energy issues into
the presidential campaign this summer, any surge in heating oil or
natural gas prices this fall could become a problem for Al Gore's
presidential campaign, political analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
   The winter heating crunch would hit hardest in the states Gore
considers pivotal if he is to defeat Bush: New York and
Pennsylvania in the Northeast and Illinois, Michigan and Ohio in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton raised the issue in her high-profile New
York Senate race, criticizing her GOP opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio,
for missing the House vote on the heating oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long criticized the Clinton administration of
being unprepared for last winter's heating oil price surge.
Richardson said in February that the government, and everyone else,
had been caught ''napping.''

<HEADLINE> Haitians Vote in Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Ex-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
has a fragile hold on Haiti's people, opposition leaders said
Monday, after revelations that fewer than 10 percent of voters went
to the polls in run-off legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition boycotted the elections, and opposition leaders
said the low turnout proved their call for a boycott was heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Although results are not likely for days, Aristide was expected
to emerge more powerful from Sunday's second-round vote for 44 of
83 Chamber of Deputies seats.
</P>
<P>
   His Lavalas Family party seems poised to control both houses of
Parliament, and Aristide is strongly favored to win the November
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The elections -- seen as crucial to reviving a decade's tortuous
experiment with democracy -- left a morass of recriminations, with
international observers and opposition parties claiming the
campaign and count were fraught with irregularities favoring
Lavalas.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed his ''regret''
Monday that Haitian authorities held the run-off vote ''without
having resolved the outstanding issues related to the first
round.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vote, candidates had to win a majority of 50 percent
plus one for a first-round victory -- but officials counted votes of
only the top four contenders in each race, yielding what observers
say were many false Lavalas victories.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department on Monday called the second-round vote
incomplete and inappropriate and said it was not too late for
Haitian authorities to reverse the course the elections had taken.
</P>
<P>
   No official participation figures were available Sunday -- but a
key Lavalas official conceded it was low.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd estimate the turnout at 5-10 percent,'' Lavalas spokesman
and Senator-elect Yvon Neptune told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The low turnout ... doesn't affect the validity of the
balloting,'' Neptune insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Evans Paul, an opposition leader, said the low turnout showed
that Lavalas in reality ''has a very small minority'' of support.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been plagued by flawed elections. The country's first
democratic vote in 1990 ended in chaos with no final count -- but
Aristide's landslide victory was not disputed. He was ousted in a
coup the following year and restored when the United States invaded
in 1994 to chase out a military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a functioning government since President Rene
Preval, Aristide's hand-picked successor, dissolved Parliament in
January 1999 to resolve an 18-month political deadlock. He has
ruled by decree since.
</P>
<P>
   The count in these latest elections gave Lavalas first-round
victories with 16 of 19 contested seats in the 27-seat Senate and
all 26 first-round wins in the 83-member Chamber of Deputies.
Counting for the others has not been completed or will be decided
in another run-off.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pinelands Commission members oppose Whitman appointee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman's office confirmed it
has directed the Pinelands Commission to hire a state official who
had been passed over for the commission's top staff job.
</P>
<P>
   But some commission members oppose the idea and may press to
bring it up before the full panel for a vote, according to a report
Monday in the Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime staff director Terrence Moore stepped down last fall
and the commission selected Annette Barbaccia, a former
environmental official in the New York mayor's office, to replace
him effective in August.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's staff subsequently directed the commission to create a
new administrative post for Robert A. Marshall, a lawyer in the
state attorney general's office who specializes in environmental
affairs. Marshall had been one of the finalists for the post given
to Barbaccia.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that several commission members opposed
hiring Marshall at a time when they cannot get funding for other
positions, and that they resented the interference from the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinelands Commission regulates development and land
preservation in the 1.1-million acre Pinelands National Reserve. Of
its 15 members, seven are appointed by the governor, seven by each
of the counties within the Pinelands' jurisdiction and one by the
U.S. Interior Secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman for Whitman, said the governor
wants Marshall hired despite the opposition of some members. ''The
governor still believes the position is necessary for the Pinelands
to live up to its fullest potential,'' she said, adding Marshall is
well-qualified.

<HEADLINE> US Cites Environmental Trade Rules  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration took step Monday
that will subject future trade agreements to tougher environmental
reviews, maintaining that free trade and environmental protection
can go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to trade and the environment we don't have to
choose one or the other,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said in releasing the draft guidelines that follow a
presidential executive order last fall.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in November directed the government to assess
the environmental impacts of future trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the administration was hoping to blunt criticism of
upcoming negotiations by the World Trade Organization in Seattle
aimed at launching a new round of global trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of demonstrators came to Seattle in December to
highlight their arguments that the WTO does not consider the impact
of trade agreements on the environment or worker rights. The WTO
discussions ended in failure when the 135 nations could not agree
on an agenda for a new round of trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Seligman, director of the Responsible Trade Program for
the Sierra Club, said the administration's procedures are a good
first step but did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration has clearly felt our pain and has decided
to do something about it,'' he said. ''But there are some major
holes in this proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligman said there is no requirement that the draft texts of
future trade agreements be released to the public, making it
''impossible for the public to provide adequate comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guidelines will be published Tuesday in the Federal
Register and the administration will seek public comment on them at
hearings Aug. 2 and 3 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Frampton Jr., acting chairman of the president's
Council on Environmental Quality, said the administration hoped to
have the new guidelines in place soon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that implementation of the November executive order
remains a ''high priority'' of both Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, who made the initial announcement that the administration
would require environmental reviews of future trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has come under
attack from environmental activists for his support of the
administration's trade liberalization policies.

<HEADLINE> Agent's Bond Hearing Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal court bond hearing for sports
agent William ''Tank'' Black was postponed a week.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who said through his lawyer that he is innocent, was
indicted last week on money laundering and drug charges by a grand
jury in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The sports agent, wearing a suit along with handcuffs and
shackles, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph McCrorey on Monday that
he wanted to continue the hearing for another week. His attorney,
John Hardaway, said the defense needed more time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Co-defendant Linda Wilson, Black's business partner, also
requested the continuance.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson operated World Express Travel Inc., a Columbia travel
agency which Black was chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Black hid drug dealers' money, moved drugs and
helped dealers hide out of the country. He is accused of laundering
$1.1 million and funneling it into a car title loan business.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Wilson also are charged with conspiracy and perjury.
Federal prosecutors say they plan to extradite the pair, who could
face as long as life in prison and $4 million in fines if convicted
of all counts.
</P>
<P>
   In another Florida case also pending trial, Black and others are
accused of stealing more than $5 million from about a dozen NFL
players. Black had been free on a $1 million bond in that case
before his latest arrest.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Duncan To Stay With Spurs  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Maybe the begging worked.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of pleas from fans to stay with their team,
free-agent forward Tim Duncan reportedly is ready to sign a new
deal with the San Antonio Spurs, spurning the Orlando Magic and the
opportunity to play with Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Sentinel and the San Antonio Express-News reported
Monday that Duncan's representatives told Orlando general manager
John Gabriel that Duncan will turn down the Magic's six-year, $67.5
million offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Babby, Duncan's attorney, flew to San Antonio on Monday and
met with Spurs officials. Contacted by The Associated Press, Magic
officials declined comment until Duncan made an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan will hold a news conference at 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday to
announce his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Duncan's decision to remain in San Antonio brought
welcome relief for Spurs fans, who had dotted the city in recent
weeks with billboards and placards reading: ''Stay Tim, Stay!''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety took off when the Magic made a hard push to lure
Duncan and Hill. Both players traveled to Orlando on the same
weekend and were treated to stays in one of the theme-park city's
top resort hotels and luxurious parties hosted by Magic executives.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan even got to meet Tiger Woods, who lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has said he will sign with Orlando. Had the Magic pulled
off the Duncan deal, Orlando would have had the juggernaut lineup
capable of tipping the balance of power in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic position, and the offer it makes, are unique. They
have the NBA's coach of the year in Doc Rivers and enough salary
cap room to sign two of the league's top free agents. Their future
includes nine first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   But there was pressure from the Spurs as well. Veteran center
David Robinson, who along with Duncan gives San Antonio the most
formidable front line in the league, cut short his vacation in
Hawaii to persuade Duncan to stay. The two guided San Antonio to
its first NBA title in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With the Spurs' aging lineup, the 24-year-old Duncan is
considered the key to San Antonio's future. Without him, the Spurs
would be left with a brand-new $175 million arena for the 2002-2003
season and without one of the game's superstars.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it appears Duncan's loyalty to the Spurs and his
desire to keep playing with Robinson won out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tim stayed at Wake Forest all four years,'' an NBA source told
the Express-News. ''He isn't a guy who likes a lot of change in his
life. He has played with David Robinson and for the same coach for
the past three years. But the Magic made it a difficult decision
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan could sign a seven-year deal worth $86.5 million if he
re-signs with San Antonio, although he is likely to sign a shorter
deal. Duncan has a nonbinding commitment to the Spurs and cannot
officially sign a contract with the team until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard anything,'' Spurs coach and general manager
Gregg Popovich said. ''He hasn't given me a hint this entire time.
I sure wish somebody would tell me something.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenged by Mideast Peace  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About to kick off a last-ditch summit,
President Clinton said Monday there is no more difficult conflict
in the world than the dispute he will try to settle between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to not
be distracted by his political woes at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really, I think, a matter of trying to come to grips
with the issues on the merits,'' Clinton said in an exchange with
reporters before flying to Pennsylvania for a governors'
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues have defied solution in the seven years since
Israel agreed to begin turning over territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   They range from the hot-button issue of Jerusalem, part of which
the Palestinians seek for a state but which Barak insists will
never be divided, to claims of Arab refugees to homes in Israel
from which they say they were ousted at Israel's founding a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has signaled a willingness to expand considerably the 40
percent of the West Bank that Israel already has agreed to
surrender and to abandon some settlements in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is holding out for
virtually all of the West Bank and sovereignty over part of
Jerusalem as the capital for a Palestinian state. He has vowed to
declare statehood if Israel does not agree to a state by
mid-September, the deadline the two sides have set for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak barely survived a no-confidence motion in the 120-member
Israeli parliament Monday. The opposition, anxious about his
projected concessions to Arafat on territory and Jerusalem,
outpolled the government, 54-52, but it could not muster the 61
votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, possibly referring to a recent poll, said a solid
majority of Israelis ''want him to come and want him to pursue
peace.'' In the same vein, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said the prime minister can make peace despite the defection of
three political parties from his government
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not going to make an agreement that jeopardizes his
people,'' Albright said in an Associated Press interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll published Sunday by the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, 52
percent of Israelis said Barak should go to the summit while 45
percent said he should stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, will be remaining in
Israel. Levy has served in both Likud and Labor governments, and is
considered a barometer of Israeli public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in a statement before his departure for the summit, told
the Israeli people that ''this is the time to take decisions and to
bequest a better future to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the negotiations would be ''heart-rending'' and that
''no deal is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality of life is highly complicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, nearing the end of an eight-year presidency in which he
has dealt with conflict in the Balkans, Ireland and the Persian
Gulf, said the Israeli-Palestinian dispute ''is perhaps the most
difficult of all the peace problems in the world, certainly dealing
with the most difficult issues of the whole Middle East peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Barak and Arafat both ''have the vision, the
knowledge, the experience and the ability and sheer guts to do what
it takes, I think, to reach an agreement, and then to take it back
to their people and see if they can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ''I am going to try to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement designed to bolster Barak's already considerable
confidence and resolve, Clinton said the prime minister was able to
negotiate with the knowledge the Israeli public would have the
final say in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the President said he hoped an overall settlement
could be reached within a few days. He is due to fly to Japan for
an economic conference with the leaders of seven other countries on
July 19.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton said the two sides already ''have a pretty
clear idea of what the various options are'' and 'it's not as if we
don't know what's out there to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he did not want to set ''an artificial deadline for
these talks,''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts doubt an agreement can be forged quickly,
particularly one that deals with the emotional issue of Jerusalem.
''My guess is you can't achieve an agreement in eight days,''
Samuel Lewis, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is going to have to be a tougher talker with Arafat
than he has been with other leaders,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Singer, a lawyer who helped draft the 1993 Oslo accords
that started Israel on the course of pulling back on the West Bank,
said Barak ''clearly does not have a majority in the Israeli
Knesset'' and if he had to get approval for the package he is
likely to propose to Arafat ''he would fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Shibley Telhami, a University of Maryland professor, said Arafat
''comes as a weak leader.'' Polls among Palestinians show declining
confidence in him, Telhami said. ''People doubt his ability to
deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has signaled a willingness to surrender most of the West
Bank, accept a Palestinian state and cut a deal over Jerusalem that
would give the PLO a toehold in the city.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Telhami said the Palestinians have made no
concessions on any of the core issues. And yet, he said, ''the
perception in the Arab world is that Arafat is giving away the
store.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, meanwhile, Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman
for the Palestinians, challenged the idea that both sides ''have to
give.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that would mean the Palestinians must violate
international law and their right to the land occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, Yael Tamir, minister of immigrant
absorpotion, said Israel was seeking ''as wide an agreement as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she told reporters at the Israeli Embassy, Arafat's demand
for sovereignty over part of Jerusalem ''is not a demand Israel is
going to accept.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition Faults Haitian Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Ex-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
has a fragile hold on Haiti's people, opposition leaders said
Monday, after revelations that fewer than 10 percent of voters went
to the polls in run-off legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition boycotted the elections, and opposition leaders
said the low turnout proved their call for a boycott was heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Although results are not likely for days, Aristide was expected
to emerge more powerful from Sunday's second-round vote for 44 of
83 Chamber of Deputies seats.
</P>
<P>
   His Lavalas Family party seems poised to control both houses of
Parliament, and Aristide is strongly favored to win the November
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The elections -- seen as crucial to reviving a decade's tortuous
experiment with democracy -- left a morass of recriminations, with
international observers and opposition parties claiming the
campaign and count were fraught with irregularities favoring
Lavalas.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed his ''regret''
Monday that Haitian authorities held the run-off vote ''without
having resolved the outstanding issues related to the first
round.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vote, candidates had to win a majority of 50 percent
plus one for a first-round victory -- but officials counted votes of
only the top four contenders in each race, yielding what observers
say were many false Lavalas victories.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department on Monday called the second-round vote
incomplete and inappropriate and said it was not too late for
Haitian authorities to reverse the course the elections had taken.
</P>
<P>
   No official participation figures were available Sunday -- but a
key Lavalas official conceded it was low.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd estimate the turnout at 5-10 percent,'' Lavalas spokesman
and Senator-elect Yvon Neptune told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The low turnout ... doesn't affect the validity of the
balloting,'' Neptune insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Evans Paul, an opposition leader, said the low turnout showed
that Lavalas in reality ''has a very small minority'' of support.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been plagued by flawed elections. The country's first
democratic vote in 1990 ended in chaos with no final count -- but
Aristide's landslide victory was not disputed. He was ousted in a
coup the following year and restored when the United States invaded
in 1994 to chase out a military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a functioning government since President Rene
Preval, Aristide's hand-picked successor, dissolved Parliament in
January 1999 to resolve an 18-month political deadlock. He has
ruled by decree since.
</P>
<P>
   The count in these latest elections gave Lavalas first-round
victories with 16 of 19 contested seats in the 27-seat Senate and
all 26 first-round wins in the 83-member Chamber of Deputies.
Counting for the others has not been completed or will be decided
in another run-off.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in shotgun killing returned to NJ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A former New Jersey man has been returned
to the Garden State to stand trial in a 1996 Mercer County shotgun
killing that occurred during a string of brothel robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Renford L. ''Gaudy'' Wilson, 23, formerly of Hamilton, was
arrested in the Bronx in April. Gov. Christie Whitman signed a
warrant Monday to have him returned to the state, Mercer County
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was identified as the triggerman in the October 29, 1996,
slaying of Leandro Rafael Garcia Hernandez, Mercer County
Prosecutor Daniel G. Giaquinto said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Wilson and three other men, Wigberto Gonzalez,
29, Roberto Flores, 23, and Kurt Richard Martin, 29, committed a
string of brothel robberies at the time Hernandez was killed. The
four encountered Hernandez at a bordello on South Cook Avenue in
Trenton during one of the robberies and Wilson shot him in the face
with a 12-gauge shotgun, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was on the run until his April 14 arrest. He was arrested
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The three men with Wilson have already pleaded guilty in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Giaquinto said Gonzalez and Flores pleaded guilty to aggravated
manslaughter. Gonzalez faces up to 20 years in prison. Flores faces
up to 18 years. Giaquinto said Martin pleaded guilty to
manslaughter and faces up to 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Ruling Party in Chaos  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's defeated ruling party was forced to
shut down its headquarters Monday when peasants stormed the
sprawling complex to demand the freedom of a jailed leader and a
voice in the party's future.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader, congressman Humberto Serrano, said his
supporters would bolt the party if the current leadership doesn't
pay more attention to grass-roots groups like his, and said Mexico
would ''heat up'' if the ruling party doesn't shed its bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Careful, very careful with the countryside,'' Serrano said.
''If the party doesn't take up the peasant causes, the workers'
causes, we're going to bury it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150 supporters, most of clad in dirty baseball caps and
dirty T-shirts, chanted anti-PRI slogans, and one sprayed dust from
a fire extinguisher, setting off a small stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials blocked off the main doors to the party
headquarters for several hours, saying ''there seems to be a
problem inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano finally met with some midlevel officials, who placed a
phone call to the governor of Morelos state, where the peasants are
from. Serrano said the governor promised to free the peasant
leader, jailed in a land dispute, by Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't keep his word, if he's making fun of us, the
next time we won't tell them what time we're coming or where we'll
be. Then this will get good,'' Serrano told the crowd of
enthusiastic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was sure the governor could free the leader if he
wanted to, because ''he appointed all the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The small protest highlighted one of the most pressing problems
for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which on July 2
lost its first presidential election ever. The party had held the
presidency since its formation in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly disenfranchised groups within the PRI have been
fighting for power amid the vacuum created by the loss in a party
where orders have always come straight from the president.
</P>
<P>
   A group of PRI governors and a few party officials have been
meeting to set a new agenda for the party. The two main feuding
camps are followers of Francisco Labastida, the defeated
presidential candidate, and those of Roberto Madrazo, the
charismatic southern governor who lost to Labastida in the party's
first primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's group supports Madrazo, who argues that the PRI return
to its roots. Labastida wants to continue the reforms of recent
years, which led to a more open, democratic party -- but which have
been blamed for the loss of power.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's supporters tore down Labastida flags that still
adorned the party headquarters.

<HEADLINE> China PM Arrives for EU Visit  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- China's prime minister paid the
first-ever visit by a Chinese leader to European Union headquarters
Monday, while his foreign minister said China would adopt U.N.
human rights treaties by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu Rongji met with Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt and King Albert as part of a tour of European capitals
aimed largely at building economic ties between China and the
15-member EU. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan met with EU
External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten.
</P>
<P>
   Patten, who was Britain's last Hong Kong governor, was keen to
talk about China's human rights record. EU officials said Tang told
him China would seek to ratify U.N. human rights treaties aimed at
improving economic standards and social conditions such as access
to education.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also met with Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy
representative to discuss EU-China relations, where human rights
was the main area of concern for Solana.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disagreement on human rights should not prevent the
continuation of the political dialogue,'' Solana said after his
half-hour talk with the Chinese premier. Solana stressed the
importance of continuing communication between the two and added
that more would be done by both sides in the near future to bring
them closer together.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 demonstrators gathered outside EU headquarters to
protest against China's policies in Tibet and human rights
infringements in China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1996 ''dialogue on human rights'' between the EU and
China, progress has been slow initiating reforms in China to
promote civil rights, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's 15-day tour of European capitals includes a four-day stop
in Brussels, and market opening is high on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between the EU and China has steadily increased since
1978, totaling $51 billion in 1998. The EU has become China's
second-largest export market, and China has become the EU's
third-largest trading partner after the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   China and the EU signed an agreement in Beijing in May on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which sets rules
for global trade. China is moving toward joining the group next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the world trade agreement, the EU Commission -- the EU's
executive body -- still says China's markets are not open enough.
The commission is keen to see speedier market-based reforms there.
</P>
<P>
   The EU already has pledged some $57 million in cooperation
agreements aimed at reforms in many Chinese sectors, including
transportation, high technology, energy, financial services and
telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> NJ rabbi resigns after article reports years-old abuse allegations  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey rabbi has resigned from a
leadership position at a prominent Jewish youth organization after
a weekly newspaper published allegations that he sexually and
physically abused several teen-agers under his care more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Baruch Lanner, 50, of Fair Lawn, left his job as director
of regions at the National Conference of Synagogue Youth last month
after the June 23 article in The Jewish Week, the nation's largest
Jewish weekly, was published, said officials with the Orthodox
Jewish youth group.
</P>
<P>
   The article quotes more than 10 men and women, now in their 30s
and 40s, who said Lanner kissed, fondled and slapped teen-age
girls, kicked boys in the groin and attacked one with a knife. They
said officials at the Orthodox Union, the New York organization
that operates the youth group, ignored repeated complaints about
Lanner's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Union, which has a membership of nearly 1,000
synagogues and is responsible for certifying kosher foods, began an
internal investigation of its own conduct after publication of the
article.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are terrible charges. We have to get to the bottom of
it,'' said Dr. Mandell Ganchrow, president of the Orthodox Union.
He said an independent commission would focus only on the Orthodox
Union's conduct, and not try to determine whether the charges
against Lanner are true.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner on Monday said he could not comment on the charges
against him without speaking to his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to talk about it, but I really can't,'' Lanner
said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Lanner's lawyer by The Associated Press was not
returned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's editions of The New York Times, Lanner either denied
or said he didn't recall the charges made in the article. He did
acknowledge kneeing a male student in the groin while he was a high
school principal at a school he founded in Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner resigned from the Hillel school in 1997. He also had
worked as a teacher at The Frisch School, a yeshiva in Paramus.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner worked for three years as director of regions at the
youth group, planning programs and leading a six-week summer tour
of Israel for teen-age boys, said Orthodox Union spokesman David
Olivestone. He had worked at different jobs for the organization
for many years, Olivestone said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues described him as a charming, effective speaker who
became a substitute parent to many of the teens under his care.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yosef Blau, a counselor at Yeshiva University, sat on a
religious panel in 1989 that evaluated allegations that Lanner had
attacked a young man suffering from Hodgkin's disease with a
kitchen knife.
</P>
<P>
   The panel concluded the charges could not be proved, but Blau
said he later received many telephone calls and letters from former
students who complained that Lanner had been abusive to them. He
said he believed allegations in The Jewish Week that the
allegations were ignored by the Orthodox Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that they were so enamored with his success and
accomplishments that they didn't want to hear problems,'' Blau
said.

<HEADLINE> Syrians Cast Ballots for Assad  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syrians kissed Bashar Assad's hands and
cheeks, hugged him and smeared voting cards with their blood to
show their loyalty during a nationwide referendum Monday, the last
formality before the former eye doctor succeeds his father as head
of state.
</P>
<P>
   The polling, orchestrated by the ruling Baath party, was held
exactly one month after the death of Assad's father Hafez Assad,
who ruled Syria with an iron grip for 30 years. When Bashar Assad
takes office following a swearing-in ceremony July 17, it will be
the first time a son succeeds his father as president in an Arab
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said that polls closed at 10:20 p.m. ,
according to the official Syrian Arab News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the referendum, to be announced Tuesday, is a
foregone conclusion. Like his father, who received between 99.6 and
99.99 percent of the ballots in four of five referendums, Bashar
Assad is expected to get overwhelming endorsement from voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our blood and our children belong to Bashar Assad,'' said Rose
Boghos, a school principle. ''He's our choice for a prosperous
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous referendums, when voters danced and sang outside
polling stations, there were hardly any signs of jubilation because
the 40-day mourning for Hafez Assad has not yet ended.
</P>
<P>
   About 9.44 million Syrians over the age of 18 -- more than half
the population -- are eligible to vote. They have a choice of
marking a green ring that says ''yes'' or a gray one signifying
''no.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using pens, some voters pricked their thumbs with
sewing needles provided by voting officials and smeared blood to
mark their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the voting began at 7 a.m., Bashar Assad drove
his gray-black car to cast his vote at his old school in Damascus.
Teachers and students met him with cheers, hugs and kisses, with
some grabbing his hands and squeezing them tight.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad told them he chose to vote at his school ''because
I owe you a big favor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A person acquires the elements of success or failure from two
sources: the home and the school,'' Bashar Assad said, according to
the official Syrian Arab News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad then got behind the wheel and drove slowly behind a
security vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When a crowd that had gathered around the corner from the school
saw him, they broke through a security cordon and threw themselves
at the car, chanting: ''With our blood and our soul we sacrifice
ourselves to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The young leader slowed down, smiling and waving as his security
men pulled the crowd away.
</P>
<P>
   In old Damascus, 80 members of Damascus' 100-strong Jewish
community cast their votes, smearing the green ring with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jewish community said 'yes' to the late President Hafez
Assad and today we say 'yes' to Gen. Bashar Assad,'' voter Khodr
Kabariti said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Foreign Ministry, Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa told reporters after he voted that the referendum was
''the biggest proof'' yet that those who believed Hafez Assad's
death would lead to anarchy and instability were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam said that according to the
constitution there will be a Cabinet reshuffle after the new
president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   The main theme of the campaign leading up to the referendum had
been that Bashar Assad was the only Syrian capable of continuing
the older Assad's policies. The autocratic Hafez Assad gave Syria
stability after years of political upheaval, coups and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is the last in a series of steps Hafez Assad put
in place to ensure the succession of his son, a former eye doctor
with little political experience.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of his father's death on June 10, parliament
amended the constitution to lower the minimum age for president
from 40 to 34, Bashar Assad's age. In the days that followed,
Bashar Assad was promoted from colonel to general and declared
commander of the armed forces. The Baath party, which has enjoyed a
monopoly in Syria since 1963, made him its leader and nominated him
as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The election was closely followed in neighboring Lebanon, which
is dominated by Syria and where some 35,000 Syrian troops are
stationed and some 1 million Syrians work. Syrians were able to
vote at 25 election centers in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Adams Asks Blair Keep Police Reform  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein Leader Gerry Adams urged British
Prime Minister Tony Blair to live up to his government's
commitments in Northern Ireland to reform the police force and
withdraw troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Protestant hard-liners should negotiate passage of
their traditional July parades through Catholic neighborhoods where
there has been violence in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, leader of a party linked to the Irish Republican Army,
spoke to reporters at the National Press Club after talks with
members of President Clinton's National Security Council. He sees
congressional leaders Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the British government had failed to withdraw troops
from mainly Catholic neighborhoods in the province in response to
the IRA's initiative last month to allow international arms
inspections to visit several weapons dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus now needs to be on the response, not of those who
have fulfilled their commitment,'' Adams said when asked whether he
foresaw further actions by the IRA in coming weeks to put its
weapons ''beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the main topics of the discussions with
administration officials was reform of Northern Ireland's police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Two British army watchtowers that were features of the Belfast
skyline, and long the focus for Sinn Fein protests, were dismantled
last month, however. And the number of British troops and
installations has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   An international commission headed by former Hong Kong Gov.
Chris Patten made 175 proposals last September to change the force,
including stripping it of its ''royal'' designation and pledging to
increase the number of Catholic officers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said 89 Patten recommendations were being subverted. Adams
also said there was insufficient evidence to judge 75 others and
only ll simple ones had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British government has to face up to its
responsibilities,'' Adams said, adding that neither Catholic and
republican parties will have nothing to do with the police service.
</P>
<P>
   He said British Prime Minister Tony Blair held ''the key to a
peaceful future (in Northern Ireland) and it was up to him to turn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the Protestant parades by the Orange Order
throughout July that commemorate ancient victories over Catholics,
Adams said it was a positive sign ''that the lack of support (from
the Protestants) has been so visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's summer ''marching season'' reaches its climax
Wednesday, the 310th anniversary of King William III of England's
victory over the Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said in traditional trouble spots such as Portadown,
southwest of Belfast, marchers should negotiate their passage
through Catholic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't talk,'' they should not walk, Adams said. ''If
they want to march and are genuinely concerned about a religious
occasion, the Christian way would be to talk about it.''

<HEADLINE> Brackens, Jaguars at 'Impasse'  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- It has been a few weeks since the
Jacksonville Jaguars and Tony Brackens have talked about a new
contract. And the defensive end's agent said the sides are at a
''complete impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagged as Jacksonville's franchise player, Brackens is
threatening to hold out through training camp -- maybe beyond -- if
he doesn't get a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't have a contract, he's not going to be in camp,''
agent Michael George said Monday. ''We're not close to having the
numbers that would translate to a final deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp begins next Friday, and the Jaguars must prepare as though
they will be without Brackens, who led the team with 12 sacks last
season and made his first Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This offseason, top defensive ends are fetching contracts worth
$7 million to $8 million a year with signing bonuses of $12 million
to $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without a contract, Brackens could play for $4.2 million next
season as Jacksonville's franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   He could also sit out, which seems to be the most-likely option.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars senior vice president Michael Huyghue said the team
isn't in a panic situation and hopes to resume negotiations in time
for camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached an impasse,'' Huyghue said last week. ''We
haven't gotten past that yet. That's just the reality of the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he is waiting for the team to approach him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't negotiate against ourselves,'' he said. ''They've got
to come and sort of join us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brackens could become the first veteran holdout in the team's
short history.

<HEADLINE> Critics bash Whitman for searching suspect; some promise protest  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Critics called Gov. Christie Whitman's
search of an unarmed Camden man everything from insensitive to
illegal and promised protests when she returns to the city for the
Republican National Convention's opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's just stepped in a mess,'' Camden City Councilman Ali
Sloan-El said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A convention is coming up. I think she didn't want no
scuttlebutt with the residents here,'' Sloan-El said. ''If it's an
issue, and this is now an issue, we'll put it on our list and we'll
meet her at the waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose protest over racial profiling shut
down the Atlantic City Expressway last year, said he will meet
Thursday with members of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey
to plan a new round of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it needs any more explanation why it took her so
long to understand the outrage over racial profiling. She herself
engaged in it,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not talking about speculation. You're not talking about
interpretations. Here you clearly have a governor engaged in this
and caught in the act,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman maintains her pat-down of the unidentified man was an
attempt to fully understand the rigors of police work. The search
came during a 1996 tour Whitman took of the city with State Police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers offered Whitman the opportunity to search the man and
she agreed. He had been searched at least once before by officers.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph obtained by The Associated Press shows Whitman
standing behind a black man, his arms spread, palms pressed up
against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is wearing jeans, a sweatshirt, a baseball cap and
black gloves.
</P>
<P>
   In the picture Whitman appears to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Of all that is wrong with the picture, that smile might be the
most offensive, state Sen. Wayne Bryant, D-Camden, said. Police
searches are serious business and should not be taken lightly,
Byrant said. They should also not be photo opportunities, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''No citizen should be humiliated. That's humiliation to have a
second search. There is no legitimate explanation to pat down a
citizen, deprive him of his rights again for a photo op,'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's eagerness to participate as a police officer shows a
''cowboy'' mentality and it demonstrates ''a lack of caring,''
Bryant said. But many in Camden's minority community subjected to
race-based searches have come to expect such behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sends that signal. That is what young African-Americans
think, 'Here we go again.' When it's the governor, it almost sends
the signal that it's all right,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The search itself was illegal and a violation of the man's civil
rights, said Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the New Jersey
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The search demonstrates just how little police officers respect
individual rights, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're so accustomed to having this kind of power that it
seems insignificant and unimportant that this person's civil rights
were violated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday with the AP, Whitman said she was not
sure if there's anything wrong with searching a man who was never
charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said she did not know if she had the legal
authority to search someone. ''It never occurred to me to ask that
question,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer was not available Monday and
would have no comment, a spokesman said. The photograph has been
subpoenaed by several black and Hispanic troopers who claim they
were subjected to discrimination by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Buckman, the attorney for a trooper in the case, said it
was clear that Whitman had no legal standing to search the man.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers need a reasonable belief that a person
is armed or that a crime has been committed before they can conduct
a physical search, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time the governor comes along, we know this gentleman
didn't fit that description,'' said Buckman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The photograph and all its implications bespeaks a lack of
sensitivity by the State Police, by the governor, to human rights
and to human dignity,'' Buckman said.

<HEADLINE> USDA to try to buy surplus cranberries to help growers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The federal government has agreed to buy
30.4 million pounds of cranberry products in the coming months to
help growers who have a glut on their hands, according to a
published report.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is intended to help save farmers from
overproduction and a steep drop in prices, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported in Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is negotiating with schools
and nutrition programs to see if they'd want cranapple juice,
cranberry sauce and trail mix with cranberries. George Chartier, a
spokesman for the USDA, said the agency would know in the next few
weeks if it can proceed with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department last week decided to force farmers to
cut production or dump about 15 percent of their crop this fall to
winnow down the surplus and reverse the downward spiral in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers across the country, including the 47 cranberry growers
in New Jersey, faced the prospect of bringing in less than $30 per
barrel this year. In 1996 a barrel sold for a high of $65.90. In
some areas, farmers are earning less than $10 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the USDA's new limits, growers will be allowed this year
to sell only 85 percent of their usual production, which means they
will have to dispose of about 884,000 barrels of fruit, enough to
make almost 40 million gallons of cranberry juice cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is so large that processors expect to have about 4.6
million barrels of cranberries on hand in September - about 80
percent of the nation's annual production - when growers start
harvesting this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   Growers created the problem themselves. Strong demand and high
prices in the early 1990s spurred new people to get into the
business and led existing operations to expand acreage, say
industry experts. Cranberries grow on perennial vines that don't
start producing for two to three years after they are planted.
</P>
<P>
   Demand peaked in 1994 with per capita consumption of processed
berries at 1.7 pounds. It has since declined, to 1.6 pounds in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   To increase demand, growers are considering forming a national
promotional program similar to the dairy industry's ''Got Milk?''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey ranks third in cranberry production, behind Wisconsin
and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the production cutback, the effect on consumer prices
will be modest, the USDA said. Ocean Spray, a grower cooperative
that accounts for 70 percent of cranberry production, says it plans
to reduce prices, despite the production limit.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA's purchase program, begun by Franklin D. Roosevelt,
bought more than 1 billion pounds of commodities worth $721.5
million last year, The Inquirer reported. The agency added
cranberries to its shopping list last year when the surplus crisis
was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has already bought 13 million pounds of cranberry
products this year, but much of that was cranapple juice, which
doesn't have much cranberry in it, and trail mix, which contains
only about 20 percent cranberries.

<HEADLINE> GI Accidentally Kills Albanian Boy  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CERKEZ SADOVINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A 5-year-old ethnic Albanian
boy was killed Monday when an American soldier's gun accidentally
discharged as troops worked to repair the fence around an
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   A witness said the soldier, whose name was not released, had
been playing with about 30 children when the weapon fired three
times, striking Gentrit Rexhepi in the chest and hand.
</P>
<P>
   The boy ran screaming for about 10 yards and then collapsed,
said Abdyselim Qosaj, 31. ''The soldier involved ran toward the kid
and started screaming and crying. Other soldiers ran to the
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The child was rushed to the U.S. base at Camp Bondsteel, located
near the scene, where a U.S. statement said doctors tried to save
his life. He was pronounced dead about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the NATO-led peacekeeping force, Lt. Gen. Juan
Ortuno, appeared on Kosovo television Monday evening to express
deep regret for the death.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of U.S. forces here, Brig. Gen. Randal M. Tieszen,
was at the hospital while doctors operated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very sad what happened but I know it wasn't done on
purpose,'' the victim's father, Deli Rexhepi, said. ''It could have
happened to anyone. I know the soldier was playing with the kids to
help them remove their trauma'' suffered during last year's Serb
crackdown and the 78 days of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said U.S. representatives visited the family twice to
offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Maj. Scott Slaten said a preliminary
investigation indicated the death was an accident. He said a full
investigation had begun.

<HEADLINE> UNC Coach Search Widens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- They're not exactly lining up at North
Carolina for Bill Guthridge's job.
</P>
<P>
   George Karl and Larry Brown pulled out of consideration for the
Tar Heels' vacancy Monday, the latest high-profile coaches not
interested in taking over one of the most famous programs in
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, the Milwaukee Bucks' coach who used to played for Dean
Smith at North Carolina, said he was flattered to be approached.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, however, I also have a loyalty to an organization
that has treated me very well, an owner who has shown a great deal
of faith in me and team that's on the verge of something special,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks had gone seven seasons without a playoff appearance
before Karl led them to two consecutive postseason berths.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Philadelphia 76ers' coach who also played under Smith
with the Tar Heels, announced his decision after meeting with North
Carolina officials over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have decided to continue my efforts and fulfill my dream of
helping to bring a championship to Philadelphia,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who retired in 1997 as the winningest coach in NCAA
Division I history, called the Sixers and Bucks last Friday about
the job opening. Guthridge retired June 30 but is acting as the
interim coach until his replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
   Other former Tar Heels under consideration include Notre Dame's
Matt Doherty, Middle Tennessee State's Randy Wiel and Tennessee
Tech's Jeff Lebo. Kansas coach Roy Williams, an assistant under
Smith for 10 years, announced last Friday that he would not take
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty met this weekend in Chapel Hill with Baddour, Smith and
Guthridge. Doherty, who played under Smith, said meetings with
North Carolina athletic officials went well, but he hasn't been
offered the job, nor was he given a timetable on the search.
</P>
<P>
   UNC also plans to talk with Wiel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy at MTSU, but when something like this comes
along you need to give it your attention,'' he told The Tennessean.
</P>
<P>
   Wiel has a 65-53 record during his four years at MTSU. He played
four seasons with the Tar Heels before graduating in 1979 and was
an assistant under Dean Smith from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Baddour tried unsuccessfully to get permission from
Tennessee Tech athletics director David Larimore to speak to Golden
Eagles coach Jeff Lebo.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were four different phone calls and it turned into
telephone tag,'' Tech sports information director Rob Schabert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebo, who has a 28-27 record in two seasons at Tennessee Tech,
was an All-ACC point guard at North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Classified Work at DOE Lab Stopped  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA ASHTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Classified work at the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory was temporarily halted after a secret document
was mistakenly photocopied and left in an unsecured but locked
office.
</P>
<P>
   The security breach occurred June 29 when an employee at the lab
in Richland copied several unclassified drawings along with a
classified one in a secure area, then took the papers to an office
outside the secure area and left them locked up there, lab
spokesman Greg Koller said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lapse was discovered the next day by another employee, and
lab staff reported it to the U.S. Department of Energy, Koller
said. The employee involved in the lapse was not disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ''These security concerns happen occasionally,'' Koller said.
</P>
<P>
   A security stand down, in which managers meet with staff to
review security procedures involving classified projects, was
ordered July 3. Some classified work has resumed and the remainder
should start again later this week, Koller said.
</P>
<P>
   The security flap comes on the heels of the national uproar over
a security breach at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. In May, a huge wildfire threatened the lab where two
computer hard drives with information used to disable nuclear
weapons went missing before the site was evacuated. The breach was
not reported to DOE for more than three weeks. The hard drives
later reappeared mysteriously in June.
</P>
<P>
   In December, former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was charged
with illegally copying top-secret nuclear weapons files. He is in
jail awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest lab is operated by Battelle for the DOE. It does
classified work both at the Hanford nuclear reservation and at its
main campus just south of the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred as a range fire swept across the nearby
Hanford nuclear reservation, but the security lapse was unrelated
to the blaze, Koller said.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Police Reform is Urged  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein Leader Gerry Adams urged British
Prime Minister Tony Blair to live up to his government's
commitments in Northern Ireland to reform the police force and
withdraw troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Protestant hard-liners should negotiate passage of
their traditional July parades through Catholic neighborhoods where
there has been violence in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, leader of a party linked to the Irish Republican Army,
spoke to reporters at the National Press Club after talks with
members of President Clinton's National Security Council. He sees
congressional leaders Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the British government had failed to withdraw troops
from mainly Catholic neighborhoods in the province in response to
the IRA's initiative last month to allow international arms
inspections to visit several weapons dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus now needs to be on the response, not of those who
have fulfilled their commitment,'' Adams said when asked whether he
foresaw further actions by the IRA in coming weeks to put its
weapons ''beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the main topics of the discussions with
administration officials was reform of Northern Ireland's police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Two British army watchtowers that were features of the Belfast
skyline, and long the focus for Sinn Fein protests, were dismantled
last month, however. And the number of British troops and
installations has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   An international commission headed by former Hong Kong Gov.
Chris Patten made 175 proposals last September to change the force,
including stripping it of its ''royal'' designation and pledging to
increase the number of Catholic officers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said 89 Patten recommendations were being subverted. Adams
also said there was insufficient evidence to judge 75 others and
only ll simple ones had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British government has to face up to its
responsibilities,'' Adams said, adding that neither Catholic and
republican parties will have nothing to do with the police service.
</P>
<P>
   He said British Prime Minister Tony Blair held ''the key to a
peaceful future (in Northern Ireland) and it was up to him to turn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the Protestant parades by the Orange Order
throughout July that commemorate ancient victories over Catholics,
Adams said it was a positive sign ''that the lack of support (from
the Protestants) has been so visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's summer ''marching season'' reaches its climax
Wednesday, the 310th anniversary of King William III of England's
victory over the Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said in traditional trouble spots such as Portadown,
southwest of Belfast, marchers should negotiate their passage
through Catholic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't talk,'' they should not walk, Adams said. ''If
they want to march and are genuinely concerned about a religious
occasion, the Christian way would be to talk about it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rebuts GOP Tax Cut Plans  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- His opinion on national priorities may
soon be worth less than ''half a soda-pop,'' said President
Clinton, but he nonetheless offered a low-key rebuttal Monday to
Republican tax cut and spending plans that would far outlast his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a nostalgic, valedictory address to the National Governors'
Association, Clinton also appealed for civility amid election-year
politics and took broad credit for the nation's economic success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask you to help ensure an election season that is positive,
open and vigorous about the real and honest differences, but devoid
of the poison that has too often clouded the judgment of everybody
involved in the public process,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has begged, borrowed or created opportunities
lately to tout the economic stewardship and qualifications of his
chosen successor, Vice President Al Gore, he did not mention Gore
in Monday's address to a bipartisan group of about 35 governors.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did he mention Gore's presumptive GOP opponent, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush. Bush skipped the meeting, as did his brother,
Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's broad summing-up of the economic and
legislative successes of his two terms amounted to an implicit
pitch for Gore, and to his own ideas for continued fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those is a special $500 billion reserve fund, which would
be out of reach of either the current White House or the current
Congress. Clinton says the fund is necessary as a hedge in case
projected budget surpluses don't happen.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent off-the-cuff digression, Clinton mused that his
priorities for spending probably won't have a long shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would not be responsible for me to propose how to
spend all that money,'' Clinton said. Clinton said a quarter plus
his opinion ''will get you half a soda pop after next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress returned to work this week after a holiday break, and
Clinton directly criticized tax cut measures backed by the GOP
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax bill the Senate will vote on this week is too
expensive and ill-conceived, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've got to keep the economy going by hewing to the
same principles of fiscal discipline that got us where we are,''
Clinton said. ''And that means I think whatever combination of
spending and tax cuts any candidate for any office proposes, there
ought to be enough left over,'' to get rid of the national debt and
other priorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former governor who once chaired the governors' group, Clinton
waxed nostalgic as he thanked the group for cooperation over the
years, and credited state executives with helping sustain the
national economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this was in fact the most partisan speech I have
ever heard him give, but he is very good and very subtle,'' said
New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican, after Clinton's
speech. ''If he had mentioned Al Gore then everybody could have
said 'yes, this is a very partisan speech.' The fact that he didn't
mention Al Gore by name enabled him to get away with it as just
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican often mentioned as a
possible Bush running mate, shared a car from the airport with
Clinton and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and had a more
positive take on the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see it as much partisan, necessarily, as
presidential,'' Ridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton saved the direct partisan firepower for later in the
day. At a speech in Philadelphia estimated to raise $600,000 for
Pennsylvania Senate candidate Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., Clinton said
every Democratic vote in the Senate counts dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the recent nomination fight over Enrique Moreno, a
Texas judge Clinton nominated for the federal bench, Clinton said
Republicans in the Senate tried to disguise their partisan
opposition by denying Moreno a hearing. ''And the leader of the Rep
party in Texas -- you all know who he is -- total silence while this
man was denied even the dignity of a hearing,'' Clinton said
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison said Moreno, a
Harvard-educated lawyer in private practice since 1981, lacked the
necessary experience to sit on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement at the time that claim was
''unconscionable,'' noting that Moreno won the top rating from the
American Bar Association, which evaluates and reports on the
professional qualifications of people being considered by the
president for nomination to federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans often grumble that Clinton and Gore do not deserve
so much credit for a robust economy, and point instead to a lucky
combination of technological expansion and sound fiscal management
by the independent Federal Reserve. Clinton, who takes pains to say
that he never offers advice to Greenspan, did offer Greenspan a
ride to the governors' meeting aboard Air Force One. The popular,
long-serving Fed chairman is scheduled to address the group
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Weizman Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman handed in his
resignation Monday, effectively ending a seven-year term that
turned sour when he was found to have acted improperly by accepting
gifts while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the day marked ''the end of an era'' Weizman's top aide,
Aryeh Shumer, delivered the resignation letter to Avraham Burg,
speaker of Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the resignation takes effect 48 hours later. There
will be no Israeli president until July 31, when lawmakers will
vote by secret ballot between former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
and legislator Moshe Katsav of the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have accomplished a lot, and I am leaving feeling good and
satisfied,'' Weizman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's resignation came after the attorney general ruled that
Weizman had acted improperly. However, the 76-year-old president
had said previously that he would resign sometime this year, citing
ill health and the implications of a police investigation into more
than $300,000 in gifts he accepted from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman became embroiled in controversy after a journalist
alleged he had received $453,000 from Edouard Sarousi, a French
textiles magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Police concluded that Weizman's failure to report the money
constituted fraud and breach of public trust, but that the statute
of limitations on those charges had run out.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman has admitted receiving $350,000 but insisted the money
was a private gift and never affected any of his decision-making
while president.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the Oslo
Accords which launched the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, is
considered the front-runner in the race. However, the current
political turmoil stemming from the collapse of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition on Sunday could affect the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party that dealt a serious blow to
Barak by pulling out on Sunday, is also seen to be playing a strong
role in determining the results of the presidential race, with its
17 votes.
</P>
<P>
   He received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for trying to end the
decades-long conflict. Although he is revered abroad as a
statesman, he has drawn criticism from the more hawkish elements at
home as being too conciliatory to Israel's Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push for China Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's Democratic leader on Monday
demanded a vote this month on granting permanent trade status to
China, saying passage of the legislation could be in jeopardy if
Republicans put off action until September.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said he was ''alarmed'' that no date
had been set this month for a vote on the China trade bill. He said
he understood that Republicans were now moving toward delaying the
vote until after Congress returns from its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he supported
the legislation that would expand and stabilize trade with China,
but would not now commit to a date for a vote. He said his first
priority this month was passing spending bills for fiscal year
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Lott acknowledged that he stated last month that he hoped to
consider the China bill before the August vacation, but ''I never
said for sure when it would be. I said it was my intent and it is
still my intent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a major hurdle to setting a date for the trade bill was
Democratic objections to taking up a parallel bill, offered by
Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that
would require annual assessments of China's weapons proliferation
records and give the president the authority to impose sanctions if
China breaks nonproliferation agreements.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ''feel much freer to go ahead'' with the trade
bill if Democrats agreed to vote first on Thompson-Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, citing recent reports of China's aiding Pakistan's
missile program, said his bill was needed because ''the Chinese are
basically telling us to get lost. We know what they are doing and
they are apparently not even denying it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has agreed to separate consideration of his bill so
that it will not complicate final passage of the trade bill, which
the House passed in May by a 237-197 vote. But he has indicated he
would offer his measure as an amendment to the trade bill if he
does not get a separate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in turn, say the Thompson measure should not be
considered before Lott sets a July date for taking up the trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said that without an agreement on the trade bill he
would go to the Senate floor this week with a motion to take it up
this month. ''We cannot fail to act on that issue any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill has the strong backing of business and
agriculture groups that have strong ties to the Republican Party.
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue, in an op-ed
piece in the Washington Post Monday, urged the Senate to reject the
Thompson-Torricelli measure because, he said, unilateral sanctions
never work. He urged passage of the permanent trade status
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott denied that he was under pressure from GOP backers for
quick action. ''Why don't I know anything about it?'' he asked,
saying that during the weeklong July 4th recess he got only one
call urging him to move on the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Clinton, Paterno have friendly encounter at Penn State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) - President Clinton's face lit up when
he encountered Penn State football coach Joe Paterno in the
audience after addressing the National Governors' Association near
the university's campus Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There's a family angle to the connection between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, was a former Penn
State player, and a big booster of the Nittany Lions before he died
in 1993, Paterno explained after the two men chatted. Her brother,
Hugh Jr., was a walk-on player in the late '60s or early '70s,
Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family was really good to me when I was a young coach, her
father in particular,'' Paterno, a Republican, said of the Rodhams.
''Her father helped us when we tried to recruit some kids out of
Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton circulated among the governors and VIPs, chatting with
New Jersey's Christie Whitman, patting Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge on
the back twice, and embracing actor and director Rob Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   He lingered at a doorway to shake hands and pose for pictures
before exiting the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ''You and I could go into business,'' Clinton joked with one man
who snapped a picture of him with a conference participant. ''I
could arrange the pictures and you could flash them.''
</P>
<P>
   Major corporations handed their wish lists to the nation's
governors Monday, calling for a reduction in state regulation and
more business-friendly policies.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated political columnist David Broder of The Washington
Post held each of the corporate officials to three-minute
summations in his role as moderator of a panel discussion that
sought to define the term ''new economy'' that was used liberally
throughout the 3&AMP;frac12;-day National Governors' Association annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Stone of The Boeing Co. said states must recognize the
importance to businesses of ''meat-and-potato-type issues,'' such
as unemployment taxes and Workers' Compensation premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ''State to state, the cost of doing business is very important''
in where corporations create jobs, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Wood of the Prudential insurance company urged governors to
''educate'' regulators and legislators who are less sensitive to
the needs of business.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governors get it,'' said Fred Hoffman of DaimlerChrysler
Corp., echoing other corporate panelists who complimented the
governors for their pro-business views.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough flattery,'' Broder said with a smile. ''Move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the corporations represented in the panel discussion are
among the NGA's ''corporate fellows,'' which provide financial
support for the organization as well as information about
governmental issues that affect them.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of governors touted their states' programs in a
broad-brush committee session on aiding the disadvantaged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina said his state is providing $330
million to programs for children, including efforts to provide
child care in regions where it is tough to get.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's Tom Carper spoke of a program that places inmates who
need such services as drug and alcohol counseling into close-knit
units where they can get support from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she consolidated services for older
New Jerseyans into one department where there used to be four.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has also instituted a toll-free telephone line where
senior citizens can call to get knowledgeable answers on a broad
range of matters. In keeping with the preferences of many older
people, the line is answered by state workers and not a recording,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has provided money to help disabled people get
mortgages, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said. Less than 5 percent of
those with disabilities own their own homes, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-member Democratic Governors' Association on Monday placed
Maryland Gov. Parris N. Glendening in line to become the group's
chairman in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Glendening will begin a one-year term as chairman of
the bipartisan National Governors' Association, which is winding up
its annual meeting in State College, Pa. He will take the helm of
the Democratic governors' group at the beginning of 2002.

<HEADLINE> Orangemen Protests Close Belfast  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Hard-line Protestants mounted
human road blockades across Northern Ireland on Monday, bringing
the province to a tense standstill and provoking running battles
with riot police as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
   Militants hijacked and burned cars in several Belfast
neighborhoods as anger over restrictions on traditional Protestant
parades flared into violence for the second straight week.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Orange Order brotherhood insisted they had
counseled supporters not to destroy property or attack police
following Monday's planned four-hour road blockades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential that the protests are not used by malcontents,
who have no real interest in the Orange institution, as a cover for
violence,'' leaders of the 80,000-member fraternal group said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''To those who have or would engage in violence, we can only say
stop,'' the statement said. ''You are not acting on our behalf.
Your actions damage an honorable cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the first protests, trouble broke out in
Belfast and other towns, and got progressively worse at night.
Motorists in several towns were terrorized into handing over their
cars to roadside mobs. Police prepared for the worst tried to
contain riotous mobs on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Along the so-called ''peace line,'' a network of fences and
walls separating British Protestant and Irish Catholic communities
in west Belfast, youths on both sides traded salvos of bottles and
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   On the city's predominantly Protestant east side, soldiers and
police blocked a growing crowd from entering Short Strand, an
isolated Catholic enclave, where a few dozen Catholic men stood
ready to defend their area.
</P>
<P>
   And while skirmishing with hooligans in Protestant suburbs to
the north, police seized components for homemade grenades, a
shotgun and cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five miles to the southwest in Lurgan, riot police
intervened to prevent Protestants from walking into the Catholic
side of the town, among the most bitterly polarized in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   And in neighboring Portadown, the mostly Protestant town at the
center of debate over Orange Order parades, a protracted clash
broke out between riot police and masked Protestant youths.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police armed with shields, clubs and attack dogs pushed
protesters out of one Portadown intersection. Masked teen-agers
responded by pelting police with bricks and rocks, while a stolen
car was left burning on the main Belfast-Dublin rail line nearby.
Police in turn blasted the 300-strong crowd with water cannons, but
the rioting continued.
</P>
<P>
   And some extremists turned their attention to isolated
Catholics. In Bangor, a mostly Protestant town east of Belfast, a
Catholic church and adjoining priest's home had their windows
smashed -- just one of scores of Catholic-occupied property targeted
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Shops in Belfast, Portadown and several smaller towns closed an
hour before the protests to allow workers enough time to get away.
Normally bustling shopping precincts were eerily empty by 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders condemned Orange tactics, saying the Protestant
fraternal group was placing its own disputed right to march past
hostile Catholic neighborhoods above everyone else's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most businessmen didn't want to close their premises, and
certainly do not support what the Orangemen are doing, but they had
a duty to ensure that their staff could get home safely,'' said
Bill Jeffrey, chairman of the Northern Ireland Small Businesses
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The mass exodus of motorists meant that when groups of Orangemen
and their supporters began rallying in predominantly Protestant
parts of Belfast -- some carrying placards reading ''Respect our
culture, restore our rights'' -- they had comparatively little
traffic to snarl.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the Protestant leader of Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing government and an Orangeman himself, warned that
anyone committing violence this week ''will only bring dishonor and
disgrace on the cause they profess to support.''

<HEADLINE> UW Probes Alleged Players' Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin athletes who bought merchandise
for unadvertised discounts at a shoe store owned by a school
booster did so without knowledge that it could violate NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   The university notified the NCAA of the possible violations and
began its own investigation after reports surfaced that members of
the football and men's basketball teams may have received special
credit arrangements at The Shoe Box not available to other clients.
</P>
<P>
   The school also is probing allegations that some of them may
have exchanged university-issued shoes for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Associate athletic director Vince Sweeney said Monday the
university has not determined whether the purchases constitute a
rules violation, though the athletes did not knowingly violate NCAA
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would argue, at least at this point, that if it turns out
what we think it will be, if it is indeed a violation, it was
inadvertent in nature and thus secondary,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA defines a secondary violation as ''one that provides
only a limited recruiting or competitive advantage and that is
isolated or inadvertent in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   A report in the Wisconsin State Journal detailed purchases by
eight members of the Badgers' Final Four men's basketball team and
14 players from the Rose Bowl champion football team. The paper
reported players received discounts of 25 to 40 percent and
interest-free credit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players listed were Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne,
starting quarterback Brooks Bollinger, and all five starters from
the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe Box owner Steve Schmitt dismissed the allegations as the
grumblings of a fired former employee and insisted he gives similar
discounts to an array of customers, not just athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt, who holds men's basketball season tickets and has
donated money to the university in the past, said he has no
personal relationship with athletes outside of selling them shoes
and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The university's compliance officer visited Schmitt's store in
November after hearing rumors that players were receiving special
treatment there. Schmitt said the visit was very casual and the
university sent him a thank you letter afterward for his
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the university visited Schmitt to make sure he
understood the NCAA rules on boosters' relationships with players
but didn't know the extent of what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time, I thought we did above and beyond what we would
normally do with rumors,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   If the purchases constitute a rules violation, it would be the
third time in the last decade the university broke NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling program was put on probation in 1994 for improper
use of booster funds that included impermissible benefits to
athletes, a major rules violation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the NCAA found the athletic department had committed
a major rules infraction because coaches and staff members received
reimbursement for expenses from a boosters fund without approval
from the chancellor. That probation was scheduled to end in
November.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the NCAA would not comment
on Monday.

<HEADLINE> House Eyes Cheaper Drug Imports  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing public resentment of high
prescription drug prices, the House late Monday debated whether to
prevent the government from discouraging the purchase of drugs in
Canada or other countries.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of Americans have been going to Canada,
Mexico and other countries to purchase prescription drugs cheaper
than what they cost in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Technically it's illegal to import prescription drugs, and the
Food and Drug Administration sometimes has send warning letters to
people caught doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The House considered late Monday whether to put an amendment
onto an FDA appropriations bill that would prevent the agency from
enforcing the law or mailing such warning letters.
</P>
<P>
   ''People's lives are being shortened today because of the
abnormally high and ridiculously increased price of
prescriptions,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cost controls, drugs can cost several times less in
Canada, Mexico and Europe than in the United States, leading some
Americans to buy their pharmaceuticals by mail order or else join
bus trips across the border to fill their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Prilosec, a popular ulcer medication, cost $400 for
100 capsules in New York but $184 in Canada and $107 in Mexico,
said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prescription drugs and medicines are not a luxury, they are a
necessity,'' added Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   High drug prices have emerged as a significant issue in this
year's political campaigns. Polling indicates the issue of
prescription drugs is a priority for Americans 65 and older, a
group that accounted for more than one-quarter of voters in the
1998 elections and is regarded as a key swing group in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pushed a bill through the House last month that
would use private insurance and federal subsidies to cover some of
the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the legislation. He and
congressional Democrats are advocating a more encompassing but also
costlier alternative: a uniform, government-run prescription drug
benefit, offered to all 39 million elderly and disabled Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokesman Lawrence Bachorik said the agency is concerned
that the House legislation could undermine its ''ability to protect
consumers and patients from substandard, poorly manufactured or
otherwise risky drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA stands ready to work with Congress on these issues,''
he added.

<HEADLINE> Green Bay, Packers Reach Name Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- In three years, naming rights to Lambeau
Field could go on sale for more than $120 million with the Packers
and the city of Green Bay splitting the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Jadin announced the deal Monday that would allow the
naming rights -- which are sold to a company for the right to put
its name on a property -- to go on sale in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   That's the target date for completing a $295 million expansion
and renovation of the stadium that the Packers contend is critical
to keep the team financially competitive in the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   The plan must clear several hurdles first.
</P>
<P>
   The naming rights could only be sold after an advisory
referendum in Brown County asks voters if they backed the sale. The
former City Stadium, built in 1957, was renamed in honor of the
team's founder and first coach, E.L. ''Curly'' Lambeau, after his
death in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Jadin said he hoped any corporation that bought naming rights
would keep Lambeau in the name, ''like XYZ Co. at Lambeau Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Packers president Bob Harlan said the Packers initially wanted a
higher percentage of the naming-rights proceeds, but the team will
get all the revenue from other advertising, sponsorship and
promotional rights at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept hearing what the mayor and the city council said and
you don't get a negotiation finished until you keep working towards
the middle, and that's what we tried to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jadin said the Green Bay city council was expected to take up
the naming-rights deal Tuesday. If the council approves it, a new
stadium commission created under state law would be authorized to
vote to levy a half-percent sales tax in Brown County to help
finance the stadium improvements.
</P>
<P>
   First, voters would have to approve the sales tax in a
referendum tentatively planned for Sept. 12. The cornerstone of the
project is using the sales tax revenue to borrow $160 million for
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Brown County Executive Nancy Nusbaum said she was confident
voters would approve the sale, given the amount of money it could
raise as a way of reducing the taxpayers' share of the stadium
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Nusbaum doubted any corporation would agree to pay at least
$120 million for naming rights and keep Lambeau in the name.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very much a business proposition,'' she said. ''There
is too great a risk that if Lambeau remains part of the name, it
gets too easy for the general public to ignore the corporate
name.''

<HEADLINE> Larry Brown To Stay With Sixers  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Larry Brown, who once dreamed of coaching at
North Carolina, is staying with the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown announced his decision Monday after meeting with North
Carolina officials over the weekend to discuss the coaching vacancy
at his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ''After discussions with my family, and considering how much I
care about Philadelphia, the management and our fans, I have
decided to continue my efforts and fulfill my dream of helping to
bring a championship to Philadelphia,'' Brown said. ''Once again, I
would like to thank coach Dean Smith for all he has done for me in
the past, and I intend to remain as closely allied to the
university as I have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who joined the 76ers in 1997 after four seasons with the
Indiana Pacers, signed a three-year extension in March. He hasn't
coached in college since leading Kansas to the NCAA championship in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to remain in Philadelphia thrilled Sixers president
Pat Croce.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' Croce said. ''It was a relief. I was worried
because it was Dean Smith who called. It was his mentor, his
friend, his family.''
</P>
<P>
   It was believed Brown's contentious relationship with Sixers
star Allen Iverson would drive him out of Philadelphia. The two
have clashed since Brown joined the Sixers, and Iverson reportedly
was fined nearly 75 times last season for being late to practice.
</P>
<P>
   But Iverson insists he and Brown can coexist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I have to take up by myself,'' Iverson said
from Virginia. ''I've said for a long time, I can play under Coach
Brown. I don't have a problem with Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said it ''would be very, very difficult'' for him to
play under Brown next season, but he's willing to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown began his coaching career with the ABA's Carolina Cougars
in 1972, and has coached Denver, New Jersey, San Antonio and the
Los Angeles Clippers. In addition to Kansas, he coached UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   He is 732-586 as an NBA coach, 229-107 as an ABA coach and
177-61 in college. Brown led the 76ers to the Eastern Conference
semifinals the last two seasons after a seven-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching position at North Carolina became available when
Bill Guthridge retired June 30.
</P>
<P>
   After Kansas coach Roy Williams turned down the job last week,
Smith contacted Croce for permission to speak with Brown, who has
five years remaining on a contract worth more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   In granting Smith permission to speak to Brown, Croce said he
was ''a dream-maker, not a dream-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I reluctantly gave approval because it was a dream of Larry
Brown's forever,'' Croce said. ''To pursue a championship in
Philadelphia is his new dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said in the past he would jump at an opportunity to return
to North Carolina. He averaged 11.8 points as a guard at North
Carolina from 1960-63, and was the first Tarheels player to compete
in the Olympics in 1964. Brown was an assistant under Smith before
playing in the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Years ago, when I was a young coach, my dream was to go back
to my alma mater and be a coach there,'' Brown said last season.
''I would do anything coach Smith asked me to do, but I want to
retire here. Three years ago, four years ago, five years ago, I
wouldn't have blinked. Everything I want is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers general manager Billy King said he realized it wasn't an
easy choice for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough process for him because it's two places he
really loves,'' King said. ''He loves coach Smith and he respects
Pat Croce. He did what was best for him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's decision to remain with the Sixers could help him become
the successor to Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich as the Olympic coach in
2004. Brown will be an assistant to Tomjanovich with the U.S. team
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brown, Milwaukee coach George Karl withdrew his
name from consideration for the North Carolina job Monday, leaving
Notre Dame's Matt Doherty and Middle Tennessee State's Randy Wiel
in contention.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Dissident To Be Deported  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An immigration judge on Monday ordered the
deportation of an Iranian dissident who has been detained since
April on suspicion of belonging to a group designated by the State
Department as a sponsor of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of a settlement, Mahnaz Samadi, 35, who claims to
have been tortured in Iran between 1982 and 1986, will be deported
to a third country, not to Iran, an immigration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, disputing that assertion, said Samadi will be
allowed to remain indefinitely in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused in immigration documents of preparing rebel
units under her command for ''coordinated attacks designed to
liberate Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for her release from detention and the
dropping of terrorism-related charges against her, said Russ
Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi, who came to the United States in 1994 and was granted
political asylum in 1995, admitted to immigration officials that
she had fraudulently attained asylum and was willing to give up
that status, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi's main concern was that she not be deported back to Iran.
Speaking to the Washington Times last week from her jail cell in
Richmond, Va., she said, ''I have no doubt that I will be tortured
to death, not simply executed'' if she is returned.
</P>
<P>
   She has had the backing of more than 60 House members, who sent
a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno pleading for her release
and accusing prison officials of mistreating her.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros Lehtinen, R-Fla., said two weeks ago on behalf
of her House colleagues, ''The persecution of those seeking to
liberate their homeland violates the principles upon which this
country was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., welcomed the decision to drop
the terrorism charges against Samadi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been convinced from the beginning she is not a
terrorist and she poses no threat to our country,'' Torricelli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi has the backing of the National Council for Resistance of
Iran, which has been praised by many lawmakers as a legitimate
group seeking democracy in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, however, continues to list it as an alias
for the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, which it describes as a
terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi has denied committing any terrorist acts. Her Washington
attorney, Michael Maggio, says she is no longer a member of the
Iranian opposition and has committed no crimes in this country.
</P>
<P>
   He said immigration service assertions that she will be deported
to a third country are in correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would violate the spirit of the agreement,'' Maggio said.
''In reality, something like this is not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Her legal troubles began last November when she was arrested in
Canada and accused of being a danger to the community because of
her prior associations.
</P>
<P>
   She was deported from Canada to the United States early this
year and arrested by U.S. authorities in April.

<HEADLINE> Mudd Said Happy About Training Camp  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Of all those headed with the Indianapolis
Colts to training camp on Thursday, offensive line coach Howard
Mudd might be the happiest.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, the 58-year-old Mudd lost control of his motorcycle
and sustained multiple injuries. The injuries included a broken
shoulder, broken wrist, collapsed lung and a concussion when his
unhelmeted head struck the ground. His motorcycle and the car
involved in the collision that threw him in the air were both
demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the accident, Mudd was back at work and
said Monday that his recovery makes the training camp in Terre
Haute, Ind., especially satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ''When your life passes in front of you, literally, and I add up
what could have been, and what didn't happen, there's a very, very
large measure of gratitude for being alive. I've got some injuries,
but it's not like it could have been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Mudd's 27th consecutive NFL season as an offensive
line coach, and the three-time Pro Bowl starter as a member of the
San Francisco 49ers said the accident put football into a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some respects it maybe helps me on a personal note, make me
realize that there are things more important,'' he said. ''Things
that I felt are less important, are maybe a little more important.
What does that mean? Maybe it is making sure some little detail is
not overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel differently coming into training camp this time.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows camp will be a little different because of some
lingering physical ailments from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got some shoulder damage that I don't want to stick my hands
in somebody's chest to demonstrate, but that's about it. Before I
had some brain issues from banging my head,'' Mudd explained. ''But
other than that there are no limitations. I can run around and my
mouth still works and my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudd will be working with an experienced line that helped
produce the biggest one-season turnaround in league history. The
Colts finished 13-3 last season after going 3-13 each of the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   All five starters are back to open holes for running back
Edgerrin James, a Pro Bowl starter as a rookie last year, and
protect Pro Bowl quarterback Peyton Manning. That's a luxury the
Colts haven't had since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first year we were here as a team (1998), we had to learn
how to practice. We learned how to do that more than anything else,
what type of practice it takes to carry yourself through the game,
so that the game is less difficult,'' Mudd said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe very strongly that you play like you practice. The
players that we've got here now, they know how to practice, what
the standard of performance is and they like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting unit has Adam Meadows and Tarik Glenn at tackle,
Larry Moore at center, with Steve McKinney and Waverly Jackson as
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm blessed to have a core of players that know what we
want,'' Mudd said. ''An offensive line has to develop trust in each
other. When you're able to hold on to it from one year to the next,
there's certain levels that we expect. Now we've got a high water
mark to measure ourselves against. It's been decent. We've got to
do at least that well, and with the group we have I don't have as
much to do because there aren't as many that have to learn the
basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudd heads into camp looking at Jeff Saturday, who played some
as a rookie last season, for depth. Others he hopes may provide
depth include Tim Ridder, a 6-foot-7, 301-pounder from Notre Dame,
and Paul Snellings. Both Ridder and Snellings were with the team
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know what we want, and it will be interesting to see how
they come along,'' Mudd said. ''We certainly need to find some
people, because we can't go with just six guys.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chasity Melvin combined quickness and power
inside to score 21 points and lead the Cleveland Rockers over the
Charlotte Sting, 72-65 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin scored six points early in the second half during a 10-2
run that gave Cleveland a 54-44 lead with 11:52 to play. The
6-foot-3 center, in her second WNBA season, made six of eight field
goals and nine of 12 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (10-8) maintained a comfortable lead the rest of the
way to defeat the Sting for the second time in three nights. The
Rockers won Saturday night at Charlotte, 80-59.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Mapp had 17 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte (3-16),
which lost for the ninth time in 10 games. Charlotte Smith scored
16 for the Sting before fouling out with 28.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Mery Andrade and Suzie McConnell Serio each scored 11 points for
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams missed easy shots and turned the ball over early, but
turned it around in the final four minutes of the first half when
Cleveland hit four 3-pointers and Charlotte made two.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting's Dawn Staley began the long-range barrage with a
22-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell Serio responded for Cleveland 24 seconds later, but
Smith countered with 2:48 left. McConnell Serio hit two more
3-pointers, giving her nine points in 1:38.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Reid made a layup for Charlotte and Andrade ended the
flurry with yet another 3-pointer with 40.9 seconds to play to give
the Rockers a 42-31 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte dominated the boards and ran the floor during an 11-2
run at the start of the second half but Cleveland started to get
the ball inside to Melvin and regained command.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Injuries Don't Dampen All  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Not everybody at the All-Star game is bummed out
about the injuries that have kept the sport's biggest names on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are too overjoyed at being fill-ins -- no matter
what the circumstances -- to have much sympathy for the disappointed
fans and their banged-up colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to enjoy it,'' said Jeffrey Hammonds, who found out
he was replacing Barry Bonds on the roster in the eighth inning of
Colorado's game Sunday night against Anaheim. ''It's not a burden.
This is what it's all about. It's ironic that it took an injury,
but if that's what it's going to take ...''
</P>
<P>
   With a record eight players selected for the team -- Bonds, Mark
McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Mike Piazza, Greg Maddux, Cal Ripken,
Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez -- missing the game, there will be
more players in the training room than on the field this week.
</P>
<P>
   That will surely leave fans who paid between $100-150 a ticket a
bit unhappy -- and some players as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too bad because these are the guys I enjoy watching,
too,'' said Baltimore shortstop Mike Bordick, added to the team
when Ripken opted out with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that NL manager Bobby Cox put out a cross-country
alert for a third-string All-Star catcher to take Piazza's place on
the roster. He finally found the Cubs' Joe Girardi after his first
two choices couldn't make it. Javy Lopez went back home to Puerto
Rico and Todd Hundley is tending to a sick family member and turned
down an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has put a bit of a damper on the game, but it will give
some up and coming players a chance to show what they can do,'' Los
Angeles outfielder Gary Sheffield said. ''A lot of people will get
to see what these guys can do for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is especially excited to watch Montreal slugger
Vladimir Guerrero, starting in left instead of the fans' choice,
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The six other fill-in starters are also in the All-Star lineup
for the first time in their careers: Jim Edmonds, Andres Galarraga,
Jason Kendall, Derek Jeter, Carl Everett and Travis Fryman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys who are replacing everybody are still All-Stars,''
Griffey said. ''When you look at their numbers, they've done as
well as everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback stories of Galarraga and Kendall are particularly
touching. Galarraga missed all of 1999 battling cancer, while
Kendall's right ankle was nearly torn off in a frightful accident
about a week before last year's game.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is replacing McGwire, perhaps the most disappointing
no-show for fans who were eagerly awaiting Big Mac's Home Run Derby
power display.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall will start in place of Piazza, who sustained a slight
concussion after being hit in the helmet by a pitch from Roger
Clemens on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be cool to hear my name announced with all the other
great players in the lineup,'' Kendall said. ''It will be a
chilling moment. I just wish it were on different terms.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the injured players have accounted for 66 All-Star
appearances, led by Ripken's 17, putting a new face on this year's
game. There are 11 first-time starters -- the most since 1993 -- and
pregame introductions will be a must-see for casual fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the only upside to that is there are so many more
deserving players that the roster allows you to have,'' AL manager
Joe Torre said. ''Now you're able to honor more. It's a big thrill
to see the faces of these guys when they come into that
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be particularly odd for Fryman, who has made four
All-Star appearances before this year, backing up Ripken each time.
</P>
<P>
   As a shortstop with Detroit from 1992-94, Fryman played behind
Ripken. When he switched to third base in 1996, Ripken was there
too, ahead of him once again on the All-Star depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   With Ripken home this week, Fryman gets his first start.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an All-Star game if I'm playing behind Cal,'' Fryman
said. ''I've always been his caddie. The highlight for me is always
taking grounders with Cal and having a locker next to him. It will
be a different experience.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign To Support Family Planning  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One of America's richest foundations launched a
multimillion-dollar education campaign Monday aimed at getting the
American public and the U.S. Congress to support family planning
programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year campaign, funded by The David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, is backed by leading women's, children's and
environmental groups who say family planning is the key to saving
the lives of mothers, children and planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''For so many years the adversaries of family planning have been
very loud and very vocal,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., one of the partners in the
campaign. ''I think it is high time for the message of the
importance of being able to plan and space your family to be out
there just as strongly as the adversaries are delivering their
message.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which is receiving about $13 million from the
Packard foundation for the first year, plans to deliver several
messages in television, newspaper and magazine advertisements as
well as at meetings with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''International family planning can reduce population pressures
on our planet,'' said John Flicker, president of the National
Audubon Society, another campaign partner. ''It is our best
opportunity to address the single most important root cause of
environmental degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also stressing that family planning could save
about 3 million children's lives a year by helping women to space
births at least two years apart, and it could save the lives of
some of the 600,000 women who die every year from complications of
pregnancy and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple truth is that a lot of couples don't plan their
families because they can't,'' said Amy Coen, president of
Population Action International. ''One hundred fifty million
married women in the developing world would use family planning
services if they were available. They are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants said the campaign would serve to remind the
American public that the United States is no longer playing a
leadership role in international family planning, primarily because
anti-abortion forces in Congress have cut funding for overseas
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign partners also include CARE and Save the Children.
</P>
<P>
   In a message for World Population Day on Tuesday,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan stressed the need to stabilize world
population and ensure that women can make key decisions about their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many girls do not have the same chance of education as
boys. Too many women still cannot choose when or whether to become
pregnant. Too many women resort to abortions that are not safe,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Safety McDonald Retires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Safety Tim McDonald, released five
months ago by the San Francisco 49ers, retired Monday after 13 NFL
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who played in the Pro Bowl six times, was released by
the 49ers in February as the team struggled to get under the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, 35, was one of several veterans asked to renegotiate
his contract and reduce his salary, and he was cut when a deal
could not be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald spent the first six years of his pro career with the
Arizona Cardinals before joining the 49ers in 1993 as a free agent.
He started 111 out of 112 possible games for San Francisco, and
earned a Super Bowl ring in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He said Monday he had considered playing for only one other
team, the Carolina Panthers, who are coached by former 49ers coach
George Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally realized that there was just no way I could have
given the type of energy and commitment that it takes. I realize
that it is time to say 'No' to the abuse to my body and time to say
'Yes' to my family and other interests,'' he said. ''I gave so much
of my heart and desire to the 49ers.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh said McDonald was a
great athlete and a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tim was one of the greatest performers in contemporary
football and there are those who would state flatly that he was the
best strong safety to ever play the game,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who said he will focus on running his World Sports
Cafe in Fresno, said it was time to move on after 10 operations and
several concussions.

<HEADLINE> House OK's Easing Drug Import Rules  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing public resentment of high
prescription drug prices, the House voted overwhelmingly Monday to
prevent the government from discouraging the purchase of drugs in
Canada or other countries.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of Americans have been going to Canada,
Mexico and other countries to purchase prescription drugs cheaper
than what they cost in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it's illegal to import prescription drugs that were
originally made in the United States, and the Food and Drug
Administration sometimes sends warning letters to people caught
doing it. The agency gives its employees discretion to permit
imports of drugs that violate its restrictions so long as they are
intended for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved, 363-12, an amendment to an FDA
appropriations bill that would prevent the agency from enforcing
the importation ban, so long as the drugs are for personal use. A
second amendment, approved 370-12, would bar the agency from
sending the warning letters.
</P>
<P>
   ''People's lives are being shortened today because of the
abnormally high and ridiculously increased price of
prescriptions,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cost controls, drugs can cost several times less in
Canada, Mexico and Europe than in the United States, leading some
Americans to buy their pharmaceuticals by mail order or else join
bus trips across the border to fill their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Prilosec, a popular ulcer medication, costs $400
for 100 capsules in New York but $184 in Canada and $107 in Mexico,
said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prescription drugs and medicines are not a luxury, they are a
necessity,'' added Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Monday, the House defeated an amendment, 187-182,
that would have barred the FDA from testing, developing or
approving abortion-inducing pills like the drug RU-486. The House
had approved a similar measure in 1998 and 1999, but the Senate had
refused each time to go along with the restriction. Sixty-six
members missed Monday's House vote.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said in February that it would approve sale of
RU-486, also known as mifepristone, once some final, but
undisclosed, requirements were met.
</P>
<P>
   High drug prices have emerged as a significant issue in this
year's political campaigns. Polling indicates the issue of
prescription drugs is a priority for Americans 65 and older, a
group that accounted for more than one-quarter of voters in the
1998 elections and is regarded as a key swing group in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pushed a bill through the House last month that
would use private insurance and federal subsidies to cover some of
the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the legislation. He and
congressional Democrats are advocating a more encompassing but also
costlier alternative: a uniform, government-run prescription drug
benefit, offered to all 39 million elderly and disabled Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokesman Lawrence Bachorik said the agency is concerned
that the House legislation could undermine its ''ability to protect
consumers and patients from substandard, poorly manufactured or
otherwise risky drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA stands ready to work with Congress on these issues,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R.4461.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Travel Firm Settles Complaint  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As part of a federal crackdown on travel
fraud, a Wisconsin company and its managers have settled charges
that they lured customers with ''free'' trips only to make them pay
hundreds of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants James Burns and John Bundy will be permanently banned
from travel-related telemarketing for misrepresenting the value of
the trips or telling consumers that they had won free vacations,
according to the Federal Trade Commission complaint. Both men were
senior officers at First Impressions, which also operated under the
name ''Air-Land-Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers should never have to pay phantom charges to collect
a so-called free vacation,'' said Jodie Bernstein, head of the
FTC's consumer protection bureau. ''When you hear the words,
'you've won a free vacation,' ask about the fees. A healthy dose of
skepticism may save you a suitcase full of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the latest in the FTC's ''Operation Trip
Trap,'' a series of complaints against 25 travel companies
presented last August. The FTC filed suit against five companies --
three are now settled, including the one announced Monday --
accusing them of deceptive practices. An additional 20 companies
faced charges by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC complaint, consumers filled out postcards
at restaurants, fairs and other events, believing they were
entering a drawing for free vacations. Air-Land-Sea representatives
called the consumers telling them that they had won an
all-inclusive vacation package at popular locations such as
Orlando, Fla., or Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Then the representatives told consumers that ''incidental''
charges ranging up to $299 per person had to be paid separately, as
well as port fees. Additional travelers had to pay extra, and once
on the trip, consumers found they had to pay ''upgrade'' fees at
the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the consumers sometimes found their cruise or hotel
wasn't paid for, and many were pressured into attending day-long
timeshare presentations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's consumers have already recieved more than $600,000
in reimbursements since the case was filed, according to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Between July of 1998 and 1999, the FTC received nearly 2,500
travel-related complaints worth more than $610,000 in alleged
consumer losses. Of those complaints, nearly a third were against
companies based in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Russia Releases New Foreign Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov announced a new
foreign policy doctrine Monday, saying the policies will trim
Russia's interests abroad to conserve scarce resources and place
more emphasis on assisting the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said the country should pursue only those foreign policy
objectives that it can afford and will help build a stronger state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point is to make our policy more rational, more profitable
in the political and economic sense,'' Ivanov told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister did not provide specifics on how he
intended to implement the new goals. However, by trimming interests
he was likely referring, in part, to reducing Russia's extensive
overseas obligations.
</P>
<P>
   He said the country will focus on building alliances with
regional powers, strengthen ties with important trading partners
and work within the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine's introduction follows Putin's state of the nation
address Saturday, which called for an end to waffling on government
policy, strengthening the central government and allowing a free
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Putin government's previous policy pronouncements have
included a new security doctrine broadening the Kremlin's authority
to use nuclear weapons and a so-called information security
doctrine, which strengthens the government's role in monitoring
information flows in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy doctrine says the government should ''insist
on its lawful rights'' in the foreign policy field, and have a
''realistic'' approach to Russia's interests, Ivanov told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The document reflects Russian bitterness over NATO's eastward
expansion, which many in Russia consider a betrayal by the West.
''Certain plans related to establishing new, equitable and mutually
advantageous partnership relations ... have not been justified,''
the document reads.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine identifies the struggle against international
terrorism, ''which is capable of destabilizing the situation not
only in individual states, but in entire regions,'' as the most
important task of Russian foreign policy. Moscow contends that
international terrorists are responsible for Russia's war in
breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Main foreign policy goals, such as lifting economic sanctions
against Iraq -- a major debtor nation to Russia -- and defeating a
U.S. proposal to build a limited national missile defense system,
remain unchanged, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The missile defense system is a path to a unipolar world,''
Ivanov said, referring to what Russia calls U.S. dominance of world
affairs. He said Putin will discuss the matter with President
Clinton at the summit of the G-8 group of developed nations in
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. missile defense plans ''require a response from those
states whose security is put in jeopardy,'' and if implemented,
''Russia will also be required to take appropriate steps, but it's
not our choice,'' Ivanov added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will continue to co-sponsor the Middle East peace
process, together with the United States, he said. Ivanov said
Putin would discuss strategic alliances with China during a visit
to Beijing next week.
</P>
<P>
   On wider themes, Ivanov said the country has no ambitions to
revive its lost empire. But he said Russia deserves a special place
in the world because of its vast natural resources, military power
and rich intellectual and spiritual heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia was, is and will always be a superpower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine is the first announced since a post-Communist
foreign policy reassessment in 1993. In that doctrine, Russia
lowered its guard and focused on courting aid and advice from
Western Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross &AMP; Supremes Tour Canceled  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Diana Ross won't be keeping many more fans
hanging on -- the plug has been pulled on her ersatz Supremes
reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour suffered from bad karma ever since it was revealed that
Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, who performed with Ross in the
Supremes in the 1960s, refused to join because they felt they
weren't being paid enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ross soldiered on with Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne, two
women who had joined the Supremes after she had left in 1969, but
they sang in some arenas to more empty seats than fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people realized it wasn't a true Supremes reunion and
it cast a negative pall on the tour before it even started,'' said
Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar, a concert industry trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices ranging from $42.50 to $250 per seat didn't help,
either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supremes performed in 12 cities before dates were cancelled
without explanation Friday on Long Island and Sunday in Washington.
Ross and the Supremes were to perform in Pittsburgh on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, in a statement, said she was ''severely disappointed''
that concert promoters SFX had decided to cancel the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would sing the same if there were 10 people in the audience
or 10,000,'' Ross said. ''I love the music and the fans, and I will
find a way to reconnect with them as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the biggest business disasters yet for SFX, the
company that dominates the concert industry. Industry insiders
speculated that they paid too much for Ross and overestimated her
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that SFX decided to cut its losses,'' said Bob
Grossweiner, a concert industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Ross' statement, a spokesman for the company would only
confirm that three concert dates had been canceled. He did not
return several phone calls after her statement was released.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, in an interview with The Associated Press last month, said
she had contacted Wilson and Birdsong to see if they would be
interested in performing this summer. When they said they would,
she turned negotiations over to the show's producers
</P>
<P>
   But the women complained publicly that Ross would be getting
much more money than them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think that Mary had the vision at all to
understand that this was not about money,'' Ross said. ''I really
think it's shortsighted, if you know what I mean. Because five
years from now, we wouldn't be able to do this tour.''
</P>
<P>
   On this tour, Ross and her new companions were singing some of
the biggest Supremes hits from the 1960s, including ''Stop! In the
Name of Love,'' ''Baby Love'' and ''You Keep Me Hangin' On.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when they played in Columbus, Ohio on June 20, there were
fewer than 3,000 people in a 22,000-seat arena.

<HEADLINE> Judge Bars Pacific Lumber Logging  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge on Monday barred the Pacific Lumber
Co. from using huge helicopters to pluck trees from private land
surrounded by the Headwaters Forest Reserve, the nation's newest
wilderness sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and another group sued to block the logging plan
for ''the hole in the Headwaters,'' a 705-acre parcel that Pacific
Lumber got last year as part of the $480 million deal to create the
new preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Quentin Kopp, who heard one day of arguments in Eureka
earlier this month, issued a temporary restraining order pending a
full trial later this summer. He said ''irreparable injury will
occur to the public interest'' if the area is logged without first
exploring the environmentalists' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp also ordered the Sierra Club and the Garberville-based
Environmental Protection Information Center to post a $250,000 bond
against losses Pacific Lumber says it will suffer if logging is
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear that we have to pay it, but our lawyers are
looking into it,'' said EPIC Executive Director Paul Mason. ''It's
really shocking because the rest of the ruling is very much in our
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the public had to post bond every time they wanted to stop
someone from logging or polluting, that would have a chilling
effect on the public's ability to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopp acknowledged in his 19-page ruling that EPIC might not have
the resources to pay the bond, but said the Sierra Club, with its
''vast financial resources,'' certainly does.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber had asked for a bond of $1 million or more. In a
statement, the company said it was ''obviously disappointed with
the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we are confident that we will prevail on the merits
of the case during the upcoming trial,'' Pacific Lumber Chief
Executive John Campbell said. ''Our inability to operate on this
plan will result in hardship for the company and our employees, as
the judge recognized in the his requirement that a bond be
posted.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber had argued that it would lose about $8 million
and have to lay off workers if it is not allowed to log the
property.

reported nor structures lost since the fire was sparked by
lightning July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lower temperatures, higher humidity and spotty showers helped
firefighters bring the fire under control over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the fire burned dense stands of juniper. Wind-whipped
flames that reached 20 to 70 feet forced the closure of several
Sweetwater County roads and threatened a power line.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also caused a spectacular smoke plume visible from Rock
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the fire weakened, becoming a smoldering
ground fire with some isolated torching of juniper stands.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, fire officials began pulling firefighters away from
an 11,033-acre fire, hoping to keep them rested in case more large
fires break out.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center said the
lightning-sparked blaze, which has burned land in and around the
Dinosaur National Monument in extreme northwestern Colorado, should
be fully contained Tuesday or Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Fire information officer Dennis Saville said the fire was 95
percent contained Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend two other major wildfires in western Colorado
were brought under control. The Cone Mountain fire near Gateway
burned 4,580 acres and the blaze near Rangely burned 1,700 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, firefighters were working to extinguish two
lightning-caused fires in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park. Both
fires, which started Sunday, were less than an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Other smaller fires were contained over the weekend east of Rock
Springs, near Medicine Bow National Forest, west of Cheyenne and in
the Big Horn Mountains in north-central Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Rise in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL BALINT-KURTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Military leader Gen. Robert Guei has
embarked on a campaign to disarm and expel disloyal soldiers who
were part of an army mutiny last week.
</P>
<P>
   Guei said in a state television address late Sunday that
soldiers who staged the July 4-5 incident would be judged by a
special military tribunal and ejected from the army.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mutiny, loyalist army and paramilitary police troops
have searched door to door in Abidjan neighborhoods for hidden arms
caches.
</P>
<P>
   The government warned over the weekend that those refusing to
give up their arms would be disarmed by ''any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Two mutineers, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned the
tensions could escalate into open fighting unless the government
ends the crackdown and gives payouts promised to soldiers during
the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters initially demanded housing bonuses worth $9,000
but eventually agreed to a sum of $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's spokesman, Desire-Paulin Dakoury, said Monday they would
be paid later in the week. The cash-strapped government, one of
Africa's most indebted, has defaulted on some foreign debts and is
struggling to pay civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Dakoury said the junta had arrested an unspecified number of
mutineers. The military government has described the incident as an
attempted coup d'etat orchestrated by opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank of West African States, which oversees the
currency shared by Ivory Coast and seven regional countries,
meanwhile said Monday it was suspending its activities in Ivory
Coast due to instability. The decision sparked a rush on banks,
which either closed or limited withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day mutiny closely resembled Ivory Coast's first coup
d'etat last Christmas Eve. In both uprisings, soldiers fired guns
in the air, seized cars from civilians and looted stores and banks.

<HEADLINE> Big Lineup of All-Star No-Shows  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Joe Torre always could count on Boomer in big
spots.
</P>
<P>
   So in an All-Star game hit by so many injuries that it's become
the ''All-Scar'' game, the New York Yankees manager had no trouble
picking a starting pitcher for the American League.
</P>
<P>
   He chose David Wells, naturally. The same guy who went 4-0 for
the Yankees in the 1998 postseason and then was traded away for
Roger Clemens. The same character who leads the majors with 15 wins
for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a point to prove,'' Wells said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His shaved head gleaming, Wells turned to Torre and added with a
playful grin peeking out from his bushy goatee, ''I know what I'm
capable of doing at any time and right now, if I wanted to, I could
strangle Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughed Torre: ''The only thing I could say is, if it was just
to prove a point, you've done that, so you can stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, Torre probably wishes he could have Wells for the
rest of the season. The two-time World Series champions are full of
problems in their rotation -- and that before Roger Clemens'
beanball to Mike Piazza started such a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the way things have been going lately, Torre and
NL manager Bobby Cox might be happy just to have enough healthy
bodies for Tuesday night's game at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Seven elected starters, along with Atlanta pitcher Greg Maddux,
are out of action. That total does not include Boston ace Pedro
Martinez, who was not picked because he was hurt. And Cleveland
second baseman Roberto Alomar is ''iffy'' with a bruised arm, Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Never before in 70 All-Star games had more than five players
selected for the original rosters needed replacements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 11 players will start an All-Star game for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lineup has changed many times,'' Cox said. ''I had a
lineup really set, etched in stone here about 10 days ago. Our guys
stopped dropping a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidelined for the NL: Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Barry
Bonds, Piazza and Maddux. Out for the AL: Cal Ripken, Alex
Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, Vladimir Guerrero, Jim Edmonds, Jason Kendall,
Travis Fryman, Derek Jeter and Carl Everett will start in their
places.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, slowed by a sore right knee, made the trip to take part
in the home run derby Monday night. Sammy Sosa stopped Junior's
two-year run as champion, hitting a pair of 500-foot shots.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Colorado outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds arrived
as a late replacement for the NL. Cox was still a player short,
though, after Piazza pulled out with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was up at 1:15 last night, trying to find a catcher,'' Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley of the Dodgers was asked to play, but could not
attend because of an illness in his family. Javy Lopez of the
Braves had already left for Puerto Rico. The Cubs' Joe Girardi was
eventually found and added to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young winner Randy Johnson will start for the NL, even though
he worked seven innings Sunday for Arizona. He becomes the first
pitcher to start in both leagues since Vida Blue did it for the AL
in 1975 and the NL in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Bobby I'd be available unless I threw 140, 150 pitches,
which wasn't the case yesterday,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The AL has won three straight games, yet the NL leads the
overall series 40-29-1. Home run champion Hank Aaron will throw out
the first ball -- he homered in 1972 when the game was last played
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With so much emphasis on lively balls this season, Wells (15-2,
3.44 ERA) and Johnson (14-2, 1.80 ERA, major league-leading 198
strikeouts) will take the mound at one of the few ballparks left
where pitching usually rules.
</P>
<P>
   Wells started the 1998 game at Coors Field while with the
Yankees. Johnson, who will likely pitch only one inning, started in
1995 and 1997 while with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For Wells, this is a chance to play again with former Yankees
teammates Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams and Jeter.
He also gets to play under Torre, who did his best to tolerate
Boomer's antics -- on the mound, in the clubhouse and all about
town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been on some great teams. Best team ever in '98,'' Wells
said.
</P>
<P>
   At spring training in 1999, the Yankees sent Wells in a package
to the Blue Jays for Clemens, a five-time Cy Young winner. Wells is
32-12 since that deal while Clemens is 20-16.
</P>
<P>
   ''When things happen like that, you just have to treat it as
business. You don't hold any regrets over it,'' he said. ''To me,
New York was a place where I wanted to play. That's where I wanted
to end my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But they had a chance to get Roger Clemens. I think you'd be
crazy not to because he's an outstanding pitcher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, a lot of Yankees fans would undo that deal in a
minute. But Wells, trying to pitch Toronto past New York in the AL
East, is not gloating.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go out there and wish bad things on the Yankees, that's not
going to happen,'' he said. ''I can't worry about what the Yankees
are doing.''

<HEADLINE> White Supremacist's Trial Underway  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers for white supremacist Buford O.
Furrow moved Monday to dismiss numerous charges against him,
claiming legal flaws in his indictment on hate-crime allegations in
a shooting at a Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   Among the claims in six separate defense motions is an argument
that the North Valley Jewish Community Center does not fall within
legal definitions of places covered by civil rights hate crime
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Five counts of the indictment contend that on Aug. 10 Furrow
shot and wounded three boys, a teen-age girl and a receptionist at
the center while they were ''enjoying the goods, services,
facilities, privileges and advantages of the North Valley Jewish
Community Center, a place of exhibition and entertainment which
serves the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said that in fact the center exists to serve the Jewish
community, not the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that while the center may open some of its
programs to nonmembers ''it serves not the public, but the Jewish
community, Jewish heritage and Jewish way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The original indictment in the case did not address the Jewish
Community Center shootings, but it was later superseded to include
those charges. The defense asked that they be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the indictment is a murder charge accusing Furrow,
37, of fatally shooting Filipino-American letter carrier Joseph
Ileto on the same day as the community center attack. The
government seeks the death penalty on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   The defense motions indicated there will probably be a mental
illness defense for Furrow, either in the guilt phase or penalty
phase of his trial, but the lawyers have not given official notice
of their intent.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Attorney's spokeswoman said prosecutors had not studied
the motions yet and would have no comment. They have until August
to file responses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Henri Gault, a food critic and co-founder of the
GaultMillau food guide that helped launch nouvelle cuisine around
the world, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Gault and Christian Millau founded the annual GaultMillau
restaurant guide in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   With its colorful comments on food, atmosphere and decor that
blended feisty criticism with warm praise, the guide quickly caught
on among the French. It went on to become a serious rival to the
more established Michelin guide.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants in the GaultMillau guide are rated on a score of
1-20, and chefs awarded a maximum of four ''toques,'' or chefs'
hats. The Michelin guide awards a maximum of three ''macaroons,''
or stars, for restaurants rated ''worth the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gault's best-known works are ''Gault and Millau Eat
Dinner,'' ''My 50 Best Restaurants in France,'' ''Europe's Top 300
Restaurants'' and ''The Guide to Foreign Restaurants in Paris.''
Robert Hutchinson:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Robert Hutchinson, a horse racing aficionado who
ran an advertising agency and published trucking magazines, died
July 3 of complications from a fall. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson worked at the Western (Advertising) Agency, founded
by his father, Brubaker Hutchinson, an early partner in Longacres
Race Course. Western, based in Seattle, became Newport Publication
Group, which published several trucking-industry periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   After his father died in 1962, Hutchinson became a partner in
the track and served as secretary-treasurer of the Washington
Jockey Club until Longacres closed on Sept. 21,1992, after a
59-year run.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his second wife, four sons, two daughters, and
six grandchildren.
Vahe Oshagan:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vahe Oshagan, critically acclaimed
Armenian-language poet, died June 30 of complications from heart
surgery. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He was famed in Armenian intellectual circles for his eight
volumes of poetry, six volumes of fiction, and many short stories,
plays and commentaries. Most of his works were written in Armenian
but some have been translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Oshagan is credited with having revolutionized Armenian poetry
by rejecting its imposed formality, often writing in colloquial
language. He was also hailed for giving a voice to the Armenian
diaspora.
Warren Reynolds:
</P>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Warren Reynolds, a broadcaster who
spent 36 years at television station WOOD, including 31 years as
sports director, died Sunday of prostate cancer. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Reynold's father, legendary sports announcer Bob Reynolds, was
sports director of Detroit radio station WJR for 25 years and
announced Detroit Lions and Michigan State University football
games.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Reynolds announced Spartans games with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Reynolds arrived at WOOD as sports director in 1964
and held the post until 1995. He remained an air personality at the
station with his ''Community Network 8'' and ''Positively
Michigan'' broadcast segments.
</P>
<P>
   He recently became the first recipient of the Grand Rapids
Sports Hall of Fame's lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, four children and eight
grandchildren.
Harold Sack:
</P>
<P>
   OCEANSIDE, N.Y. (AP) -- Harold Sack, America's foremost period
furniture dealer who paid $12.1 million for an 18th century Newport
desk-bookcase in 1989, died Saturday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Sack bought the mahogany secretary at Christie's for what was
then the highest auction price ever for an item other than a
painting.
</P>
<P>
   The desk, which he bought for a Texas financier, originally was
owned by Nicholas Brown, of Providence, R.I., and his family, for
whom Brown University is named.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s to the 1990s, Sack shattered auction price
records for American furniture. In 1977, he set the record of
$135,000 when he bought a Boston bombe chest. Three years later, he
pushed the record to $396,000, for a block-front Newport chest.
</P>
<P>
   He set the record again in 1983, paying $687,500 for a Newport
kneehole desk at Sotheby's.
Parke Thompson:
</P>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Parke Thompson, who was described in The
Guinness Book of Records as being one of the world's most-traveled
people, died Sunday from a heart aneurysm. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson once said that receiving the 1989 Guinness edition,
which included a photo of him at the South Pole as the
most-traveled man, was the realization of a dream. He got the honor
by visiting 309 countries, territories and island groups in the
world, as defined by Guinness. He was listed in the book from 1984
to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Travel had been a passion since Thompson's grandparents took him
to England and Germany when he was 7. He spent more than 31 years
seeing the world through the viewfinder of his camera.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who also had a 55-year law practice, shot more than
70,000 photos on the 37 trips it took to achieve the record. His
journeys provided the basis of ''Around the World in 60 Minutes,''
a slide show he presented for community and private groups, and
helped illustrate a Life magazine profile on him in May 1987.
Laurel Vlock:
</P>
<P>
   WOODBRIDGE, Conn. (AP) -- Laurel Vlock, a producer and director
whose films about Holocaust survivors served as models for Steven

</P>
<P>
   In 1979 she founded the Holocaust Survivors Film Project Inc.,
which videotaped testimony from Holocaust survivors. The films are
deposited at the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies
at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Vlock won an Emmy Award in 1981 for ''Forever Yesterday,'' a
documentary about Holocaust survivors.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Annan: Serb Massacre To Haunt UN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- On the fifth anniversary of the worst
massacre in Europe since World War II, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said the United Nations' failure to help save thousands of Bosnian
Muslims from a Serb mass murder will forever haunt the world body.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of disarmed and defenseless men and boys who had been
led to believe that the United Nations would ensure their safety
were killed in the forests around Srebrenica, Annan said in a
statement to mark Tuesday's anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 11, 1995, just a few months before the end of the
3&AMP;frac12;-year war, Bosnian Serb forces overran the eastern town, which
was designated a U.N.-protected zone. When the slaughter was
finished, as many as 8,000 men and boys older than 14 were missing.
The remains of some 2,500 have been exhumed.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing his ''deepest regret and remorse'' to the families of
the victims, the secretary-general said ''we cannot undo this
tragedy, but it is vitally important that the right lessons be
learned and applied in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragedy of Srebrenica will forever haunt the history of
the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said it was important not to be forget that the architects
of the Srebrenica massacre have been indicted by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal but remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fact alone suggests that the most important lesson of
Srebrenica -- that we must recognize evil for what it is, and
confront it not with expediency and compromise but with implacable
resistance -- has yet to be fully learned and applied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in December on the 1995 massacres, Annan said the
United Nations failed to help save the Bosnian Muslims because of
errors, misjudgment and ''an inability to recognize the scope of
the evil confronting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who headed U.N. peacekeeping operations during the war in
Bosnia, said the United Nations treated Serbs and Muslims equally
when they should have made a ''moral judgment'' that the Serbs'
campaign of ethnic cleansing was evil.

<HEADLINE> 3 Thought Dead in Submerged Truck  </HEADLINE>
By MARK THIESSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- An adult and two children were
presumed dead Monday after the truck they were in plunged into the
Missouri River at a local park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard kids screaming. The truck went under so fast,'' said
Jeremy Johnston, 22, who was standing on a dock about 25 feet away
when the truck entered the river.
</P>
<P>
   The truck jumped off a 25-foot river bank Monday evening at
Narrows County Park, directly across the river from Omaha, Neb.'s
Eppley Airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said it did not appear that the adult driver made any
effort to stop the vehicle, which sped off an access road about 100
feet from the river.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't try to swerve, no brake lights, nothing,'' said
Conrad Santon, 26, who also saw the truck from the dock. ''I heard
the engine rev up when they got close to the bank. It was insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers searched for the vehicle in 24 feet of water, battling
currents strong enough to pull off their face masks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big struggle down there,'' said Council Bluffs Fire
Chief Alan Byers, who added authorities believe the vehicle's
occupants were an adult and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers in boats and on the river's banks frantically
searched for the vehicle for more than two hours before the rescue
effort was called off. Authorities then focused on recovering the
bodies of the vehicle's occupants.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Coast Guard cutter was being used to drag the river's
bottom.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Marlies Askamp had a season-high 21 points and 13
rebounds to lead the Miami Sol to a 59-42 victory over the fellow
expansion Seattle Storm on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Askamp, who shot 4-for-6 from the field and 13-for-18 from the
free-throw line, was Miami's only player in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Lovelace was the only Seattle player in double figures
with 11 points in 14 minutes as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (7-12) failed to reach 60 points for the 15th time this
season. The Sol, who entered the game last in the WNBA in scoring
and field-goal percentage, shot just 24 percent from the field
(10-for-41). They went 1-for-6 from 3-point range, but did convert
38-of-55 foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-16), next to last in scoring and field-goal

S. Korea Bank Workers Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Tens of thousands of bank workers went on strike
Tuesday after failing to obtain government guarantees for their job security.
The union is concerned the government's plans to restructure the industry would
spur bank mergers and lead to layoffs. The initial impact appeared limited, as
banks opened using non-union employees or union members who opposed the walkout.
Last-minute efforts to prevent the strike ended after bank union leaders walked
out of talks with government officials which lasted 6&AMP;frac12; hours.

Nation Faces Blood Shortage

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An ever-increasing demand for blood combined with summer's
customary donor drop-off have created a critical nationwide shortage, blood bank
officials said today. The American Red Cross said there is a need for all blood
types. The shortage has reached crisis proportions in the New York metropolitan
region, said Dr. Robert Jones, president and CEO of the New York Blood Center.
He said the shortage has forced the center to reduce blood shipments to New York
and New Jersey hospitals by as much as 75 percent.

House OK's Easing Drug Import Rules

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing public resentment of high prescription drug
prices, the House voted overwhelmingly today to prevent the government from
discouraging the purchase of drugs in Canada or other countries. An increasing
number of Americans have been going to Canada, Mexico and other countries to
purchase prescription drugs cheaper than what they cost in the United States.
Technically, it's illegal to import prescription drugs that were originally made
in the United States, and the Food and Drug Administration sometimes sends
warning letters to people caught doing it.

splitting the proceeds. Mayor Paul Jadin announced the deal Monday that would
allow the naming rights -- which are sold to a company for the right to put its
name on a property -- to go on sale in 2003. That's the target date for
completing a $295 million expansion and renovation of the stadium that the
Packers contend is critical to keep the team financially competitive in the
National Football League.
The plan must clear several hurdles first.

<HEADLINE> Colombia President Outlaws Genocide  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a hard-fought victory for human
rights activists, President Andres Pastrana on Monday signed a law
that officially outlaws genocide and forced disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   The law put the crimes on the books, sets sentences as high as
45 years and creates a commission to investigate the fate of an
estimated 3,000 missing people.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said that by signing the law he had once vetoed, he was
paying homage to the ''the spirit of so many who suffered and the
families who have searched desperately for their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members of the disappeared -- mostly leftists thought to
have been abducted and killed by security forces during the South
American country's 36-year guerrilla war -- cheered the law.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Herney, president of the Association of the Families of
the Disappeared called it ''a very important step.'' However, she
said laws are often promulgated in Colombia and then not enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who pledged progress on human rights in lobbying for a
$1.3 billion U.S. anti-narcotics aid package approved last month,
shocked family advocates when he vetoed the law in December.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana cited objections by his military that the legislation
could expose soldiers to genocide charges for killing guerrillas in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The revised law cleared Colombia's congress in May and was
applauded, despite some reservations, by local human rights groups
and U.N. rights monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Herney has sought justice in the case of her husband, a
landscape painter who was abducted and tortured to death in 1989
after being jailed for guerrilla membership. Nobody has ever been
tried for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to eliminate opponents without leaving a trace,
disappearances were employed by some rightist regimes in Latin
America during the 1970s and 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Challenges Ministers  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- In an effort to curb the spread of AIDS
among the black population, the Rev. Jesse Jackson issued a
challenge to local ministers: take an HIV test, and do it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spoke Monday before a service at an Indianapolis church,
kicking off the 30th Summer Celebration of the Indiana Black Expo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The minister tends to have the moral authority,'' Jackson said
before the service, which attracted an estimated 400 people. ''You
have to have the courage to take the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson, Attorney General Karen
Freeman-Wilson and several area ministers accepted Jackson's
challenge and were tested for HIV at the church Monday. Jackson
also was tested.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also challenged professional athletes and other public
leaders to take the AIDS test.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us are safe until all of us are safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said community leaders should take the test publicly to
help people of all races and economic backgrounds learn that
getting tested for the virus that causes AIDS is not taboo.
</P>
<P>
   ''However you may have gotten it, early detection leads to early
correction,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Expo's Summer Celebration, billed as the largest
exposition of its kind focused on the black American community,
will run through July 16, drawing hundreds of thousands of
participants to conferences, concerts, health and job fairs and
other sessions. Some 200,000 attended events last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Expo will feature medical screenings -- for HIV, high blood
pressure, several types of cancers and other diseases -- at a health
fair Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Wins Home Run Derby  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Step aside Junior, Sammy's the man.
</P>
<P>
   Slammin' Sammy Sosa ended Ken Griffey Jr.'s two-year reign as
Home Run Derby champion, hitting the longest, loudest and largest
number of shots at Turner Field on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa beat Griffey 9-2 in the finals and hit 26 overall,
including a pair of 508-foot shots -- one to the 755 Club in the
left-field upper deck and one that came to rest atop the second
green batter's backdrop in straightaway center, below the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here to put on a show. I didn't necessarily come here
to get the win, but I guess I got the win,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries to Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds and Manny Ramirez,
there wasn't nearly the drama of last year, when Griffey won but
McGwire conquered the Green Monster at Fenway Park, with hundreds
of fans filling Lansdowne Street to catch the balls.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's competition, scalpers were dumping tickets with
$50 face value for $10 each.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark McGwire is one of the guys everybody is looking at,''
Sosa said. ''Because he was not here today, I came here to
represent him.''
</P>
<P>
   What started off as a listless, humid night sparked up
immediately when Sosa started swinging. No other player totaled
more than 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sammy made it look easy,'' said Griffey, who has won the derby
three times overall. ''When people in the first couple of rows of
the upper deck are looking up, that's power. I didn't hear oohs and
aahs for my wallscrapers. I heard them for Sammy's upper-deck
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who lost out to McGwire 70-66 for the home-record record
two years ago and 65-63 for last year's title, made flashbulbs
sparkle and fireworks explode in the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals, Sosa beat Boston's Carl Everett 11-6 and
Griffey topped Toronto's Carlos Delgado 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Sosa tied 2-2 in the first round of the finals,
which was split into two rounds with each player allowed five
non-homer swings each.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, practicing his swing in the runway between rounds, then
went ahead with a 429-foot homer to left, took a pitch, and
connected on four straight swings -- hard, long shots of 476, 488,
477 and 443 feet. He added two mores, at 460 feet and 508, while
fans in the crowd of 50,118 stood clapping, chanting his name and
bowing, much like the Wrigley Field bleacher bums pay homage to him
back home in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa finished, he high-fived Griffey and both players
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa thanked his pitcher, Chino Cadahia, the Atlanta Braves'
minor league field coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ''He used to be my manager when I was in the minor leagues in
Texas (Gastonia in 1987). He knows where I like the ball,'' Sosa
said. ''He was throwing me some cookies today. I have to thank him
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who won the titles in 1994 at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Stadium, 1998 at Denver's Coors Field and last year, then failed to
homer in five straight swings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sosa bombed out at Fenway, hitting just one home run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here the last three years and I didn't do anything,''
he said. ''I came here today with a different plan. I went up there
trying to give myself an opportunity. I took a few pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   For a night, Sosa put aside his contract squabble with the Cubs,
who wouldn't extend his contract and then, at the request of their
star, tried to trade him to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to talk about a contract right now because I want
to wait until the year's over and relax,'' Sosa said. ''Whatever
happens from there, happens. I would love to stay in Chicago. This
is the city I want to stay with. But if it doesn't work out, you
know, if I have to go, I don't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know if his performance would cause Cubs president
Andy MacPhail and general manager Ed Lynch to give him the
extension he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing for sure,'' Sosa said. ''They were watching
tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Haas ties for Lead at Public Links  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Defending champion Hunter Haas shot a
1-under par 71 Monday to finish in a five-way tie for the lead
after the first round of the U.S. Amateur Public Links
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, 23, from Norman, Okla., was tied with Mark Farrell, Andy
Roberts, Brad Nurski and Jimmy Walker. They were the only golfers
to shoot under par on the 6,869-yard, par-72 Great Blue Course at
Heron Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Links Championship, in its 75th year, is limited to
players who do not belong to private clubs. The ''blue collar
championship'' is sponsored by the United States Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   The field of 156 will continue stroke play on Tuesday. The low
64 golfers will begin match play on Wednesday, and the championship
will be held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, who won last year at Alton, Ill., is trying to become the
first repeat winner since Billy Tuten won in 1982 and 1983. Only
three others have done it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course played a little more difficult than it would look
like it was set up to play,'' Haas said. ''I'm surprised because I
thought there would be a lot more birdies out there. I could have
had a few more birdies, but putts didn't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 20, who plays at Brescia University in Owensboro, Ky.,
had two double-bogeys but also had seven birdies, tops in the
round.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of the best putting days I've ever had,'' the
5-foot-7, 120-pound Roberts said. ''I made four putts longer than
30 feet for birdie. I was up and down all day. I wanted to create
room the first day so that I could be comfortable making match
play, which is my goal.''

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Coleman Pleads No Contest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets forward Derrick Coleman pleaded
no contest Monday to a disorderly conduct charge stemming from an
incident in a Detroit restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman paid a $100 court fine and has to run a free basketball
clinic for underprivileged children in the city, a 36th District
Court judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Coleman was accused of urinating in front of patrons
at Intermezzo Italian Ristorante and was charged with disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 33, said he was in the restaurant with boxer Thomas
Hearns and Indiana Pacers guard Jalen Rose in the early morning
hours of Aug. 7 when he spilled a drink on his pants and stood to
wipe it off. An employee told police Coleman urinated on the floor
and left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still deny it,'' Coleman told the Detroit Free Press outside
court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also received six months probation.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's attorney, James Feinberg, said Coleman agreed to plead
no contest because of a civil lawsuit pending in Wayne County
Circuit Court. A lawyer for Intermezzo filed the suit seeking
damages in excess of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg also said Coleman had the ''inability to recall all of
the necessary events'' from the Aug. 7 incident.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Coleman's first brush with the law. In April 1998,
Coleman was arrested outside of Chuck's Millionaires Club in
Detroit on a charge of interfering with police business. He pleaded
no contest in that case and agreed to donate $5,000 worth of canned
goods to area food banks.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Coleman was acquitted by a Charlotte judge of a
driving while intoxicated charge. That ended a criminal case
stemming from an Oct. 27 crash that injured three people, including
Hornets teammate Eldridge Recasner.

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The death toll from a string of
earthquakes has risen to seven, while more than 35 people have been
reported injured, the country's civil defense said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The quakes followed Thursday's magnitude 5.9 quake, which killed
four people and was centered 30 miles west of the capital, Managua.
A magnitude 5.2 temblor on Friday killed a 4-year-old boy and two
others, who died when their homes collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The quakes destroyed 600 homes and partially damaged 1,900
others, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of families have refused to return to their homes,
fearing more quakes, and 13,071 people have taken refuge in 11
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Damaged houses have been marked with white flags, and
authorities have begun demolishing those at risk of collapsing.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Says It's Being Cheated  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T accused Verizon Communications Monday of
illegally steering New York customers who call for local phone
service to its own long distance service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said Verizon, formerly Bell Atlantic, has violated
regulations by failing to have ''marketing neutrality'' in selling
long distance service to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bell Atlantic is doing exactly the opposite of what the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 intended. Instead of vigorous
competition on a level playing field, Bell Atlantic's marketing
strategy is to leverage its dominance of the local phone market to
stifle long distance competition,'' said Robert M. Aquilina, senior
vice president of AT&AMP;T's consumer services unit. ''New Yorkers who
call Bell Atlantic for local phone service are not being properly
informed of their long distance choices.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has asked the Federal Communications Commission to force
Verizon to pay damages, and stop Verizon from providing long
distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said it used an outside marketing firm to conduct a survey
earlier this year, finding that in nearly half of test calls, Bell
Atlantic representatives mentioned only Bell Atlantic long distance
service. In two thirds of test cases, AT&AMP;T said, callers weren't
told they had a choice of long distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also alleged that in 5 percent of calls, Bell Atlantic
illegally used information about a customer's existing long
distance service in order to market Bell Atlantic's service.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said that the test calls were made
by customers looking to add a second phone line. In that situation,
Rabe said, the representative is not required to read the list of
long distance options.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think AT&AMP;T is misinterpreting what the rules are,'' Rabe
said. ''And the FCC sees it how we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T confirmed that the marketing firm called about second
lines, but that it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law applies whether it's first or second lines,'' AT&AMP;T
spokesman Jim McGann said. ''They're required to be a neutral party
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Verizon official said that this is another case of AT&AMP;T
blaming other companies for its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case, the problem is that hundreds of thousands of
customers are happily deserting AT&AMP;T for Verizon long distance
service in New York,'' said Edward D. Young III, Verizon's senior
vice president for federal government relations.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said Verizon does comply with non-discrimination rules for
first-time customers.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first battle the two companies have fought in New
York. In March, AT&AMP;T asked the FCC to suspend Bell Atlantic's
authority to provide long distance there because of broken systems
that serve competitors. AT&AMP;T said that customers choosing their
service had their orders ''lost or mishandled'' by Bell Atlantic,
and it took customers several months to change their service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   A comment by Rabe shows the hostility between the
telecommunications behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of saying they've got confusing plans that are too
expensive, they're saying Bell Atlantic is doing something
underhanded,'' Rabe said.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore Says Fun To Continue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tipper Gore says her penchant for spontaneity
and desire for fun will continue even if her husband, Al Gore, is
elected and she becomes first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ''it could be an isolating life, if you weren't
careful about that,'' she told The Washington Post in an interview
published in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's wife, who generally remains protective of
her family's privacy even after decades in public life, said she'll
be able to balance the staid and scripted duties that come with
being first lady with her need to be playful and interact with
people one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can change and adapt. Frankly, I do that very well,'' said
Mrs. Gore, who is known to cruise city streets in a van searching
for homeless people in need of health care. She also is a longtime
advocate for sufferers of mental illness. She once struggled with
clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a larger forum to advocate for issues I feel deeply
about is something I hope I have the opportunity to do, but I don't
see that as inconsistent with being able to continue being the
individual I am and to live life the way that is important to me,''
she told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore said her bout with depression, following a 1989 car
accident that nearly killed the couple's son Albert, taught her
''that I need to set and prioritize my boundaries, and then I need
to enforce them. And I do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I try to remind other women to do that -- that if they
don't take care of themselves, they are going to pay some kind of
price,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of the Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting said
she hasn't had a recurrence of depression, for which she took
antidepressants. Her mental health fitness program consists of
exercise, a balanced lifestyle and plenty of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore once said yes to an Albuquerque event so she could
ride in a hot air balloon and, in Florida, her staff made a detour
to ride Space Mountain at Disney World three times.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the White House Correspondents Association
dinner in April, Mrs. Gore was partying with gays and lesbians at
RFK Stadium and playing the drums while her husband and President
and Mrs. Clinton were stuck in a packed hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the surprise trip she arranged for the couple's
30th wedding anniversary in May, after managing to rearrange her
husband's campaign schedule and conspire with Secret Service to
keep him in the dark. Tucked into his CIA briefing folder was
Tipper's hand-drawn invitation for a helicopter getaway to Bethany
Beach, Del., where they went as teen-agers.
