CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy
Youssef Boutros Ghali said Tuesday that his upcoming visit to
Britain is aimed at promoting bilateral trade relations and
British investments in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for London on a three-day visit, Ghali told
reporters that he will attend a campaign initiated Wednesday by
the British government for promoting the Egyptian market, stepping
up investments in Egypt and increasing bilateral trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The British government has selected Egypt among 10 countries to
promote their markets.
</P>
<P>
The promotion campaign is the first of its kind and out of the
British government's conviction that the Egyptian market is
promising, Ghali said, adding that the British initiative is one
of the fruits brought by Egypt's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister will meet with British officials and more
than 650 British investors to explore investment opportunities and
facilities that Egypt offers to investors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 when Egypt began its economic reforms, including
loosening controls over and privatizing state-owned enterprises,
its GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate has risen from 2
percent to more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its inflation has fallen from 20 percent to under 4 percent and
foreign currency reserves have climbed to 20 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Americans Begin to Vote in Mid-term Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Americans began voting on
Tuesday in national mid-term elections to choose 34 senators, 435
members of the House of Representatives and 36 state governors.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 6 a.m. local time (1100 GMT) in the eastern
states and will begin to close at 6 p.m. (2300 GMT). First results
are expected soon after voting ends.
</P>
<P>
For months, the campaign was overshadowed by the scandal
surrounding President Bill Clinton's relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The House has voted to begin
an impeachment investigation into whether Clinton committed
perjury or obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
However, polls consistently showed that most Americans were not
interested in the scandal and wanted it to end, and the campaign
generally unfolded on a local level.
</P>
<P>
Still, the outcome will have impact on the way the impeachment
process goes forward. If the Republicans win big, they will target
Clinton with renewed confidence. If Democrats hold the line, they
will defend him with fresh tenacity, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
As the races wound down, at least half a dozen Senate races and
up to dozens of House races remained too close to call.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had told a group of Hispanic reporters that Democrats
needed a strong turnout to achieve results.
</P>
<P>
"There are almost three dozen close House races that could go
one way or the other. There are seven close Senate races that
could go one way or the other. And we need a strong turnout,"
Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two national polls showed Democrats with a slight edge when
likely voters were asked which party they would support in their
own congressional district. Gallup gave Democrats a four
percentage-point advantage. The Pew Research Center put the
Democrat lead at two points.
</P>
<P>
The Gallup poll compared the motivation of voters now and just
before the 1994 mid-term elections, when Republicans captured
control of both chambers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 51 percent of Republicans said they were enthusiastic
about voting but only 43 percent of Democrats. This year, the
figures were exactly reversed with 51 percent of Democrats
expressing enthusiasm and 43 percent of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Democrats seemed poised to win the greatest single prize of the
election by capturing the governorship of California. But
Republicans had an excellent chance to gain Florida, Georgia and
Colorado to add to the 32 states they already control, analysts
say.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Trafficking in Women Opens in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Rising unemployment and
poverty, children dropping out of schools, and falling exchange
rates in the region could lead to a possible increase in
trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation,
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of United Nation's Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks to a regional conference on Trafficking
in Women, Mooy warned that deteriorating economic environment was
a cause for serious concern and new approaches and solutions were
required to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Strategies to combat trafficking in women and children must
confront the transboundary and international nature of the
activity," Mooy said pointing out that various bilateral and
multilateral agreements could provide the framework and principles
to approach the issue.
</P>
<P>
On a positive note, Mooy said that despite the economic
situation exacerbating flow of trafficking in women he was glad to
see continuing efforts have been made at all levels to combat the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Conference on Trafficking in Women, being held at
the United Nations conference center between November 3 and 4, is
organized by ESCAP, the International Labor Organization (ILO),
International Organization For Migration and the Asia Women's
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference will discuss and analyze critical
issues pertaining to the issue of action against trafficking,
focusing on new trends, approaches and support needed in the light
of the prevailing political, economic and social environment.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 delegates from various ESCAP member countries, United
Nations bodies and specialized agencies and NGOs working on the
issue are attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> EU Indicates Steady Improvement of Single Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
met two thirds of its commitments under the June 1997 Single
Market Action Plan, says the latest issue of the Scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
The Scoreboard, an EU publication, attributes the single market
progress to the EU's executive European Commission, its Council of
Ministers and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Member states have achieved steady progress on implementing
Single Market legislation, it says.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, 26.7 percent of the items of the Single
Market legislation were not applied by all the member states,
while the figure has dropped to 14.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the publication points out that some member states are
still infringing the directive.
</P>
<P>
Free movement of goods, the Scoreboard says, is the area with
the highest number of infringement cases, but cases concerning
transport, taxation, services and establishment are the most
difficult to resolve.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for Single Market Mario Monti said the
transparency introduced by the Scoreboard is proving to be a
useful tool for highlighting where single market problems persist
and for encouraging member states to rectify these problems.
</P>
<P>
"The latest issue of the Scoreboard confirms that we will have
to continue to focus our efforts on ensuring single market rules
applied in practice through enforcement and raising awareness, on
removing remaining obstacles and on tackling market distortions,"
the commissioner said.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is expected to pay an official visit to Egypt next Monday
for talks with Egyptian leaders over bilateral ties and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Orient radio quoted sources close to the prime minister as
saying that Hariri would arrive in Cairo on Sunday night from
Paris where he would conclude a personal visit to France.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit in Cairo, Hariri will hold talks
with Egyptian leaders, including President Hosni Mubarak and Prime
Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri, on bilateral relations and the stalled
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday next week, Hariri will made speeches at the
headquarters of the Arab League to clarify Lebanon's positions on
regional affairs, especially the recent Wye Plantation peace deal.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of negotiations at the Wye Plantation near
Washington, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Natanyahu signed the agreement on October 23,
which broke the 19-month deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over three months, while Palestinians will crack down on
"terrorists," which has led to the arrest of many Palestinian
militants.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon strongly opposed to the deal, terming it a
"treacherous" accord which will strip the right of all Arabs,
especially the Palestinians, of restoring their freedom and
independence.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Turkish Cypriots to Continue Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said Tuesday that Turkey and Turkish Cypriots are
determined to continue the integration process, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in northern Cyprus after meeting with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, Yilmaz said the integration
process initiated following the European Union (EU) summit in
Luxembourg last December is being carried out "successfully" and
will be continued.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will, as always, extend political and economic support
to Turkish Cypriots in order to help them maintain their
"independent status," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will never leave Turkish Cypriots alone," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriots announced the so-called integration
process after the EU summit in Luxembourg excluded Turkey, the
only supporter of Turkish Cypriots' breakaway republic, from the
EU enlargement process and officially invited Cyprus to the access
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who came to northern Cyprus on a one-day working
visit, stressed that no initiative will result in a positive
outcome unless the Greek Cypriot side gives up its present
position and sits at the negotiation table with Turkish Cypriots
under equal conditions.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, for his part, said the political basis for the Cyprus
peace talks is the recognition of the sovereign and independent
status of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Prevent Use of Force in Iraq: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia is determined to make
every effort to prevent the resort to force in Iraq, Russian
Foreign Ministry's spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing held here Rakhmanin said that Russia was
seriously concerned over the situation around Iraq, which was
caused by Baghdad's decision last Saturday to end the work of the
UN special commission in its territory.
</P>
<P>
The step is "fraught with the failure of further efforts to
resolve the Iraqi problem" and it contradicts earlier
understandings that opened the way to lifting sanctions on Iraq,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Russian position is that only the
U.N. Security Council can sanction the use of force in the event
of a real threat to regional and international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Any unilateral moves can only aggravate the situation in the
region, with unpredictable consequences, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian diplomats are energetically working in New
York and Baghdad to persuade Iraq to revise its decision and
resume full-scale constructive cooperation with the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President to Visit Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad will pay a visit to Beirut in November, with the aim of
holding consultations with top Lebanese officials to enhance
coordination and cooperation in face of regional developments.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Damascus disclosed Tuesday that the visit
will take place in the latter half of November on the eve of the
day when Lebanese president-elect Emile Lahoud assumes the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri concluded his
two-day visit to Damascus Monday afternoon, during which he had
intensive talks with Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
They examined the current developments in the region in the
light of the recent peace agreement signed between the
Palestinians and Israel. Hariri also attended the meetings of the
joint Syrian-Lebanese economic committee.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud is scheduled to assume the presidency of Lebanon on
November 24. It is likely that Hariri will form a new, balanced
cabinet that embraces all Lebanese political parties and
communities and to pursue the same policy of coordination with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The sources further stated that contacts are underway between
Syria and Lebanon with a view to coordinating their stances
toward the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and its repercussions in
the region, particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
On October 23, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed the accord in Washington,
under which Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent of the
West Bank, while the Palestinians step up efforts to crack down on
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have rejected the deal on the grounds that it
entails major concessions on the part of the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also occupying Syria's Golan Heights which it
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- About 60 amateur Peking Opera
performers between the ages of 20 and 74 will compete in the
finals of a contest which was opened today in the north China port
city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Peking Opera lovers from Hong Kong and Taiwan will also
participate in the performance, according to the
organizers. Winners will be named on November 9.
</P>
<P>
The contest, initiated in 1991, provides a stage for amateur
performers and has helped increase the popularity of the
traditional performing art.
</P>
<P>
Peking Opera, which reached its zenith during the late Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911), combines music and vocals with dialog,
pantomime, acrobatics and the martial arts.
</P>
<P>
Actors and actresses must be proficient performing artists,
vocalists and dancers, and it usually takes a student more than
ten years to learn the vocal style and acrobatic skills.
</P>
<P>
China has a large number of amateurs performing the opera,
with many people practicing their skill in city squares and parks
early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 amateurs have participated in this year's
contest.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC) has so far attracted a total of 179 companies
including 62 foreign concerns based in Europe, the United States,
Canada and Japan for investments.
</P>
<P>
The 179 companies which obtained MSC status would invest a
total sum of 4.5 billion ringgit (about 1.184 billion U.S.
dollars) over a five-year period, Malaysian Deputy Minister of
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Chan Kong Choy said in
Parliament Tuesday, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The investment was in various fields such as computer software,
telecommunications and electronic equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the MSC is on schedule with 19 companies
having set up office at the MSC headquarters of Cyberjaya while
phase one of the Multimedia University would be completed early
next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said no foreign company with MSC status had withdrawn
following the onset of the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, a very brainchild of the country's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, is a 15 km x 50 km zone specially designed for
hi-tech development, stretching southward from the Kuala Lumpur
City Center to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang.

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Accused of Passing NATO Info to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A French military officer has
been put under investigation for allegedly passing classified NATO
documents to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Major Pierre Bunel, 46, was arrested last Saturday on suspicion
of telling Yugoslavia which targets NATO would strike in its air
operation, a French delegate to NATO said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the delegate said Bunel had
worked in the NATO Military Committee for two years.
</P>
<P>
Bunel was arrested in Paris for investigation after the French
Defense Ministry suspected him of having the possibility of
passing top-secret documents to Yugoslav agents, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Major Bunel admitted having passed
information to Yugoslavia but said he did so out of sympathy and
not for money.
</P>
<P>
NATO postponed the planned air strikes indefinitely on October
27 after Yugoslavia withdrew its security forces from Kosovo in
accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The western military bloc had authorized Supreme Allied
Commander Europe Wesley Clark to begin bombing Yugoslav targets if
the country should fail to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a French military officer was recalled from
Bosnia after being accused of tipping off Bosnian Serbs about
NATO's plans to arrest former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
French investigators later said the recalled officer had only
tried to persuade Karadzic to surrender himself to the
international war crimes tribunal in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
France is still not part of NATO's integrated military command
structure despite being a member of the alliance. It pulled out of
the integrated command in 1966 due to a row with the United States
over the right to command in southern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAGOSHIMA, JAPAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China came across
little trouble to overwhelm Thailand 3-0 Tuesday here in their
opening match of the World Women's Volleyball Championship.
</P>
<P>
In Group D's other matches here today, South Korea ousted the
vigorous Croatia 3-2 to snap their two straight loses to the
European runners-up.
</P>
<P>
Chinese won the match 15-9, 15-2, 15-5 while their East Asian
fellows triumphed 15-12, 9-15, 15-12, 7-15, 15-11 in the five-set
marathon.
</P>
<P>
Shrugging off poor start in the first set, China was led by Li
Yizhi's cool headed attacking to hold of a surprising challenge
from the Thai side, who arrived Japan a month ago for warm-up
training.
</P>
<P>
They rolled over the rest of the game against their rivals,
who lost to the Chinese on the same score in qualifier of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping said, "They played better in the
first set, overpowering us with faster smashes. They jumped to a
quick start while we started slowly early in the play."
</P>
<P>
South Korea had been beaten by Croatian two times in a row
before Kim Hyung-sil took over as the head coach. "I did not lose
to Croatians," said Kim Hyung-sil, "We'll not lose for the third
time to the same opponents."
</P>
<P>
With five points in row, South Koreans led the second set 9-8
after they took the opening set.  But the Croatians found their
attacking power and snatched the set with six-successive points.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the Asian championship's silver medallists, took
advantage of a 4-1 lead in the decisive set to crush Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Croatian coach Ivica Jelic said: "My players were too nervous
in the first set."
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's other matches, the Netherlands overwhelmed
long-shot Kenya 15-7, 15-1, 15-6 in Group A in Tokyo, while Italy
disposed of Bulgaria 15-12, 15-10, 15-6 in Group B in Tokuyama.

ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Olympic bronze medalists
Australia Tuesday were held to a 4-4 draw by Pakistan on the
fourth day of the 20th Champions Trophy Hockey Tournament in
Lahore, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A goal two minutes before the final whistle helped Pakistan
manage to level the keenly contested game, in which four goals
were produced in the thrilling last eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
The draw gifted the hosts just two points without a win yet in
three games while Australia five points on one win and two draws i
n the six-nation tournament.
</P>
<P>
Combining efforts from Brent Livermore who drove home the
first penalty corner in the ninth minute and captain Jay Stacy in
the 12th minute gave the Aussies an early advantage.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 2-1 at the half, the home side reduced the margin at
the stroke of the half time through Naveed Iqbal who took
advantage of an excellent cross from Haider Hussain.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes into the second period, the Australians, who were
held to 1-1 draw by South Korea on Monday, netted their third
goal when Stacy struck the sixth penalty corner.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan were able to even the score when fullback Sohail
Abbas translated his side's fifth short corner into the third
goal with a powerful push.
</P>
<P>
But the fourth through Troy Elder silenced the elated home
side supporters. Australia regained the lead in the 66th minute
on a swift return attack when Elder calmly tapped the home the
ball on a lovely cross from Daniel Sproule, who broke the
Pakistan defence from the right flank and centered the ball.
</P>
<P>
Atif Bashir, however, saved his side from going down to the
second defeat with another fine goal from Muhammad Sarwar and
salvaged an remarkable draw.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China has launched an extensive
campaign to publicize the family planning policy well in advance
of a fourth baby boom expected at the end of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Another peak period of rapid birth increases is expected
between 2009-2014 due to the population structure, according to
Yang Kuifu, vice-minister of the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
China will witness over 20 million births annual during the
period even if fertility rate of Chinese women is strictly
controlled at two children, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, controlling population growth will be at the top of
the agenda for long period of time to come," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the campaign is to promote new concepts of marriage
and fertility which are beneficial to the family planning
policy. The campaign will be carried out in all provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
The new concepts include later marriage and later births,
healthier births and nurturing, girls are just as good as boys and
men also bear responsibility for family planning.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of about 33 kilograms
of drugs were seized in three operations against drug trafficking
in Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces Tuesday confiscated 17.1 kilograms of
pure hashish in an operation in Gurun town of Sivas province near
central Anatolia and detained three suspected drug smugglers, said
the agency.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Turkish police stopped a car with a
Pole plaka on the TEM highway in Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, on October 28 and found 9.5 kilograms of heroin in the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The police detained 12 suspected drug smugglers including two
Poles, who tried to bring this heroin to Italy from eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The agency also reported that the Turkish police searched a
minibus and seized 6.37 kilograms of hashish in eastern province
of Van linking neighboring Iran. However, it did not disclose when
the heroin was seized.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is on a transit route of drugs to Europe from the border
areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1996, Turkish police seized
4.4 tonnes of heroin, which accounted for 40 percent of the
world's total haul.

<P>
The fact that surveys show a slight imbalance in birth rates of
male and female children in recent years indicates the general
tendency for people, especially rural residents, to observe
traditional concepts such as gender discrimination, more children
means more happiness and only male children will carry on the
family line.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that both intensive and extensive publicity
will be required to erase old concepts from the minds of many
people and help sustain a low and balanced birth rate.
</P>
<P>
Six villages in central China's Henan Province have been
selected to promote the new concepts of marriage and fertility.
</P>
<P>
The villages will replace words with action and establish
various social security programs related to old-age pensions,
education, employment and health care in order to provide a
material basis for promoting the concepts.
</P>
<P>
Family planning department in urban areas such as Tianjin,
Dalian and Shenzhen will provide consulting services for couples
reaching the age of fertility and will seek the help of insurance
companies to distribute pamphlets on family planning policies to
individual families.
</P>
<P>
Signs and bulletin boards will also be used to disseminate
information on family planning and reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
"The effort will represent a long-term struggle between old and
new concepts," said Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge of State
Family Planning Commission. "We will exert every possible effort
to enlighten more people," Zhang added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban, Opposition Resume POWs Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
and opposition commander Ahmed Shah Masood have resolved
differences over the swap of prisoners and resumed exchange of
prisoners after suspension of the operation for four days.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the News Network International
Tuesday, the two sides exchange 65 prisoners each on Monday night
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban opposition said Monday the two sides had
agreed on a two-week extension in the ceasefire to enable the
completion of the prisoner swap.
</P>
<P>
However, Taliban spokesman Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakil denied any
accord with the opposition. The Taliban are ready to extend the
truce if Masood is sincere in the release of genuine prisoners, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official of the opposition as saying that
the cease-fire will be observed on all of the fronts and a
six-member joint commission will monitor it.
</P>
<P>
The original one-week truce between the Taliban and forces
loyal to opposition commander Masood, brokered by an Afghan trader
based in Saudi Arabia, came into force last Tuesday and was
designed to allow the exchange of 1,000 prisoners by each side.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been held up after controversy surfaced over
the identity of some prisoners and accusations and
counter-accusations by the two sides of truce violations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides released first batch of 106 prisoners on October
30 after agreeing to free 1,000 prisoners each during a week-long
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the anti-Taliban opposition suspended swap
operation because of wrangling and shooting after the first day of
exchange. The Taliban refused to accept some of the prisoners as
they accused Masood of releasing ordinary people rather than the
Taliban fighters.

TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) - Iran announced Tuesday that it
has decided to recall its ambassador to Czech to protest against
Prague's support for the Persian-language programs of Radio Free
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that the announcement
was by the spokesman of Iranian Foreign Ministry Mahmoud
Mohammadi. But he did not say if the Iranian ambassador has left
Prague.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran made the decision to show its
objection to "the unprincipled stance" of the Czech government to
allow the broadcast of anti-Iranian programs in Prague.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been trying to convince the
Czech officials through different channels of its objections to
such satanic moves against the Iranian people, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the satanic voice finally went on air by the
cooperation of the Czech officials.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has decided to shrink the level of its economic and
political cooperation with Prague, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Prague has allowed Radio Free Europe to set up a station in
the country to broadcast Persian-language programs, which were
seen by Tehran as a move of the West, particularly the U.S.,
against the Iranian Islamic government.

LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's non-traditional export
(NTE) sector has performed better this year, making about 186
million U.S. Dollars from January to August compared to 176
million Dollars recorded in the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) show that
cotton yarn has recorded the biggest single NTE product, earning
26.4 million Dolars, about 14 percent of this year's total NTE earnings,
said Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sugar and tobacco exports reaped 17.2 million and 11.2
million Dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
EBZ attributed the better performance by the cotton yarn
industry to its status as a 100 percent exportable sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ expects increased yields of these commodities
including that of fresh flowers and vegetables by the end of this
year. The projected climb is expected to be enough to compensate
the current fall in international commodity prices, said the

<HEADLINE> Interview: Financial Crisis on Top of Agenda for APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The APEC process must be
used productively to address the financial crisis as it is no more
an Asian financial crisis, but a global financial crisis,
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the financial crisis is affecting every APEC economy, it is
to APEC member economies' interest to seriously focus on the
problem, she said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua Tuesday
prior to the informal meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) leaders here on November 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we do our part to help international financial
community resolve the crisis then we will see global recession,"
the minister said, adding "Everybody will have to do something
together, we have to do it together."
</P>
<P>
She hoped the APEC leaders at their forthcoming meeting here
will give ideas on "how best within the APEC we can resolve the
problem."
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis will be on the top of the agenda for the
leaders' discussions and Malaysia's inputs at the leaders' meeting
would mainly be on the financial crisis, she said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will also discuss various items on economic and
technical cooperation, progress in electronic commerce,
development of small and medium-scale enterprises, and capacity
building in APEC, and they will be getting a report from the APEC
Business Advisory Council, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said as the host of the meeting, Malaysia had already
tabled a Plan of Action for small and medium industry development
and also skills development program in APEC.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Kuala Lumpur meeting is expected to adopt the
agenda on APEC science and technology cooperation towards the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
On trade liberalization, the minister said that a package on
Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization will be presented to the
ministers who meet before the leaders, and then to the leaders
based on what member economies offer.
</P>
<P>
Hoping everyone would strive to offer the best, Rafidah Aziz
believed the member economies will offer concessions, and tariff
cuts based on their ability and capacity and on voluntarism.
</P>
<P>
"Based on these principles, whatever it is we finally come up
as the package will be the package offered and everybody must
accept it," she said, adding "We are fine-tuning the package."
</P>
<P>
Rafidah Aziz said because APEC resources are limited, "we
should not try to do too many things at same time, especially at a
time when most member economies are affected by the financial
crisis, they cannot afford it."
</P>
<P>
She said, "We will review the whole APEC operation, making
suggestions on how we can make APEC more effective, more focused
by prioritizing APEC programs."
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said, "In the past, APEC turned out to be idealistic,
they (the members) want to do everything, if you have resources,
you can do it, but you cannot. Enthusiasm is there, but we must be
practical."
</P>
<P>
The minister said preparations for APEC meetings here are right
on track and those for logistics and agenda have been completed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, Rebels to Conduct Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will hold peace talks
Wednesday in the Southern Philippine city of Marawi.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks will be held at the Mindanao State University
in the city, the Philippine News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman, was quoted by the agency
as saying that their organization will push before the government
panel "the recognition of MILF territories in Mindanao."
</P>
<P>
The MILF claims it has 46 camps all over Mindanao, 13 of which
are major bases while the rest are satellite sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
"Only if the government recognizes these territories will there
be peace in Mindanao," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
But the government is still closely studying the MILF proposal,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar was also quoted as proposing that the government-MILF
panels discuss the cause behind the recent week-long encounter
between combatants of both forces in the Datu Piang-Shariff
Agwak-Talayan complex in Maguindanao, southwestern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The fighting killed three soldiers and 20 Moro rebels and
wounded dozens of other from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is fighting for independence of Mindanao although
another major rebel group -- the Moro National Liberation Front
signed an agreement on peace in the Southern Philippines two years
ago.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Land Fertilization Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China has so far allocated 20
million yuan this year on a project to fertilize cultivated land
in order to further raise grain output, according to an official
of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The project -- Fertile Land Project -- will be introduced in
ten provinces and municipalities, including Beijing Municipality
and Hebei and Guizhou provinces, said Wang Jindeng, section chief
in charge of the ministry's means of agricultural production
department.
</P>
<P>
He said the project, which is designed to improve soil
fertility by balancing soil, water and fertilizers, is expected to
increase the annual grain output by 80 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for establishing high-yield arable land in
targeted areas over the next few years, promoting efficiency to
raise the fertilizer use ratio by 10 percentage points and to
promote the use of technology to fight drought and raise the
water use ratio by 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that agricultural development is beset with both
scarcity and the massive waste of resources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's current fertilizer use rate stands
at only 30 percent, or some 20 percentage points lower than levels
in developed countries.

<HEADLINE> HK's Tung Chee Hwa Meets EC President Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa Tuesday called on the Group of Seven (G7) countries
to take into account Hong Kong's experience when they were
translating their intention for greater international cooperation
into new rules for the globalized financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Tung made this call when he met and exchanged views on the
global and regional economic situation with President of the
European Commission (EC) Jacques Santer, who arrived in Hong Kong
Monday on the last leg of his China visit.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he was heartened by the G7 initiatives announced
last week and was particularly pleased with their call for greater
transparency, accountability and supervision in short term capital
flow, particularly that of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we are also in favor of codifying the degree of
transparency required of financial institutions generating such
capital flows and establishing greater discipline in the extension
of credit to these institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that financial officials of other markets including the
United Kingdom and France shared Hong Kong's view on the issue,
Tung said Hong Kong would continue cooperation with them to
develop a framework which was able to cope with the new demands
placed upon the system by the size and speed of modern capital
flows to ensure the stability of the financial markets at the
international level.
</P>
<P>
"After all, many of us have been at the receiving end and have
suffered considerably as a result of the instability of the
financial markets," he said. "Our experience should be most
valuable."
</P>
<P>
Tung said while the new order and rules in the globalized
financial markets must be vigorous, they must also be applicable
without favor, and capable of promoting free market based
financial activity.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong remains fully committed to free and open markets and
the maintenance of a level playing field," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are also determined to maintain the linked exchange rate
under our currency board system and a place with no capital
controls," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the European Union had become China's second
largest trading partner, Tung said Hong Kong would continue to
play an important role in that relationship as it deepened.
</P>
<P>
"While we are committed to maintaining Hong Kong as a vibrant
international trading and financial center, we are also determined
to make Hong Kong the pre-eminent gateway for business and
investment in the mainland of China," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed today's initialing of the Customs Cooperation Agreement
between Hong Kong and the European Commission, the first binding
customs cooperation agreement that Hong Kong has negotiated after
its return to China in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Turning to increased travel convenience for Hong Kong people,
Tung said he was glad to note the European Parliament's report
which supported visa-free access to all member states for Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) passport holders.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we hope that EU would adopt a common policy of
granting HKSAR passport holders visa-free access," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive will host a dinner in honor of Santer, the
first EC president to have visited Hong Kong, at Government House
tonight. Santer will leave Hong Kong after the dinner.

LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia, which currently has a
huge trade surplus with Japan, has experienced a decline in its
exports to that country from about 192.8 million U.S. Dollars in
1996 to 138.5 million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Japan External Trade Organisation said in
an recent interview in Tokyo that Japan's exports to Zambia,
however, slightly rose from 19.2 million Dollars in 1996 to about
26.3 million Dollars in 1997, Financial Mail weekly published
here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's trade surplus with Japan is mostly on account of the
copper Zambia exports to the Asian country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is Japan's third largest supplier of copper and its
second largest supplier of cobalt.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicted that Zambia's exports to Japan might
continue to decline in 1999 given that Japan's economy is still
in recession.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's main exports to Japan include refined copper
cathodes, cobalt mattes and intermediate products as well as
worked rubies, sapphires and emeralds and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
While the Japan's exports to Zambia include automobiles,
diesel engines as well as gasoline engines.

</P>

In an interview with reporters in the presidential palace here,

MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that former armed forces chief of staff Fabian Ver and his
sons may return to the Philippines provided they face all criminal
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here Tuesday, presidential spokesman Jerry
Barican said that the Department of Foreign Affairs has standing
instructions to Philippine embassies and consulates to issue
passports to all Filipino citizens who meet the requirements for
such privilege.
</P>
<P>
Barican was reacting to reports that the Vers have allegedly
complained about the rejection of their passport applications by
Philippine consulate officials in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Vers reportedly applied for passports after President
Joseph Estrada said they may come home on condition that they
answer all charges filed against them.
</P>
<P>
"As President Estrada has already stated, the Vers can return
home provided the former armed forces chief of staff and his sons
face whatever charges the government had earlier filed against
them and suffer the consequences, if found guilty," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
The Vers fled the country at the height of the "People Power
Revolution" that toppled the Marcos regime in February 1986.
</P>
<P>
Ver was indicted for the 1983 assassination of former senator
Benigno Aquino. The case against him was archived by the court

BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
expresses its utmost displeasure and regret over the Jordanian
government's move to allow Taiwan high-ranking officials to visit
Jordan, and urges the Jordanian side to take immediate, effective
measures to guarantee that there will be no recurrence of similar
incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark

</P>
<P>
Zhu said it is known to all that the attempt of the Taiwan
authorities to create "two China" and "one China, one Taiwan" in
the world has became increasingly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government, however, in disregard of the overall
interests of the friendly relations between China and Jordan, has
flagrantly and repeatedly allowed Taiwan's high-ranking political
figures to come to Jordan for maneuvering purposes, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
This is a violation of Jordan's "One China" position and solemn
commitments on the Taiwan question, the spokesman said, and it has
hurt not only the national feelings of the Chinese people but the
reputation of the Jordanian government internationally.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Agricultural Bank Disburses Agri-Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Krishi
(agricultural) Bank has so far disbursed about 3.04 billion taka
(62.7 million U.S. dollars) as credit among 250,000 flood-affected
farmers under its flood rehabilitation program, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the targeted loan of 12.5 billion taka (258
million dollars) is expected to be disbursed by December, a senior
official of the bank was quoted by The Independent as saying.
</P>
<P>
The pay-out speed was satisfactory as necessary steps were
taken to reach the crop credits to the doors of the farmers,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Lending for crop cultivation had been made to some 175,000
growers while some 75,000 farmers were given loan in the non-crop
sector for buying bullocks and others, he stated.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the credit program, he said, some 650 extra
booths have been set up in remote areas in the country in addition
to the branches. "Loans are being given within 72 hours of getting
applications from the farmers."
</P>
<P>
Credit-supervising teams have been working across the country
to oversee the credit operation, he said, adding that a two-member
team for each two branches would see transactions and settle any
dispute on the spot for smooth conduct of the rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was hit by devastating floods from mid-July to
mid-September this year, which affected two-thirds of the country
and over 30 million people, inflicting a preliminary estimated
loss of about 4.3 billion dollars.

JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu decided Tuesday to delay a scheduled cabinet
meeting over the newly-signed interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the security plan submitted by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to Washington was incomplete.
</P>

Netanyahu said on local TV that an important element is missing
in the Palestinian security plan and thus the cabinet will not
convene as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He did not say what is the missing element in the plan, which
was submitted to the United States Monday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was expected to begin a two-day cabinet meeting
Tuesday to ratify the agreement he signed with Palistinean leader
Yasser Arafat in the U.S. last month. He postponed a cabinet
decision on the agreement last week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Monday that the PNA has handed the CIA a
"complete" security paper outlining its plan for fighting terror.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Ends Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed flat on
Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as profit-taking emerged to wipe
out sharp gains spurred by the United Overseas Bank's cut in prime
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) moved marginally up
0.33 points to close at 1,263.47 points in volatile trading.
</P>
<P>
The overall turnover slid to 605.07 million units valued at
905.76 Singapore dollars (558.32 million U.S. dollars). Decliners
edged out advancers by 252 to 77 with 91 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 34.97 million units by Wing T. It was
followed by TChongInt which had a volume of 32.48 million shares
done. KepLand was next with 28.71 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH led the top gainers of the day as it went up 50 cents to
close at 15.00 Singapore dollars. OCDC F rose by 40 cents to
finish at 7.60 Singapore dollars. SPH 100 also gained 40 cents but
closed at 15.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Datacrft led the descent of the day with a
drop of 1.56 U.S. dollars to finish at 1.74 U.S. dollars. Creative
50 retreated 70 cents to close at 23.50 Singapore dollars. Venture
and Venture w99 slid off 50 cents to end at 5.45 and 4.30
Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said market sentiment picked up after the UOB announced
a 50-basis-point cut in its prime lending rate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
At the open, share prices surged on expectations that other
banks would follow suit. The rally was also fueled by Wall
Street's gains overnight.
</P>
<P>
The sharp gains were eroded by profit-taking by mid-day.
However the STI refrained from falling to close at the negative
territory as the easing interest rate environment kept the market
supported.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Engineers to Check Planes Kept Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A team of Iraqi engineers will
be sent to Iran to inspect the Iraqi planes flown there prior to
the 1991 Gulf War in an effort to avoid attacks by allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Khalil, minister of transport and communication, was
quoted by Tuesday's Al-Ittehad (The Union) weekly as saying that
"there are current efforts to delegate engineers to assess the
planes' technical conditions."
</P>
<P>
Before the allied forces started the Gulf War to evict Iraqi
troops from Kuwait in early 1991, Iran allowed Iraqi planes, both
civil and military, to fly onto its territories in hopes of
surviving allied attacks.
</P>
<P>
The number of the planes was first said to be over 100, but
Tehran later admitted only a dozen. After the war ended, however,
Iran refused to return these planes to Iraq, and used them as
a leverage to force Iraq to pay war reparations for their eight
years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
The two old foes have recently improved relations by exchanging
prisoners of war and swapping remains of those killed during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The most recent effort was the
participation of Iran's trade minister in the 31st Baghdad
International Fair which opened on November 1.
</P>
<P>
It is now clear whether Tehran has agreed to the dispatch of
Iraqi engineers to assess the planes.
</P>
<P>
Khalil also said other civil planes located abroad had been
prevented from flying because of the U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq.

LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson lifted the
government's pro-single currency rhetoric to new heights on Monday
when he said that Britain would join it when the economic signals
were right.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government has dropped its plans for sweeping
pensions reform. Proposals for a significant increase in
compulsory saving for second-tier pensions to back up the basic
state pension have been abandoned because of the Treasury's fears
about the costs of government contributions for low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The car in which Diana, Princess of Wales, died was
travelling at 62mph when it crashed in Paris, French police
investigators confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The ousted British Welsh Secretary Ron Davies Monday night
coupled an emotional appeal for a more tolerant atmosphere in
public life with a bitter attack on irresponsible "media
intrusion" into his private life since the Clapham Common affair
triggered his resignation from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- After 18 months of tip-toeing around the European economic
and monetary union, the British government is at last declaring
that the euro is a development from which Britain cannot afford to
stand aside.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Back Down in Trade Talks With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is preparing
to concede to the use of the terms of "port" and "sherry" for
export products in exchange for increased agricultural quotas in
its stalled trade talks with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
South African Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom said Monday
that after a period of despondency over EU "obstructiveness" in
the negotiations, both sides were increasingly optimistic that
the conclusion of the pact could be at hand, Business Day
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) conference with the EU, Hanekom said he could not divulge
details of an impasse-breaking package that was negotiated
recently between EU Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro and South
African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro sought agreement from the EU last week to negotiate a
compromise agreement with senior EU bodies without publicly
disclosing its terms.
</P>
<P>
However, it is understood that the basis of the deal is that
South Africa will make limited concessions regarding the
trademark issues holding up the wine and spirits agreement in
exchange for increased quotas of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the deal, South Africa would phase out the terms
"port" and "sherry" over five to seven years on its export
products, but would continue to use the terms internally. The
use of the term "grand cru", along with the other terms, is also
regarded by the EU as a trademark dispute.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the EU is expected to increase quotas on other
agricultural products for South Africa so that they matched the
existing level of South African exports to European countries.
Priority products include fruit, canned fruit, maize starch and
wine.
</P>
<P>
Hanekom said South Africa was extremely unhappy with the EU's
subsidies in terms of its common agricultural policy and whatever
the outcome of the EU-South African trade pact, would continue to
oppose these subsidies as part of the Cairns group of countries
which are pushing for global free trade in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no doubt that the EU's extensive trade
subsidies distorted trade between South Africa and the EU. South
Africa has a 17-billion-Rand (2.98 billion U.S. Dollars) annual
trade deficit with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Hanekom said he would use the opportunity provided by the
SADC-EU ministerial conference to lobby in favor of granting
South Africa additional concessions and for the conclusion of the
trade pact.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo sought to
dispel the concerns of other SADC member states about the
consequences of the trade pact, saying that even as it engaged in
bilateral negotiations, it had not and would not lose sight of
regional concerns.
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the EU-South African trade pact has emerged from
SADC members whose representatives have argued that as regional
organizations, the EU's external relations should focus on the
SADC rather than on a single member state of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South Africa's membership of the SADC did not exclude
it forging bilateral relations, which were also pursued by other
SADC members.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Curb AIDS Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
up national and state HIV/AIDS prevention committees and
earmarked some eight million U.S. Dollars to check AIDS spreading
in the country, media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Izeduwa Derex-Briggs, liaison officer of
the National AIDS/STD Control Program in Lagos state here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the state HIV/AIDS prevention
and management committee, he said that the Federal Ministry of
Health had directed state governments to give considerable
allocations to HIV/AIDS control programs.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund of
Nigeria has procured and distributed HIV screening kits to all
secondary and tertiary health institutions across the country.
</P>
<P>
A series of activities have been lined up in this West African
country to sensitize members of the public on prevention of the
dreaded disease for this year's World AIDS campaign program which
will start in December and last for six months.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the committee of Lagos state, State Health
Commissioner Michael Ogungbesan described as alarming the rate of
increase in HIV/AIDS patients in the state.
</P>
<P>
Fe said, "results of HIV screening for patients in our
hospitals have also increased from 9.4 percent in 1996 to 14
percent in 1997 and that 16 percent have been recorded so far in
1998."
</P>
<P>
Since 1986 when the first AIDS patient was reported in
Nigeria, there has been steady increase from 1.75 percent in
1991/92 to 4.5 percent in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
Ogungbesan said that more than 60 percent of new infections
are young people between the ages of 15 and 45, adding that this
age group should be the target of the attempt to control the
scourge.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner noted that the newly-inaugurated committee
would ensure organization of the state blood transfusion service
with the aim of ensuring the provision of safe blood in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also ensure organization of a state
voluntary blood donation campaign to reduce HIV infected blood in
blood banks, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Optimistic for Stronger Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is optimistic for a stronger peso after the currency
appreciated Tuesday to 39.90 to the U.S. dollar from last Friday's
weighted average of 40.39, said Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson.
</P>
<P>
Singson told reporters here Tuesday that he is not surprised by
the strengthening of the peso because of the country's "generally
stronger macro-economic fundamentals and the stability of its
banking system."
</P>
<P>
"The peso has greater leeway for bouncing back," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the governor refused to say at what point the central bank
will start buying dollars to moderate any rapid appreciation of
the currency.
</P>
<P>
The central bank only steps in to moderate any wild swing or
fluctuations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange traders said that there has been a change in
sentiment and the market now expects the peso to remain strong up
to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
They even predicted that the peso could strengthen to 37
against the greenback as they see no major support to stop the
peso from appreciating to that level.
</P>
<P>
The peso actually strengthened Tuesday to a high of 39.68 to
the dollar during intraday trading even though it opened at 40.16
and weakened at a certain point to 40.27 before finally closing at
39.76.
</P>
<P>
There was no trading session Monday as the Philippines were
enjoying a special holiday.

<HEADLINE> EC President Confident of Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Commission
President Jacques Santer said here Tuesday that he has confidence
in Hong Kong's future although it has been struck hard by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who arrived in Hong Kong Monday evening following his
trip to Beijing, Wuhan and Shanghai, said that he saw little
evidence of any attempt to change the way of life in Hong Kong,
which returned to China on July 1, 1997 from some 150 years of
British rule.
</P>
<P>
The courts, the press, the freedom of expression and the
political structure in Hong Kong are functioning as before, Santer
said when delivering a speech at a luncheon organized by the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council at Grand Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
"The handover has been a success exactly because Beijing has
let Hong Kong continue to do what it does best: serve as a bridge
between China and the world, to the enrichment of both," he said.
</P>
<P>
The free market principles that have served Hong Kong so well
in the past have been safeguarded and the business-friendly
climate and open society in which traders and investors like to
operate have been also protected, Santer added.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of 'one country, two systems', central to your
own Basic Law, is also central to the European Union's policy
towards the Special Administrative Region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Santer stressed that although Hong Kong has been hard struck by
the financial crisis, he was sure Hong Kong will not lose heart
and indeed, in the future, will become stronger given the
legendary resilience of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remain sound and the SAR
government sticks to the policies of transparency, clean
government, sound regulation, fiscal prudence and open markets,
which are surely the best policies to attract investors back, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe applauds Hong Kong's policy to sustain its
currency peg with the U.S. dollar throughout the turbulence,
describing it as a good buttress against devaluation in Hong
Kong, in China's mainland and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"We also applaud your efforts to improve the regulation of
stock and equity trading," Santer continued. He also welcomed the
SAR government's clear statement that this summer's intervention
into the equities and futures market does not herald a departure
from Hong Kong's long-standing approach to economic and financial
policy.
</P>
<P>
Santer told hundreds of local and European business leaders at
the luncheon that the birth of the European single currency -- the
Euro two months later, will benefit Hong Kong's businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economic operators will no longer have to cope with
exchange costs and fluctuating values between 11 currencies and
the single currency will greatly facilitate the lives of the
businessmen of Hong Kong and Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the prospect of the single currency is already
forcing radical change to the structure and efficiency of the
European economy, Santer said. Fresh economies of scale and
increased competition will benefit Hong Kong's investment and
trade with Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his visit to the mainland, Santer said that
China's role in world affairs has become dramatically more
important in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Its role, and in particular its commitment to stability, have
been much appreciated in this troubled region as well as elsewhere
in the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I was particularly impressed by what the leaders in Beijing
told me and their determination to pursue the reform of China's
economic structures to pave the way for a more market-oriented
economy and their bid for China to become a full and responsible
player in world trade," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
Santer is the first EC president to have visited Hong Kong. He
and Vice-President Leon Brittan will later meet SAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa and other government officials, members of
the Executive Council and the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is Hong Kong's third largest trading partner
just behind China's mainland and the United States. More than 700
EU companies have their regional headquarters or offices in Hong
Kong and more than 50,000 EU citizens have made their homes here.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Iraq to Resume Cooperation with UN Special Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China urged Iraq to resume full
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
this afternoon at a regular press conference, saying that "we are
worried and disturbed by Iraq's decision to suspend all activities
of the UNSCOM in Iraq last Saturday."
</P>
<P>
"We were and still are of the view that the relevant UN
Security Council resolutions, particularly the Resolution No. 687,
should be fully and effectively implemented," he said, adding that
Iraq should also fulfill its relevant obligations in full.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Zhu, the UN Security Council, on its
part, should make a fair and objective evaluation of and
conclusion on the inspection work that has already been completed
and gradually lift the sanctions on Iraq in light of Iraq's
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China hopes that the relevant parties will exercise
restraint and endeavor to properly resolve their differences and
disputes though dialogues and cooperation, which is undoubtedly
conductive to an early conclusion of the arms inspection in Iraq,
Zhu said.

CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
marginally lower Tuesday in listless dealings, with the market
distracted by the prestigious Melbourne Cup horse race in the
state of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
A thin market with little volume marked the day for the local
currency, as it waited to see if the Reserve Bank of Australia,
the country's central bank, eases monetary policy Wednesday after
its board meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 62.28 U.S. cents from 62.55 U.S.
cents Monday.
</P>
<P>
It found a narrow range of 62.30 U.S. cents to 62.50 U.S.
cents, as a public holiday in Melbourne for the Cup and a holiday
in Japan kept many traders away from their desks.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 71.90 Japanese yen from 72.36
yen and 1.0324 German marks from 1.0319 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China is willing to work together with
Belgium to lift bilateral ties up to a new level.
</P>
<P>
While undergoing a historic process of reform, opening up and
modernization construction, it is necessary for China to learn
from other countries to achieve common development, Jiang told
visiting Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene during today's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled his past visit to Belgium, and said the
country's economic, artistic, and scientific achievements left him
with a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
Through concerted efforts in recent years, Sino-Belgian
relations have realized sound development momentum, bilateral
trade volume has been on the rise, and Belgium's investment has
yielded considerable result, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is acquiring an important position in the
world arena as multipolarization is the developing trend, and will
play an increasingly important role in international society,
Jiang said, adding that China stresses its relationship with the
EU, and will continue to exert efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene said that the turbulent world situation and economic
globalization in recent years calls for new balancing points, and
the EU and China are stablizing factors.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, devoted to the integration of Europe, believes that
the EU should play a more active role in international affairs,
and hopes that China will also exert greater influence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Both Belgium and the EU attach great importance to relations
with China, and there's great potential for further cooperation,
Dehaene said. The Belgian government will continue to encourage
enterprises to invest in China, China's central and western
regions in particular, he said, stressing that the nations of the
world should learn from and cooperate with each other for common
progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked Dehaene to extend his kind regards to King Albert
II, and invited him to visit China at a convenient time.

PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A French army officer who served at the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels was suspected to have sent
to Serb agents the classified documents of defense secrets which
included the Yugoslav military sites that could be targed by NATO
air strike during the Kosovo crisis in October. Pierre Brunel,
who had admitted his acts as being simply pro-Serb, was presented
last Saturday to a Paris court judge after four days in the
custody of the French intelligence institution DST.
</P>
<P>
-- A Paris judge Monday issued an international warrant of arrest
against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for his alleged
arrest and murder of several Frenchmen. The Interpol will diffuse
this warrant and it will be followed by a French request of
extradition of Pinochet from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a new promise about
Britain's engagement with the European single currency euro when
Germany's new chancellor Gerhard Schroder Monday made his first
visit abroad in London since his coming to power. British
Chancellor of Exchequor Gordon Brown announced in Birmingham that
London will present in January a plan of transition detailing the
steps of its constructive engagement with the euro.
</P>
<P>
-- The Americans will vote on Tuesday part of the U.S. Congress
 in an election whose result could determine the future of Bill
Clinton. The Republicans are posed to win 15 to 20 more seats in
the House of Representatives and three to four more seats in the
Senate, according to the latest polls. But the weariness of
Americans about the Lewinsky affair and the solidness of the
U.S. economy are playing in favor of the Democrats who are
expected to scale down their loss.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday that the
continuation of establishing Jewish settlements in the occupied
land augurs ill for the future of the Wye Plantation agreement and
creates atmosphere of distrust.
</P>
<P>
He said that something must be done to stop building the
settlements because they cast doubt about the intentions of
Israeli government in implementing the recent Palestinian-Israeli
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which should have been implemented Monday,
Israel is to pull back its troops from another 13.1 percent of the
West Bank while the Palestinians intensify crackdown on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Police killed two terrorists Monday in a crackdown on
fugitive terrorist elements in Malawi and Minya.
</P>
<P>
The swoop was carried out under a plan by the Interior Ministry
to crack down on the terrorists still at large.
</P>
<P>
In the swoop, a police officer and a conscript were injured.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Moussa said Monday that he hopes the crisis between Iraq and
the United Nations will not escalate any more.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Baghdad froze all the activities of the U.N.
Special Commission on disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Moussa spoke highly of the efforts made by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan in defusing the Iraqi-U.N. standoff in
February, saying he believes that Annan can also ease the current
tension.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Minister of Public Enterprise Atef Ebeid said Monday that
his ministry will sell four companies affiliated to the Holding
Company for Cotton and Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
The four companies are Misr for Cars Trade, Misr for Foreign
Trade, Al-Nasr for Import and Export, and the Arabia for Foreign
Trade.
</P>
<P>
The ministry agreed in principle to offer 51 percent of these
companies' stake as a preparatory step towards privatizing them,
Ebeid said.
</P>
<P>
The move to sell the companies is a step taken by the ministry
to support the country's export, Ebeid said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Boost Primary Education: Mkapa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will raise the
education budget from the current 22 to 25 percent in the next
five years to promote the school enrollment and upgrade the
teachers' status, national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa was quoted as saying that the
government will ensure that teachers' salaries are ready by the
25th day of every month.
</P>
<P>
In his address broadcast live Tuesday by the state-run Radio
Tanzania Dar es Salaam (RTD) to mark the World Teachers' Day in
southwestern city of Mbeya, Mkapa also ordered the central and
local government authorities to work closely and seek a lasting
solution to delays in paying teachers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
He said at the Sokoine stadium that banks dealing with paying
teachers' salaries should from now on take this as a priority.
</P>
<P>
"We've managed to solve the problem (of paying salaries) to
our soldiers. I don't see any reason why should we fail to
improve the paying system for our teachers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President said this malpractice has for quite a long time
been demoralizing teachers.
</P>
<P>
He also called on teachers to defend their profession by
adhering to the professional ethics and avoiding corrupt
practices in pupils' enrollment, examinations and transfers.
</P>
<P>
"If the rich students get access to good education while
sidelining the poor, there is danger of creating classes in the
future generations which could threaten the existing peace and
tranquillity in Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming school enrollment had dropped alarmingly from 98
percent in 1984 to 77 percent this year, Mkapa directed the
enactment of by-laws which would ensure that eligible children
are enrolled and careless parents are severely punished.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has launched a program to raise primary
school enrollment from 77 to 85 percent and reduce the school
dropout from present 33 percent to less than 20 percent in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that parents send their children to school
whether they like it or not," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged the parents to collaborate with the teachers in
making follow-ups on their children's performance and in
improving the standard of education.

<HEADLINE> Three Bombs Detonated in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian military
officers have detonated three bombs suspected to be left by the
German army during the World War II at a village in the northern
region of Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's Daily News, the action was taken on
Sunday morning after Mabungo village executive officer Hemed
Waziri Msangi complained to journalists that there was a delay in
destroying the abandoned bombs.
</P>
<P>
The stories about the bombs in the village were published and
attracted the attention of the Tanzania People's Defense Forces,
which sent Lieutenant Colonel Max Mfaume and Lieutenant Marwa
from a field engineering squadron to fulminate the bombs,
including an anti-tank bomb and two mortar bombs.
</P>
<P>
Local people have suggested further investigations be carried
out to remove more bombs in the surrounding area and other parts
of the country which pose threats to security.

<HEADLINE> Somali Bandits Kill 9 Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Somali bandits have
killed nine people in north Tanzania's Arusha Region, media
reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bandits, armed with sub-machine guns and light-machine
guns, raided Olemetemi area Saturday evening and killed nine men
of Maasai tribe, possibly on a revenge mission, Arusha Regional
Commissioner Daniel ole Njoolay said.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, a group of Somali gangsters killed a
district police commander in Arusha. Following this, the police
launched a special operation against them, killing five of the
gang and arresting more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
The bandits often crossed the Kenya-Tanzania border into the
region and assaulted local villagers, stealing cattle and other
properties.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay, who described the incident as a vengeance act and a
cowardly attack, convened an emergency meeting of the region's
defense and security departments Monday and appealed to the
government to work out a joint strategy against the bandits with
the Kenyan side.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Invested Firms in Vietnam Fare Poorly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hanoi, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign invested enterprises
(FIEs) in Vietnam have achieved a poor export record this year,
the latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review reported,
quoting official statistics.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report from the General Department of
Statistics, FIEs have earned more than 1.6 billion U.S. dollars
from exports this year, accounting for only 21.1 percent of
Vietnam's total export volume.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that FIEs' export turnover accounted for
only 12.2 percent of the total turnover since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ten countries and regions which made up 85 percent of the
foreign direct investment capital in Vietnam, generated only 69
percent of the FIEs' export volume, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the countries and regions that possess the largest
stake in Vietnam are not the biggest exporters. Singapore is the
leading investor in Vietnam with 6.4 billion dollars. However, it
only ranks seventh in terms of export turnover.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, South Korea and Japan, which rank fifth and fourth
among foreign investors respectively, are the first and second
largest exporters.
</P>
<P>
FIEs' export turnover makes up only 28.6 percent of their total
revenues, according to the official figures, too low for the
healthy development of the sector, the review reported.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that 40 percent of FIEs' export volume
was generated from light industry, 20 percent from heavy industry,
10 percent from agro-forestry, and 5 percent from food production.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the investment structure of FIEs is not
export-oriented, thus seriously limiting their export
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, services, construction and property projects account
for 36 percent of all the foreign investment projects in Vietnam
and 46 percent of the licensed investment capital.
</P>
<P>
These projects have attracted plenty of foreign currency, but
their profits are not included in Vietnam's export volume.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Workshop on Job Training for Out-of-School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- An ASEAN workshop for program
managers  and associated personnel on skills training for
out-of-school youth opened Monday in Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency
(VNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop aims at developing cooperative ties between
vocational training centers for out-of-school youth in ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
The workshop drew the participation of 34 delegates from nine
ASEAN countries, the ASEAN Secretariat and directors of vocational
training and job promotion centers under Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh
Communist Youth Union.
</P>
<P>
It also covers measures to increase exchanges of information on
vocational training for the youth and to improve training quality
in catching up with economic development.
</P>
<P>
The out-of-school youth refers to young people who, for a
variety of reasons, do not have access to education or job
training.
</P>
<P>
VNA quoted a report from the workshop as saying that young
people account for one-fifth of ASEAN's population with most of
them classified as out-of-school youth. The unemployment rate
among them doubles that of the whole society.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, said VNA, now has 20 million people aged from 15 to
29, including 16 million out-of-school youths who mainly live in
rural areas. Vietnam is striving to achieve junior high
school-level education universalization among the youth by 2001.

Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
Turkey worried that the U.S.-brokered peace accord can lead to

<HEADLINE> Uganda Should Sell Airlines Soon: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan minister has urged
the government to privatize the Uganda Airlines Corporation (UAC)
quickly to stop the expenses it incurs.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, Minister of Works, Housing and Communications,
made the appeal Monday after appearing before the parliamentary
select committee on privatization, the New Vision daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is putting in some 30,000 U.S. Dollars
each day to keep it going and he hoped someone else would inject
in some funds.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is reported to have focused on the
financial status and privatization of the UAC, also discussed the
issue of the airlines' sister company, Entebbe Handling Services
(ENHAS).
</P>
<P>
The report said the committee is querying the mode of selling
off public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the minister attributed the poor
performance of UAC to the negative publicity it receives in the
media.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government decided to privatize the corporation
after merger plans with Alliance Air flopped. Nasasira said his
ministry can only advise on the issue because it is the
Privatization Unit that is in charge.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Unit bailed UAC out for a debt of 650,000
Dollars it had failed to pay to the International Air Transport
Association.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- More than seven kilograms of
cocaine have been confiscated at the Beirut International Airport
from two Lebanese passengers, the Daily Star newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The narcotics were hidden in secret compartments in two
suitcases carried by the two who came home from Brazil via Rome on

</P>
<P>
The two men were hiding six kilograms of cocaine in one
suitcase, while the other suitcase contained 1.4 kilograms and
equipment used to process the drug.
</P>
<P>
The seized cocaine was raw and could produce three times its
quantity usable drugs if mixed with other chemicals, which, in
this case, could reach more than 2 million U.S. dollars in street
value, the paper quoted an airport customs official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two men have been handed over to the National Drug
Enforcement Office for questioning, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Rejects U.S. Proposal for Foreign Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurent Kabila has rejected a proposal by
the United States that foreign troops aiding him withdraw as a
condition for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese leader, currently fighting with the assistance
of Southern African Development Community (SADC) allied forces to
repulse a rebellion by ethnic Tutsis backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
said the call for the withdrawal of allied forces was a way of
protecting the aggressors, the Daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to see Congo start negotiating peace with rebels.
Nothing came out of this meeting which lasted more than four
hours. Their proposals, which would work against the interests of
the DRC, were not acceptable," said Kabila Sunday in Lubumbashi
of southern Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs, met Kabila last week as part of American efforts toward
resolving the crisis in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
"We will talk to our rebels if both Uganda and Rwanda pull out
and talk to theirs first. An insecure Rwanda is as much a threat
to the DRC as an insecure DRC is to Rwanda or Uganda," said
Kabila, who accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invasion and of backing
rebels in his country.

<HEADLINE> World Record Holder Low-key about Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, Yunnan, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Wu Yanyan,
world record holder for the women's 200m medley, took a low-key
attitude towards the forthcoming Asian Games and warned her
countrymen not to expect the best performance from her.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old, who only resumed training in July after a
half-year physical and mental rehabilitation, said it was
impossible for her to fully recover her best levels before the
opening of the Bangkok Games, which starts on December 6.
</P>
<P>
"It is tremendously difficult to regain my best levels for the
Asian Games," she said in a training camp here, "but I will try
to reach a certain point."
</P>
<P>
Wu' coach Wu Jicai echoed concerns for her fitness and said
the current training is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"She has been undergoing training for two weeks, which so far
is not so good. She easily get tired, and doesn't breathe
properly sometimes."
</P>
<P>
But he said Wu is not going to give up, "She won't let it up,
and her average training amounts to 11,000 meters."
</P>
<P>
Wu kept a rather low profile and seldom took part in
competitions since last October's Chinese National Games, where
she made her name by setting a world record of 2:09.72 in the
200m medley.
</P>
<P>
In the World Championships in January, Wu won the 200m medley
with a meet record of 2:10.88 and touched home in the fourth
place twice in both the 400m medley and 200m butterfly in Perth,
Australia.

<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs Susan Rice will consult with Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe Tuesday on how to break the impasse in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This would be her fifth stop on the continent in an attempt to
bring peace to Africa's third largest country currently embroiled
in a civil war being waged by ethnic Tutsis with the backing of
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Rice has already been to the DRC, where she met Congolese
President Laurent Kabila but the meeting failed to resolve the
crisis, national media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila rejected the U.S. proposal of pulling out Zimbabwean
and Angolan troops from Congo (K) as a precondition of a
cease-fire with the rebels who took up arms to oust him since
early August.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. policy on the DRC crisis is parallel to Zimbabwe's,
namely that we want to see an immediate end to the fighting,
cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of foreign troops, adoption
of a broad-based political system and the transition to
democracy," said Rice on her arrival at Harare International
Airport Monday.

<HEADLINE> Public Order Improving, General Situation Still Stark: Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) - A senior Chinese lawmaker said
here today that public security in some areas has taken a turn for
the better thanks to comprehensive public-order regulations, but
the general situation is still disturbing.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, China's top legislature, made this statement
after concluding a legislative inspection tour to Hainan, Jilin
and Jiangsu provinces, and several municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the ongoing session of the NPC Standing
Committee, he said local governments are basically maintaining
social stability and causing people to feel safer by employing
measures for years to mobilize community forces and help the
police prevent and crack down on crime.
</P>
<P>
"Especially in coastal areas where there used to be quite a
number of public security problems, the general security situation
is obviously better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without the comprehensive measures taken these years, Cao
added, the present security situation would be "much worse".
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, crime rates are still on rise; the problems of
murder, robbery, explosions, and theft are prominent;
prostitution, gambling and drug-related social vices persist
despite repeated police raids; and gang crimes, juvenile
delinquency, and felonies perpetrated by migrants are increasing,
according to the senior lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police have intensified their fight against criminal
gangs and have smashed many in the past two years, but the public
reports that gangs are still growing in number and influence, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security say that in the
first six months this year, police nationwide handled 833,000
criminal cases, up 21.6 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Cao proposed several solutions for the worsening situation:
</P>
<P>
-- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising
crime rates;
</P>
<P>
-- The community-level security network must be spread and
instituted all across the country, as surveys have found that
those places with poor security are also lax in law enforcement;
</P>
<P>
-- And, most important, leaders at all levels must first
become aware of the present situation and remain assiduous in the
comprehensive management of public security.

WELLINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of
Civil Defense Jack Elder said Tuesday in Auckland, the biggest
city in the country, that disaster response facilities would be
available if a major earthquake strikes Wellington, according to
the Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign scientists have repeatedly warned that it is
only a matter of time that an earthquake of 7.5 or above on the
Richter scale will hit Wellington, capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Project Phoenix, an Auckland workshop series
encouraging businesses to consider what resources they could spare
Wellington in a major quake, Elder said that his ministry, local
authorities and emergency services would provide a "swift recovery
operation".
</P>
<P>
"Some 90 percent of homes will be covered for damages through
the Earthquake Commission," the Wellington-based newspaper quoted
Elder as saying.
</P>
<P>
Elder said a strong earthquake would create havoc in
Wellington, possibly knocking out transport links, power and
communication services, but it "may provide an opportunity to
reconsider the shape of central Wellington."

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Tap Overseas Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China is actively exploring
international oil markets, along with its consistent efforts to
tap domestic oil and gas resources, by inviting foreign partners,
said a senior Chinese oil official.
</P>
<P>
Ma Fucai, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation
(CNPC), made the remark at the opening ceremony of the the Sixth
International Oil and Gas Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China is expected to develop
multinational oil production focusing on the Middle East, Russia,
Central Asia and other countries and regions rich in oil, in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China plans to turn out 10 million tons of crude
oil through its overseas production by the turn of the
century. And by the year 2010, China hopes to achieve an annual
overseas oil capacity of 20 million tons, in addition to an annual
gas supply of 50 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Presently, China is making headway in oil exploration and
development overseas. The China National Petroleum Co. (CNPC) and
its subsidiary China Petroleum Engineering Construction
Corporation (CPECC) have successfully obtained shareholding,
operational and leasing rights for oilfields in Peru, Canada,
Thailand, Kuwait and several other countries.
</P>
<P>
China also has great prospects in its oil and gas production
in Iraq, Sudan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
According to the oil official, China has made marked progress
in undertaking oil projects overseas. The CPECC has so far signed
overseas oil construction contracts totaling 1.67 billion U.S.
dollars, and it has been listed among the world's top 225
contractors for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that China is rich in oil resources, producing over
150 million tons of crude oil annually and having so far verified
total oil deposits of 17 billion tons, ranking fifth and ninth in
the world, respectively.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China's petroleum development strategy is to
rely mainly on domestic resources, speed up Sino-foreign
cooperation in exploring the western China and offshore oil and
gas resources, and step up efforts to tap international oil
markets.

BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank
(CCB) has secured a loan of 60 million U.S. dollars from the
Israeli government to support the construction of China's key
information project.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CCB said that this is the first financial

information network.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the information industry is expected to
become a new growth area for China's economy, and the CCB has
listed the industry as a key business development area.
</P>
<P>
The 60 million U.S. dollars will be used to
import vital technologies and equipment required by Jitong's
network and application systems, he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Officials in the Prime Minister's Office maintained Monday
night that an unspecified "important element" of the Palestinian
National Authority security plan, submitted to the U.S. Monday,
is missing and that in its absence ratification of the Wye
Memorandum is impossible.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, however, State Department spokesman James Rubin
confirmed that the PNA has handed the CIA a complete paper
outlining its plan for fighting terror.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat acceded Monday to a telephone
request from Netanyahu asking for a slight delay in the
implementation of the Wye Memorandum until the cabinet and the
Knesset (Parliament) ratify it, even though it did not need such
ratification.
</P>
<P>
With only three ministers on the record as being firmly opposed
to the memorandum, Netanyahu seems assured of a solid cabinet
support.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Arafat has put pressure on the leader of Israel's Arab
Democratic Party in the Knesset to provide a safety net for
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The four party members in the Knesset absented themselves
Monday from a vote on the 1999 budget, which was turned by the
coalition into a motion of confidence in the government, enabling
the budget to pass its first reading by one vote. The party had
said it would vote against the budget.

<HEADLINE> Union Chief Says NBA Agreement Difficult to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Rumors of an agreement in
the 125-day NBA lockout have been greatly exaggerated, union's
direcotr Billy Hunter said today.
</P>
<P>
On the day before the NBA's 53rd season was to have started,
lawyers for the players and owners met for 2 1/2 hours, and in
discussing economic issues found that the sides are further apart
than last week's optimistic negotiations had led many to believe.
</P>
<P>
A similar meeting is planned for Wednesday, but Hunter refuted
a series of reports over the last several days that an agreement
could come within the next two weeks. In fact, he indicated that
there may not be one for two months.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who originated the rumors. I can inform you that
there's no basis for it," Hunter said in a teleconference. "We
have fundamental differences. When we met today, we saw that
there was no meeting of the minds on the framework. We're just
not on the same page. There must have been a miscommunication
somewhere."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the sides apparently agreed to an economic
framework -- a two-year luxury tax with the Larry Bird Exception,
which allows teams to re-sign their own free agents whthout
regard to the salary cap, followed by a two-year modified cap.
The fifth year of the deal would be a moderation of the two plans.
</P>
<P>
But the NBA and the union have been unable to reach agreement
on a percentage breakdown of basketball-related income, and
Hunter would not answer a question on whether the union believes
the proposed system would work.
</P>
<P>
"It appears now that there are some fundamental differences in
regard to our policy, a general lack of understanding and
communication in regard to the framework," Hunter said. "We
apparently had one view and they had a different one."
</P>
<P>
With the optimism of last week dampened, Hunter has a sense
that no NBA games will be played until 1999, which would mean
wiping out a minimum of 400 games. The league already has
canceled 194 games through November.
</P>
<P>
"In my own mind, I've always thought us back sometime around
January," Hunter said. "When I put it in my gut, my gut tells me
January. I think that we can be playing in January. I think it
becomes much more urgent in January. I think we're going to play,
or something extreme is going to happen one way or the other."
</P>
<P>
Hunter said the owners' proposal would scale back the players'
share of the revenues to 50 percent by the year 2003, adding that
the union is looking for 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last season, 57 percent of revenues went to salaries, well
above the 52 percent that allowed the owners to re-open the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The sides are far apart on the luxury tax. The players have
asked for a tax of 50 percent on the amount of any annual salary
over 18 million US dollars, a figure that affects only union
president Patrick Ewing. Owners have asked for tax rates of 50
percent to 200 percent of salaries signed under the Bird
Exception above the league average of 2.6 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The union chief believes finally the pressure will come from
networks and advertisers. The owners will receive 660 million US
dollars this season from network deals signed one year ago with
NBC and TNT. They will receive that money whether or not games
are played, but it has to be returned at some point if the season
is canceled.

<HEADLINE> Milutinovic to Coach U.S. MetroStars Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. national soccer
team coach Bora Milutinovic, who was fired during the World Cup
by Nigerian national team but took over the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars late last season, will return to the U.S. league club
squad in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It's Bora," a source close to the team, who asked not to be
identified, said today.
</P>
<P>
MetroStars spokesman John Nerves said the team has scheduled a
news conference Tuesday in New York to introduce its coach.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic, who coached the U.S. national team into the World
Cup finals and guided the African champions Nigerian team
excellently before losing the chance to enter the top 16 in
France last summer, replaced Alfonso Mondelo as the MetroStars
coach in mid September.
</P>
<P>
The experienced Yugoslav coached the MetroStars to a shootout
win over New England in the final game of the U.S. Major League
Soccer regular season and then in the playoffs, where Columbus
eliminated New York-New Jersey in two straight games.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian-born Milutinovic was rumored to be a candidate for
the U.S. national team coach, a job that finally was won by D.C.
United's Bruce Arena.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature Hears Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) - The State Council submitted
further explanations to the legislature here today on
controversial amendments to the Highway Law.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments, which propose levying fuel taxes to
replace the various fees collected along the highways, were tabled
last Tuesday by Communications Minister Huang Zhendong, but were
later fiercely opposed by legislators.
</P>
<P>
The latest explanation from Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng
was added to today's agenda at the suggestion of the meeting of
chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The meeting today also heard two reports on the implementation
of two laws, one on agriculture and the other on public order,
read by Buhe and Cao Zhi, respectively, both vice-chairmen of the
NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Buhe, the nation's investment in agriculture has
been steadily increasing, the long-term land contracts just signed
by the farmers and the State further stimulate farmers'
enthusiasm, and village democracy and government efforts are
protecting the rights and interests of farmers and easing their
burdens, to some extent.
</P>
<P>
However, still more must be done in these areas for the
coordinated development of the rural economy and the society as a
whole, and for maintaining rural stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi said a legislative survey has found that public order
in some places is improving markedly, but the general situation
is still disturbing.
</P>
<P>
Three NPC special committees on economy, overseas Chinese, and
environmental protection reported today to the legislature on how
the bills submitted by deputies to the Ninth NPC this March have
been treated.
</P>
<P>
According to these reports, several new laws, including the social
security law, residence law and the anti-monopoly law, will all be
drafted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expecting a
tourism boost through the Asian Games with foreign athletes and
tourists to spend at least two billion baht (56 million US
dollars), officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Patcharaphong Aphichartphong, in charge of tourism on the
games organising committee, said the games slated for December
6-20 would complement the national "Amazing Thailand" tourism
campaign perfectly.
</P>
<P>
"Let's say there will be about 20,000 athletes and officials
and they should have about the same number of friends, relatives
and fans here with them," he said, "If each of them spends about
4,000 baht per day...it is expected Thailand will gain about two
billion baht from the visitors and athletes at that time."
</P>
<P>
Athletes from 43 countries and regions are taking part in the
games, coinciding with Thailand's high season for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The police said more than 1,600 officers would be assigned to
provide security, direct traffic and other tasks during the
games.

<HEADLINE> India Plans Brand-Building for Steel Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- India steel will be leveraged
as an individual brand in global markets as part of a promotion
blitzkrieg planned by Indian Union Steel Ministry to boost
exports, official sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for the brand-building campaign would be drawn up
by the ministry-promoted Steel Exporters Forum, the industry's
representative body for tackling export-related issues.
</P>
<P>
The campaign would incorporate roadshows, conferences and
government level interactons with the different countries. "The
objective of the brand-building exercise would be to highlight the
positive aspects of Indian steel and remove the many
misconceptions that global markets have with regard to quality and
service," the Steel Exporters Forum sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Indian industry, in general, is held in relatively low esteem
in other markets, particularly in the Western markets. While the
earlier protectionist economic regime had rendered most Indian
companies incompetent in world markets, liberalization has changed
that. The brand building exercise would, therefore, work towards
removing the misconceptions about the incompetitiveness of Indian
steel in global markets," they said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the conditions in the Indian steel industry in
terms of quality and competitiveness are conducive to hard selling
Indian steel as a brand in global markets. Out of 23 million
tones of steel that is produced in the country, at least six
million tones meet world standards in terms of quality
specifications and cost effectiveness, they further said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Ballooning Service Sector Hits Rock Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's ballooning service
industry hits rock bottom, Vietnam Investment Review said in its
latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The country's service industries, including taxis, hotels,
karaoke and even waterparks, have ballooned by as much as 160
percent during the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
But it's a growth that analysts forecast is " unsustainable",
especially during the current Asian economic meltdown, said the
English-language weekly.
</P>
<P>
It said some pessimists are predicting "a below-five percent
growth rate over the next year and very tough times ahead for the
sector".
</P>
<P>
The service industry generates a major part of Vietnam's gross
domestic product (gdp), with 41 percent of last year's gdp coming
from the sector .
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the service growth rate has exceeded general
gdp growth, but government forecasts predict service growth to
fall to 4.99 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict the downturn will continue, citing the hotel
industry as an example. Room numbers have boomed while foreign and
domestic visitors have sunk occupancy rates to 20 to 30 percent
despite reduced room charges, said the weekly.

<P>
NANNING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Two historical sites featuring
historical ties between China and Viet Nam were opened to tourists
recently at the Chinese side of the Sino-Vietnamese border after
renovation.
</P>
<P>
One is a boundary tablet initially erected in 1890 by the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911) government and the French who then ruled Viet
Nam, demarking the China-Viet Nam border.
</P>
<P>
The tablet, located on the banks of the Beilun River at the
Chinese city of Dongxing, had fallen into the river before it was
retrieved and protected by the local government in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The other attraction is the Ho Chi Minh Pavilion, previously
called the Dongxing Six Angle Pavilion but renamed for the former
Vietnamese Communist Party leader when he stopped there in
February 1960.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Hold Talks on Siachin Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani defense
delegation is leaving for New Delhi Tuesday for talks with Indian
defense officials on the dispute over the strategic Siachin
Glacier in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Defense Secretary Iftikhar Ali Khan will lead the
delegation in the talks to be held on November 6, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has several proposals to settle the dispute over
Siachin, including that India withdraw its forces sent to the
glacier in early 1970s after the Simla accord, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue on the 7,272-meter-high Siachin is part of a
nine-day composite talks on six bilateral issues which the two
countries agreed to resume last month.
</P>
<P>
As another part of the composite peace dialogue, a delegation
of Pakistan's electricity authorities, which left for India on
Monday, will start formal talks with Indian officials on November
5. Before the talks they are expected to discuss a deal on
possible supply of Pakistan's surplus power to India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani and Indian foreign secretaries held separate meetings
on peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir in Islamabad from
October 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
But there was no progress in the talks as the two sides all
insisted their old positions on the issues. The second round of
talks on the two issues will held in New Delhi in February next
year.
</P>
<P>
Other issues the two countries will discuss include economic
and commercial cooperation, anti-terrorism and anti-drug
trafficking, promotion of friendly exchanges in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Promotes Use of Iodized Salt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made more efforts to
promote the use of iodized salt among the people to prevent
iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
November 2 has become the "all people buy and use iodized salt"
day in Vietnam since 1994 as an effort of the country to
eliminate iodine deficiency by the year 2000 and disorders caused
by iodine deficiency by 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here Tuesday, as a result of efforts
by the government, 23 out of the country's 61 provinces and cities
have had at least 90 percent of their population used iodized
salt.
</P>
<P>
Eight mountainous provinces in the north and central highlands,
where goiter was prevalent, have 100 percent of their population
used the salt thanks to the government's policy to subsidize
iodized salt prices.
</P>
<P>
Lagging behind are nine provinces in the Mekong delta with only
50 percent of the people using the salt.
</P>
<P>
The rate of children aged from eight to twelve affected by
iodine deficiency have reduced from 94 percent in 1993 to more
than 30 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The rate of children in this age bracket suffering from goiter
also dropped from 22.4 percent in 1993 to 14.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The improvement is most remarkably seen in mountainous, central
highlands and central coastal provinces, where the rate even
decreased to nearly seven percent in some places.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Found for Dinosaur Demise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have found
new evidence pointing to the extinction of dinosaurs about 65
million years ago, said a report from the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at U.S. Scripps Institute of Oceanography said
they have found an isotope of chromium Cr-53 in the
extinction-era sediment samples from Denmark and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Cr-53 is now a vanishing isotope in the solar system because it
is produced by a form of radioactive manganese that decayed fully
billions of years ago. But the sediment samples have the same
abundance of Cr-53 found in stony, carbon-rich meteorites.
Therefore scientists concluded that much of that must clearly be
of extraterrestrial origin.
</P>
<P>
Now most scientists believe the theory that about 65 million
years ago, an asteroid or comet collided with the Earth, causing an
eco-catastrophe that led to the prompt extinction of dinosaurs
and many other species. There are two more pieces of evidence that
support that theory:
</P>
<P>
One is the detection of a titanic crater in the Yucatan
peninsula whose formation falls into the geological age of
the collision.
</P>
<P>
The other is the fact that an abnormally rich amount of an
element called iridium in sediment layers that are exactly 65
million years old. Iridium is extremely scare in the earth's
crust, but much more common in meteorites. Therefore scientists
assume that it arrived via the collision. However, there are still
arguments against both explanations.

<HEADLINE>   U.S. Medical Study Lists Gender-based Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Diseases significantly and
differently affect women than men, the Society for the Advancement
of Women's Health Research (SAWHR), a U.S. nonprofit organization,
said in a news release on Monday.
</P>
<P>
SAWHR has conducted a comprehensive scientific literature
review in the emerging field of gender-based biology and
identified 10 of the most important points in the field.
</P>
<P>
Many of the most dramatic gender differences are evident in
auto-immune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, lupus
and rheumatoid arthritis, SAWHR said.
</P>
<P>
According to SAWHR, which pioneers in gender-based biology, the
concept is meant to identify the biological and physiological
differences between men and women, including gender differences
found at the system, organ, tissue, cellular and sub-cellular
level, and gender differences in response to pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The 10 differences between men and women SAWHR listed are:
</P>
<P>
-- Women are two times more likely than men to contract a
sexually transmitted disease, and 10 times more likely to contract
HIV during unprotected sex with an infected partner.
</P>
<P>
-- Women are two- to three-times more likely to suffer from
depression in part because their brains make less of the hormone
serotonin.
</P>
<P>
-- Women comprise 80 percent of the population suffering from
osteoporosis, which is attributable to a higher rate of lost bone
mass.
</P>
<P>
-- Women smokers are 20 to 70 percent more likely to develop
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
-- Women are more likely to have a second heart attack within a
year.
</P>
<P>
-- Women tend to wake up from anesthesia more quickly -- an
average of 7 minutes as compared 11 minutes for men.
</P>
<P>
-- Even common drugs can cause different reactions and side
effects in women and men.
</P>
<P>
-- Three out of four people suffering from auto-immune diseases
are women.
</P>
<P>
-- After consuming the same amount of alcohol, women have
higher blood alcohol content than men.
</P>
<P>
-- Some pain medications are far more effective in relieving
pain in women than in men.
</P>
<P>
SAWHR said the findings have the potential to revolutionize the
way to understand health and disease for both men and women.
</P>
<P>
"The more scientists look for such differences, the more they
find, and the more they recognize the importance of these
differences," SAWHR said.

LIMA -- Peru's foreign currency reserves dropped by 140 million
U.S. dollars to a total of 9.9 billion dollars on October 27, the
central bank reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due mainly to a 100 million dollars decrease of
money deposited in bank accounts and to the rise of business
liquidation loans to 114 million dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The drop was compensated partly by a better exchange rate and
higher public sector deposits amounting to 34 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Top Priority to Exploration, Utilization of Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its gas
production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by 2005 as one of
the state's important strategies for developing energy resources,
a senior Chinese oil official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to verify additional onshore gas reserves of
one trillion cubic meters by the end of the century, with an
accumulative total approaching two trillion cubic meters, said Ma
Fucai, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas production capacity should be
increased by 10 billion cubic meters, with a cumulative total
topping 25 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Ma disclosed these in a keynote speech entitled "Potential for
China's Natural Gas Development" at the opening ceremony of the
Sixth International Oil and Gas Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC president predicted major breakthroughs in the
expansion of proven gas reserves and production capacity in the
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, the Tarim Basin and Sichuan
Province. The country's annual gas output should reach 30 billion
cubic meters by 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the country's gas production potential is huge. Through
years of vigorous development, three large-scale gas production
areas have been formed in China.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
northwest China, total gas reserves of 230 billion cubic meters
have been verified. Total gas reserves of 200 billion cubic meters
have been confirmed in the eastern part of Sichuan Province,
southwest China. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also in
the west, total gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters have been
verified, in addition to the discovery of a group of new
gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion
cubic meters has been identified.
</P>
<P>
Along with domestic gas exploration, active efforts are under
way to utilize the gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project which envisions construction of a
long-distance gas pipeline running through China and the Korean
Peninsula to Japan. This project could provide China with a gas
supply of 25 billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia should deliver 25 billion cubic meters of gas
annually to China.
</P>
<P>
By around 2000, natural-gas pipelines running across China will
have taken shape, which will effectively ease shortages in
industrial and civil gas utilization in many cities, the official
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Golkar Apologizes for Past Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar
(Functional Group) has finally issued a national apology for the
group's blunders committed during the 32-year rule of former
president Suharto.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the Golkar faction at the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Monday admitted that the
organization was guilty of "political mistakes".
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said he decided to issue the group's first ever apology
following a meeting with Golkar Chairman Akbar Tandjung on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
"I submit this apology on behalf of the organization. This is
the first opportunity for this statement to be made public after I
spoke to him (Akbar)," national newspapers Tuesday quoted Marzuki
as saying.
</P>
<P>
His apology came after several high-ranking Golkar officials
last month refused to seek penance for the group's numerous
mistakes, which mainly involved supporting a corrupt autocrat who
led the nation into financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
During its extraordinary congress last month, Golkar dismissed
calls for it to apologize, saying the blame for the country's
economic, social and political collapse should not be laid at its
door alone and that all elements in society should share the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1964, the once all-powerful functional group was
Soeharto's loyal political vehicle, which never dared to disagree
with its leader until May this year, when the aging autocrat was
forced to resign amid rising socio-economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Golkar dominated every general election since 1971, thanks to a
lot of help from the military. Its outrageous victories, often
more than 70 percent, were always marred by allegations of fraud,
cheating and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Following Suharto's downfall on May 21, Golkar was blamed as
the main culprit behind the economic crisis, as most of its
members in parliament were accused of being greedy practitioners
of corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
According to Marzuki, Golkar is well aware that its public
image has slumped. Therefore, he said, the apology was very
necessary.
</P>
<P>
He said Golkar, as an organization, needed to really apologize
so it could start rebuilding normal relations with people.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Aid Soil Conservation in China's Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is expected to
grant another 150 million U.S. dollars next year for a water and
soil conservation project in China's Loess Plateau after its board
of directors approves the feasibility study for the project.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank assessment panel recently investigated the
projected areas and were satisfied with the Chinese government's
preliminary feasibility study, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming project will be the second phase of the 1994
World Bank-financed project in a total area of more than 300,000
square kilometers in the similar region.
</P>
<P>
A loan of 150 million U.S. dollars was granted in 1994 for the
eight-year project to help restore China's heavily eroded Loess
Plateau and to lift local residents out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase project covers an area of 20,000 square
kilometers involving 37 counties in four provinces and autonomous
regions. Total investment for the project will amount to 2.1
billion yuan (253 million U.S. dollars), including the
150-million-dollars loan from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion in five years, the water and soil conservation
program along 12 tributaries of the Yellow River will reduce the
amount of sand and mud washed away by 30 million tons a year,
experts say.

<P>
GUIYANG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province has made great achievements in the World Food Program
project called "China 3356" in Zhijin and Nayong counties.
</P>
<P>
The project has increased the forest coverage in this area from
8.3 to 35 percent while reducing eroded land from 121,000 to
36,000 hectares, said an official in charge of the program.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the average net per-capita income of farmers has
increased from 70 yuan to 1,100 yuan and grain output has doubled,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The "China 3356" project was initiated in 1988 by the United
Nations World Food Program. It has so far provided 98,000 tons of
wheat in free aid to this region, and helped improve the local
environment.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that the project area has
curbed large-scale soil erosion and avoided severe natural

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Strengthen Rule For Foreign Job Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankans seeking foreign
employment will not be permitted to leave the country unless they
register their passports with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign
Employment (SLBFE), according to SLBFE sources Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was decided to curb illegal migration of Sri Lankan
workers to other countries for employment through job agencies
which have not been recognized by the SLBFE, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under this new rule, which will come into effect from November
5 this year, passport of all migrant workers must be authorized
with a special official stamp affixed by the SLBFE.
</P>
<P>
This stamp indicates the employment protection and personal
security extended by the government to Sri Lankan workers employed
in foreign countries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
To make this a success, the SLBFE has assigned a team of
officials. They will be deployed at a special counter at the
Colombo International Airport to examine the passport and
documents of migrant workers, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Likely to Hit Thai Rice Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Thailand's
paddy fields will not be farmed in the coming season as Thailand
faces one of the worst water shortages ever, irrigation officials
have warned.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in the country's dams are 50-60 percent lower than
normal due to the drought. It means that there will only be enough
water for 1.7 million rai (272,000 hectares) of paddy fields. Last
year, 4 million rai (640,000 hectares) were farmed.
</P>
<P>
The government is warning that agricultural land will be zoned,
with only lowland areas promised irrigated water. Higher plateaus
will be watered only if there is enough to go round.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Tuesday quoted Irrigation Department chief
Pramote Maiklad as saying that the situation was at "crisis"
level. Water stored in four major dams in Chao Phraya and Mae
Klong basins was 60 percent lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
"It has never happened that both basins are dry at the same
time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Reduction Draft Removed From Environmental Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A draft bill on "voluntary
commitments" to reduce toxic gas emissions has been removed from
the topics of a United Nations climatic changes meeting which
opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The draft, if passed, would require both industrialized and
developing countries to reduce toxic gas emissions on a voluntary
basis.
</P>
<P>
The group of 77 developing countries and China insisted that
voluntary commitments should not be included in the debate because
industrialized countries are the main producers of toxic gases and
therefore should reduce their gas emissions first.
</P>
<P>
China, Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia and Brazil noted that the
measure should not be applied to developing countries as it would
curb their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They said that the reduction of toxic gas emissions should be
based on the responsibility principle defined in the 1992
U.N. Framework Convention on Climatic Changes.
</P>
<P>
However, the industrialized countries, including Australia, the
United States and Russia, back the so-called voluntary commitments.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 government representatives and delegates from
non-governmental organizations from 163 countries are taking part
in the meeting, which will end on November 13.

XI'AN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China will spend more than 300
million yuan (36.14 million U.S. dollars) to build 17 "green
corridors" for giant pandas by turning farmland and roads into
area for planting trees and bamboos at the end of this century and
early next century.
</P>
<P>
These corridors will be built in the provinces of Sichuan,
Shaanxi and Gansu for the purpose of promoting communications
between giant pandas in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Expanding human activities, especially the development of the
modern communications industry, have seriously destroyed the
habitats of giant pandas in the Qinling, Minshan, Qionglai,
Xiangling and Liangshan mountains, blocking genetic exchanges
among different groups of giant pandas.

China has so far built nearly 20 protection zones for the

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Inflation Below IMF Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation is likely
to average between 8.1 percent and 8.2 percent this year, compared
with 9.2 percent predicted by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) judging from the current trends.
</P>
<P>
The prediction by Thawatchai Sophasatienpong, deputy
director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Business Economics
Department, is based on a 0.2 percent decline in the consumer
price index (CPI) between September and October, The Bangkok Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The department expects a similar decline in November and a
further drop in December, as long as there are no unexpected
problems such as floods.
</P>
<P>
The October inflation was 5.9 percent higher than in the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The December price increase is expected to be 4.8 percent
year-on-year, compared with 8 percent forecast by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The fall in October continued the trend in September, with
foods including rice, eggs, vegetables and fruit down in price.
The food and beverage index was down by 0.7 percent between
September and October, while the index for other products was up
by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Products to fall in price last month included fragrant jasmine
rice, pork, cabbages, chilies, orange, eggs and cleaning products.
</P>
<P>
Prices were unchanged for cooking gas, telecommunications and
electricity services, public transport and clothes. However,
marine equipment, fuel oil, ferry boat services and cement rose in
price.
</P>
<P>
Thawatchai said declining interest rates and inflation would
spur domestic consumption and economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Protests Macedonia's Denying Entry of Its Reporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister
Nadezhda Mihailova on Monday protested strongly against
Macedonia's refusal of Bulgarian journalists' entry into Macedonia
to cover its second round of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Macedonia's Ambassador in Sofia Nikola
Todorchevski, Mihailova voiced this protest concerning
journalists who have regular accreditations.
</P>
<P>
Calling Macedonia's actions "unacceptable," Mihailova said this
is unprecedented in treating journalists and is in violation of
all existing international norms.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova added that Bulgaria has not responded in any way to
the anti-Bulgarian campaign which is being conducted in Macedonia
particularly during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that Bulgaria respects its neighboring country
and will not stand in the way of the normal course of the
elections there, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov said the Macedonian
border authorities did not give any concrete explanation to the
journalists for not letting them in and handled them roughly.
</P>
<P>
However, Ambassador Todorchevski told reporters after the
meeting that relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia are
"progressing well," and the journalists incident is "passing by."

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Agriculture and
Cooperatives Ministry will ask the cabinet next month to consider
a withdrawal from the International National Rubber Organization
(INRO).
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already asked agencies concerned to study the
pros and cons of the withdrawal, Deputy Agriculture and
Cooperatives Minister Somchai Sunthornwat was quoted Tuesday by
the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Their findings will be presented to the cabinet next week, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came after Thailand's request made at INRO's
annual meeting in Malaysia last month, to raise INRO's market
intervention price, was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wants to shore up rubber prices by six percent from
the current 214.95 Malaysia/Singapore cents per kilo to reflect
the declining price caused by weakening of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia/Singapore cent is an artificial currency,
representing INRO rubber prices.
</P>
<P>
INRO is the world's only commodity group with a buffer-stock
system, buying and selling rubber in the market to support prices
at predetermined intervention levels.
</P>
<P>
Somchai said the proposal would go ahead, although the ministry
has been asked by INRO to delay it for a week.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Citizens' Investment Sharply Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The investment of Myanmar
citizens in the country reached 30.82 billion kyats (102.75
million U.S. dollars) at the end of May this year, up 69.32
million dollars or 207 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Myanmar Business News,
published by the Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the
sharp rise in investment of local citizens was due mainly to heavy
investment in real estate development and manufacturing, which
jumped from 7.2 million dollars and 6.86 million dollars to 63.4
million dollars and 14.1 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The invested projects, which increased from 70 to 137 in the
period, covered construction, transport, hotels and tourism,
industrial estate, livestock and fisheries, agriculture and
others.
</P>
<P>
To promote domestic investment and boost commodity production
and exports by the private sector, Myanmar enacted its Citizens'
Investment Law in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, which plays an active role in Myanmar's
economic development, contributed 75.4 percent to the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997/98 when the GDP grew by 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investment in Myanmar from 23 countries and
regions after late 1988 amounted to more than 7 billion dollars at
the end of May this year, the statistics show.

LIMA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Peru's foreign currency reserves
dropped by 140 million U.S. dollars to a total of 9.9 billion
dollars on October 27, the central bank reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due mainly to a 100 million dollars decrease of
money deposited in bank accounts and to the rise of business
liquidation loans to 114 million dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The drop was compensated partly by a better exchange rate and
higher public sector deposits amounting to 34 million dollars.
</P>

Despite floodings this year and the effects of the current
world financial crisis, Peru had managed to keep its reserves
above 10 billion dollars.

surface. Consequently, it has been described as the "sea of hope"
for China's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
A string of recent geological prospecting results suggests that
the proven gas reserves of Tarim is now 500 billion cubic meters,
making it the largest onshore gasfield in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has mobilized more than 20,000 workers for a great battle
for oil and gas in the region in an effort to make up for reduced
outputs at major oilfields on the eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
Jia Chengzao, deputy head of the Tarim oil and gas prospecting
zone, said workers have dug three exploratory shafts so far this
year at Kuqa at the northern Tarim Basin. One shaft produces
660,000 cubic meters of gas a day, and the other two have similar
daily outputs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five high-yielding gas wells have been dug at the
Mazhatage zone on the Basin's southwestern section where there are
probable gas reserve of 200-400 billion cubic meters, equivalent
to the size of the Shaan-gan-ning Gasfield, now the largest
in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tarim is also an oil-rich area. By the end of last year, 12
oil-gas fields had been found on four large oil-bearing structures
-- Mazhatage, Quka, Lunnan and Tazhong -- with verified reserves
of 600 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"They cover a large tract of land and have thick layer and
great reserves. Development of these structures will turn the
Basin into China's most significant new source of energy," said
Qiu Zhongjian, general director of the Tarim oil prospecting zone.
</P>
<P>
To date, half of the 12 oil-gas fields have gone into operation
with a combined annual production capacity of 5 million tons of
crude oil. They turned out 4.2 million tons of oil last year and
3.85 million tons so far this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, four high-yielding oil wells began to gush oil
this year in the Tazhong Zone in the heart of the Basin, with
daily outputs ranging from 80 to 300 tons.
</P>
<P>
A 7,200-meter-deep oil well, the deepest in China, was dug this
past spring at a large oil-bearing zone. The well ran through nine
sedimentary strata accumulated over 570 million years, six of
which contain oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Qiu predicted that the verified oil reserves in Tarim will
climb to one-billion tons by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, China has discovered 592 onshore
oil-and-gas fields, 455 of which have been exploited. The annual
output of 21 large oilfields, led by Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe,
has maintained an output above 100 million tons annually for 19
years, making China the fifth largest oil producer in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro has
called for international financial aid to help Brazil end its
economic crisis, it was reported here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the opening of the 16th international fair of Havana on
Sunday, Castro said that a worsening of the situation in Brazil
could affect all Latin American countries, the United States
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Castro said the prospect of the worldwide financial crisis
would be decided in Latin America, which he said was the area
where the U.S. would defend itself from the slump.
</P>
<P>
Almost 20 percent of U.S. exports in the past have gone to
Latin America, so the U.S. economy would be effected if the
slowdown in economic growth in Brazil spreads to other South
American regions and countries, local economic experts warned.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader further pointed out that global financial
problems should be solved through negotiations, while blasting the
International Monetary Fund for imposing inflexible austerity
policies on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the financial crisis in Russia and Brazil, Castro
said he believes international support is needed to enable the two
countries to negotiate with financial institutions.

<P>
YINCHUAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The start of construction of a
new high-grade highway in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region has initiated its efforts to forge a key economic growth
area.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to link the three cities of Lingwu,
Wuzhong and Qingtongxia, the region's priority development areas,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The 30-kilometer-long highway, at a cost of 420 million yuan,
will take two and a half years to finish, and will also be linked
to three other national highways running across the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the local government vowed to develop Lingwu,
Wuzhong and Qingtongxia, together with the regional capital of
Yinchuan, into a key economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
Located at the heart of the region's transportation network,
this area, also a major northwest China grain production base, is
reported to have rich coal reserves and other energy resources.
</P>
<P>
The road now under construction is part of the local
government's efforts to develop the area, which has 32 percent of
the region's population and creates 54.7 percent of its total
gross domestic product (GDP) and 62.2 percent of its revenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf has made an early
comeback only to suffer a first round defeat in the doubles at
the 450,000 US dollars Leipzig Open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, plagued by injuries in the past two years, appeared
relaxed playing for the first time in 56 days following an
operation on her right hand after the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Teamed up with 16-year-old Mia Buric, the healthy Graf was
beaten by Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Natascha Zvereva 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
"Physically I feel good. But since we were playing one of the
world's top doubles team, we approached the match in a pretty
easy-going way," said Graf, who dominated the women's game for a
decade before a knee injury threatened her career end in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Graf steps on the court Tuesday in singles
against Romania's Ruxanda Dragomir, the latest comeback coming
earlier than anticipated. The German had originally planned to
return on November 9 at the Philadelphia event.
</P>
<P>
She took a wild card at Leipzig, which she helped found and
won every year between 1990 and 1993, because her latest injury
had healed faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to play singles, but I'm not expecting to reach the
final," said the German.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Democrats to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday called on the Democratic Party's core constituents to vote
in the mid-term elections, saying the idea of a low turnout is "a big
risk that's not worth taking."
</P>
<P>
Clinton sat for a series of interviews and held a ceremony to
urge voters to elect a Congress that would be sympathetic to
proposals such as his plan for expanding patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an ordinary time and, therefore, it is not an
ordinary election," Clinton said. "I hope the American people will
go to the polls tomorrow in large numbers, and I hope they will
vote in a way that sends a signal, loud and clear, that America
needs a real patients' bill of rights."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Clinton took part in a roundtable discussion
with prominent black Americans and recorded radio spots and
telephone messages that went out to eligible black voters in 13
states that had low black turnout in the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
The president's discussions targeted black and Hispanic
audiences, the segment of its constituency that the Democratic
Party believes could be a deciding factor in up to 35 House races,
and Senate races in California, Illinois, New York and North
Carolina, and in a number of gubernatorial contests.
</P>
<P>
"If we want our voices heard and we want to continue the
progress of the last six years, I need some support in Congress,"
Clinton said on a nationally syndicated radio program, the Tom
Joyner Morning Show. "If everybody stays home and we have people
in here who will be irresponsible,... then things could get worse
in a hurry. That's a big risk that's not worth taking."
</P>
<P>
Later, in an interview with Black Entertainment Television that
was to air Monday night, Clinton said he feels "both confident and
apprehensive" about Tuesday's election because "it will determine
how much I can do" in his remaining two years in office.
</P>
<P>
"The last two years of my presidency, I think, would be far
more focused on progress as opposed to this Washington partisan
politics," Clinton said. "So,... it's terribly important to me."
</P>
<P>
Clinton touched on issues of concern to blacks and Hispanics,
and drew distinctions between Democratic and Republican policies
on the 2000 census, immigration policies and education spending.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Latino radio reporters, Clinton said
Hispanics could choose between "a decent, fair, equitable and
accelerated process of immigration and naturalization" offered by
Democrats, or the Republicans' policy, "which is to slow it down,
make it more difficult, and do things which, in my view, are
unfair to immigrants coming to this country."

<P>
KUWAIT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Jassim al-Huwaidy scored five
times to pace defending champion Kuwait for a 6-2 victory over
Qatar in the six-nation Gulf Cup soccer tournament in Manama,
Bahrain on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Huwaidy netted twice in the first half and three times in
the second half to put Kuwait, an eight-time winner of the Gulf
Cup, back into the tournament after an earlier 2-1 loss to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In the day's second match, Saudi Arabia drew 1-1 with host
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Al-Huwaidy scored Kuwait's first goal eight minutes after the
kickoff, with a powerful shot to the right corner. In the 38th
minute he scored with a similar shot to left side that sent
Qatari goalkeeper Ahmed Khalil diving in vain.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's third goal came in the 51st minute from forward
Bashaar Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Al-Huwaidy's next goal came in the 57th minute with a
well-placed header. He scored again in the 74th minute.
</P>
<P>
Al-Huwaidy's scored his final goal in injury time with a
penalty shot awarded after Khalil tripped him in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Despite scoring two goals, Qatar responded well only in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Qatar scored a 20th minute equalizer from midfielder Abdul
Aziz Hassan and later scored again in the 80th minute with a c
urved shot by Mustafa Mubarak who took a free kick outside the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the favorites to win the cup, drew 1-1 with host
Bahrain in a later match.
</P>
<P>
Saudi captain Yousif al-Thiniyan scored in the 30th minute of
the first half to give Saudi Arabia the lead.
</P>
<P>
But Bahrain scored the equalizer in the last minute of the
first half when Bahraini midfielder Abdul Razzak Mohammed
capitalized on a free kick outside the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini forward Hadi Hameed got the first red card of the
competition in the 75th minute for bringing down Saudi Arabia's
Mohammed al-Khilaiwi.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Saudis world experience and their advantage over a
Bahraini team that was down a player, they were unable to score
in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Bridge Fears Ships More Than Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The major bridge over the giant
Yangtze River has stood firm against numerous torrential floods in
its 41 years, but is in danger of being destroyed by ships and
boats that scrap over or bump into its bridge piers, cautioned a
recent issue of the China Tourism News.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, in the city of Wuhan at the middle reaches of the
river, has been rammed some 68 times, suffering more than 10
million yuan in damages, the newspaper quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The eight 33-meter-high reinforced concrete piers are 1.55
meters in diameter and can each withstand 60,000 tons of
pressure. They are also designed to withstand earthquakes
measuring up to eight points on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
But continuous severe knocks by ships and boats are liable to
dislocate or even destroy the bridge piers, experts say.
</P>
<P>
On October 5, the No. 5 pier suffered probably its worst knock,
by a motor-powered boat pulling two barges, causing damage to a
3-square-meter area and severe cuts.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to this latest incident, experts have called for
urgent safety measures for the bridge piers.
</P>
<P>
Safety measures are necessary because the piers are too close
together, experts say, adding that changing the river bed and
torrential currents can end potential damage to the bridge piers.
</P>
<P>
The bridge spans what engineers call the throat position of the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the country's first railway and highway
bridge. Yet despite the annual summer floods and the 68 rammings
by ships, the bridge, the busiest over the Yangtze, has so far
proven its solid quality, expert say.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi is one of the
early entries for the Australian Open in January, the
International Tennis Federation said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi who won the Australian Open in 1995, has five
tournaments to his credit this year and has moved from No. 141 to
No. 5 in the ATP rankings over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Agassi was granted a wild card to play in the 1998
Australian Open, although he eventually received direct entry
into the draw.
</P>
<P>
"To think a year ago Andre originally needed a wild card and
is now a serious contender is a transformation to say the least,"
tournament director Paul McNamee said in the latest ITF news
bulletin. "That he could even be the tournament's top seed in
1999 is extraodinary."
</P>
<P>
Other early entries are former champions Mary Pierce, Jim
Courier, Goran Ivanisevic, Mary Joe Fernandez and Iva Majoli.

ROME, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy expressed its concern Monday
over Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with the United Nations on
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Baghdad's
barring UN inspectors Saturday introduces "new elements of tension
and reduces the likelihood of an overall UN review of Iraq's
obligations to disarm."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's full compliance with the pertinent UN resolutions is
the only way to lift the sanctions," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government also reaffirmed its support to UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, the Iraqi government declared to cut off its
on-again-off-again cooperation with the UNSCOM - the UN's special
commission to monitor disarmament because the economic sanctions
against Iraq remain in place.

<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Everton said Monday police videos will be used to try to identify
supporters they believe shamed the club by launching a bottle
attack on Manchester United star Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
The Goodison Park club have vowed to identify and prosecute
fans who attacked the Danish goalkeeper with a hail of plastic
bottles at the end of Saturday's 4-1 home Premiership defeat.
</P>
<P>
Club secretary Michael Dunford has warned fans will be banned
for life if they are found guilty.
</P>
<P>
The FA are waiting for a report on the incident from match
referee Peter Jones, which seems certain to result in Everton
being charged with failing to control their fans.
</P>
<P>
Dunford said: "We have apologised unreservedly to Manchester U
nited about the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour from a minority
of mindless idiots," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned fans found guilty could expect a ban from
Goodison:"Everyone at Everton appreciates the tremendous support
that we receive home and away, and this season again it has been
incredible.
</P>
<P>
"But that fact isn't going to be remembered because of these
morons. This will not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
Everton have already been in trouble with the FA this year
after a fan got on the pitch during another 4-1 defeat at the end
of last season.
</P>
<P>
That incident during a game against Aston Villa resulted in a
severe warning from the FA about future conduct.

<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Finland-based Nokia, the
world's largest mobile telephone producer, is increasing
investment in China which is now one of its most important markets.
</P>
<P>
Nokia Group President Jorma Ollila said the company's China
sales for this year will hit two billion U.S. dollars, up
dramatically on the 1.2 billion U.S. dollars for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen was visiting China at the
end of October and cut the ribbon to inaugurate the Nokia
Industrial Park in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The complex, the first industrial park in Beijing funded by a
foreign company, includes a research and development center, a
training center, and the company's manufacturing and marketing
departments.
</P>
<P>
Pertti Simovaara, vice-president and general manager of Nokia
Mobile Phones (China), said that demand in China will have a
significant impact on the future development of the international
mobile telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
China currently has over 18 million mobile phone users, and the
number is expected to exceed 40 million by the end of the year
2000. The number mobile phone users in China grew from zero to the
current level in only 12 years, a growth rate never before in the
world.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the first countries to use CDMA mobile
communications technology for commercial purposes. The
International Telecommunications Union is currently considering a
plan to adopt China's CDMA technology as international standard.
</P>
<P>
Ollila noted that China is politically stable and has
introdcuced effective economic policies. He noted that Chinese
leaders have consistently treated foreign enterprises and
investment with respect and Nokia will continue to expand its
exposure in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin met Prime Minister Lipponen last
week and pointed out that Nokia's telecommunications equipment has
gained a substantial share of the Chinese market.

<P>
Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson currently hold the greatest share
of China's mobile telephone market. Nokia is rapidly gaining
ground on Motorola which has the longest operational history and
holds the largest market share in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Customs statistics for the first eight months of the
year show that Nokia exported products valued at 70 million U.S.
dollars, up ten-fold on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Motorola's exports for the period basically remained at the
1997 period level.
</P>
<P>
Nokia replaced Motorola as the world's largest mobile telephone
manufacturer for the January-September period, with this year's
global sales projected at more than 35 million hand sets.
</P>
<P>
An official from Nokia (China) Investment Co. Ltd. said the
company currently holds a 30-percent share of the mobile telephone
hand set market in China.
</P>
<P>
Nokia has established seven joint ventures, one solely owned
company, 20 representative offices, one research and development
center, three systems training centers and 30 authorized
maintenance centers in China, which employ 3,000 local people.
</P>
<P>
The company opened a new joint venture in the southwest China
municipality of Chongqing in September to manufacture mobile
communication systems. Nokia is also expanding its joint ventures
in Beijing and Dongguan in south China's Guangdong Province, as
well as Suzhou in Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
Simovaara, pointing to rapidly changing demands of Chinese
consumers, said that the company has had to continuously expand
both the scales and production capacities of its joint
ventures. He said that Nokia's Research and Development Center is
staffed by over 100 Chinese engineers who concentrate on
localizing products and technology.
</P>
<P>
Nokia has invested close to 500 million U.S. dollars in China,
and its network section dedicates 14 percent of annual sales
revenue to developing new products for the local market.
</P>
<P>
Nokia recently introduced its mini-GSM base station, MetroSite,
and Nokia-8810 hand set model to the Chinese market. The equipment
features the same technological advantages as similar Motorola
products.
</P>
<P>
The Nokia-8810 hand set model has built-in antenna and large
display screen with Chinese input capacity.
</P>
<P>
Simovaara said it is delighted to see that Chinese companies
such as Datang have developed small base stations which equal
Nokia products in terms of technology.

</P>
<P>
"Federal purchasing of renewable energy is a wise investment in
the future, an investment with a return that will far exceed its
costs," it added.
</P>
<P>
As the largest single energy user in the United States, ASES
said, the federal government is in a unique position to influence
the market for renewable energy through its purchasing decisions.
</P>
<P>
Large government purchase of renewable energy technologies
would lower the net manufacturing costs of these technologies,
leading to increased private market demand, higher production
levels and greater utilization, the ASES said.
</P>
<P>
According to ASES, the federal government of the United States
purchases very little renewable energy because of its current
up-front costs. Although renewable energy systems often cost less
than fossil fuel systems over the long term, federal regulations
and accounting practices favor technologies that are less
expensive to purchase initially.
</P>
<P>
"So renewables appear less attractive," the ASES said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government spends 8 billion U.S. dollars per year
for all of its energy needs, including 3.5 billion dollars for
electricity, the ASES said.
</P>
<P>
By relying on renewables to supply just one-half of one percent
of its power needs by the year 2000, the organization said, the
federal government could prevent 51,000 metric tons of carbon
levels and greater utilization, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ASES calls U.S. Congress and the president to eliminate
existing regulations preventing the federal government from
purchasing renewable energy.

<HEADLINE> East China's Suzhou New Area Improving Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou New Area, a state
high-tech industrial development zone in east China's Jiangsu
Province, has been striving to improve its investment environment
by reducing various administrative fees.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the New Area has adopted three
plans to streamline administrative charges and standardize fee
levies to help reduce the burdens on local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Local pricing departments have distributed leaflets explaining
procedures for the levy of fees to various enterprises, and a
complaint department has been opened for reporting possible
misconduct in this regard.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that administrative fees levied this year will
be reduced to 24 million yuan from 37.8 million yuan in 1995, and
the ratio of levies to the areas' financial revenues will also
drop to four percent from 28 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The improved environment has led to the growth of the Suzhou New
Area. The area is now home to more than 300 overseas-backed
enterprises, more than a half of which have increased their
investment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial crisis, the Suzhou New Area has
attracted over 700 million U.S. dollars in overseas investment
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, the New Area saw a 30 percent growth
in major economic indexes such as gross domestic product and
revenue, and the composite index for industrial economic returns
was 24 percentages points higher the national average.

<HEADLINE> Forest Reject Van Hooijdonk Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Nottingham Forest manager, Dave
Bassett, confirmed Monday that German side VfB Stuttgart have
been rejected for a bid for troubled striker Pierre van Hooijdonk.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman only returned to the Premiership club on Friday
after a three-month strike and remains available even though he
is back with the East Midlanders.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesliga outfit, who lost the European Cup Winners' Cup
final to Chelsea in May, are believed to have offered four
million pounds for the striker.
</P>
<P>
"I think they inquired but they were thrown out," Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk, however, still has to win back his place in the
side - who face a home clash against Wimbledon next weekend.
</P>
<P>
"He's on the wage roll and he's back as an employee, and if we
need to use him and he's capable and he shows he's fit, of course
we'll use him," Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
"But he's got to earn his right to get back into the team.
</P>
<P>
"He'll be playing for the reserves against Birmingham on
Tuesday night and we'll see where we go from there, " the manager
added.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cheats Face DNA Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The fight against drug cheats
in sport could soon include the kind of DNA testing that has
revolutionised the way police conduct criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
British officials are concerned that cheats are keeping
supplies of "clean" urine samples with them at all times and
producing false specimens when asked to supply a test.
</P>
<P>
But now the UK Sports Council (UKSC) is preparing a crackdown
involving DNA testing and it wants international sports bodies to
adopt the procedure.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have pioneered a technique which allows them to
take DNA from urine samples and that will enable officials to be
absolutely certain whether a sample was provided by the chosen
athlete. DNA contains distinctive characteristics and police can
use even a single fleck of dandruff to place a suspect to a crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
Under the UKSC's new plans, abuse of the system will be
impossible. When athletes present themselves in doping centrol,
they will be asked for another sample, such as a strand of hair,
to enable a DNA match to be made.
</P>
<P>
"DNA testing would protect an athlete in the case of a faulty
result but it would also allow us to determine who is trying to
beat the system," said Michelle Verroken, the UKSC's head of
anti-doping and ethics.
</P>
<P>
In the past, athletes have claimed positive samples have been
labelled incorrectly, but the additional form of testing will act
as a safeguard against error by sampling officers.
</P>
<P>
Verroken, a member of the International Olympic Committee's
sub-commission on Doping Control, will now try to convince the
IOC to adopt her plan worldwide at a conference on drugs in sport
in February.
</P>
<P>
"There is the meeting in February and hopefully we will be
able to present our findings then," said Verroken. "We want to
convince the world of sport to take it on board and make it
standard testing procedure. The technology is there to do it and
we think it advances incredibly the fight drugs in sport."

LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur and Charlton
Athletic played to a 2-2 draw in the English Premier League here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The draw meant that neither of the teams could climb into the
top six in the team standings.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham had looked set to rise to fifth, their highest
placing for 2-1/2 years, when Chris Armstrong spectacularly dived
in to make it 2-1 after 57 minutes but Charlton came back to
equalise with Andy Hunt's second goal of the game 15 minutes from
time.
</P>
<P>
Charlton had taken the lead through Hunt against the run of
play after 32 minutes but Tottenham came back strongly at the
start of the second half and equalised through Danish
international Allan Nielsen after 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The result left Spurs in ninth place and Charlton 10th.

The Dow industrial average rose 114.05 points, or by 1.3
percent, to 8,706.15, the first close above 8,700 since

<P>
Leading Monday's advance were American Express, Coca-Cola,
Boeing and Merck.
</P>
<P>
The Dow had gained 123 points and 97.07 points last Thursday

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary to Visit Europe, Gulf on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen will visit Europe and the Gulf this week to meet
with allied leaders on the latest confrontation with Iraq over
U.N. arms inspections, the White House said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that
President Bill Clinton had asked Cohen to go but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said at the regular White House news briefing that
Clinton met with top security advisers early on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who cut short a trip to Asia and returned to Washington
over the weekend after Iraq announced it would stop cooperating
with arms inspections, was among those who attended.
</P>
<P>
"The president and his team reviewed and discussed potential
options for next steps," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"No decisions were made beyond the president asking the
secretary of defense to travel to Europe and to the region to
consult with our allies."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said on his abrupt return to Washington on Sunday that
the United States preferred to work with its allies and the U.N.
Security Council on Iraq's announcement over the weekend that it
would no longer cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton earlier on Monday demanded that Iraq allow U.S. arms
inspectors to complete their search for weapons of mass
destruction and warned that "no options are off the table."
</P>
<P>
"Until the inspectors are back on the job, no options are off
the table," Clinton said at a White House event. "Iraq must let
the inspectors finish the job they started seven years ago -- a
job Iraq promised to let them do repeatedly."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Humanitarian Situation in Kosovo Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday the humanitarian situation in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo has improved with more returns of displaced people to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary Julia Taft assessed the humanitarian
situation in Kosovo this weekend, and met with some of the
humanitarian folks there, according to State Department spokesman
James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"She reported that the humanitarian situation has improved
since her visit in August. She highlighted our commitment to help
Kosovans return and rebuild their lives," Rubin told a regular
State Department briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the humanitarian situation has greatly eased, and
the prospect of a humanitarian catastrophe has been avoided," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said reports from the monitors in the region are that the
return of internally displaced persons is accelerating. At one
particular camp which previously housed 3,000 to 4,000 displaced
persons, now it looks like all the residents of that camp at Kisna
Reka have returned to their homes in Komorane.
</P>
<P>
The number of shelterless displaced people has also dropped
significantly. Food convoys have been getting in, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"With the respect of the military side, there were no
significant violations of the cease-fire or incidents of
ethnically motivated violence reported over the weekend or this
morning," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four Americans arrived in Belgrade Saturday to join the
monitoring effort to verify compliance with the conditions of
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) approved on
Friday the activation order for the air verification regime. U.S.
air surveillance flights, both manned and unmanned, began on
October 17.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia last month agreed to withdraw all its forces from
Kosovo to avert a military confrontation with NATO and allow the
alliance to conduct the verification.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Crisis Must be Solved in Peaceful Means, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- All problems in Serbia's
southern province of Kosovo must be resolved only by political
means and through dialogue, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting in Belgrade with visiting
U.S. special envoy for Balkans Christopher Hill who is also the
ambassador to neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both sides stressed that the Kosovo crisis must
be settled peacefully with full respect of the principle of
equality of all citizens and ethnic communities living in the
province, in line with the generally accepted international
standards and the legal systems of the Serbia and Yugoslavia, a
statement issued by the Serbian President's office said.
</P>
<P>
The solution must be based on the Accord reached by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, and on the eleven principles of a political solution
endorsed by the Serbian government last October 13, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that speedy resumption and intensification of
the dialogue between Serb and ethnic Albanian representatives are
the key priorities and in the interest of all citizens of Serbia
and Yugoslavia, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic praised the beginning
of an OSCE mission's work in Kosovo during a meeting with foreign
diplomats accredited to Belgrade on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sainovic, who heads the Yugoslav government's commission for
cooperation with the OSCE verification mission, said that the
mission had successfully started its operation and voiced belief
that there were no open issues between the Yugoslav government and
the mission.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo was improving every day, despite some
incidents and that an evident breakthrough had been made in the
humanitarian field, return of displaced persons to their homes and
a general easing of tension, Sainovic said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that the OSCE mission would contribute to a
peaceful and political resolution of all problems in Kosovo and
that the mission could count on full cooperation with the Yugoslav
government.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate with the OSCE mission in Kosovo,"
Jovanovic said and added that cooperation on mutual appreciation
was necessary.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Agreement on Peace in Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday extended a welcome to an agreement signed
Sunday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, to end the conflict in Guinea
Bissau, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a press conference that Annan
"congratulates" the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries,
Nigerian head of state General Abdulsalami Abubakar and President
Yaya Jammeh of Gambia "for their efforts in helping to achieve
this successful conclusion to the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Since Annan, the first U.N. Secretary-General from the
sub-Saharan Africa, came to power in January 1997, the United
Nations has attached great importance to maintaining peace and
stability in Africa, the continent which has long been plagued by
civil war or conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau's civil war rivals Sunday signed a
regionally-brokered peace accord calling for the deployment of
West African troops followed by elections next march.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed on the sidelines of an ECOWAS summit held
in Abuja. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Ibrahim Fall attended
the summit on behalf of the Secretary-General, and Fall's presence
was seen as assurances of U.N. support of the regional peace
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out on June 7 in Guinea Bissau, a day after
President Joao Bernardo Vieira sacked his former army chief Mane
on allegations of funnelling arms to separatists rebels in
neighboring Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Sentence of Yugoslav Journalists Causes Condemnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The sentencing of two abducted
Tanjug journalists by the outlawed Albanian guerilla group
"Kosovo Liberation Army" has caused condemnation from Serbian
officials and political parties.
</P>
<P>
Serbia Justice Minister Dragoljub Jankovic said Monday that the
sentencing of Nebojsa Radosevic and Vladimir Dobricanin, who were
abducted by the KLA on October 18,"is not an invalid legal act and
without any legal effect."
</P>
<P>
The rule by the KLA's so called martial court "has not been
taken by any court of law or judges of our country's legal system,
nor is it in keeping with any valid rules of trial proceedings,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The KLA announced on Sunday that the two abducted reporters of
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug had been sentenced each to 60 days in
prison, for allegedly breaking their laws.
</P>
<P>
"Such an action shows that the ethnic-Albanian side does not
respect the agreement reached by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke," Jankovic said, adding
the action showed the ethnic Albanians were against the
normalization of the situation in Kosovo and the resumption of
talks, as the only means of peacefully resolving problems in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) said on Monday the sentences
"shows that the Albanian terrorists are openly provoking our
country, and also the international community, in the attempt to
undermine the accord on the peaceful resolution of problems in
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"They have shown this by ambushing regular police patrols in
Glodjani and Klina, and various terrorist actions carried out on a
daily basis," the SPO said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The arrogance of the terrorists and the hypocrisy of the
political leadership of Kosovo Albanians must be strongly
condemned by the entire world, and the OSCE verifiers should
inform the international public and international organizations
about everything that is going on and suggest appropriate punitive
measures against Albanian criminals and all those who support
them," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Serbian Information Ministry on Monday strongly
condemned the kidnapping and sentencing of the two Tanjug
reporters by KLA.
</P>
<P>
After agreeing with international representatives that all
problems should be resolved peacefully and through democratic and
political means, the ministry calls on all international
organizations and institutions to take all necessary measures
aimed at an urgent release of Radosevic and Dobricic, the ministry
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Ship Missing for Week in Caribbean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A Miami-based cruise ship
with a crew of 31 has been missing in the Caribbean Sea for almost
a week after it tried to evade Hurricane Mitch, the U.S. Coast
Guard said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has searched more than 259,000 square
kilometers of the Caribbean Sea for the Fantome, a 71-year-old
schooner once owned by Aristotle Onassis, but there was still no
sign of the crew members.
</P>
<P>
The ship was owned by Miami Beach-based Windjammer Barefoot
Cruises that sail the Caribbean. The ship's crew included
nationals from Belize, Panama and the West Indies, the Coast Guard
said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard on Sunday found a lifejacket washed up on the
Honduran island of Guanaja, north of Trujillo.
</P>
<P>
The Fantome was last heard from on Tuesday as it tried to evade
Hurricane Mitch north of Honduras after dropping off 100
passengers in Belize.
</P>
<P>
Company and Coast Guard officials fared that the ship might
have lost its communications gear and taken refuge somewhere in
the Caribbean.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. General Motors said
Monday that it has developed a computer system that tells
drivers when it's time for an oil change, according to a report
from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
The device, called GM Oil-Life System, will be installed on
most General Motors vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The system can monitor oil quality and sense when it has
deteriorated. With this system drivers can eliminate unnecessary
oil changes and save as much as 40 million quarts of oil a year.
</P>
<P>
The company said that within 5 years, the system will be
standard equipment on 90 percent of North America cars and light
trucks. North America accounts for 62 percent of GM's total
production.
</P>
<P>
The system already is in use in some GM vehicles, including the
Chevrolet Corvette and Cadillacs with the Northstar V8 engine.

<HEADLINE> China: Stable Financial Basis is Essential to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A necessary and stable
financial basis was essential to the success of the United Nations
peacekeeping operations, China said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, Shen Guofang, said in recent years, the various
activities in peacekeeping operations of the United Nations had
suffered gravely, due to the large amount of arrears in
peacekeeping assessments by some countries.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shen urged countries behind in payment of
peacekeeping contributions, especially those in large amount of
arrears, to pay their dues on time, in full and without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China was opposed to the unilateral move of any
country to set a ceiling for its peacekeeping assessments, and
even more strongly to the shifting of financial burdens to
developing countries or imposing discriminatory financial
arrangement on developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Iraq to Allow Inspection Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday demanded that Iraq let U.N. arms inspectors "finish the
job" they were sent to do and said that he would not rule out any
options until they were allowed to resume work.
</P>
<P>
"Until the inspectors are back on the job, no options are off
the table," Clinton said at a White House event. "Iraq must let
the inspectors finish the job they started seven years ago -- a
job Iraq promised to let them do repeatedly."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein decided to suspend
all cooperation with the United Nations weapons inspectors until
the U.N. Security Council cancels the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"For Iraq, the only path to lifting sanctions is through
complete cooperation with the weapons inspectors, without
restrictions, runarounds, or roadblocks," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein's latest refusal to cooperate with the
international weapons inspectors is completely unacceptable. Once
again, though, it will backfire," added he.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton summoned his top national security
aides to the White House to discuss how to respond to Iraq's
decision.
</P>
<P>
"Far from dividing the international community and achieving
concessions, his (Saddam's) obstructionism was immediately and
unanimously condemned by the United Nations Security Council. It
has only served to deepen the international community's resolve,"
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the U.S. will be consulting closely
with its allies in the region and decide how to respond.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iraq's decision to halt all cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, the State Department said the search for
illegal weapons is proceeding and Iraq has not made a move to
expel the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said a technical team
has tended to a monitoring camera and groups of inspectors have
gone to suspect sites for a second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's announcement Saturday is regarded "as a very
serious matter," Rubin said. "Iraq has confronted the
international community with an escalation by refusing to
cooperate."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman again raised the threat of force to compel Iraq's
compliance, and said the United States reserved the option of
acting alone if needed.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen cut short an
Asian trip and returned to Washington to deal with the new crisis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that there was little indication the Clinton
administration was moving toward a quick military response
although it talks tough on the matter.

<HEADLINE> China: UN Peacekeeping Must Stick to Guiding Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
peacekeeping operations must stick to its guiding principles so as
to play a bigger role in maintaining the world's peace and
security, China stressed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, Shen Guofang, said the principles include observing the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
especially the principles of the respect for state sovereignty and
non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador said these also include following the three basis
principles guiding peacekeeping operations, namely, obtaining
prior consent from parties concerned, observing strict neutrality
and non-use of force except for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Shen said others include settling disputes through peaceful
means, adopting a realistic approach and confining the operation
within one's capacity, and launching peacekeeping operations only
when conditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it had been proved that the UN peacekeeping
operations, if deviated form the above guiding principles, would
fail to achieve the desired target and even go stray.

<HEADLINE> China on Rapid Deployment of UN Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ambassador Shen said under the current circumstances of severe
financial difficulties facing the Organization and the relative
scaling down of peacekeeping operations, the efforts in
strengthening the rapid deployment capability should be focused on
tapping the full potential of current mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the U.N. standby arrangement system had drawn about
80 percent countries under its flag and the number of
peacekeeping personnel committed by various countries has
reached near 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Shen said further improvement of the standby arrangement
system would strengthen the rapid deployment capability of
peacekeeping operations, help encourage active participation in
peacekeeping activities by the vast number states, and guarantee
the fairness and neutrality of peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> 1998 to Be The Hottest for A Thousand Years: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A new study by British scientists
shows that 1998 will be the world's hottest year in a thousand
years, British newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A team at the University of East Anglia in Norwich has
reconstructed the temperature peaks of every year in the last
millennium, and the scientists are confident 1998 will be the
warmest, The Independent newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This year is already certain to be the hottest year in the
140-year global temperature record that has been compiled from
instrumental readings.
</P>
<P>
But scientists at the university's Climatic Research Unit (CRU)
are convinced that, as 2000 approaches, 1998 will also be hotter
than 1106, the previous record summer in the northern hemisphere,
and prove to have been the hottest year of this millennium.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have put together the annual average summer
temperatures of the last 1,000 years from measurements of
tree-ring growth and analysis of ice cores, which give information
about the meteorological conditions deep in the past.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we believe the last three to four
years have been the warmest of the millennium, and 1998 to have
been the warmest of all," professor Phil Jones, who leads the
research group, was quoted by The Independent as saying.
</P>
<P>
The record, published in the scientific journal The Holocene,
will add further credence to global warming being caused by
industrial gases, the newspaper said.

JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah closed at
8,050/8,150 to the U.S. dollar here Monday, weakening 500 points
compared to Friday's close of 7,550/7,850 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The financial markets were overshadowed by mounting opposition
to the planned special session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said that fears that the anti-government
rallies ahead of the meeting would turn violent dampened the
trading mood.
</P>
<P>
The MPR is scheduled to hold a special session on November 10
to 13 in Jakarta to discuss next year's general, presidential and
vice presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Student protests flared again in the capital last week,
demanding the resignation of President B.J. Habibie and saying the
special session of MPR should not go ahead.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus agreed on
Monday to set up a union parliament, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported from Yaroslavl, central Russia.
</P>
<P>
They passed the accord in a session of the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Russian-Belarussian Union "as a representative and
legislative organ of the union".
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus proclaimed their union in April 1997 in
order to confront the NATO's east expansion.
</P>
<P>
The union parliament will be made of a council of the union and
a council of representatives and will pass laws within powers
granted by its member states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The council of the union, or the upper chamber, is to be formed
by delegates of the Russian and Belarussian national parliaments,
while the council of the representatives, or the lower chamber,
will be elected by a general and direct election, in which 25
seats will be allocated for Belarus and 75 for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the next session of the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Russia-Belarus Union would discuss the official
request of Yugoslavia to join the union.

<HEADLINE> Britain Set to Boost Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gordon Brown
signaled his readiness Monday to increase borrowing to protect
plans to spend an extra 40 billion pounds (23.5 billion U.S.
dollars) on health and education.
</P>
<P>
Brown told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
conference that Britain was well placed to weather the world
economic turmoil as Labor had government finances under control.
</P>
<P>
The government's tough action to cut public borrowing and
reduce inflation since the election meant that the UK was "now
better placed to steer a path of stability in these troubled times
for the global economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the chancellor stressed that his spending plans had a
built-in margin to cover uncertainties, including lower growth.
</P>
<P>
He expected reductions in interest rates and increases in
spending to help to limit the risks of recession during the next
year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party, Tories, said the higher borrowing would
result in Brown breaking his "golden rule" -- that the government
would borrow only to invest.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude said that Brown would have to
let borrowing rise or increase taxes. He believed that public
finances would deteriorate because of the increase in government
spending and a weakening economy.
</P>
<P>
The CBI expressed strong support for the government's spending
plan, saying, "The government's comprehensive spending review
plans are not under threat from short-term economic pressures."
</P>
<P>
It argued that the public finances were sound after five years
of sustained fiscal consolidation. "As a result, Britain is well
placed in the short term to allow public borrowing to rise from a
low base as growth slows," the CBI added.
</P>
<P>
Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economist, said, "Provided the
current economic slowdown does not turn into a recession, the
consequent rise in public borrowing should not require a review of
spending plans. Indeed, a panic review now could be economically
damaging."
</P>
<P>
Economic observers here believed the CBI's strong backing would
be greeted with jubilation by the chancellor, who has been unde
pressure to show that the government can afford to spend an extra
40 billion pounds on health and education despite slashing its
growth forecast for next year from 2 to 1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia posted 0.27 percent
deflation in October, the Central Statistics Agency announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deflation was achieved due to a decline in prices of staple
food.
</P>
<P>
Prices of basic foods have gone down because there are
sufficient stocks.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the inflation rate for January to October
this year has reached 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
In September, the agency predicted that the inflation rate for
the whole year would reach as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country's inflation rate was 11.05 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Parliament Group Proposes Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A major parliamentary group
of Mongolia proposed Monday an amendment to the constitution to
end months of government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The group made the proposal in discussing a recent ruling made
by the constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
As set forth by the ruling, which analysts believed will fuel
the government crisis, it is illegal for the parliament members to
serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
However, under the parliamentary group's proposal, a provision
would be added to the constitution to allow members of the State
Great Hural, or parliament, to serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's constitution does not allow members of the Great
Hural to take positions other than those in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MDU followed the rule in forming the government in 1996,
but argued later that it is essential for parliament members to
serve in the government, so as to secure the leading status of the
State Great Hural in the nation's political life.
</P>
<P>
The parliament therefore passed a constitutional amendment on
January 15, allowing its members to serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
The legislature then approved a government formed by all
parliament members and led by Tsakhiya Elbegdorj. But it dismissed
the government on July 24, starting months of government crisis.

<HEADLINE> Britain Set To Boost Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer Gordon Brown signaled here Monday his readiness to
increase borrowing for health and education programs.
</P>
<P>
At a Confederation of Britain Industry (CBI) conference, Brown
said the financing would help health and education plans calling
for an extra 40 billion pounds (67.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As the Labor Party has government finances under control, he
said, Britain is better placed to weather the world economic
turmoil and "to steer a path of stability in these troubled times."
</P>
<P>
The Labor government has taken tough action to cut public
borrowing and reduce inflation since taking office in May 1997, he
said, noting that his spending plans had a built-in margin to
cover uncertainties, including lower growth.
</P>
<P>
He expected reductions in interest rates and increases in
spending to help limit the risks of recession next year.
</P>
<P>
The CBI expressed strong support for the government's spending
plan, saying "the government's comprehensive spending review plans
are not under threat from short-term economic pressures."
</P>
<P>
"Provided the current economic slowdown does not turn into a
recession, the consequent rise in public borrowing should not
require a review of spending plans. Indeed, a panic review now
could be economically damaging," said Kate Barker, the CBI's chief
economist.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition party, Tories, said the higher
borrowing would result in Brown breaking his "golden rule" -- that
the government would borrow only to invest.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude said Brown would have to let
borrowing rise or increase taxes. He believed that public finances
would deteriorate because of the increase in government spending
and a weakening economy.

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces 231 Millennium Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Peter Mandelson, trade and
industry secretary, warned British business Monday that it must
innovate to survive, as he unveiled 231 new Millennium Products.
</P>
<P>
"Millennium Products are cutting edge, pioneering and
innovative. They demonstrate British genius and expertise,"
Mandelson told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
National Conference here.
</P>
<P>
Among the 231 Millennium Products, British Aerospace had three
products chosen, including the Airbus A340-500/-600 wing, an
unjammable radar system, and the Silicon Gyroscope.
</P>
<P>
There are over 30 other transport-related products, including
the Rover Freelander, the Heathrow Express and a new AA computer
response system.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector was well represented with both Marks &AMP;
Spencer and Sainsbury's securing five Millennium Products each in
this tranche.
</P>
<P>
There are over 50 health and medical-related innovations,
including sterile maggots to help clean up wounds and the AMT
Venometer, a test for fatal blood clots which takes 10 minutes
instead of two days.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson concluded his announcement with another message to
the CBI gathering by saying, "I urge everyone, whatever their
business, to look at Millennium Products and ask themselves: `Are
my products or my services the best?'"

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Supports Non-Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) on Monday declared its full support to the Iraqi
leadership's decision of halting all forms of cooperations with
the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued following a session held on Monday, the
National Assembly condemned UNSCOM and its chief Richard Butler as
"obedient tools in the hand of America which is using them to harm
Iraq and spying on it."
</P>
<P>
The Assembly called upon the parliaments all over the world to
urge their governments to "curb the American military threats
against peoples."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf addressed Monday's Assembly session to explain why
Iraqi leadership decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Accusing UNSCOM of being employed by the U.S. and Israel to
carry out their hostile schemes against Iraq, Aziz stressed that
the work of UNSCOM is not honest or satisfying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier criticized the U.N. Security Council and
the U.N. chief for not questioning UNSCOM which he alleged "spied
on Iraq and collaborated with Iraq's enemies as it wished."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on Saturday decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with UNSCOM, saying the decision will not be
rescinded before the U.N. Security Council considers the lifting
of sanctions imposed on it for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions it set for revoking its decision include the
removal of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler and the restructuring
of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said the decision would not be applied to
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On Sunday and Monday,
IAEA monitoring teams continued their activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned
the Iraqi decision and urged Iraq to rescind "immediately and
unconditionally" its decision.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the United States and "its agents" in
UNSCOM for blocking the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior External Affairs
Ministry official said Monday that India decided to release 148
Pakistani fishermen and their boats caught trespassing on Indian

New Delhi's reciprocal gesture came after Islamabad's decision

India's move was regarded as a positive one on the eve of
official level talks between India and Pakistan, which will be

</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan held their foreign secretary level talks in
Islamabad on October 15-18 on peace and security in the region and
the Kashmir issue. Although both sides reiterated their own stand
on the Kashmir issue, the atmosphere of the talks was frank and
friendly.
</P>

According to an agreement, both India and Pakistan will send a
team of officials as well as a team of experts to help repatriate
the fishermen and their boats.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Pinochet Extradition Case, Judicial Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Monday that the extradition of former Chilean president
Augusto Pinochet was a judicial process and his government would
not make any political interventions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a London press conference Monday afternoon, Blair
said, "There is a judicial process and we have not interfered with
that judicial process and neither should we."
</P>
<P>
"It is not for the government to intervene in that judicial
process in a way that is contrary to our basic principles of law,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court ruled last Wednesday that Pinochet, who
was arrested early this month on alleged involvement in genocide
and torture of Spanish citizens, was immune from prosecution and
extradition as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
The High Court later granted Pinochet a symbolic bail Friday on
condition the former Chilean leader remained under police custody
in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
The British House of Lords, the upper house of the British
parliament, is expected to hear an appeal against the High Court
ruling.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Deny Extension of Truce with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia on
Monday denied any agreement with opposition commander Ahmed Shah
Masood to extend a temporary truce to allow further prisoner
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The temporary truce for the release of prisoners expired on
Monday and there is no agreement to extend it," said the Taliban's
spokesman Maulvi Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakil in the southern city of
Kandahar, according to a report reaching here Monday from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The original one-week truce between the militia and forces
loyal to Masood, brokered by an Afghan trader based in Saudi
Arabia, came into force last Tuesday and was designed to allow the
exchange of 1,000 prisoners by each side.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan opposition leader disclosed earlier that the truce
would be extended for 15 days from Monday to enable the completion
of the prisoner swap.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil said that the Taliban are ready to extend the truce
if Masood is sincere in the release of genuine prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the opposition had tried to attack the Taliban
forces in Baghlan province but the militia foiled the offensive.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and Masood released first batch of 106 prisoners on
October 30 after agreeing to free 1,000 prisoners each during a
week-long cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides suspended the swap operation because of
wrangling and shooting after the first day of exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban refused to accept some of the prisoners as they
accused Masood of releasing ordinary people rather than the
militia's fighters.
</P>
<P>
The militia also rejected Masood's demand for the release of
former governor of Herat Province Ismael Khan, saying he does not
belong to Masood's Shura-e-Nazaar.

<HEADLINE> Georgian President Urges Dialogue on Abkhazia Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze called Monday for further dialogue with the republic
of Abkhazia on the settlement of the conflict there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over the national television in Tbilisi, Shevardnadze
said the settlement of the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict and the
return of refugees should not be monopolized by politicians.
</P>
<P>
An Itar-Tass report from the Georgian capital quoted him as
saying that the settlement largely depends on communication
between people of various walks of life on the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the efforts by Abkhazian leader's representative
Anri Dzhergenoya and Georgian State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze
to draft a protocol on the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He described their October meeting in Tbilisi as useful.
</P>
<P>
However, it is too early to speak of the content of the
protocol, the president said, adding that the two sides are almost
completing the work on the document.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement can be reached, the president said, his meeting
with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba "is not ruled out ... for
signing the document on refugee return".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on Russia to play an active role in
settling the Abkhazia issue. He said: "Russia is retaining serious
chances for fulfilling a positive role in the settlement."
</P>
<P>
"If Russia in disinterested in the settlement of this conflict,
this contradicts its own interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, seeking independence from Georgia, has been in armed
conflicts with the Georgian government since 1991. So far, about
300,000 Georgians have left the troubled area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumers Keep Spending High in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. savings rate was
minus 0.2 percent in September, the worst since 1959, when the
government started tracking the changes on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, the savings rate, namely savings as a
percentage of after-tax income, hasn't been negative since the
Depression year of 1938, the Department of Commerce said Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the rate has been running at a positive 0.6
percent, down from 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The negative savings rate occurs, the department said, when
consumers finance spending through credit cards, home equity
credit lines and other loans, by selling stocks or other
investments or by using past savings.
</P>
<P>
In September, pre-tax personal incomes rose a modest 0.2
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.17 trillion
U.S. dollars, the smallest pace since November 1994. There also
was a 0.2 percent rise in after-tax, or disposable, income.
</P>
<P>
Spending increased a robust 0.5 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.87 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts are expecting growth in consumers' spending
to slow. They can't spend from savings indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries, the key component of personal income, rose
a barely 0.1 percent in September, the smallest gain since July
1996.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' incomes declined during the month, but owners of other
businesses saw income rise. Transfer payments such as Social
Security, interest and dividends and rental income all increased.
</P>
<P>
Spending was strongest for big-ticket durable goods, up 2
percent on top of a 1.1 percent rise in August. Both months
represented a rebound after sharp declines associated with a drop
in car sales linked to the General Motors' strikes.
</P>
<P>
Spending edged up 0.1 percent for nondurable consumer goods
such as food and fuel and rose 0.5 percent on services.

This report has not been confirmed yet by the French

<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi will pay a visit to
France in preparation for the visit, said the embassy.

<HEADLINE> France Regrets Israeli Delay of Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- France Monday regretted the delay
by Israel of the application of the Wye Plantation Agreement it
signed with Palestinians last week in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This delay by Israel is not welcome... We think that one
should not lose the time," French foreign ministry's spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret said.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a spokesman of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying on Monday that the Israeli
government decided to delay by at least 10 days the application of
the Wye Plantation Agreement to allow the Israeli parliament
(Knesset) to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
"The judicial advisor of the government, Eliakim Rubinstein,
made a decision in this sense on Monday -- the agreement will not
become effective until its ratification by the Knesset on Thursday
November 12," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu decided, as it is the tradition in Israel, to submit
the agreement to the Knesset for approval, although such a
ratification is not formally required.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Plantation Agreement, signed on October 23, should come
into effect 10 days after its signing.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign ministry's spokeswoman also criticized
Israel for the beginning of construction of a new Jewish
settlement in the Ras-al-Amud district of East Jerusalem on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment when all should be done to restore the necessary
confidence for a fidel application of the agreement of Wye
Plantation, this decision is unfortunate and we hope that it will
not be implemented," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that Jerusalem is part of the questions which,
according to the intermediary agreements signed by Palestinians
and Israel, should be treated in the talks on the permanent status
of Palestinian territories to be held in the future.

<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The French foreign ministry
welcomed Monday the signing of a peace agreement in Abuja,
Nigeria, by the two warring parties of Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said the agreement would open
the way for a peaceful end to the conflict in Guinea-Bissau and a
return of constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
She praised the active role played by the Economic Community of
West African States in mediating the agreement and in establishing
a permanent mechanism for dealing with regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"This decision would lead to the engagement by African states
to take by themselves in charge of the prevention and the solution
of the crisis arriving at their continent," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
While backing African states in their peace-making efforts, she
said, it offered technical help in the mediation efforts on
Guinea-Bissau and would provide more in implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed between Guinea-Bissau President Joao
Vierra and General Ansumane Mane, the chief of the rebels, to end
the civil war war that began in early July.

<P>
Here at the Confederation of Britain Industry (CBI) conference,
Mandelson said "Millennium Products are cutting edge, pioneering
and innovative. They demonstrate British genius and expertise."
</P>
<P>
Among the 231 so-called Millennium Products, British Aerospace
had three products chosen, including the Airbus A340-500/-600
wing, an unjammable radar system, and the Silicon Gyroscope.
</P>
<P>
Also presented were more than 30 other transport-related
products, including the Rover Freelander, the Heathrow Express and
a new computer response system.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector was well represented with both Marks &AMP;
Spencer and Sainsbury's securing five Millennium Products each.
</P>
<P>
There are over 50 health and medical innovations, including
sterile maggots to help clean up wounds and a test for fatal blood
clots which takes 10 minutes instead of two days.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson had a message for the CBI gathering, saying: "I urge
everyone, whatever their business, to look at Millennium Products
and ask themselves: Are my products or my services the best?"

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy on Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said here Monday that the eradication of poverty is an
important yardstick for human progress an it is also a goal that
people of all countries have been pursuing over a long period of
time.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the remarks in a speech to the Second
Committee of the U.N. General Assembly. The Second Committee is in
charge of economic and financial matters in the world.
</P>
<P>
The speech is focused on the implementation of the first United
Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, which Shen said
represents another step forward in the process of poverty
eradication and a follow-up to various global conferences on
guiding principles and programs for the world efforts to help
people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
After two years into the U.N. decade, "we are still confronted
with shocking statistics" according to relevant U.N. reports, he
said.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the population of developing countries continue to
live in conditions of poverty, 800 million people do have
sufficient food, and 12 million children die every year before
they reach the age of five, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The all too frequent use of sanctions against developing
countries has added salt to the wound and made matters worse," he
said. "What's more, the Asian financial crisis has thrown hundreds
of millions of people back to conditions of poverty in just one
year's time."
</P>
<P>
Shen said, "This testifies to the fact that the process of
economic globalization is posing new challenges to the efforts
aimed at the eradication of poverty."
</P>
<P>
Poverty is a brutal violation of human rights, and the
eradication of poverty is the common responsibility of mankind, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is closely related to under-development," he said.
"Poverty has often been equated with deep-rooted and persistent
illness."
</P>
<P>
The equivalent to the word "poverty" in the Chinese language is
made up by two words: the first one means being poor, while the
second one refers to being confined and constrained, with no means
to break free, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it is not at all impossible to cure it," he said. "The key
is to find out the root cause to the problem, deal with it in a
comprehensive manner, and persevere until is is solved."

<HEADLINE> Britain Steps Up Preparation for Joining Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor Gordon
Brown has announced a new cross-party group to prepare the UK for
joining the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
He told the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) annual
conference here Monday that he intended to publish a step-by-step
plan to prepare for the euro to coincide with the launch of the
first wave in January.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the move is intended to signal an
important change of gear in the Labor government's approach to the
euro.
</P>
<P>
The decision is a clear response to warnings to the government
from business that it cannot be expected to prepare for the advent
of the euro unless there are clear indications that Britain will
join it if the circumstances are right.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Brown said, "Government and business must work
together to equip ourselves for the future -- in moving forward
our relationship with Europe, where we do half our trade, and
being ready for the euro in little more than eight weeks time."
</P>
<P>
"We have committed our country to full preparations that will
allow us to make a decision, subject to a referendum, early in the
next parliament. Our strategy is to prepare and then decide," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said that the changeover plan would set out
"stage by stage preparations that will need to be followed and we
will spell out the practical implications of changing to the
euro."
</P>
<P>
Brown also used his speech to signal the government's deep
unease at the direction taken by EU leaders at last month's summit
in Austria when they backed Franco-German proposals for more
spending to head off recession.
</P>
<P>
He said member states must push ahead with labor market,
capital market and product market reforms to ensure "more
competition, more flexibility, more investment and more
employment."
</P>
<P>
On the domestic economy, the chancellor defended the
government's economic strategy in the face of complaints by
industry and unions that high interest rates and a strong pound
have made British exports uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I know about your concerns about the pound. I have
heard them." The value of sterling has already fallen back 10
percent from its peak earlier this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Brown argued, "I think that the greater danger would
have been to take the wrong action and then had to return our
economy to the severity of boom and bust when interest rates were
at 15 percent."
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said that if the UK could maintain wage
restraint, then it could achieve the goal of a virtuous circle of
low inflation and higher growth.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Revises Budget Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has revised its budget deficit targets and economic
growth rates amid global economic and financial volatility.
</P>
<P>
In a three-year budget policy statement tabled in parliament
Monday by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, the projected budget
deficit for 1998/99 fiscal year was revised from 3.5 percent to
3.9 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and for
1999/2000 from three percent to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means that the government's deficit target is to be
delayed for one year, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit would be reduced to three percent by the year
2000/2001, as originally planned, and kept at this level in
2001/2002.
</P>
<P>
Expected growth for 1998/99 was revised down from three
percent to 0.2 percent, and inflation up to eight percent from
six percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to steadily improve, however, with
growth rate forecast at two percent in 1999/2000 and three
percent in each of the following two years, while inflation is
expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
"The change to economic conditions has meant that we have had
to re-examine our projections of spending, tax revenue and
borrowing," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the government would not abandon its controversial
growth, employment and redistribution macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will go on with its reconstruction and
development objectives, and continue to protect spending on
social services and grants to the poor.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the government is committed to budget
deficit reduction, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for World Efforts to Help Poor Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Shen Guofang, China's
deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Monday
called upon the international community to help the poor out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"For the international community, what is more important is to
create a favorable environment and provide the necessary means" to
under-developed countries, he said, "so that they will be able to
lift themselves out of poverty through their own efforts."
</P>
<P>
Shen made the statement in his speech to the Second Committee
of the U.N. General Assembly on the implementation of the first
United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty. The Second
Committee is in charge of economic and financial matters in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Fully recognizing that poverty is spreading like a contagion,
rather than showing signs of being reduced, Shen asked the world
body, in implementing the Decade, to attach major importance to
the following:
</P>
<P>
-- To study the new poverty phenomenon in the globalization
process. "While working to eliminate existing poverty, we should
explore ways to forestall or contain the emergence of large-scale
new poverty resulting from economic turmoil," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- To create an environment conducive to economic growth and
poverty eradication. Domestically, efforts should be made to
create conditions that will contribute to the promotion of
sustained growth with equality, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the international level, a favorable external environment
should be established in support of the efforts by developing
countries to eliminate poverty and develop their economy through
such measures as improving trade conditions, solving the debt
problem, increasing capital flows and transfer of technology," he
said.
</P>
<P>
-- To provide more meaningful assistance so as to break the
vicious circle of poverty being handed down from one generation to
the next. "Both domestic and international resources should be
fully mobilized and utilized," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, official development assistance (ODA) is
crucial," he said. "Meeting agreed ODA targets should be a top
priority."
</P>
<P>
-- To ensure that those people suffering from poverty are
actively involved. Poverty gives rise to a desire for change, he
said, adding that "nobody is more eager for a better life than
those living in conditions of poverty."
</P>
<P>
For poverty elimination strategies to be successful, it is
essential that their initiative and potential be brought into full
play, he said.
</P>
<P>
"People living in poverty must be encouraged to participate in
the formulation of poverty eradication policies and programs, and
in transforming such policies and programs into their own concrete
actions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Stage Rally Against U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Pro-government Iranian
university students Monday afternoon staged a rally in front of
the former U.S. embassy in Tehran against the "arrogant policies"
of the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 students took part in the rally organized by
the left-wing students organization the Unity Consolidation
Office (UCO), which strongly supported the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami during presidential elections in May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hostility between the two nations of Iran and
America," one of the slogans written on placards read.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the rally Ebrahim Asgharzadeh said Iranian students
took over the U.S. embassy in 1979 in protest of the U.S. arrogant
policies and its interference in Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The takeover had nothing to do with the American nation," he
stated, "we welcome the American people to visit Iran."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that if the U.S. officials continue their
arrogant polices toward Iran, the Iranian students would not
accept them.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian radical students took
over the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held its staff members as
hostages for more than 400 days, which triggered the severance of
diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The students criticized the U.S. administration for interfering
in Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The students burned an image of "Uncle Sam" at the rally
instead of the U.S. flag, which Iranians usually burn at
anti-U.S. rallies in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the rally showed a big change in the
attitudes of Iranians, particularly the young generation, toward
the United States, or "the Great Satan" labeled by Iranian leaders
during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
However, about 100 hard-liners burned a U.S. flag at the
beginning of the rally.
</P>
<P>
They shouted anti-U.S. slogans and attempted to attack the
participants, but they were blocked by anti-riot police.
</P>
<P>
The UCO asked its supporters to line up with the police to
prevent the hard-liners from entering the rally.
</P>
<P>
It was the first rally organized by the UCO that ended without
any clashes.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, the students also voiced support for
President Khatami and his policies.
</P>
<P>
They called for democracy and freedom in the country and
announced their opposition to dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
"No place for absolutism," read one of the slogans.

(SPD) and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) Monday signed a

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here Monday that the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) does not warrant military intervention and that a peaceful
settlement is the way forward for Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states trying to end the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Susan Rice said that her government supports the positive
initiatives SADC countries are taking and it is willing to
support all peaceful efforts aimed at ending the three-month-old
conflict.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement while meeting with Zambian Deputy
Foreign Minister Valentine Kayope.
</P>
<P>
The assistant secretary of state told Kayope that she is on a
tour to several African countries in a bid to find a common
understanding over the efforts to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kayope called upon the international community and the U.S. in
particular to supplement the regional efforts by providing
logistics and material support.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC countries are not able to mobilize all the
resources to bring about and maintain peace in the DRC, hence
they need support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that the conflict is not only a threat
to SADC but also to the global peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is a real threat to Zambia which shares the
longest border stretching over 2,200 kilometers with many tribes
sharing common ancestries in the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the conflict has real and immediate consequences
on his country, affecting its national security, economic
interests and ethnic and filial ties.
</P>
<P>
Kayope also noted that a military solution is not a viable
option, adding a quick solution that will preserve the integrity
of the DRC and minimize the loss of human life and property
should be found.
</P>
<P>
Rice is expected to hold private talks with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba before leaving for Zimbabwe later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rice has already visited South Africa, Angola and the DRC for
talks over the crisis in the third largest African country and
she will also pay visits to Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe announced Sunday that the
allied forces of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have resolved to
embark on an offensive campaign to clear the rebels from the
eastern parts of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The allied troops were sent to the DRC to back President
Laurent Kabila soon after the rebels allegedly backed by Rwanda
and Uganda rose up against him on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Uganda admitted its military presence in the DRC, while Rwanda
denied that it had sent troops to the vast central African
country.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's state budget for
1999 passed its first reading in the Knesset (parliament) on
Monday with 54 legislators voting for and 53 against.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party (NRP), which has nine Knesset
members, has threatened to vote against the budget but changed its
position after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to meet
some of its budget demands.
</P>
<P>
NRP said however it will not vote for the Palestinian-Israeli
peace agreement signed last month by Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in Washington when it is sent to the cabinet
and the Knesset for approval.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised to give the Arab Democratic Party (ADP) a
cabinet post in exchange for its support for the budget. Four ADP
Knesset members abstained in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The ADP said earlier it wanted the government to implement the
peace agreement and the troop redeployment in the West Bank, so
that it will not join the opposition parties' attempt to bring
down the government by balking the budget.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian tougher measures
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 state budget totals around 55 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> 125 Million Chinese Lifted Out of Poverty Over 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said here Monday that 125 million people in China have
been lifted out of poverty through various means over the past 20
years since the reform and opening-up drive was first introduced
in China.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the announcement in his speech to the Second
Committee of the U.N. General Assembly on the implementation of
the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty.
The Second Committee is in charge of the world economic and
financial matters.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development is the hard principle," She said.
"Economic growth provides the basis for social development. It is
also the key to poverty eradication."
</P>
<P>
China's own experience is just a case in point in this regard,
he said. "To build a strong, prosperous, democratic, civil and
modern China, we are committed to developing the economy and
improving people's living standard."
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in the past 20 years since the reform
and opening-up drive was first introduced in China, 125 million
people have been lifted out of poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 50 million people living in conditions
of poverty in China, he said, adding that among them, 20 million
live in remote or mountainous areas where economic conditions are
backward, and communication and transportation links limited.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Slammed Over Hamas Threats Against Arafat's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
on Monday accused Iran of being behind Islamic militant group
Hamas' threat of violence against the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
PNA cabinet Secretary General Tayeb Abdul Rahim said he had
received information confirming that "there was an Iran element"
behind the Hamas threat, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
A leaflet signed by the military wing of Hamas and faxed to
news organizations Sunday accused PNA President Yasser Arafat of
"treason," threatening that Hamas would turn its guns towards the
PNA if the ongoing crackdown on Hamas continues.
</P>
<P>
If the leaflet is authentic, it will mark the first time Hamas
has made a direct threat against the PNA. Hamas officials denied
the leaflet came from their organization.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian factions within Hamas receive money and training
from Iran and act on instructions from Teheran, aiming at
distablizing the Palestinian society and preventing Israel from
withdrawing from Palestinian lands, Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
This accusation was the latest slam on Iran by the PNA in the
last few days. Last week, the PNA sharply condemned Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei for attacking Arafat to sign a
land-for-peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA called the statements of Khamenei, which called Arafat
a "traitor" and an Israeli "lackey", as "baseless" and
"irresponsible."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held talks here Monday with Germany's newly-elected
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to exchange views on various issues
of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Schroeder after their
talks, Blair said that they discussed a wide range of political
issues on bilateral cooperation, the single European currency and
the future of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who is on his first foreign visit since taking
office last week, voiced satisfaction over the good cooperation
between Germany and Britain, adding that his government is
determined to improve Anglo-German relations.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor also paid tribute to Blair's government
constructive contribution to European affairs by saying, "It
proves that Great Britain has the wish to cooperate at all levels
in Europe in a constructive way and we cannot wish for anything
else."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also called on the Iraqi government to comply
with various United Nations Security Council resolutions concerned
on weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely no doubt at all that they (Iraqis) must
comply with and that we are ready to take whatever means are
necessary to ensure that they do," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who said that the Germany position was "quite
similar," stressed that "it is not a matter of conflict between
the United States and Iraq. Iraq is violating decisions of the
international community, decisions of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Blair and Schroeder also exchanged views on
the international financial situation and world economy.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Announces Stabilization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Monday said that the government has worked out measures
to overcome the economic and financial crisis facing the country,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with parliamentary speakers and leaders of deputies'
factions, Primakov said the chief purpose of the government's plan
is "to ensure that the population is supplied with the main
commodities and products and that the upsurge of real economy is
promoted."
</P>
<P>
The premier emphasized, "This is the purpose of reform, it is
for this that foreign capital is injected into our economy, it is
for this that the cabinet works."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Monday's meeting "is not a protocol function
and is not aimed at emphasizing outward connection of the
government with the State Duma and the Federation Council." "We
expect to hear your remarks on the essence of the matter,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that combating corruption is a chief task of the
cabinet. The plan of the government's measures emphasizes the need
to combat crime and corruption, said Primakov, and this provision
is not linked with the charges of corruption in the government
made in recent days.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Primakov refuted the allegation by leader of the
Yabloko faction in the Duma Grigory Yavlinsky that somebody was
appointed to some or other cabinet post for money. Primakov
promised that the government will do its utmost to eradicate
economic crime.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the parliamentary factions who attended the
three-hour meeting expressed support for the cabinet's new
economic program.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Federation Council Speaker
Yegor Stroyev as saying that 40 bills will have to be discussed
and approved related to the government-developed plan of
anti-crisis steps. "We agreed to consider them closely and approve
very fast," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Federal Assembly representatives supported on the whole the
provisions constituting the measures planned by the government and
the Central Bank," Stroyev said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Peacekeepers to Replace Norwegians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian troops are expected to
arrive in south Lebanon this week and replace Norwegians serving
in the United Nations peacekeeping troops, a U.N. spokesman
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Timor Goksel, spokesman of the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon
(UNIFIL), said in a news conference that 138 Indians will arrive
in south Lebanon as advance troops to establish a command in the
eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
The rest 600 officers and soldiers will come soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government announced earlier this year that it
would be pulling its 625 troops out of south Lebanon by the end of
this year due to problems in attracting new recruits.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been seeking a replacement troops from a western
state, especially France, a country which has been enjoying a good
relationship with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, no western countries are willing to send their troops
to such a hostile area where Lebanon's guerrillas are fighting
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong UNIFIL was established in 1978 after Israel's
first invasion of Lebanon in a bid to restore the Lebanese
government's authority over south Lebanon. The troops are also
from Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal and
Poland.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim announced Monday that over nine million children
across the country will be vaccinated against polio in a national
immunization campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
Adem told a press conference here that close to 8.3 million
children under the age of five years and 300,000 lactating
mothers will also receive vitamin A capsules.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, nearly 350,000 children less than five years old
living in nine selected towns will be immunized against measles,"
Adem said.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign will be conducted in two rounds -- the
first round immunization campaign is scheduled for November 6-8,
1998 and the second round will be conducted during December 4-6.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about 90,000 health workers and volunteers will
participate in the campaign which will be conducted at more than
30,000 vaccination posts.
</P>
<P>
According to the health minister, all hospitals, health
centers, stations and posts, residents council offices, schools,
churches, mosques and market places will be used as vaccination
sites.
</P>
<P>
The required 25 million doses of oral polio vaccines, 530,600
doses of measles vaccine and 36 million vitamin capsules have
been shipped and distributed to national states, he said, adding
that a total of 40.35 million Birr (about 5.8 million U.S.
Dollars) has been earmarked for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Adem said although the incidence of polio in the world is
declining dramatically, Ethiopia is among the nine countries
where children still become paralyzed every year due to the wide
spread of polio virus.
</P>
<P>
Four African countries including Ethiopia are considered as
polio endemic, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, which has planned to eradicate polio by the year
2000, launched several nation-wide immunization campaigns in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Start Implementing Peace Deal First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
leaders have agreed that the Palestinians start to implement the
newly-signed peace agreement immediately while Israel will wait
for the approval of the deal by the cabinet and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
said on local TV on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has asked for a several-day delay in the implementation
due to legal constraints. Arafat accepted the request.
</P>
<P>
The land-for-peace agreement, signed by Arafat and Netanyahu
on October 23, stipulated that it will go into effect in 10 days
since the signing, regardless of ratification.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said earlier in the day that according to Israeli
laws, the agreement is effective only after being approved by the
cabinet and the Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The PNA endorsed the agreement in a cabinet meeting last
Friday. But Netanyahu postponed a cabinet decision on it last
week. He is expected to present the accord to the cabinet for
ratification Tuesday and to the Knesset next week.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Netanyahu told Arafat in a telephone call
that since the PNA cabinet has endorsed the agreement and the
Palestinians are supposed to take several steps before Israel
does, the Palestinians should start the implementation immediately.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Israel, Netanyahu said, if the agreement is
approved by the cabinet and the Knesset, Israel will begin to
carry out troop redeployment as scheduled in the agreement or just
after a few more days.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel will take its first
substantial step in implementing the deal on November 16 by
pulling back its troops from 2 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It should also turn 7.1 percent of the West Bank areas
currently controlled by both sides into fully Palestinian-run
areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded that during the two weeks before that, the
Palestinians should submit a working plan on fighting terrorism to
Washington and present a legal framework on confiscating weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians should also convene the Palestinian Liberation
Organization executive committee to annul anti-Israel provisions
in the Palestinian charter, and begin the work of a committee
monitoring incitement against Israel in Palestinian media and
education systems.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Revises Budget Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has revised its budget deficit targets and economic
growth rates amid global economic and financial volatility.
</P>
<P>
In a three-year budget policy statement tabled in parliament
Monday by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, the projected budget
deficit for 1998/99 fiscal year was revised from 3.5 percent to
3.9 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and for
1999/2000 from three percent to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means that the government's deficit target is to be
delayed for one year, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit would be reduced to three percent by the year
2000/2001, as originally planned, and kept at this level in
2001/2002.
</P>
<P>
Expected growth for 1998/99 was revised down from three
percent to 0.2 percent, and inflation up to eight percent from
six percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to steadily improve, however, with
growth rate forecast at two percent in 1999/2000 and three
percent in each of the following two years, while inflation is
expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
"The change to economic conditions has meant that we have had
to re-examine our projections of spending, tax revenue and
borrowing," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the government would not abandon its controversial
growth, employment and redistribution macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will go on with its reconstruction and
development objectives, and continue to protect spending on
social services and grants to the poor.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the government is committed to budget
deficit reduction, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Support for Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here Monday that the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) does not warrant military intervention and that a peaceful
settlement is the way forward for Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states trying to end the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Susan Rice said that her government supports the positive
initiatives SADC countries are taking and it is willing to
support all peaceful efforts aimed at ending the three-month-old
conflict.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement while meeting with Zambian Deputy
Foreign Minister Valentine Kayope.
</P>
<P>
The assistant secretary of state told Kayope that she is on a
tour to several African countries in a bid to find a common
understanding over the efforts to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kayope called upon the international community and the U.S. in
particular to supplement the regional efforts by providing
logistics and material support.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC countries are not able to mobilize all the
resources to bring about and maintain peace in the DRC, hence
they need support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that the conflict is not only a threat
to SADC but also to the global peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is a real threat to Zambia which shares the
longest border stretching over 2,200 kilometers with many tribes
sharing common ancestries in the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the conflict has real and immediate consequences
on his country, affecting its national security, economic
interests and ethnic and filial ties.
</P>
<P>
Kayope also noted that a military solution is not a viable
option, adding a quick solution that will preserve the integrity
of the DRC and minimize the loss of human life and property
should be found.
</P>
<P>
Rice is expected to hold private talks with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba before leaving for Zimbabwe later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rice has already visited South Africa, Angola and the DRC for
talks over the crisis in the third largest African country and
she will also pay visits to Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe announced Sunday that the
allied forces of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have resolved to
embark on an offensive campaign to clear the rebels from the
eastern parts of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The allied troops were sent to the DRC to back President
Laurent Kabila soon after the rebels allegedly backed by Rwanda
and Uganda rose up against him on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Uganda admitted its military presence in the DRC, while Rwanda
denied that it had sent troops to the vast central African
country.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Understands Iraq's Position: Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Cairo-based Arab League chief
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Monday expressed understanding for Iraq's
demand for a "comprehensive and serious" review of its compliance
with the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
But Abdel-Meguid called for Baghdad's flexibility in handling
its relations with the U.N. arms inspectors in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a decision Iraq announced Saturday to halt
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He said that in light of contacts with U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and some Security Council members, it is necessary for
Iraq to take a flexible stance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council responded Sunday to Iraq's decision by
issuing a press statement demanding Baghdad reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision followed a Security Council decision Friday to
review its compliance with U.N. resolutions, but without the
guarantee demanded by Iraq that the review must lead to lifting of
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed the sanctions on Iraq, barring
export of oil, its main revenue earner, in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid, in the meantime, said that he understands Iraq's
request that the U.N. arms inspectors be "unbiased" in carrying
out their missions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses UNSCOM of donning the cloak of the U.N. but spying
for the United States, which Baghdad denounces for manipulating
the weapons inspections in an attempt to prolong the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief called on Iraq to comply with the U.N.
resolutions in a bid to seek lifting the embargo and end the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Following a two-day strike last
week, Lebanon's public high school teachers Monday decided to
stage an open strike beginning November 9, to demand more pension
payments.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a general meeting of the Public
School Teachers Bureau here, the official National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A recommendation issued following the meeting also called on
students and their parents to support them in the stand-off with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Public teachers are demanding their pension payments to be
calculated on the basis of 100 percent of their last full
salaries, rather than the 85 percent the government agreed to
give in a pay scale bill, which has been endorsed by the
parliament last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of National Education, Youth and Sport Jean
Obeid has expressed support for the teachers, saying that "We are
interested in achieving the rightful demands of secondary school
teachers, to treat them in the same way as private school
teachers."
</P>
<P>
Last week, about 5,500 teachers observed the two-day strike,
leaving 70,000 students in 190 secondary schools throughout the

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said here Monday that the Israeli-Turkish military cooperation
agreement is not aimed at any third party, including Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who arrived here Monday on a three-day state visit to
cement ties with Cyprus, made the remarks after his talks with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"I want you to understand, the Turkish press especially, (this
has) nothing to do with a third party," he told reporters,
referring to the Israeli-Turkish defense cooperation agreement
signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He described the agreement with Turkey as one between two
friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has previously expressed concern over
the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Greek coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
which was declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that Israel has no agreement with Ankara to attack
Syria if Turkey is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope to reach agreement with Syria to
solve the Lebanese issue. "I hope one day we have an agreement
with Syria to solve the Lebanese Problem...," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
allegedly to protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have witnessed great
improvement since Cyprus opened its embassy in Tel Aviv five
years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Int'l Community to Help End Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official Monday
stressed that the international community can and must play
"supportive" roles to bring peace to the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Regional efforts are critical to find a resolution to the
conflict. But the international community can and must play
supportive roles," said Susan Rice, visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs, in a brief statement made
at the Lusaka International Airport before her departure for
Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
She is also U.S. National Security Council Senior Executive
Director for African Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Rice came to Zambia Sunday for a two-day visit aiming at
finding "the best ways" of resolving the three-month-old conflict
in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, she held talks with Zambian Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs Valentine Kayope and later held a private meeting
with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Rice also pledged her government's support
for Zambian leader Chiluba to work within the context of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring peace to the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
She added that Zambia and the U.S. share a conviction that "a
stable and democratic Congo (K) is essential to the political and
economic stability of the entire region."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on her meeting with Chiluba, who has been mandated
by southern African leaders to mediate the Congo crisis, Rice
said that they had "very constructive" discussions and had a
better understanding of what was accomplished at the Lusaka
ministerial meeting held early last week at which a draft
cease-fire agreement on the crisis was adopted.
</P>
<P>
"But obviously there is much more work to be done and we look
forward to helping the region to achieve these objectives," she
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Before her visit here, Rice has visited South Africa, Angola,
the DRC. And she is also scheduled to visit Zimbabwe, Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Zambia reiterated its objection to the change
of governments through force and a military solution to the Congo
crisis in which more and more African countries such as Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia, Chad and Uganda have got involved.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia does not support the change of governments through
force of arms, either by local groups or foreign countries,"
Kayope said while meeting the U.S. assistant secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we do not think that a military solution is
a viable option to revolve the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo," Kayope stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the conflict in the DRC is not only a threat to
the region but also a threat to the international peace and
security as a whole.

KUWAIT CITY, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait expressed regret
Monday over the latest Iraqi-U.N. crisis, hoping Iraq would not
cause problems with the United Nations, Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is not happy that there is a dispute between Iraq and
the U.N. ... We hope that Iraq would not initiate problems with
the U.N.," said First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Sabah made the remarks after meeting with the National

</P>
<P>
"But there is nothing new in the Iraqi-U.N. issue," Sabah
said, noting Kuwait is following up the situation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first response by a senior Kuwaiti official since
Iraq decided on Saturday to halt all forms of cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors and monitors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced that it would not resume the cooperation until
the U.N. Security Council reviews the lifting of sanctions imposed
on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and purges its teams
of "spies and agents."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Decrees Sale of Gasprom Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday signed a decree to sell part of the government-held
shares in the Gasprom open-stock company.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the presidential press service
as saying that the president signed the decree for the purposes of
development of the state-run company and of obtaining revenue from
the sale of the shares held by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The decree which takes effect from the day of its official
publication authorizes a tender to sell five percent of the
Gasprom shares at an auction sale or through a commercial tender.
</P>
<P>
According to the press service, shares acquired by foreign
investors cannot be transferred or used to place securities or
other financial instrument, including American Depositary
Receipts, for five years.
</P>
<P>
If a foreign investor wins an auction or investment tender for
the Gasprom shares, the allowable share of foreign investment in
Gasprom will increase to 14 percent from nine percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors currently hold about two percent of Gasprom
shares.
</P>
<P>
The news of the signing by Yeltsin the decree made the Gasprom
share prices soared by 30 percent at the Moscow stock exchange on
Monday, the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The index of the Moscow Stock Exchange, where Gasprom shares
are mostly traded, increased by over 10.5 percent from 11:00 a.m.
Moscow time, when the first information about the presidential
decree was reported.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Iraq's Decision Not to Escalate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa expressed hope Monday that Iraq's latest decision to cut
off its relations with the U.N. weapons inspectors will not
escalate the tensions between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was speaking to reporters on the decision Iraq announced
Saturday to halt all dealings with the United Nations Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, charged with overseeing the elimination of
the country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision followed a U.N. Security Council decision
Friday to review its compliance with U.N. resolutions, but without
the guarantee demanded by Iraq that the review must lead to
lifting of the trade sanctions imposed on it in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In a sign to show sympathy for Iraq, Moussa said Egypt "has
felt" Iraq's suspicion of the performance of UNSCOM since Scott
Ritter, who resigned in August as an arms inspector, revealed that
he routinely sent to Israel the findings of Iraq's weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
"This, as we understood, constituted wrongdoing on the part of
UNSCOM," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Such "wrongdoing must be redressed" and all parties concerned
"should be reassured" that it will not be repeated and that an
"honest execution" of the U.N. Security Council resolutions will
be in place, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses U.N. weapons inspectors of donning the cloak
of the U.N. but spying for Israel and the United States, which it
denounces for manipulating the weapons inspections.

<P>
AMMAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of
Information Nasir Judeh said here Monday that there is no
"unsolvable" crisis between Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is keen to use all necessary means to transcend any
crisis with Syria, he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's keenness to solve the crisis is based on its
pan-Arab stand, said Judeh.
</P>
<P>
Jordan thinks its crisis with Syria is only "a minor problem,"
a view similar to that of Egypt, whose top leaders have vowed to
help both sides solve it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria repeatedly criticized Jordan for signing in 1994 a peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Jordan of trying to form a military alliance
with Israel and Turkey, one of whose assumed enemies was Syria.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Surge on Rates Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Though the dollar's dip prompted
a round of profit-taking and consolidation on the bourses, Wall
Street's healthy early showing helped European shares hold to
their gains on Monday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 came back from early highs on profit-taking
but still posted a 1.6 percent rise, bolstered by Wall Street's
rally and hopes of an aggressive rate cut from the Bank of
England.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 climbed 87 to 5525.5 while FTSE 250 kept pace with
the senior index. Market volume amounted to 750 million shares.
</P>
<P>
"The markets have been squeezed due to a shortage of stock,"
said Richard Grossman, a stockbroker at Redmayne Bentley. "People
are looking for value in the FTSE 250, which is more domestically
oriented, while the leaders are doing well because of strength in
the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Cash-rich investors seemed to look for a vehicle away from
overvalued bonds, while funds that have missed the recent rally
have been pressured into joining now rather than waiting for a
pull-back that may never happen.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has completed today's hat-trick of three softer than
anticipated manufacturing figures, indicating manufacturing
contraction in the US, UK and Germany," noted Marian Bell, head of
Treasury research at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"The U.K. Purchasing Managers Index, weak across the board,
will add to expectations of a rate cut Thursday," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares eased off highs although hopes of
European rate cuts underpin the market. The late-trading
electronic index, the Xetra Dax, closed at 4762, up 71.5 points.
</P>
<P>
While most traders think a rate cut by the Bundesbank later
this week is unlikely, they say that increasing calls for lower
rates by German and European leaders are helping to shore up the
dollar against the deutschmark.
</P>
<P>
As a stable dollar boosts export, investors are scrambling to
cover their short positions to limit their losses. The result, say
dealers, is a short squeeze, fuelling a further escalation of
share prices.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks climbed as hopes of further European
monetary easing boosted sentiment, too. The leading cac 40 index
closed up 47 points at 3,569.
</P>
<P>
"The market opened higher and then edged down a little bit"
which shows the bourse isn't following any definite direction, a
trader at Credit Lyonnais securities said.
</P>
<P>
"Investors are also waiting for a rate cut from the Bank of
England this week and possibly one from Italy too now that it
appears political disputes in Germany will avert interest rate
cuts there."
</P>
<P>
Investors are said to be keeping a close eye on economic
indicators coming out of the U.S. this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is to pay a one-day working visit to the northern Cyprus on
Tuesday for "consultations," a Foreign Ministry statement said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in northern Cyprus, Yilmaz is expected to meet
with Turkish Cypriot leaders to outline additional political and
economic measures to enforce their relations.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's visit comes just a week before Cyprus formally starts
accession talks with the European Union (EU) on November 10.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the inauguration of Cyprus' accession
process with the EU, Ankara and Turkish Cypriot leaders have vowed
to take all reciprocal steps of rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on Monday, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
said that in response to the inauguration of Cyprus-EU talks,
northern Cyprus is preparing an array of plans which will be
disclosed in the coming days, Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that "The European Union should understand that
it is having talks with Greek Cyprus, and not the entire
island. The European Union is displaying a hostile attitude
against us...As long as the European Union continues to follow
this wrong path, the wall between the Greek Cypriots and us will
continue to ascend."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983 which is only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in
northern Cyprus to provide security protection to Turkish
Cypriots there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Must Act Now to Reduce Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States must take
immediate steps to adopt more aggressive measures to cut
emissions, says an article in Monday's Washington Post written by
Daniel A. Lashot, senior scientist at the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer ignore the threat of global warming," the
U.S. scientist pointed out in his article,"Since the historic
conference in Kyoto, Japan, last December, new evidence
reconfirming the urgency of addressing the global warming problem
has accumulated. Record global temperatures, combined with extreme
weather, indicative of trends forecast by climate scientists have
made this seemingly remote issue an immediate concern for most
Americans." He said "Now it is time to translate political
commitments into real action."
</P>
<P>
On the situation of greenhouse gas emissions in the United
States, the scientist said that "Our greenhouse gas emissions
continue to increase with no discernible change in trend. The
Administration has failed to address adequately the two major
sectors contributing most to this growth: power plants and
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
He said that Currently electric power plants are responsible
for 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a
substantial share of the pollutants that cause dangerous levels of
smog and soot in our air and acidity and mercury in our lakes and
estuaries. Most of this pollution comes from older, coal-filed
plants that are exempt from many pollution-control requirements,
said the author.
</P>
<P>
Automobiles are the second most important source of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions and the largest contributor to smog. But
U.S. fuel efficiency standards haven't been updated since 1985. As
a result it appears that new vehicles introduced by automobile
manufactures are less efficient than the vehicles that are
replacing.
</P>
<P>
The author calls on the U.S. government and the Congress to
take a strong commitment to domestic action to accelerate progress
in negotiating rules for emissions trading and the other
flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Iraq to Allow Inspection Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday demanded that Iraq let U.N. arms inspectors "finish the
job" they were sent to do and said that he would not rule out any
options until they were allowed to resume work.
</P>
<P>
"Until the inspectors are back on the job, no options are off
the table," Clinton said at a White House event. "Iraq must let
the inspectors finish the job they started seven years ago -- a
job Iraq promised to let them do repeatedly."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein decided to suspend
all cooperation with the United Nations weapons inspectors until
the U.N. Security Council cancels the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"For Iraq, the only path to lifting sanctions is through
complete cooperation with the weapons inspectors, without
restrictions, runarounds, or roadblocks," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein's latest refusal to cooperate with the
international weapons inspectors is completely unacceptable. Once
again, though, it will backfire," added he.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton summoned his top national security
aides to the White House to discuss how to respond to Iraq's
decision.
</P>
<P>
"Far from dividing the international community and achieving
concessions, his (Saddam's) obstructionism was immediately and
unanimously condemned by the United Nations Security Council. It
has only served to deepen the international community's resolve,"
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the U.S. will will be consulting
closely with its allies in the region and decide how to respond.

Mosisili added that Lesotho's armed forces had failed to
maintain law and order and it was therefore his duty as prime
minister responsible for security to invite the SADC to intervene
militarily to help restore law and order.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, in the SADC's name, sent its troops to Lesotho
on September 22 at the invitation of Mosisili to help restore
social order and law in the mountain kingdom. Botswana followed
suit two days later.
</P>
<P>
With the SADC intervention, Lesotho's weeks of national
turmoil was effectively curbed, and now the country has turned to
be stable.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks have been held between the Lesotho government and
the opposition. They have agreed to hold fresh general elections
within 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Negotiation On Kosovo Future Elusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, YUGOSLAVIA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Although the
possibility of war diminished following NATO's decision to
postpone indefinitely its airstrike against Yugoslavia, political
settlement of the Kosovo Crisis is just as elusive as before.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the delegations of the Serbian Republic and of
Kosovo ethnic Albanians failed to start on Monday despite media
reports in Belgrade that the date was agreed by the Yugoslav
government and U.S. mediators.
</P>
<P>
The failure was apparently due to differences between Yugoslav
authorities and ethnic Albanians on the future of Kosovo and on
how to start the process of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Bosko Drobnjak, Secretary of Information for the provincial
government of Kosovo, told Xinhua that the Serbian side was ready
to start talks at any time. "If the ethnic Albanians are ready
too, our government delegation can arrive in Pristina in two
hours," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that any blueprint for future Kosovo should respect the
soverienty and territorial integrity of Kosovo and while ethnic
Albanians can enjoy highest autonomy on earth, Kosovo should
remain as part of Serbian Republic. This, he pointed out, is one
main aspect of the agreement reached between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Drobnjak complained that Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the ethnic
Albanians, has not given up seeking independence while expressing
support for the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement.
</P>
<P>
In response, Alush A. Gashi, adviser to Rugova, said that the
ethnic side has welcomed the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement except
for the provision that Kosovo should remain inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are not responsible for what we have not signed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ethnic Albanian side would not start talk with
the government with conditions stringed, which mean that the
government could not insist on Kosovo being part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the long-term goal of ethnic Albanians remain
to achieve independence, but the near-term one is to strive for a
transitional period of three or five years during which the status
of Kosovo will be upgraded to that of republic.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the proposal on Kosovo's future tabled by U.S.
Special Envoy Christopher Hill, Gashi said that the ethnic
Albanian side is not satisfied and that change has to be make.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to detail what change should be in the Hill
proposal which, according to Belgrade media, states clearly that
Kosovo remains part of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) War May Last Long: Ugandan Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The current war in the eastern
part of the Democratic Repubic of Congo (DRC) may last long
because there is no solution in sight yet, an official in the
Ugandan President's Office said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Jack Turyamwijuka, the commissioner of Radio Broadcasting in
the President's Office, told Xinhua that the DRC war will further
spill into other areas if both President Laurent Kabila's
government and the rebels refuse to talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan official said that he hated the war and hoped
Uganda could get itself out of the three-month-long conflict
because it costs dearly.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reasons for Uganda's involvement in the
Congo crisis, Turyamwijuka said that his government may fear the
Tutsi rebels to come to Uganda if defeated and that the rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) pose a serious threat to
Uganda's security.
</P>
<P>
"If the Tutsis come to Uganda, we will have a lot of refugees.
And together with the refugees may come other people," the
official said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The DRC has a tradition of inviting foreign troops for help
whenever there is a serious problem at home, he said, citing
former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and the incumbent President
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Uganda has begun to use the demobilized officers
in eastern DRC shows that the country is doing its best and this
involvement constitutes a heavy burden for the government, he
said.

<HEADLINE> 23 Islamist Terrorists Arrested in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir
said on Monday that 23 terrorists have been captured in Istanbul
for their attempt to make a suicide attack on Anitkabir, the
mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal, founder of the Republic of Turkey, on
October 29.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Cakir as saying
that the illegal Anatolian Federated Islamic State (AFID)
organization rented a private plane in Bursa, western Turkey, on
October 22 and made a reconnaissance flight in a bid to stage the
operation on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding
the Republic of Turkey on October 29.
</P>
<P>
Its plan was thwarted when the Thursday flight was canceled
due to adverse weather conditions and the planned assault was
postponed to November 10, the anniversary of the death of Mustafa
Kemal.
</P>
<P>
Cakir said that the Turkish police organized one of the
biggest operations in its history to arrest the 23 terrorists in
the city and Turkey has accused the AFID leader Metin Kaplan of
directing the operation from Cologne, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Imports Drop by Four Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

DAR ES SALAAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's imports in
September reached 123.3 million U.S. Dollars, decreasing by four
percent from those in August, according to a latest report issued
by the Bank of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, in its monthly economic review, said that
except for capital goods which increased by 33.8 percent, imports
of all other major categories decreased from the levels recorded
in August.
</P>
<P>
The imports of major categories, namely the intermediate and
consumer goods, declined by 33.2 percent and 13 percent
respectively, said the report.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, the total imports for the year ending in
September 1998 increased by six percent against the previous
year, reaching 1,453.5 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Except for intermediate goods imports which decreased by 9.9
percent, imports for other categories namely, capital and
consumer goods, increased by 20 percent and 8.9 percent
respectively, compared with levels recorded in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in capital goods was mainly due to increased
importation of machinery from on-going projects especially in the
power generation, mining and road construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
Imports for consumer goods, especially foodstuffs, increased
on account of inadequate local production, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Intermediate goods imports declined as a result of the
decrease in oil imports, especially white goods, due to favorable
prices in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Some 1,000 Evacuated in Flood in Kansas, Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 people were
evacuated in Kansas and Oklahoma as river waters flowed out of
their banks following up to 30 centimeters of rain during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain since Friday night in Kansas has driven an estimated
900 people to flee homes, including at least 350 people from
nursing homes in Wichita. Water blocked all roads into the town of
Sedgwick on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Augusta, downtown was under two-meter water after flood
water flowed over a 10-meter levee that protects the town of 8,700
people. A preliminary damage estimate in the town alone was about
two million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kansas Governor Bill Graves canceled Monday's planned
campaigning for Tuesday's elections and toured the flooded areas.
He declared a state of emergency for Cowley, Chase, Butler and
Sedgwick counties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 150 people have fled their homes across Kay
County in northern Oklahoma after more than 15 centimeters of rain
fell over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Chikaskia River was more than 1.5 meters above flood stage
at Blackwell, 145 kilometers north of Oklahoma City, and more than
100 people evacuated their homes during the night.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said the flooding would spread Monday as
rain continued to raise waterways throughout the region.

JOHANNESBURG. November 2 (Xinhua) -- South African Vice
President Thabo Mbeki, who is in Saudi Arabia for a four-day
visit, may secure a 8.3-billion-Rand (1.6-billion-U.S. Dollar)
arms deal with Riyadh, South African television reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The television report quoted diplomatic sources as saying that
the arms deal would be part of Mbeki's discussions with Saudi
Arabia. The South African vice president met crown prince
Abdullab bin Abdulaziz Monday.
</P>
<P>
Weapons to be sold to the west Asian country include G-6 super
cannons and anti-aircraft missiles, said the report.

South African Defense Minister Joe Modise was among the
members of the delegation.

<P>
The presence of South African Mineral and Energy Minister
Penuell Maduna raised the possibility that an oil deal could be

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Israel on Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
expressed concern about Israeli plans to expand a Jewish
settlement, stressing that it could set back a new peace deal with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"In our view we would not want to see unilateral actions of
this kind taken," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"If we go back to business as usual -- that means undermining
the confidence that has been created at Wye -- we'll be out
business," he added, referring to the Palestine-Israel agreement
signed at the Wye Plantation in Maryland last month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that
Israel would begin work on Monday to expand the Jewish settlement
of Kiryat Arba near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians and Israelis agreed to start final status
negotiations after the Wye accords were implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the necessity to create a positive environment for
those negotiations, neither side shall initiate or take any step
that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in
accordance with the interim agreement," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"And so it's very important in the coming weeks on both sides
for both sides to understand that their actions and statements can
undermine the very confidence that we've put back on track through
the Wye River process and the agreement that resulted from it,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
agreed to delay the implementation of the Wye agreement. However,
Netanyahu reassures Arafat that he would carry out the accord
though several days later than planned.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, due to have gone into effect on Monday, would
come into force only after Israeli parliament approved it next
week, said Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Bad Planning Fails S. African Soldiers in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African
National Defense Force (SANDF) Monday claimed that the government
lacked a clear national security policy and that bad planning
made soldiers deployed in Lesotho not combat ready.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF also disclosed that the incursion, code-named
Operation Boleas, had cost 24 million Rand (4.2 million U.S.
Dollars) to date, according to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing to a joint sitting of parliament's foreign
affairs and defense portfolio committees, SANDF spokesmen said
that the psychological and media war had been lost "at all
levels," and blamed the Department of Foreign Affairs for a "lack
of operational coordination."
</P>
<P>
"The weakness of Operation Boleas includes too short time for
proper planning in the absence of contingency plan, and too short
time for deployment drills," SANDF joint operations chief Deon
Ferreira told the committees.
</P>
<P>
"This resulted in insufficient support for the operation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Participating units were not combat ready and stock level
planning for operational reserves was not done, resulting in a
strain on supplies, he added.
</P>
<P>
SANDF chief General Siphiwe Nyanda said the troops were also
keen to know from Southern African Development Community (SADC)
what to do with the confiscated Lesotho Defense Force weapons and
ammunition, and how they should disarm the country's civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
However, the general said, despite all the problems they had
experienced, the SADC troops had done "exceedingly well" in
restoring law and order in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswanan troops entered Lesotho in
September under the auspices of the SADC to help the government
quell the rising unrest in the country stemming from a dispute
over the results of the May 23 general election.
</P>
<P>
The forces encountered unexpectedly fierce resistance from the
mutinous Lesotho soldiers. More than 40 South African and
Lesotho soldiers died in skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
Monday's briefing came as the first South African troops to be
withdrawn from Lesotho crossed into home territory the same day.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said it expected the withdrawal of 1,400 troops
would be completed by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
After the pull-out, the number of South African soldiers in
Lesotho will decrease from 3,500 to 2,700 including 600
light-armed soldiers from two infantry battalion who arrived in
Maseru Sunday night.
