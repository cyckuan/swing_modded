BRAVES BEAT YANKEES, 7-2

   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez has been a hungry learner since
joining the New York Yankees, absorbing the English language,
adapting his style of dress and his humor to that of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Atlanta Braves taught him a lesson on the
sophistication of advance scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting through Hernandez's assortment of arm angles and
pitches, the Braves consistently attacked him in the same way and
chased him from the mound after three and two-thirds innings as
they beat El Duque and the Yankees, 7-2, before 54,775 fans at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez forced home on walks two of the six runs he allowed
and lost his first decision, in his fourth big league start. Tom
Glavine, who makes a habit of winning the day after the Braves
lose, pitched eight innings and gave up both Yankee runs.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Yankees flew to Atlanta, where they will
begin a two-game series on Wednesday night, with the Yankees' David
Cone (9-2) pitching against Kevin Millwood (9-3).
</P>
<P>
   The baseball that Hernandez played in Cuba was highly
competitive and refined, judging by his quick transition to the
major leagues. But the conditions were relatively spartan there,
and in the international competition in which Hernandez thrived;
teams did not possess the scouting resources teams have in the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was signed by the Yankees too late in spring training
to pitch in exhibitions, to give the Braves a chance to see him in
Florida. But in preparing for Hernandez, the Braves could have
relied on the reports of advance scouts or videotape. Chipper
Jones, their third baseman, referred to the use of videotape on
Tuesday afternoon in discussing his preparation for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cuban right-hander's first two starts, an American
League advance scout said he could find no discernible pattern in
Hernandez, that he was unique because he could throw his curveball
for strikes consistently. But it appeared on Tuesday night as if
the Braves had identified a method of attack against Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   They often ignored his fastball and his changeup, pitches
Hernandez likes to throw outside the strike zone in the hope
opposing batters will hack at them. But when Hernandez threw his
curveball _ the one pitch he consistently throws for strikes _
Atlanta batters usually swung, like dive-bombing hawks. With a part
of his camouflage gone, Hernandez became more and more passive in
his approach, eventually capitulating.
</P>
<P>
   The first three Atlanta hitters made out on curveballs, Curtis
Pride taking a called third strike and the other two putting the
ball in play as Hernandez got through the first inning with only 10
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the left-handed Ryan Klesko singled to left with one out in
the second and the right-handed Javy Lopez leaned over the plate
and whacked a sidearm fastball into the right-field corner, Klesko
stopping at third. Hernandez spun a curveball to Michael Tucker,
who slapped it to left-center, to score Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez still had a grip on this game _ the score was tied,
1-1, for Derek Jeter had homered in the Yankee first against
Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, however, walked Ozzie Guillen, Atlanta's No. 9
hitter, to open the third inning. Pride pulled a curveball through
the first-base hole, Guillen hustling around second and sliding
into third. Hernandez tried a curveball with a 2-2 count on Keith
Lockhart, who chopped it to second, allowing Guillen to score.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, it was as if Hernandez had recognized
Atlanta's approach, for he threw mostly fastballs and changeups,
and Atlanta's hitters wouldn't bite. When Hernandez walked Lopez to
put runners at first and second with nobody out, a collective
grumble began encircling Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker struck out on three pitches, but when Andruw Jones swung
at the first pitch _ a curveball _ and grounded it to third, Scott
Brosius fumbled the ball, the error loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez then walked Guillen to force home the Braves' third
run. With Pride at the plate, Hernandez and his catcher, Jorge
Posada, seemed at odds several times on what to throw. Pride twice
called for time before one pitch, and Posada swiped at the dirt
with his bare hand, apparently in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez then walked Pride, forcing home another run, and
Atlanta led, 4-1. Lockhart struck out, but Chipper Jones lined a
fastball to center, two runs scoring.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque was done for the night, having allowed six hits, four
walks and six runs in three and two-thirds innings.

   Timing isn't right &QL; 
for Jordan to leave
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SO Phil Jackson has confirmed what he had been saying all along: He
is out of there, gone as the bearded guru of the Chicago Bulls,
content to be an ex-coach for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The search to replace him began Tuesday, but it isn't likely the
Bulls will find a more perfect fit than the coach with the big
shoulders in the City of Big Shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   How much credit Jackson deserves for shaping the NBA's last
empire isn't clear, but he is surely due more than most observers
will give him. He kept the Bulls hungry, kept them together, and
best of all, he let them be whoever they were. The Bulls seemed to
enjoy his occasional references to Eastern philosophy, his yen for
Zen.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves with a record that defies criticism, six world titles
in this decade. He coached for nine seasons, not a number that
would offend those who favor term limits. But he left in his own
good time.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fans of the team, and the fans of grace and glory, can
only pray that Michael Jordan doesn't follow him into the twilight
zone. The strong conviction here is that Michael will not. It never
made sense to us that he would connect his plans, his future, to
the whims of his coach. Yes, they have been friends and comrades,
but they were never joined at the hip. They didn't use the same
hairstylist.
</P>
<P>
   He's still got game
</P>
<P>
   Would a new coach treat Jordan with any less respect or
gratitude? Would he use him as a decoy so the Bulls could get the
ball to Luc Longley?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as you may recall, Michael was able to separate himself
from Phil once before, when he went off to make the world safe for
minor-league baseball. His sudden goodbye, in 1993, wasn't
described as a mere retirement. It was analyzed like the breakup of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe he is ready to put us through that again. You
saw his face this week on the cover of Time. There is Mike the
legend, Mike the symbol of the NBA's wealth and international
reach, and Mike the growth industry, known on Wall Street as Air
Jordan. If he quit this time, never to return, what would be the
impact on all the companies that hitched their wagons to his
frequent-flier club? What would become of all those kids who want
to be like Mike? Where do they go to retire?
</P>
<P>
   They would learn, as all of us eventually must, that life goes
on.
</P>
<P>
   But the best guess is that Jordan will remain with the Bulls and
play one or two more seasons, even without Jackson &LR; v R-$+&AMP;$,,
R'-+WH05kW-YHT.nR,

questions contritely, admitting that he did not throw enough
strikes, seeming confident that he could make adjustments in his
next start against the New York Mets on Sunday.

   ``I learn from my losses, not my wins,'' he said. ``I'm not
worried or disappointed.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FORGET ABOUT IT, GEORGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another night, another event, another thumbs-up
referendum on the state of George Steinbrenner's baseball team and
the stadium it reluctantly calls home.
</P>
<P>
   After 53,000 showed up at Yankee Stadium on Monday night,
another 54,775 braved the mist, the traffic, the parking and the
prices on Tuesday night to watch a suddenly erratic Orlando
Hernandez lose his first major league game, by 7-2, to Tom Glavine
and the Turnersville Braves. Big deal, Steinbrenner huffed, albeit
good-naturedly, in the Yankee clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural setup, with the World Series,'' he said.
``What will we do with the Phillies next week? That's more of a
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell us another one. Keep setting obstacles in the Bronx and
daring New Yorkers to cross them. Face it, big guy, they will build
a nuclear test site in Manhattan before they build you a ball park.
You blew it. You put together this splendid team, brimming with
homegrown stars and smart acquisitions, and nurtured by a calm,
street-smart city native.
</P>
<P>
   You say you learned that you ``can't go undefeated in
baseball,'' which you proved by not overreacting after losing in
the playoffs last October. Now New York loves your talented Yankees
for what they stand for, for their international flavor. Fans are
visiting the Stadium at a near-record pace that will only improve
with the kids out of school. By the end of the season, your cries
and those of the mayor for a park on the West Side of Manhattan
will sound like so much whistling in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   In your advancing age, you have become too smart for your own
good, even if you did get yourself stuck in two hours' worth of
traffic after landing at Newark International Airport from Tampa,
Fla., on Monday night in the middle of rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what some of these people have to go through to get to
the games,'' Steinbrenner said. ``You have to love the Yankees to
do that, and they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a couple of children in Yankee caps in the next car, he
recounted, ``I rolled down the window and said, `Don't worry, they
ain't starting until I get there.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's still the Boss, but these children, Steinbrenner said,
didn't even know who he was, and why would they? While busily
romancing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani these past few years, he has
surrendered the spotlight, allowed his players to be the only stars
of his baseball team, and they have authored the most feel-good
story of the decade in New York sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any bad apples, no one barking at the manager,
and that's why people like this team,'' Darryl Strawberry said. ``I
know that we have a feeling like the Chicago Bulls have _ the
unity, knowing how to play, how to win, that you don't panic. We've
won a World Series, been together a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Braves visit baseball's 24-hour supermarket for rich
teams sometime this summer, the Yankees are more charismatic,
deeper and have the superior bullpen. As the 20th century nears its
end, we have reached the point where Steinbrenner's franchise is
one of the game's most reliably stable, the one El Duque and Hideki
Irabu chose over all others. The Yankees are closer to what the
Dodgers were until Rupert Murdoch took over in Los Angeles and the
era of television executives bypassing the general manager to make
multiplayer trades commenced.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Foxies have fired a Dodger manager, for the first
time in 45 years, and jettisoned an accomplished general manager
along with him, there is a whisper circulating that they want to
ditch the elegant Dodger uniforms next, for ones that would be
easier to market to ``X-Files'' America. By the time Murdoch is
done, Steinbrenner's respect for history and tradition will be
compared to Wimbledon's. Sooner or later, he will realize he isn't
getting the Manhattan stadium, that it would be insane to go to New
Jersey, that luxury boxes, a Metro North train stop, improved
access and parking will solve his worst riddles. He will embrace
the Bronx, reinvent himself as a Robin Hood of sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Steinbrenner will continue to insult New York
by comparing it to Cleveland and Baltimore, limp tourist towns that
fill their parks to watch underfinanced opponents playing on life
support. New York doesn't buy that scam as easily, never has. Or as
Strawberry said: ``New York fans always come out for the teams that
can almost compete with us.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 107,000 came to the Bronx to watch the Yanks and the
Braves split two games the last two nights, despite Steinbrenner's
insistence that ``people do not come up here for midweek night
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Go tell that to the Mets. &QL;

LASORDA SAYS TENURE DEPENDS ON FACTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tom Lasorda has always had interest in one day
being the general manager of the Dodgers. But since he is now 70,
he might prefer that his GM days are short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   That issue was just one of many topics that Lasorda touched on
in his second day on his new job. He said he plans on making some
personnel changes and has talked to other clubs, but he wouldn't
pinpoint the areas where the team needs improvement. Also, he
vehemently denied a report that he was trying to get former manager
Bill Russell fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, age is a factor,'' said Lasorda on Tuesday. ``I feel
great, but we have to get someone a lot younger in here. I'm just
trying to get this team in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I am doing the job because they asked me to. If
they ask me at the end of the season to stay, I'm doing a good job
and I'm feeling well, I'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Avila visits: Dodgers vice president Ralph Avila, who
oversees operations in the Dominican Republic, was expected to make
a short visit to Los Angeles. But after the death of Al Campanis on
Sunday, Avila will attend the funeral Friday, help out Lasorda and
team president Bob Graziano and probably won't depart until this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Avila, who is in his 28th season with the organization, arrived
in L.A. on Monday afternoon following a 12-hour flight from Taiwan,
where he was helping the Sinon Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason that I wanted to stay here was for Al's
funeral,'' said Avila, who has been instrumental in signing such
players as Ramon Martinez and Raul Mondesi. ``But in the meantime,
I can help Tommy or Graziano in any capacity they need.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wilton's OK: Wilton Guerrero wanted out as a Dodger. But
after being recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque on Monday, the
23-year-old infielder has changed his tune.
</P>
<P>
   After learning he was being demoted to Triple-A on May 16, he
was very upset and asked for a trade. A member of the Dodgers
organization also said that infielder Alex Cora was promoted from
Triple-A in early June because Guerrero refused to come back.
</P>
<P>
   While Guerrero admitted that he let his emotions get the best of
him, he also said he didn't refuse to return to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was tough. But I had to get used to it because it
was out of my control,'' said Guerrero, whose comments in Spanish
were translated. ``But it was hard. Yes, I was emotional, but I am
here now. I was mad and (the trade comments) were the first thing
that came to my mind. I'm just trying to forget about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scioscia looks ahead: Dodgers coach Mike Scioscia has dreams
of one day managing on the major-league level. And now that it
doesn't seem likely that it will happen in Los Angeles, he will
likely be open to looking elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick where you want to manage,'' he said. ``But when
the opportunity comes and you like the environment, that's your
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Etc: Former Dodgers general manager Fred Claire is holding a
press conference this afternoon at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in
Pasadena.... Third baseman Bobby Bonilla, who was placed on the
15-day disabled list with a intestinal infection Saturday, is
continuing to improve. He is expected to be at Dodger Stadium
today.... Albuquerque coach Jon Debus will manage the Dukes until a
replacement is named.

MICROSOFT WINS KEY LEGAL BATTLE; STOCK SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. won a key legal victory Tuesday that it said
affirms its freedom to design its software without outside
interference and erodes claims by antitrust regulators that it
doesn't compete fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington,
D.C., propelled Microsoft's stock to a record high and prompted
jubilation among the company's top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold proclaimed Tuesday ``a great
day for consumers'' and said the decision ``reaffirms the central
principle ... that every company should have the freedom to improve
its products and integrate new features on behalf of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and legal experts agreed that the ruling was a
significant win for the company. But they warned that the issues
are far from settled, and that in any case Microsoft's market power
and hard-nosed business tactics will continue to draw regulators'
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are anything but out of the woods,'' said industry
analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. ``They have an image
that leads people to assume they're guilty until proven innocent
... until they fix their fundamental image problem, their exposure
to litigation remains significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice said little. It issued a
three-sentence statement saying it was disappointed with the
ruling, which came in a relatively narrow case filed last fall, but
remained confident it would prevail in the broader antitrust case
it filed last month along with companion litigation filed by 20
states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Central to all of the cases has been the claim that Microsoft
has abused its Windows software monopoly by forcing computer makers
to also accept its Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of computers sold today are equipped with the
Windows operating system. Computer makers had no real alternative
to Windows if they wanted to replace Internet Explorer with an
alternative browser _ such as Netscape Navigator _ for computer
users to navigate the Internet and the World Wide Web, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claimed it had combined the browser and the operating
system in a single ``integrated'' product on the basis of consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel supported that view, voting 2-1 in Tuesday's
ruling that it was ``inclined to conclude'' that the combined
operating system and browser was a ``genuine integration''
permitted under the 1995 consent decree at the heart of that case.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Justice Department had not shown a ``reasonable
probability of success on the merits,'' the appeals panel decided
unanimously to cancel a preliminary injunction issued in December
by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that required
Microsoft to offer computer makers a browserless version of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It also was unanimous in vacating Jackson's decision to refer
the case to a special master, saying it found the case ``devoid''
of anything ``remotely `exceptional''' to trigger that procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuke to Jackson, the appeals court said his decision to
refer the case to Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig was
``either a clear abuse of discretion or an exercise of wholly
non-existent discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the appeals court had tentatively suspended Lessig's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday Lessig said, ``This is an extremely
difficult case, and I am grateful to both sides for the patience
and respect that they showed me during the brief time that I worked
with them on this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges did not rule on Microsoft's claim that
Lessig was biased against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most heartening to Microsoft, however, was that the ruling went
far beyond those procedural questions to scrutinize major issues of
product design and the proper role of courts _ issues at the heart
of the case filed last month.
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the appeals ruling will be an ``important and
weighty authority in guiding the trial court,'' Bill Neukom,
Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs,
told reporters and analysts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out passages in the ruling that he said supported two
of Microsoft's most important points: that the law should encourage
innovation and integration in pursuit of better products for
consumers, and that courts should generally avoid interfering in
such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of
having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of
technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust
law,'' the panel said in one passage that Neukom took care to point
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a validation of the company's legal right to continue
to do what it has been doing,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Browser rival Netscape Communications issued a statement late
Tuesday stressing that the ruling ``most certainly did not decide
the broad antitrust case'' filed last month and echoing the Justice
Department's view that Microsoft would ultimately lose that case.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., antitrust expert Phil O'Neill said the
government would likely seize on a portion of the dissenting
opinion in which the judge outlined an alternative view that she
said the two other judges hadn't adequately considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's basically saying ... `Since I am able to come up with an
equally plausible construction, you ought to wait until the
fact-finding is done before you declare the game over,''' O'Neill
said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill agreed that overall, the ruling was a ``huge
victory'' for Microsoft, both symbolically and practically, and
predicted that Jackson would ``probably read this thing 100 times''
in weighing the next case, scheduled for trial on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said (to the lower court judge), `You got
nothing right here,''' O'Neill said. ``He's got to be pretty
discouraged by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the appeals ruling was replete with nuggets that looked
like gold to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated version of Windows and Internet Explorer offers
more functionality than the sum of the two products separately, it
said, adding, ``This strikes us as an essential point.''
</P>
<P>
   And the integration must logically be done by Microsoft; it
would be ``absurdly inefficient'' for computer makers or end users
to do it, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested in several places that courts should try to stay
out of the way, noting at one point, ``Courts are ill equipped to
evaluate the benefits of high-tech product design.''
</P>
<P>
   It even questioned the value of pursuing the consent-decree
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of our interpretation of the consent decree, tentative
though it be, the Department (of Justice) may well regard further
pursuit of the case as unpromising,'' the panel said, ``especially
given the alternate avenues developing in its recently launched
separate attacks on Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those avenues lead anywhere is also far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cuts the legs out from under the Justice Department on
their new case,'' Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust office, told the New York Times.
``It's potentially devastating.''

GROUP MOVES TO BLOCK REFUSAL TO LIST GOSHAWK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing more than 300 scientific reports that back them up,
environmentalists moved Tuesday in federal court to reverse the
federal government's refusal to list the Northern goshawk as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what she called the ``best available science,'' U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service Director Jamie Rappaport Clark said she
believes her refusal Monday to protect the goshawk will _ on the
third try _ stand up in court.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before, a federal judge in Tucson has struck down similar
refusals by Clark's agency to place the goshawk on the endangered
species list, and twice the judge has ordered the federal
government to redo its studies.
</P>
<P>
   Clark called her agency's most recent study the first analysis
of goshawks throughout the West. She said her biologists were
unanimous in their recommendations. Their review showed there are
nearly 3,200 goshawk territories in the 11 Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the best available data provided to our scientists,
we found no conclusive evidence of a declining population trend for
the goshawk in the forested West,'' said Clark, a biologist who
took over the agency last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would put any one and every one of those biologists on the
stand to defend their recommendations,'' she said during a
nationwide conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   They'll likely get their chance, said Kieran Suckling, executive
director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, which
immediately filed notice in federal court of its intent to block
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a more outrageous squashing of an endangered
species than this decision,'' said Suckling, whose Tucson group and
six other environmental organizations first petitioned the
government to list the goshawk in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Suckling said he has compiled 360 studies documenting the
virtual disappearance of goshawks from forests in Southern
California and western Oregon and Washington, as well as their
decline in Arizona, New Mexico and Idaho near Yellowstone National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Suckling also disagreed with Clark's assertion that goshawks are
not dependent on old-growth forests, those few remaining areas not
already logged at least once that are favored by many endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just incredible. There are literally dozens of studies
that show that goshawks are closely associated with old-growth
forests. That is so off the wall that I don't think we'll have any
trouble convincing a judge that this decision was just politics,
through and through,'' Suckling said.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Wildlife also refused to list the goshawk as endangered
in 1992 and 1996. Both times the agency was overruled by senior
Judge Richard Bilby of the U.S. District Court in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent ruling last year, Bilby chastised the Fish
and Wildlife Service goshawk decisions as ``arbitrary, capricious
and unlawful'' and ``an abuse of (Fish and Wildlife's)
discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said her decision not to list the goshawk was based, in
part, on new guidelines by the U.S. Forest Service designed to
prevent logging _ especially clear-cuts _ from eliminating goshawk
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Arizona Game and Fish Department argued in a
150-page report that those Forest Service guidelines actually would
devastate forest habitats in Arizona, especially north of the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish predicted that the Forest Service policy would
enable timber companies to eliminate old-growth and result in
forests of small, young, fire-prone trees.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a University of Arizona ecologist, Martin
Taylor, concluded in a report that, since the Forest Service
guideline took effect in 1992, ``goshawk populations have declined
sharply in the south and central West,'' and the goshawk should be
protected as endangered. &QL;

AT&AMP;T REPORTEDLY NEAR DEAL TO ACQUIRE TCI
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The AT&AMP;T Corp. is close to an agreement to acquire
the nation's second-largest cable television operator in a deal
that could sharply expand AT&AMP;T's ability to provide Internet access
and local telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. is expected
to be worth at least $25 billion in stock. A final agreement had
not been reached late Tuesday night, but a deal could be announced
as soon as Wednesday, an executive close to TCI and an official who
had been briefed on the talks said on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is seeking to acquire only Tele-Communications cable
properties, which connect to homes, not its programming unit, which
creates television programs, said a person close to
Tele-Communications. Tele-Communications' programming unit, Liberty
Media, already trades as a separate stock. Its ultimate fate is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is prepared to pay about $50 in stock for each share of
Tele-Communications' stock, one source said. That would represent a
premium of more than 28 percent to Tele-Communications' closing
stock price of $38.6875 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A merger between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications would be the
biggest sign yet that trying to deliver high-speed access to the
Internet and other advanced services is one of the strongest
imperatives in today's business world. In recent years, the
Internet has emerged as a new sort of media that could rival radio
and television in its impact on the nation's economy and culture.
The technological bottleneck that has kept cyberspace from becoming
a true mass media has been the difficulty in transmitting large
amounts of digital data to everyday homes.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers gain access to the Internet at speeds a mere fraction
of those available to people in modern offices. That has kept the
process of linking to cyberspace a relatively awkward procedure in
some ways akin to using a ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   But by acquiring Tele-Communications, which serves 14.4 million
customers, AT&AMP;T would gain direct access to homes and apartments
for the first time since the company spun off its local telephone
operations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Although new telecommunications carriers boast more advanced
networks, AT&AMP;T retains a vast capacity to transmit information of
all sorts from coast to coast at lightning speeds.
</P>
<P>
   By merging with Tele-Communications, which is known as TCI, and
gaining its many wires into homes, AT&AMP;T would acquire an ability to
bypass its own ornery progeny, the Baby Bell local phone companies.
That could allow AT&AMP;T to create an end-to-end network that would
allow the company to deliver not only Internet data but also
everyday phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The technology to transmit phone calls over cable television
networks is not fully mature. The technical obstacles to creating
such a system on a mass basis would be formidable. But many
technology experts believe that allowing people to talk through
their television system is a goal well within the reach of
companies with the financial muscle of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   With their control of the copper telephone wires that stretch
into most every home and apartment, the Bells have appeared to have
an advantage in some ways over long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T
and MCI Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 cleared the way for the Bells
to enter the long-distance market once they convinced regulators
that they had opened their local networks to potential competitors.
Likewise, long-distance telephone companies won the right to
compete in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells have not yet won approval to offer long-distance
service, but were they to gain the go-ahead, they could be expected
to win large chunks of the long-distance market away from
traditional long-distance carriers by buying long-distance capacity
in bulk and reselling it at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T, however, would face the huge
cost of building elements of local networks on their own. Indeed,
AT&AMP;T agreed in January to acquire Teleport Commmunications Group
Inc., a competitive local phone company, for $11.3 billion in a bid
to jump-start that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about a possible alliance between AT&AMP;T and a major
cable company has been rife in the industry for months and caused
cable stocks to rise sharply on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tele-Communications rose $3, to $38.6875; Cablevision Systems
rose $7.25, to $62;, Media One Group Inc. gained $2.125, to a
record of $41.25; Cox Communications increased $1.75, to $46.25,
Comcast was up $2.375 to a record $39.75.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry has been spending billions of dollars to
upgrade its lines to offer more data options at faster speeds. TCI
in particular has been busy upgrading the capacity and speed of its
cable systems. TCI is one of the leading companies behind At Home,
the cable industry's broadest venture to offer high-speed Internet
access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone and cable television industries have been locked
in a battle over which sector would be first to provide high-speed
Internet access to consumers.

PHILLIES FLATTEN RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-PHILLIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How soon we forget from whence Derek Lowe has come. Maybe we
simply expect too much.
</P>
<P>
   Inexperience again haunted the Red Sox rookie righthander in a
3-2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies Tuesday night at Fenway Park.
Seeking his first victory since June 23, 1997, Lowe was given a 2-0
lead in the fifth inning. But it wasn't to be as he coughed up
three runs in the sixth. Like butter sliding down a stack of
pancakes, Lowe melted. And now he is 0-6 in nine starts this
season. It all happened so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   First he gave up a solo home run to Scott Rolen, which is no
disgrace. But after getting the next two batters, he allowed four
straight batters to reach. Two of them scored.
</P>
<P>
   That's unacceptable, even for a 25-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that,'' said Lowe. ``That's obvious. I didn't shut
them down and we lost. All I can do is blame myself. I'm the one
that's doing it. Blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to do that. Most nights it takes more than two runs to
win at Fenway. Philadelphia's Mark Portugal had as much to do with
the result as Lowe. The Sox got to him for two runs in the fifth,
but that was all he gave them in his first complete game in almost
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary and John Valentin touched Portugal for back-to-back
doubles for one run, and with one out, Valentin scored on a
perfectly executed squeeze bunt by Mike Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox threatened in the sixth, putting runners on second
and third with one out. Midre Cummings led with a single, and after
Reggie Jefferson struck out, Nomar Garciaparra doubled off the
wall. So what did Portugal do? He listened intently to pitching
coach Galen Cisco in a brief mound conference, then struck out both
Mo Vaughn and O'Leary, the heart of the Red Sox lineup these days.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Sox couldn't touch him. He retired nine of the
next 10 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (Lowe) paid close attention to what Portugual did after
Nomar got a double,'' said Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``He
didn't fool around with Vaughn and O'Leary up. He shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek is developing and growing. But I think we have to teach
him that mentality, especially if your team scores. Mostly, that
comes from experience. But it starts by having the right mentality.
Keep the momentum in your dugout. That's what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rolen's home run brought the Phillies within 2-1, Lowe got
two outs. But then he walked Bobby Abreu and hit Kevin Jordan with
a pitch. Abreu came home on a single by Mark Lewis, and Desi
Relaford brought home Jordan with a single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe finished the inning, but despite strong bullpen work by
newly acquired Carlos Reyes (two innings) and Rich Garces, the Sox
lost the second game of this unusual four-game series, which
continues tonight in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Lowe must step it up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is about wins,'' he said. ``You can have a good ERA,
but the bottom line is getting wins, and I don't have one.''

   PHOENIX _ Libby Siegling could contain her anguish no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Her wails grew louder in Maricopa County Superior Court on
Tuesday as she struggled to describe the suffering her daughter had
endured. Last year, Brian Christopher White raped and beat her
daughter and stomped on her head over and over again, leaving
imprints of his shoes on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting near Siegling was her daughter, Melissa, who once
dreamed of being a chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Father's Day, she had to have help making pancakes,'' said
Siegling, whose choked-up speech had broken down into yells and
gasps.
</P>
<P>
   Siegling apologized to Judge Barbara Jarrett three times as her
crying became more uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both the victim's and the defendant's families _ both
men and women _ sobbed throughout Tuesday's sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   White buried his face in his handcuffed hands, one of which
clutched a a wadded white tissue. His close-cropped dark hair
showed scars of the head injuries he'd suffered as a child.
</P>
<P>
   White's family and fiancee testified that he'd never been
violent before. And White himself told the judge that he'd taken
out on Melissa the rage built up inside him from his abusive
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrett called the crime ``cruel, heinous and depraved.''
She sentenced him to 21 years in prison and lifetime probation for
attempted first-degree murder, attempted sexual assault and arson _
for burning Melissa's car.
</P>
<P>
   White met with Melissa last June when he walked into a
``swinger's'' club called Encounters, in an industrial area near
30th and Clarendon avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, a waitress at the Phoenix club, recognized White from
junior high school. Witnesses told police they saw Melissa talking
to an obviously drunk man with whom she later left in her car.
</P>
<P>
   When White demanded sex, Melissa refused and pulled into a
parking lot, court records say. There he sexually assaulted her and
strangled her, then stomped on her head and body as many as 50
times, her mother said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White drove her to the 10800 block of West Campbell Avenue and
dumped her in an area covered with gravel and prickly-pear cactus.
Still, Melissa lived.
</P>
<P>
   A man who took his dogs out for a walk in the early morning
heard her groans and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   After almost slipping away three times, she came out of a coma
after two weeks in the hospital. Since then, Melissa has undergone
numerous surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she walked haltingly before the judge and read some
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still cannot understand why someone would do something like
that to me,'' said Melissa, 21, who cannot remember any details of
the night. ``I struggle daily to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   She began to cry, but no tears came because her ducts no longer
function. She's lost feeling in her left leg, and has lost much of
her ability to retain memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hold on so tight to my memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Siegling said, she drills Melissa on questions to answer
for job interviews, but her daughter can't remember the questions
from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa works 16 hours a week at a discount department store,
the only job she's been able to get, her stepfather said. He said
he quit his job at Intel due to depression.
</P>
<P>
   He's also had to prevent his wife from killing herself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White's lawyer, Michael Hruby, asked that his client be given
the minimum sentence of 15 years. White's sister, mother and
stepfather tearfully testified to the abuse the boy suffered at the
hands of his drunken parents. As they spoke, White cried, rocked
back and forth in his chair and hung his head.
</P>
<P>
   Before being sentenced, White, 23, told the judge he was sorry.
He didn't ask for mercy, but blamed his problems on alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the crime, he said, his older brother told him
that he had assaulted him as a child. That pushed him over the
edge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to live anymore,'' White said. ``I was trying to
drink myself to death. . . . She didn't deserve anything I did to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Melissa to know I will spend the rest of my life trying
to make up for what I did.'' &QL;

CALIFORNIA ECONOMY TO CONTINUE ON A ROLL, UCLA SURVEY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California's economy, robust enough to shrug off
a withering financial calamity in Asia, should continue on a strong
growth curve through 2000, according to a widely watched survey.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly projection by the UCLA Anderson Forecast, to be
released today, predicts that job gains in the state through 2000
will rival the strongest spurts of the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And it concludes that, during the first five months this year,
Southern California's economy grew at a brisker clip than Northern
California's for the first time in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly heartening to us is the strong expansion in
Southern California, which is now growing apace with the San
Francisco Bay Area,'' said Tom Lieser, the forecasting project's
executive director and author of the California report.
</P>
<P>
   Through 2000, the number of jobs in the state will grow at a 2.8
percent rate by about 370,000 annually, gains in real income will
average about 4 percent, and the unemployment rate will fall to 5.4
percent, the university's economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Every sector should add jobs, with especially strong
performances turned in by the apparel industry, businesses services
and the tourism and amusement industries.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that government figures indicate employment in
the entertainment industry stopped expanding in 1997 and so far
this year as corporate jobs were shed to cut costs. But official
surveys, such as the monthly poll conducted by the state and
federal government, underestimate what is happening outside the
corporate realm, the UCLA report says.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA economists estimate that employment in motion pictures and
television has reached 170,000 jobs, with an additional 20,000
likely over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone of this forecast is very much the tone we had back in
April,'' said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California
Department of Finance. ``It's a perfectly reasonable outlook, and
it's one that has a good chance of coming true.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA said the public sector's balance sheet is the best way to
gauge private sector performance. By that measure, things are going
well, as evident in the state government's $4.4 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The state is even weathering the roiling financial crisis in
Asia, the UCLA report noted.
</P>
<P>
   While exports to six Asian countries fell a combined $1.8
billion during the past four quarters, that drop was more than
offset by gains in exports to Mexico, the Netherlands, Australia
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakness of export trade with Asia (has) been surprisingly
mild in reports for the second half of 1997, when the turmoil was
perhaps most intense,'' Lieser said. ``The concern over Japan is
(still) warranted because if anything could kill California it
would be a worsening of our business with Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., said the Asian economic cycle could still do
some damage in the Golden State before running its course. So far,
the crisis has caused more financial pain in the Central Valley
farm industry and Northern California's high-tech sector than in
the Southland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Asia is unfolding in slow-motion fashion,'' Kyser
said. ``Right now, though, everything looks good for California.
We've had a whole lot of green lights, but I have seen an
occasional yellow caution out there we have to be very aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights of the UCLA Anderson Forecast as the
state heads into the next century:
</P>
<P>
   --Despite a harsh winter, construction employment rose by 10
percent over the past 12 months. About 60,000 new construction jobs
should be added over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   --The apparel industry continues to add jobs despite pressure
from lower-wage areas, primarily Mexico. These jobs, which are
concentrated in the Los Angeles area, should grow by 5 percent this
year and next.
</P>
<P>
   --While the aerospace industry has experienced job losses, it
still attracts lots of subcontract work and should continue to gain
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   --The growth of high-technology electronics jobs, which grew by
19 percent between 1995 and 1997, has rapidly slowed. The forecast
is for annual growth rates of 3.4 percent, 2.3 percent and 1.7
percent from now through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   --Business services are the giant of California industries, with
more than 1.1 million jobs. The number of these jobs will expand by
nearly 6 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   --Wholesale and retail trade will be a strong growth sector.
Total employment will rise 2.7 percent through 2000.

SIGN COMPANY CUTS OFF IMMIGRATION MESSAGE NEAR ARIZONA BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A controversial California bill board near the Arizona state
line was removed Tuesday for fear of a violent clash between those
who despise its message and others who applaud it.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard issued this warning to westbound motorists on
Interstate 10 near the desert town of Blythe: ``Welcome to
California, the illegal immigrant state. Don't let this happen to
your state.''
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona Republic story about a Hispanic activist's plan to
protest the message generated dozens of phone calls Tuesday, most
of them favoring the billboard and advocat ing a crackdown on
illegal immigra tion in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the owner of the billboard, Martin Media, removed the sign
Tuesday morning because of con cerns about a violent reaction to
the planned protest by activist Mario Obledo. Obledo had been so in
censed by that message that he vowed to deface or destroy the
billboard Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County-based Cali fornia Coalition for Immigration
Reform, which had leased the billboard for the message, had planned
to bus people to the site to protect the sign.
</P>
<P>
   That left California law enforce ment authorities nervously
bracing for a possible physical confrontation in the desert. Obledo
said that he had even contacted California Gov. Pete Wilson and
requested that the National Guard be put on alert.
</P>
<P>
   As people in both states learned of the billboard and Obledo's
planned assault upon it, the Sacra mento lawyer received calls from
dozens of supporters who planned to join him.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis may have been averted by Martin Media's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much believe in free speech,'' said Connie Wauhob, the
company's general manager, from the firm's office in Bullhead City.
``But our property was being threat ened.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Media received letters, faxes and telephone calls from
around the nation condemning as un-American both the sign and the
decision to take it down, Wauhob said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin had to draw the line,'' she said. ``We did it to
protect our property, our lessors' property and our other
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Its
toll-free number apparently had been flooded with phone calls after
the story in Monday's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo was jubilant after the sign's removal. He said he may
still stage a peaceful gathering at the site Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for America, against hatred, division and
racism,'' he said. ``I don't think these signs have a place in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   A revered Hispanic political fig ure, Obledo was awarded the
Medal of Freedom _ the nation's highest civilian honor _ by
President Clinton on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the coalition vowed Tuesday to travel to the desert
Saturday and attempt to resurrect the sign. During an appearance on
a Los Angeles radio show Tuesday, a representative of the group
threat ened to sue Martin Media for breaking the lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the approximately 40 calls that the Republic
received Monday, Arizonans either loved the billboard or hated it.
About two-thirds of the callers spoke out in favor of the billboard
and criticized Obledo.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hispanics were divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand how some one could put up a sign like that
and not expect to get criticism,'' said Ed Ceniceros of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Ceniceros, who judged the bill board to be aimed at Hispanics,
called it a ``hate sign'' that was ``absolutely racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Others feared that the sign's message was something best kept
out of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs to be stopped right now, before the hatred spreads
over here,'' said Rene Gurrola of Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   But some thought the message was exactly what Arizonans needed
to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here and take, take, take,'' said Alex Chavez of
Phoenix. ``Then they put the United States down.''
</P>
<P>
   And those divisions remained after the sign's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sign was tacky,'' said a Mexican immigrant and
legal resident who wished to remain anonymous. ``It's good that
they took it down but the damage has already been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a right to your feelings but you should think of
other people's feelings before you express them in such a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who had rallied around the billboard were outraged by its
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in defiance of the First Amendment,'' said a caller
who also wished to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``To remove something just be cause someone objects to it is
just not right.'' &QL;

LA NINA'S DRY FALL, WINTER MAY BRING FIERY NIGHTMARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sick of the lingering drizzle and rain? Good,
because long-range forecasts show we may be in for a dry fall and
winter, courtesy of El Nino's evil twin -- La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   After months of debate among meteorologists, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the arrival this
fall of La Nina, a global weather phenomenon that usually cuts Los
Angeles' winter rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   And officials say they are worried that El Nino's bounty -- the
lush grasses and brush -- could herald an ugly fire season. A dry
fall and winter, officials warn, could prolong the current fire
season and prime Southern California for truly disastrous blazes in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If La Nina brings minimal rainfall, there's going to be
minimal moisture in the plants, they're going to dry out faster and
it's going to be a tough season,'' said Capt. Paul Quagliata,
commander of the Los Angeles Fire Department's brush clearance
program.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina will not have any effect on summer weather, but her
touch should be felt this winter, as forecasters say it already is
forming in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is, in a sense, the anti-El Nino. While her better-known
brother is fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern equatorial
Pacific, La Nina starts with cold water in the same location.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino brings warm winters to the United States, La Nina cold.
And while a strong El Nino can douse Los Angeles with twice its
normal rainfall, La Nina usually gives the area dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   Just how dry is hard to predict. The last La Nina, in 1995-96,
brought Los Angeles about two-thirds of its normal rainfall, said
meteorologist Gerald Bell, with NOAA's climate prediction center.
Points north of Santa Maria received their usual dose of rain,
while those closer to Mexico got just a fraction of the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``With extreme (La Ninas) you see drought,'' Bell said. ``But
that doesn't mean, in any sense, that we're going to have a drought
this time just because we're going to get a La Nina.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is more than academic. Even before La Nina reared
her head, officials had reason to fear this year's fire season,
which started last week. Although the unusually wet spring kept
fire danger at bay longer than usual, the rain drove plants into a
frenzy of growth, churning out fuel for future wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stuff growing where it's never grown before,''
Quagliata said.
</P>
<P>
   The dense, thick brush that fuels the most damaging fires will
take months to dry out. But if La Nina shrivels up the plants'
water supply next winter, the following summer could potentially
bring large and intense blazes.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern has played itself out before, when dry winters have
followed rainy ones, said Robert Martines, with the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old saying that with the wet winters, it's not the
next year that's bad, it's the one after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martines' department has stationed an extra
water-tanker plane in Hemet, it has not taken any other unusual El
Nino-inspired precautions to prepare for the fire season. Neither
have the Los Angeles city or county fire departments. All say it is
difficult to plan so early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you rock and roll with the weather's
punches,'' Martines said.

LAKERS BUSY ON PHONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will the Los Angeles Lakers once again upstage the
Clippers, even on draft day?
</P>
<P>
   No other team was busier Tuesday than the Lakers, according to
several sources, who said the team was enthusiastically working the
phones in an attempt to work a deal by today's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, the site of the draft, was buzzing with talk that the
Lakers were offering Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel and Elden Campbell
to the Grizzlies, if point guard Mike Bibby is available at the No.
2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, the Lakers have made a similar offer to
the Clippers, who own the draft's top pick. Vancouver general
manager Stu Jackson denied that a trade would be made with the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers would never do that for the No. 2 pick,'' Jackson
said. ``Someone's sabotaging the Laker organization if they would
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers did not respond to several messages seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have also reportedly offered Campbell and Van Exel to
the Washington Wizards for small forward Juwan Howard.
</P>
<P>
   A deal of some sort seems likely, because of the Lakers' desire
to rid themselves of Van Exel, who has been in and out of the
doghouse for the past three seasons. The Boston Celtics have
reportedly turned down an offer of Van Exel straight up for
ex-Laker Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some possibilities to move up (in the draft), and it
has to make sense,'' Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said.
``Obviously, we've run across nothing to date that makes sense,
because we haven't done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In order for Vancouver to swing the deal with the Lakers, they
would need the Clippers to pass on Bibby with the top pick and
instead select Pacific center Michael Olowokandi. That seemed at
least a 50-50 prospect Tuesday, as the Clippers have taken a more
serious look at Olowokandi, who is considered to have the most
potential of any player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers brought Olowokandi in for a second workout last
weekend, dragging him all the way across the country from a Friday
workout in Boston. This has fueled growing speculation that they
will pass on Bibby, who seemed certain to be the pick for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, for one, continued to lobby for the idea that
Olowokandi is just too good for any team _ including the Clippers _
to pass up. Of course, some of this might be the normal smoke
screens teams try to put up to hide their player preferences. But
the Bibby camp does appear to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's agent, David Falk, had lunch with Clippers owner Donald
Sterling on Tuesday and Falk has made it known he wants Bibby in
Los Angeles. It's doubtful they would have met if the Clippers had
already decided to select Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers definitely don't want to upset Falk. He also
represents Michael Jordan, Howard, Alonzo Mourning and Allen
Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Falk instructed Bibby not to answer questions regarding specific
cities during a Tuesday press conference, an order that was not in
place on Monday, when Bibby freely answered questions in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers just might feel that Olowokandi is too much to pass
up, even if it takes a year or two for him to develop. Especially
when free-agent center Isaac Austin is not certainty to return next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the Clippers vice president of basketball
operations, said he has received a lot of phone calls regarding the
top pick. And in Sacramento, there were reports the Kings offered
Chris Webber and the No. 7pick in exchange for the Clippers' top
pick.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a lot of intrigue for a draft that is devoid
of a franchise player, or even a consensus No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique draft,'' Boston coach Rick Pitino said.
``Normally, you know 1 through 5 or 1 through 8. But 10 could be as
good as 1 and 12 could be as good as 2. I see a big dropoff after
13.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

RED CROSS CALLING FOR BLOOD  -- AND LOTS OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hoping to thwart what may be the worst summer
blood shortage in 10 years, the American Red Cross has issued an
emergency appeal for donations, especially type O blood.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California officials said regional blood centers are
reporting less than a day's supply of O-negative and a
day-and-a-half supply of O-positive. The agency usually maintains
10 days' worth of type-O blood, which half the population has and
is the one most often used in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   If the agency doesn't receive more donations, area hospitals may
cancel elective surgeries and may have trouble responding to
emergency traumas such as car crashes during the long July Fourth
weekend, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a severe blood shortage,'' said Cheryle Babbitt,
managing director of donor services for American Red Cross Blood
Services, Southern California Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fortunate to avoid serious blood shortages in
June and July in past years,'' Babbitt said Tuesday. ``That's not
happening this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood supplies drop 50 percent during the summer and holidays
because donors are busy or out of town on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the agency has not received reports of canceled medical
procedures from the more than 150 hospitals it serves in Los
Angeles and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in suburban Woodland Hills,
however, doctors worry that the depleted supplies soon will affect
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Red Cross says they're hurting for blood, it's just a
matter of time before it ripples through to us,'' said Dr. Michael
Kanter, director of the center's blood bank.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, donations are expected to be hit especially hard
because of the Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the upcoming July Fourth holiday and the long holiday
weekend, we're concerned that donations will be way off,'' said Dr.
Ross Herron, medical director of Red Cross Blood Services, Southern
California Region. ``That could spell trouble for the beginning of
July and the remainder of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's shortage also is exacerbated by the area's
dependence on out-of-state blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the region's supplies are imported from
other parts of the country, Babbitt said. But a majority of Red
Cross blood centers nationwide are reporting less than a
day-and-a-half supply of O-negative blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing blood in from other parts of the country is OK until
something goes wrong,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   To increase blood supplies, the organization is calling past
donors and asking corporations and civic organizations to host
blood drives. Babbitt said the agency needs at least 100 more such
blood drives in July to replenish depleted supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Herron said donating blood could save the lives not only of
car-crash victims but those who have chronic health problems and
depend on transfusions to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know whether your mother or son or daughter may be a
trauma patient,'' Herron said. ``You might need blood, and you want
to be able to contribute to the blood supply of your community.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FACTS: To give blood, donors must be 17 years of age or
older, weigh at least 110 pounds, be in good health and not be at
risk for HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   To donate blood to the Red Cross, call (800) GIVE-LIFE.
Donations also can be made at Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills
by calling (818) 719-4329.

DOG'S WAGS-TO-RICHES STORY TAKES HIM FROM SHELTER TO SHOW BIZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For the co-star of Eddie Murphy's new movie,
``Dr. Dolittle,'' acting is all animal instinct -- and a generous
helping of liver-flavored biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy, a 5-year-old terrier mix rescued from the East Valley
Animal Shelter in North Hollywood three years ago, stars as Lucky,
a mutt who teaches Murphy's character how to recapture the ability
to communicate with animals, a skill he lost as a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy loves to work,'' said trainer Mark Forbes, with whom
Sammy lives when he's not working. ``He's so eager, he's almost
overeager. He wants to please you so bad. And he'll do anything for
a liver treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy, picked up as a stray, was rescued from the shelter by
fellow trainer Roger Shumacher. Both Shumacher and Forbes work for
Gary Gero's Birds and Animals Unlimited of El Toro in neighboring
Orange County, which provides trained animals for movies,
television shows and commercials, plus live shows at Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get 75 to 80 percent of our dogs from shelters; most of the
animal movie companies do,'' Forbes said. ``Sometimes we'll go to a
breeder if a show wants a very specific breed, but most shows want
just an average, everyday kind of dog. And shelter dogs need a home
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Gini Barrett, director of the Western Regional Office of the
American Humane Association, which oversees and safeguards animal
actors, said some of the best actors -- as well as some of the best
pets -- come from shelters. More than 255,000 dogs and cats are
housed annually at public and private shelters in Los Angeles
County, and 67 percent of those are euthanized because no one
adopts them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about a dog that's been either on the
streets or in the shelter,'' Barrett said. ``They're sensitive
creatures. They understand fear and danger and abandonment and
sadness. And when you're the person who took them from that danger,
there's a bonding there that's pretty special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most animals, particularly dogs, love to work, and they say:
You saved me and you want me to shake hands for you? You got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the motion-picture industry is the perfect life for
such a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   What is there about a shelter dog that catches a movie animal
trainer's eye?
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for a !ital!look!off!, but more for an attitude,''
Forbes said. ``And shelter dogs, if they're strays, have been out
in the world. A lot of the time, they're really street-smart, which
works well for films.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shumacher visited the shelter, Sammy dashed right up and
stuck out his paw, Forbes said. On the grassy area outside the
cages, he romped and played, signs that he'd be amenable to
training.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, a sheltie mix who also appears in ``Dr. Dolittle'' and
whose voice is supplied by Ellen DeGeneres, also is a rescued dog
``with the cutest little face,'' adopted by Forbes from the
suburban Baldwin Park shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was in a cage with two bigger dogs that were beating her
up, he said. ``We put her with another dog more her size, and she
got over being scared and learned to play and turned out to be a
great dog for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other films in which computer animation is used to make
it seem that animals are talking, visual-effects supervisor Jon
Farhat wanted animals that would move their mouths on cue, making
their ``speech'' a more natural starting point for computer
imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy was the first one to try. Forbes found a spot on the dog's
jaw that, when pressed, would prompt Sammy to open his mouth; at
the same time, Forbes would give the command, ``Talk.'' Then Sammy
would get a liver-biscuit treat.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a mere touch would make Sammy open up, and with a bit more
training, the dog learned to open and close his mouth on no more
than a verbal command.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Sammy's voice is provided by comedian Norm
Macdonald, whose sarcastic delivery fits Lucky's character. His
first line, after being run down by Dr. Dolittle's car: ``Watch
where you're goin', bonehead!''

<P>
   AIDS-REPORT (Geneva) _ AIDS infection rates worldwide are far
worse than previously believed, particularly in parts of Africa
where as many as one in four adults has the virus, according to a
U.N. report. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CLINTON (Beijing) _ At home, President Clinton's fortunes
may wax and wane, but here on the eve of his first state visit to
China, he is already a star. Not only in the official press but
also among elements of the intelligentsia, he is being lionized as
a great statesman who had the wisdom to change his mind about
China. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PIRACY (Shanghai) _ The authorities have begun a crackdown
on many of the illegal activities that are ordinarily tolerated
these days, like the sale of pirated video and music compact disks.
The fight against piracy of software, music and movies, an issue
that loomed large in China-U.S. relations a few years ago, has been
pushed in the background and is unlikely to be raised seriously
during President Clinton's visit, even though it remains as rampant
a problem as ever. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ The Clinton administration has
tried to minimize its direct involvement in Asia's economic crisis,
pulling strings at the International Monetary Fund, sending out
envoys to cajole foreign leaders and avoiding the lead role
Washington took when it saved Mexico from economic implosion in
1995. But as President Clinton prepares to leave for China, the
Asian crisis, in the words of one of Clinton's top aides, is
becoming ``worse and worse every day,'' and it is becoming far more
difficult for the leader of the world's largest economy to deal
with it at a distance. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ALBANIANS (Klina, Serbia) _ In recent days the rebels have
changed their strategy and begun to attack and kidnap Serbian
civilians in an apparent effort to drive them out of their villages
in the overwhelmingly Albanian province of Kosovo in southern
Serbia. Until now the rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has
avoided attacking Serbian civilians, despite the deaths of scores
of ethnic Albanian civilians, including more than 20 children. But
in the last few days, five Serbian villages and many small hamlets
and farms in the agricultural region around Klina have been seized
by armed rebels. By Chris Hedges.

most persuasive evidence yet that birds evolved directly from
small, meat-eating dinosaurs. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   REPORTERS-PROSECUTORS (Undated) _ It is one of the least talked
about corners of journalism: the relationship of reporters and
their prosecution sources. But the debate in recent days over how
much and what kind of information the independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr gave reporters about his investigation of the president
has put an uncomfortable spotlight on the ties between journalists
and prosecutors, which often lead to information, and sometimes, to
misinformation. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-FIRES (Miami) _ Desert-like dryness and heat have led to one
of the worst outbreaks of wildfires in Florida in more than 50
years. The blazes have destroyed more than 100 homes and
structures, damaged an estimated $10 million in commercial timber
and left a smoky haze in cities such as Jacksonville, Daytona
Beach, Tallahassee and Orlando. The dry conditions have caused an
additional $100 million in damage to corn, hay, soybean,
watermelon, peanut, cotton and tobacco crops. By Mireya Navarro.

<P>
   CHINA-MISSILES _ Inside a command bunker at a launch center in
southern China, U.S. military monitors watched a Chinese rocket
streak toward space carrying a $200 million American communications
satellite. But 22 seconds after liftoff on Feb. 15, 1996, the Long
March rocket exploded, showering fiery debris, burning fuel and
chaos on a nearby Chinese village, where by American accounts as
many as 200 civilians were killed. For five hours, Chinese
authorities barred them from rushing to the crash site, purportedly
for their own safety. When the Americans finally reached the area
and opened the satellite's battered but intact control box, a
supersecret encoded circuit board was missing. Now congressional
investigators are asking whether there could be any explanation for
the missing technology other than that the Chinese took it. By Eric
Schmitt.

any investor who owns small-capitalization stocks. He will tell you
that the old saw about bull markets levitating all stocks no longer

   TEMP-EXECS _ Not everyone wants the typical trappings that come
with lengthy tenure in the upper reaches of corporate America. Many
executives, no longer enamored of steady management jobs, are
signing up to be, in effect, temps. By Adam Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   GM-MEXICO (Matamoros, Mexico) _ GM's shift of production from
Flint and Saginaw to this border city facing Brownsville, Texas,
was part of a sweeping 20-year transfer of its U.S auto parts
industry south across the border. Since 1978, GM has built more
than 50 parts factories in Mexico, which today employ 72,000
workers, making its auto parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive
Services, Mexico's largest private employer. Many other American
companies, of course, have also moved plants to Mexico. By Sam
Dillon.

   COOKING-SCHOOLS (New York) _ A pile of carrots, turnips, onions,
shallots, lettuce leaves and potatoes lay on a stainless-steel
table at the French Culinary Institute's teaching kitchen. My
mission, on this first day of La Technique, the institute's basic
course for amateur chefs, was to turn those vegetables into
textbook examples of the basic French cuts. My goal was to test the
basic-skill courses offered by New York's top cooking schools: the
French Culinary Institute, Peter Kump's School of Culinary Arts and
the culinary arts division of the New School. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING-CIA (New York) _ It used to be that if you wanted to
become a chef, you were expected to go to cooking school in Paris.
There you learned classic technique, the organization of the French
kitchen, and discipline under the critical eye of French
instructors. And when you returned to America, you were practically
guaranteed to land a job at a top restaurant. But over the last
decade, the culinary world changed. Cuisines fused, and American
kitchens were transformed from French food factories into dens of
creativity. Nowhere is the break with the past clearer than in a
comparison of the most influential school in the United States, the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., with its
counterpart in France, Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING-GRADS (New York) _ By the time Matthew Laux completed a
two-year program last March at the New England Culinary Institute _
after paying nearly $40,000 for an education that encompasses all
aspects of the food service industry _ he had earned his reward: a
job at Trois Jean, a New York bistro, where he peeled and chopped
vegetables 12 hours a day, six days a week. For this, he received
the munificent sum of $65 a shift. The food service industry is
booming nationally, and students who complete a culinary school
education will almost certainly have a career ahead of them. But
they may not have a life. By Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CIPRIANI (New York) _ To most New Yorkers, the name Cipriani
means just the boutique restaurant in the Sherry-Netherland that
his father, Arrigo, opened in 1985 and where they serve the Bellini
cocktails invented at Harry's Bar in Venice (started by Giuseppi
Cipriani's grandfather in 1931). But that profile is about to get a
lot higher. By Florence Fabricanbt.

   WINE-OPERA (Undated) _ Using wine labels, the sommelier at
Harry's Bar in London makes collages that depict opera scenes
involving wine. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   HANMADE-MOZZARELLA (New York) _ Mezzogiorno, Tribeca Grill and
Bice are among the restaurants that want handmade, tender
mozzarella that tastes and smells as pure as it looks. They all
rely on the early morning visits of Giuseppe Cuomo, a traveling
mozzarella maker. His family has done the same for three
generations in southern Italy, and Cuomo, 52, continued the
tradition after he moved here 20 years ago. By Suzanne Hamlin.

good garlic, soups based on a meatless garlic broth are a pleasure.

DISTRICT FIRES OFFICIAL WHO SAID SCHOOL WAS BUILT ON TOXIC SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The head of the city schools' environmental
department says he was asked to resign just two days after he told
lawmakers that the district made a mistake when it built a middle
school on a toxic site.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid Arabzadeh, director of environmental health and safety,
said in interviews Monday and Tuesday that he knew his job was in
jeopardy before testifying before the Joint Legislative Audit
Committee about the placement of Jefferson Middle School in South
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that if I said anything against the district, I
would be fired -- but it was important that I tell the truth,''
Arabzadeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, who serves as chairman of
the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, is investigating whether the
resignation was sought as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely concerned that a person testified before the
committee and then shortly thereafter was terminated,'' Wildman
said. ``If in fact there is a nexus between his testimony and his
removal from the district, I would take that to be an extremely
serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting with a top official Monday afternoon, when
Arabzadeh expected to be fired, the health director said he went
out on medical leave for stress suffered from the push to have him
leave the district.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District spokesman Brad Sales said he
could not comment because it is a personnel matter.
</P>
<P>
   Wildman said district officials had told him that Arabzadeh's
departure was the result of other difficulties. But he declined to
provide details and said he and members of his committee staff
would look into the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues in the environmental health field said Arabzadeh is
well-respected and that his departure will be a loss to the
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very well-respected in his field. He is a straight
shooter who does not bow to pressure,'' said James Unmack, vice
president of technical operations for Weststates EHS Services, an
environmental consulting firm that meets regularly with Arabzadeh
as part of a working group of Los Angeles city and county
industrial health officials.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's legislative hearing, state officials said the
LAUSD's shoddy review had failed to detect contaminants in the land
under the school. Arabzadeh responded: ``I fully agree. It should
have been done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his remarks so infuriated his superiors that the next
day he was called in and presented a letter of resignation, but he
refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   In the less than six months that he has been on the job,
Arabzadeh said most of his efforts to increase efficiency or safety
have been stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Arabzadeh recommended against the purchase of a $350,000
electron microscope, which he said was unneeded. He also felt that
10 staff members whose work focused on analyzing asbestos samples
could have been better utilized examining health concerns in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said the asbestos analysis could be done for far
less money by an outside lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things they did made no sense,'' Arabzadeh said. ``Our
real work should have been in safety, but it wasn't.''

AT&AMP;T IS NEAR DEALL FOR NO. 2 COMPANY IN CABLE TV
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, refinements throughout)  (sw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The AT&AMP;T Corp. is close to an agreement to acquire
the nation's second-largest cable television operator in a deal
that could sharply expand AT&AMP;T's ability to provide Internet access
and local telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. is expected
to be worth at least $25 billion in stock. A final agreement had
not been reached late Tuesday night, but a deal could be announced
as soon as Wednesday, an executive close to Tele-Communications and
an official who had been briefed on the talks said on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is seeking to acquire only Tele-Communications' cable
properties, which connect to homes, not its programming unit, which
creates television programs, said a person close to
Tele-Communications, known as TCI. Tele-Communications' programming
unit, Liberty Media, already trades as a separate stock. Its
ultimate fate is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is prepared to pay about $50 for each share of
Tele-Communications' stock, the person said. That would represent a
premium of more than 28 percent to Tele-Communications' closing
stock price of $38.6875 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal between the two companies is likely to face a rigorous
review by regulators including the Federal Communications
Commission. If the deal wins approval, it will firmly put the stamp
of C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's new chairman, upon one of America's
most venerable corporations.
</P>
<P>
   A merger between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications would be the
biggest sign yet that trying to deliver high-speed access to the
Internet and other advanced services is one of the strongest
imperatives in today's business world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Internet has emerged as a new sort of media
that could rival radio and television in its impact on the nation's
economy and culture. The technological bottleneck that has kept
cyberspace from becoming a true mass media has been the difficulty
in transmitting large amounts of digital data to everyday homes.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers gain access to the Internet at speeds a mere fraction
of those available to people in modern offices. That has kept the
process of linking to cyberspace a relatively awkward procedure in
some ways akin to using a ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   But by acquiring Tele-Communications, which serves 14.4 million
customers, AT&AMP;T would gain direct access to homes and apartments
for the first time since the leading long-distance company spun off
its local telephone operations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the Internet to AT&AMP;T became clear last week
when news emerged that the company had engaged in preliminary
discussions to merge with America Online Inc., the nation's biggest
provider of access to cyberspace. AOL rebuffed AT&AMP;T, though the two
could still strike a marketing alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Although new telecommunications carriers boast more advanced
networks, AT&AMP;T retains a vast capacity to transmit information of
all sorts from coast to coast at lightning speeds. By merging with
Tele-Communications and gaining its many wires into homes, AT&AMP;T
would acquire an ability to bypass its own ornery progeny, the Baby
Bell local phone companies. That could allow AT&AMP;T to create an
end-to-end network that would allow the company to deliver not only
Internet data but also everyday phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   With their control of the copper telephone wires that stretch
into most every home and apartment, the Bells have appeared to have
an advantage in some ways over long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T
and MCI Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 cleared the way for the Bells
to enter the long-distance market once they convinced regulators
that they had opened their local networks to potential competitors.
Likewise, long-distance telephone companies won the right to
compete in local markets. The Bells have not yet won approval to
offer long-distance service, but were they to gain the go-ahead,
they could be expected to win large chunks of the long-distance
market away from traditional long-distance carriers by buying
long-distance capacity in bulk and reselling it at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance companies like AT&AMP;T, however, would face the huge
cost of building elements of local networks on their own. Indeed,
AT&AMP;T agreed in January to acquire Teleport Communications Group
Inc., a competitive local phone company, for $11.3 billion in a bid
to jump-start that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about a possible alliance between AT&AMP;T and a major
cable company has been rife in the industry for months and caused
cable stocks to rise sharply on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cable industry has been spending billions of dollars to
upgrade its lines to offer more data options at faster speeds. TCI
in particular has been busy upgrading the capacity and speed of its
cable systems. TCI is one of the leading companies behind At Home,
the cable industry's broadest venture to offer high-speed Internet
access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone and cable television industries have been locked
in a battle over which sector would be first to provide high-speed
Internet access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways an AT&AMP;T-Tele-Communications deal would represent a
return to a strategy tried by Tele-Communications' chief executive,
John Malone, in 1993, with a proposed merger with the Bell Atlantic
Corp. That deal later collapsed as visions of cable companies'
delivering phone service and telephone companies' delivering movies
into living rooms failed to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects TCI is responsible for the evolution of the
nation's cable system into what it is today. The company traces its
roots to 1956, when Bob Magness, a Texas Panhandle rancher, sold
some cattle to build his first cable TV system. Nine years later
Magness, who died in 1996, moved the company to Denver to serve
small towns in the Rocky Mountains and hired John Malone, a
32-year-old executive at General Instrument, to help him expand.
</P>
<P>
   The effort grew into a company with more than $7.5 billion in
annual sales and cable television operations in more than 40
states, Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico
and Spain.

MARINERS' TINKERED LINEUP COMES THROUGH FOR MOYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The lineup the Mariners put on the field Tuesday
looked a lot more like the '59 White Sox than the '27 Yankees. Five
of the starters carried batting averages of .251 or less.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a season of flailing and frustration for a club
favored to win its division. So however quirky it might have
looked, manager Lou Piniella wrote the names on a lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a different lineup out there,'' Piniella said after the
team's error-free, 5-3 victory over San Diego. Then he took a long
pause before adding, ``For what we have, this is our athletic
version.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Amaral led off, replacing left fielder Glenallen Hill, who
has four errors and who made a perplexing baserunning gaffe in the
Monday night loss to San Diego. Amaral had two stolen bases and
scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Utilityman Jeff Huson, despite hitting .178, was inserted at
second for Joey Cora, whose latest defensive lapse was a popup he
let fall in right field for two critical Padre runs Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what we do tomorrow (at second base),'' Piniella
said. ``I don't want to be pinned down to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Piniella was happy to be pinned down about his third baseman
tonight for the first of two games in San Diego. He said it would
be Russ Davis, back from the ashes after 19 errors and a four-game
benching, during which time he got some work in left field and at
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had an RBI single Tuesday but more importantly, handled
six chances at third flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'm proud of the kid,'' Piniella said. ``I was
well-pleased. He looked like a different player out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you can do that once, you can duplicate it many times
over. He's in there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Ducey also filled in for Jay Buhner in right field, as
Buhner continues to recover from the effects of having arthroscopic
knee surgery in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed a day off,'' Piniella said. ``It's going to take him
awhile to get back into condition to play with any regularity.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important contributor, however, was pitcher Jamie
Moyer, who seems to go longer the older he gets. Moyer came within
three outs of a fourth complete game and a third shutout this year,
in a career that has seen only 15 complete games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty consistent all year,'' said Moyer, who is now
5-6 but with a 3.58 ERA. ``But the wins haven't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer was devilish to the Padres through eight innings, never
facing more than four in any inning. After he allowed a leadoff
single to Tony Gwynn in the ninth and a double by Greg Vaughn,
Piniella provided the 30,961 matinee fans some comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella emerged from the dugout to talk to Moyer to ask him how
he felt. With Heathcliff Slocumb warming up, the crowd, only too
wary of the frequent bullpen atrocities, booed Piniella roundly.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted maybe a second, and when Piniella began the
retreat to the dugout, he doffed his cap, bringing down the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I step out of the dugout ... '' Piniella said,
trailing off. ``I was just having some fun, nothing more, nothing
less.''
</P>
<P>
   It got serious momentarily, when Ken Caminiti rifled a double to
score both runners. Piniella then went to get Slocumb, who promptly
allowed Wally Joyner's double and, after two outs, a single by
Carlos Hernandez that brought the go-ahead run to the plate.
Slocumb struck out pinch-hitter Walt Sweeney to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best development for Seattle was Davis, who admitted
that the left field-second base work is mostly window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knows it around here, my heart's at third
base,'' Davis said. ``That's where I belong. I really don't think
too much is going to come from that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest imposed upon him, Davis said, ``They brought in
some new faces (journeyman Rico Rossi), and I have to accept it. I
have no one to blame but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Said shortstop Alex Rodriguez, ``Russ is a good ol' Southern
boy. He works hard and has a heart of gold. Everyone is a family
member here, and you don't like to see anybody go through hard
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr.'s 29th homer in the first got the M's pointed
toward their third win in five games on the homestand. Rodriguez
had two more hits, giving him nine in his last 15 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   With five games left until the midpoint of the season, Rodriguez
has 26 homers and 18 stolen bases, which gives him a chance at the
select 40-40 club populated by only two players, Jose Canseco and
Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about that at all,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Mariner starter won't be talking, either. Randy
Johnson meets one of the National League's best, Andy Ashby.

METS DEFEAT ORIOLES, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For Bernard Gilkey, it was about time.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets' left fielder has endured a testing month. One
at-bat after snapping an 0-for-25 slide on June 12, Gilkey was hit
in the face with a fastball by Ryan Dempster of the Florida
Marlins. After singling in his first at-bat back nine days later,
Gilkey went 0 for 9. That made him 2 for 36 when he stepped to the
plate with two out and two Mets on in the seventh inning on Tuesday
night against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, who had not collected an extra-base hit since June 5,
nevertheless batted cleanup on Tuesday night, with the slumping
John Olerud taking a rare night off. And when Gilkey rapped a
two-run, opposite-field double to right off Arthur Rhodes, it
scored both runners, thrust the Mets ahead by 4-3 and sparked them
to a much-needed 6-3 victory over the Orioles at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey said he knew his luck was going to change. ``Last night,
after my last at-bat, I felt pretty close,'' he said. In that
at-bat, against Mike Mussina, Gilkey worked an 0-2 count full
before grounding out hard.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey's double on Tuesday night, which highlighted a three-run
inning, erased the 3-2 lead the Orioles had taken into the bottom
of the sixth after a 1-hour-26-minute rain delay. Not only did it
spare the Mets (40-32) from losing for the sixth time in seven
games, it kept Masato Yoshii from absorbing his third straight
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost certainly a coincidence, but since the Mets
acquired Yoshii's good friend, Hideo Nomo, from the Los Angeles
Dodgers on June 4, neither Yoshii nor Nomo has won a game for the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii lasted just three and a third innings on Tuesday night.
Not counting a two-inning stint on June 2 that was cut short in
Pittsburgh because of a severe thunderstorm, Tuesday night's outing
was Yoshii's shortest as a major leaguer. Before that start, Yoshii
was 4-1 with a 2.33 earned run average. Since the Mets traded for
Nomo, Yoshii, who is 4-3 and whose era has now risen to 3.65, has
allowed 26 hits and 17 runs in 19 innings, an 8.05 era.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nomo, who is scheduled to start Thursday night at
Shea Stadium against the Orioles, is 0-1 with a 4.50 era in three
starts with the Mets. Over all, Nomo is 2-8 with a 4.95 era, with
50 walks in 80 and two-thirds innings. And on Tuesday, a member of
another organization, one that was initially interested in
obtaining Nomo, revealed that the team had been swayed by medical
reports that Nomo had a condition similar to that of the former
Yankee prospect Eric Milton, who was found to have a
multidirectional instability in his pitching shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In layman's terms, that is basically a laxity in the shoulder,
which creates too much flexibility _ and which might be one reason
why Nomo has struggled with his control throughout this season.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said of Nomo's
condition: ``His shoulder's fine. There are absolutely no concerns
about his health. He was clocked at 92 his last game out. His
velocity's fine. Our doctors read the medical reports to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said laxity in the shoulder and pitching mechanics
``tend not to be related. And he has no more laxity than he had
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that Nomo has struggled with his
location. What is currently wrong with Yoshii, who allowed six
hits, while walking two and striking out one, is another matter
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But Manager Bobby Valentine said he relieved Yoshii so early
only because heavy rain was expected soon. ``Three runs wasn't
going to yank him from that game,'' Valentine said. ``The rain did.
I played it like it was the eighth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets' bullpen, which has had problems of its own,
finished the job just fine. Turk Wendell, Brian Bohanon, John Hudek
(1-4), and Dennis Cook all held the Orioles scoreless from the
fourth through the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   And then John Franco nailed down his 17th save in 19 attempts by
closing out the final inning, after Rey Ordonez _ who had three
hits and made another spectacular diving play at short _ had driven
in an insurance run in the top of the eighth.

SONICS LOOK TO MAKE MOST FROM LATE DRAFT PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Sonic war room during the past several NBA drafts
has been more like a pot on a cold stove _ not much stirring.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Sonics garnered relatively nothing from the
draft mostly because they usually owned a late first-round
selection. The Sonics won't find the next Gary Payton or Vin Baker
drafting that low again, but they believe they must make
Wednesday's draft count for something.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the biggest decisions don't have to be something like
``Want more coffee?'' Or ``Will it be Chinese food or pizza?'' Or
``Oh, by the way, trade out of the first round and send the pick to
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Several elite teams have proven that choosing late doesn't
necessarily sheild it from potentially good talent. Chicago
acquired the rights to Toni Kukoc early in the second round of the
1990 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Indiana's Antonio Davis, Charlotte's Bobby Phils
and the Los Angeles Lakers' Nick Van Exel are other examples of
belated draft picks who have turned into solid NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz have mastered the art of finding gems long after
the first-round hoopla has fizzled. The Jazz found Bryon Russell
with the 45th pick in 1993 and selected Shandon Anderson at No. 54
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Backup point guard Howard Eisley originally went 30th to
Minnesota in 1994. Eisley, Anderson and Russell were integral parts
of Utah's back-to-back NBA Finals run.
</P>
<P>
   The point is clear: Late does not always mean out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about this year,'' said Billy McKinney, the
Sonics' vice president of basketball operations. ``After the top
six or seven picks, (the draft) is going to be buck wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Sonics corralled Payton in 1990 have they
experienced a memorable draft day. Payton was an easy pick at No. 2
overall. Granted, teams that average 55-plus wins _ such as the
Sonics since selecting Payton _ do not have the luxury of selecting
that high.
</P>
<P>
   However, the general consensus from last month's pre-draft camp
in Chicago is that teams selecting in the lottery slots (1-11)
probably won't hit the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large middle ground in this draft, and the list
starts before the 10th pick is consummated. That is good for the
Sonics, who pick 27th in the first round and 32nd and 33rd in the
second. It is bad news for teams seeking a quick fix; this year's
crop is considered bland even at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona point guard Mike Bibby is expected to be taken first.
But even though he is the most skilled player in the draft, the Los
Angeles Clippers have not guaranteed they will make Bibby the No. 1
pick.
</P>
<P>
   If Bibby isn't the first pick, almost certainly it will be
Michael Olowokandi. The 7-foot-1 center from the University of the
Pacific is a project who took up the game only three years ago.
Olowokandi played only one productive season.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Olowokandi nor Bibby are considered ``impact players,''
which have been virtually assured in the top 10 of most drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in the (Clippers') shoes, it's a very tough
question,'' said McKinney, who as general manager of the Detroit
Pistons took Grant Hill with the third pick in 1994. ``As of the
other day, no one is a lock. No one can get a handle on where these
players will go.''
</P>
<P>
   With just six players under contract, the Sonics need virtually
everything to shore their bench. They would like to find a young
backup point guard, small forward or power forward/center in the
draft or via free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Filling one gap could happen several ways, such as:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Packaging all three picks in a trade for a two- or
three-year player;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Packaging the picks to trade up in the draft;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Trading down; or
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Making one of the picks a keeper (i.e. James Cotton last
year).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of interest in our pick. We're keeping all
of our options open,'' McKinney said. ``There are a couple of
players we have interest in that will go before we pick. If we
decided to keep all three picks, we'll take a player we'd like to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important about this draft is that we have a coach who
has a tremendous reputation for developing young players. He's not
afraid to develop these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal, who replaced George Karl as Sonics coach last
week, takes great interest in the draft. While in Phoenix, Westphal
was responsible for advancing the careers of Cedric Ceballos and
Richard Dumas _ both late second-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Sonics have traded down and selected
second-rounders to avoid having to pay a first-round prospect a
guaranteed three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   This year's draft talent is so evenly spread that several trades
could take place. The thought process is that teams can get the
same player with the 27th pick that can be had with the 12th. This
is why the Sonics might try to trade up or down as the first round
develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not particularly star-heavy,'' said Sonics president
Wally Walker, ``but there are a lot of decent prospects, guys who
will make NBA rosters. ... It's the best overall group I've seen in
five years.''

GOLF TECHNOLOGY COMES BLASTING OUT OF BUNKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Posing as the poster boy for Callaway golf clubs in a
visor and designer black vest displaying the company logo, John
Daly broke out laughing when asked if he had ever been on a
trampoline before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've been on a trampoline, but I haven't found many that
can hold my fat (rear end),'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the world's best golfers, Daly was having trouble
understanding a new test the United States Golf Association has
come up with to determine if all the new metal drivers on the
market conform to a standard that measures their ``trampoline
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   After imposing a moratorium on approving new drivers with
titanium heads earlier this year, the USGA last week used the U.S.
Open to announce that it would test any new clubs to determine if
they caused balls to spring into flight much like a trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   Daly was not alone in his confusion. Players, manufacturers and
golf writers had anticipated that the USGA might declare some new
clubs illegal for play, thus putting a huge dent in the
billion-dollar golf club business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade alone, metal alloys, graphite and even
ceramic materials have made their way into golf clubs, which were
once made of either wood or steel with only rare exceptions.
Similar materials are being woven into balls, which are being
designed to do everything from travel farther to spin with better
control.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, club heads have been steadily getting bigger.
While distances have not gone up appreciably, the new clubs have
made it possible to avoid many mis-hits, keeping balls flying in
straighter lines. They also have skyrocketed in price, running
anywhere from $350 to $500 for the Greatest Big Bertha, Callaway's
latest model.
</P>
<P>
   All of this would be fine with most golfers, except that the
USGA, which governs the rules and standards of the game, wants to
ensure that players can't gain an unfair advantage simply by buying
a high-tech club or ball.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to a head last month after the USGA temporarily
withheld approval of the new Ping ISI Titanium driver from Karsten
Manufacturing. It had been submitted to the USGA for approval in
January, but the association announced it was looking into all
thin-faced metal drivers to determine if they had the trampoline
effect that Daly couldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Callaway's Big Bertha drivers weren't under direct
scrutiny, the company had hired an antitrust attorney and announced
it was ready to battle the USGA in court. It also took out
full-page ads in the New York Times that declared: ``There is
absolutely no good reason why millions of golfers should ever be
required to give up their Big Bertha or comparable brands of metal
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such a mounting backlash, the USGA suddenly backed
off last week and said that all clubs now on the market or already
used in competitive play conformed to its new test standards and
would be legal. But it left the door open to deny approval in the
future if new clubs have too much of a spring-like (as in
trampoline) effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the literal sense, all clubs have some spring-like effect
because all clubs deform at impact,'' said David Fay, USGA
executive director. ``Bob Jones' driver deformed at impact, the
wooden-headed drivers used in the 1987 U.S. Open deformed at
impact, and so do the thin-faced, large-headed drivers that the
majority of players in this U.S. Open will use.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue centers on the fact that metal woods in particular
have gotten bigger, wider and more expensive, and use space-age
materials designed to make the ball go farther and straighter with
more consistency.
</P>
<P>
   For Daly, who seems like he could drive a ball 250 yards with a
broom, the issue isn't with the clubs the pros use. As someone who
endorses Callaway's Big Bertha titanium drivers, Daly was concerned
that the USGA was preparing to take clubs out of the hands of the
average golfer, who relies on new technology to improve scores and
enjoyment of the game. He equated it with building a better, safer
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be nicer to fly in an airplane that you know will
never go down?'' he said. ``I don't think the technology should be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly isn't alone in his concern that the USGA was becoming all
too fussy about the new technology in golf. One of golf's all-time
greats, Jack Nicklaus, also shared Daly's concerns, even though
Nicklaus would like to see the pros all use a standard ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I worry about is maintaining the integrity of
the game at its highest level,'' Nicklaus said. ``... (But) I don't
think that we need to reduce the advances of technology that have
made the game so much more pleasurable for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the technology wars in golf appear to be at a
standstill until the USGA's new testing procedures for clubs are
officially put into place in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Many clubs, like the Callaway driver, have been granted
conditional approval by the USGA in the past, but those could be
endangered if the association discovers a trampoline effect in
testing, which will involve taking a plate from the driver and then
blasting a golf ball at it to measure how far it springs.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who has seen slow-motion video of the test, doubts it can
even prove anything like a trampoline effect exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're seeing is a golf ball compressing on a club head,''
he said. ``The head isn't going in, so that's not a trampoline
effect. That's the impact of a golf ball on a club head.''
</P>
<P>
   There are companies that have tried to get around the USGA
entirely by going straight to the market with their clubs without
formal approval, such as when Bullet Golf unveiled its Hollow Point
driver. Its metal head had a cut-out section that was declared
illegal for play by the USGA, but when the company filled the
hollow area with metal, the club became erratic off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, understandably, are worried that the USGA is
paying far too much attention to the new technology. But they also
took heart in the USGA's findings that clubs now approved and on
the market have not ``lessened the skill required to play the game
at championships such as the U.S. Open or at the recreational
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores last week at the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club in San
Francisco were just as high as they were three decades earlier,
despite all the technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of titanium drivers has not contributed to a dilution
of the role and contribution of (golfing) skills,'' said Wally
Uihlein, chief executive officer and chairman of the
Titleist-Footjoy Co. ``That's very important as far as the timeless
issue of the balance between tradition and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But the war of words is hardly over, especially as manufacturers
begin to search for the next big advances in equipment. All they
can do is hope their new clubs of the future will meet the USGA's
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last six months, we haven't been able to know what
(the USGA) is going to do and what kind of lines are going to be
drawn,'' said John Solheim, chief executive officer of Karsten
Manufacturing Co. ``It makes it very difficult for us to continue
testing. ... It means as you try to develop things, you're just in
a state of hope.''

COMMENTARY: THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS OF MODERN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Recently I walked across town to the Pierpont Morgan
Library to view an exhibition of manuscripts and books by Charles
Dodgson, a.k.a. Lewis Carroll, the author of ``Alice in
Wonderland'' and ``Through the Looking Glass.'' What I really went
to see was the colored proof sheets of Sir John Tenniel's glorious
engravings, which are more closely entwined with the tales they
illustrate than those by any other artist except William Blake, who
illustrated his own poems. Alice, the Duchess, the Mock Turtle and
the Gryphon looked much as they always have, feet firmly planted on
the cross-hatchings of Wonderland, faces perplexed by the odd
sobriety of the world those characters will forever inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Though I had come to revisit Alice et al., I was struck by a
different exhibition, called ``Settling New Scores,'' a display of
modern music manuscripts on loan from the Paul Sacher Foundation in
Basel, Switzerland. These were the cross-hatchings of a different
wonderland. The autograph scores, by Stravinsky, Schonberg, Webern
and many others, evoked purely visual metaphors _ a painting by
Jasper Johns, for instance, or perhaps, in the more furious
passages, the motion of the driving wheel and main rod of a steam
locomotive racing on slender rails across a featureless prairie.
Only visual metaphors came to mind for the simple reason that an
orchestral score is, to me, a little like the topo map of a place
I've never been. I can tell by the crowding of the lines that the
going gets very hard, but I can't actually see the cliffs and the
steep scree slopes the map represents.
</P>
<P>
   I do read music. That is, I decipher it, as laboriously as
someone trying to get through ``The Golden Bowl'' by spelling the
words aloud. I was warned long ago, by an elderly piano teacher in
a small Iowa town, that I would regret my habit of playing by ear.
Now I know what she means. Between the polyphonic complexity of the
manuscript scores displayed at the Morgan Library and the musical
intuition of my facile but decidedly simple-minded ear, there is an
overwhelming gap. I realize now _ chalk this up in the book of
intellectual lamentations _ that there was everything to be said
for learning to play the piano by eye, for letting seeing music
become a means of hearing music.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost paradoxical enough for Lewis Carroll. And it only
begins to hint at the puzzles latent in the manuscripts in
``Settling New Scores.'' There is, as the composer Henri Dutilleux
puts it, the problem of time. ``Did you know,'' he said, ``that the
duration of a page of orchestral music is rarely more than six to
ten seconds, but it sometimes takes a whole day to write it?'' For
Conlon Nancarrow, who composed for the player piano using a
piano-roll-punching machine, the problem of time was even worse. It
would take him, writes Kyle Gann, ``eight months of punching to
complete what was for him a major work of three to six minutes.''
This is, indeed, doing all the running you can do to keep in the
same place.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someday I will have learned, really learned, to read
music properly. And perhaps someday I will learn calculus too, as
I've always meant to do. But for now I can only play a little by
ear _ songs no more complicated than the Mock Turtle's ``Beautiful
Soup'' _ and I'm still trying to master the basic branches of
arithmetic the Mock Turtle was taught when he got ``the best of
educations'' at the bottom of the sea: Ambition, Distraction,
Uglification and Derision.

DODGERS BULLPEN CAN'T HOLD LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There was a smattering of fans who began
heading toward the exits in the bottom of the seventh inning of
Tuesday night's game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to assume they were Dodgers fans getting a jump on
traffic, just as they do at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the game was all but over, the Dodgers bullpen
wasting another lead. The Angels rallied late in the game for the
second night in a row, this time scoring three runs in the seventh
inning and one in the eighth on their way to a 6-4 win before a
sellout crowd of 43,719 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory enabled the Angels, winners of 20 of their last 23
games, to maintain their 3{-game lead in the AL West over Texas.
The Dodgers remained 13{ games behind first-place San Diego in the
NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Only one night earlier, the Angels took advantage of the
beleaguered Dodgers bullpen, scoring all six runs in the final
three innings to win 6-5. Tuesday, Dodgers starter Dave Mlicki
allowed only two unearned runs through six innings before he had to
leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki was knocked dizzy, but it wasn't the Angels hitters doing
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   On Darin Erstad's infield single in the fifth inning, second
baseman Wilton Guerrero fielded the ball before colliding with
Mlicki, Guerrero's head smacking Mlicki in the left side of his
jaw. Mlicki had to leave one inning later, and the Angels took
advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-2 in the seventh, the Angels loaded the bases with
one out against Will Brunson. Jim Bruske replaced Brunson and got
Cecil Fielder to hit a chopper to the hole at short. Third baseman
Juan Castro could only deflect the ball into shallow left field as
two runners scored to give the Angels a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck singled in another run later in the inning off
Bruske to put Anaheim up 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got close with a run in the eighth inning off Pep
Harris, but Shigetoshi Hasegawa got Gary Sheffield to fly to right
field with the potential tying run on third, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad gave the Angels an insurance run in the bottom of the
inning with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' 21st come-from-behind win this season.
Whatever their deficit, they seem to feel they can rally. Their hot
streak started May 31 when they came back from a 5-0 deficit at
Minnesota to win 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to explain how important it is to come back and
win games, Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``As a game goes
along, the confidence is there. They know what it takes, they know
how to approach it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of times during games in the season where
you're down in the seventh inning, and you hear a voice down the
bench say `It's our time, time to step up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn was adequate in six innings,
giving up three runs and eight hits. But he left the game trailing
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Harris (1-0), making his first appearance in almost two weeks,
got the win over Brunson (0-1). Rich DeLucia got the final out to
record his second save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In his three starts as a Dodger going into Tuesday's game,
Mlicki _ acquired June 4 in the trade for Hideo Nomo _ already had
as many wins this season (two) as Nomo had in 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   And after blanking the Angels for the first three innings
Tuesday, Mlicki's consecutive scoreless-inning streak reached 19,
the longest of any Dodger pitcher this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels snapped the streak with two runs in the fourth,
courtesy of the Dodgers defense. Castro at shortstop and Guerrero
at second made errors on hard-hit ground balls to start the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Both baserunners scored, one on a double-play ball and the
second on a two-out bloop single by Orlando Palmeiro, tying the
game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had taken a 2-0 lead with single runs in the second
and fourth innings, both runs driven in by Paul Konerko. Konerko
led off the second inning with his third homer of the year. He
singled home Raul Mondesi (double) from second in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels tied it in the bottom of the fourth, the
Dodgers regained the lead in the top of the fifth. Eric Young
singled, stole second and third and scored on Eric Karros' double
for a 3-2 lead.

around the globe, the gap between success and failure is widening
ominously between rich and poor countries battling the epidemic,
U.N. officials reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country report on the global AIDS
epidemic, the U.N. health experts say more than 40 million people
have contracted the disease since the early 1980s, and nearly 12
million of them have died. The report found that prevention efforts
are lagging badly in most of the world's developing nations and
that the new virus-fighting drugs remain far out of reach for
millions of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic news,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the United
Nations' AIDS program, ``is that even though we know more than ever
before about how to fight it, AIDS is winning. Infection rates are
reaching new heights in much of the developing world, and if they
cannot be halted, the world will confront a major catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Western industrialized world, powerful new drugs are
restoring many patients to health _ at least temporarily _ and
government-supported prevention programs are proving dramatically
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But in developing countries, the epidemic is leaving millions
near death and uninformed millions at dreadful risk of infection.
In poorer regions of the globe, public health budgets are meager,
drugs are unavailable and AIDS prevention efforts are often mired
in bureaucracy or are stymied by cultural or religious taboos.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The epidemic is spreading so swiftly, and so few nations are
equipped to monitor the onslaught closely, that the only firm
figures available right now are based on U.N. surveillance through
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are frightening, indeed, Piot said: 30.6 million
people, including more than a million children, are now living with
AIDS; 2.3 million men, women and children died last year alone;
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is infecting nearly 16,000 people
a day, and 8.2 million children are already orphaned with their
mothers or both parents dead of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of new infections is perhaps the most frightening of
all, epidemic-fighters say: With cures nonexistent, vaccines many
years away, and expensive, life-prolonging drugs far beyond the
ability of most nations to afford, 90 percent or more of newly
infected people will perish within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.N. report was released Tuesday in time for the
upcoming 12th International AIDS conference, which opens in Geneva
on Sunday. Nearly 12,000 scientists, physicians, health care
workers, activists and drug company representatives are expected to
attend the six-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at the 11th conference in Vancouver, B.C., the
mood was virtually ecstatic over the promise of a new class of AIDS
drugs called protease inhibitors. In large-scale clinical trials,
they seemed miraculous because _ with regular use in combination
with more traditional anti-viral AIDS drugs _ they were able to
reduce HIV to undetectable levels in the blood of infected people.
</P>
<P>
   In countries like the United States _ where protease inhibitors
are accessible with the support of the government and medical
insurance _ there were heartening tales of patients recovering
Lazarus-like from what appeared to be terminal illnesses and
returning to health and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebrations of Vancouver have proven short-lived. The
cost of the complicated drug combinations _ $12,000 a year or more
_ are prohibitive. The medicines must be taken on a schedule so
rigorous that many patients, ill and often desperate, simply cannot
comply with the demanding regimen day and night. And as the virus
mutates, a growing number of patients are developing resistance to
the multidrug ``cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   So in Geneva next week there will be reports of more new drugs
and more scientific knowledge about the nature of the virus and the
pathways it exploits to infect and destroy the cells of the immune
system. But there will be little evidence that those drug
combinations are reaching the millions whom they might help _ even
if only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   So making effective prevention programs more accessible remains
the most urgent need in slowing the epidemic, Piot said, and
countless pilot programs have proven scientifically that they work.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the U.N. AIDS expert said, in a few developing
nations like Thailand and Uganda, government-supported prevention
efforts involving accessible AIDS testing and counseling plus
intensive education and subsidized condom distribution have cut the
prevalence of AIDS dramatically _ by more than a quarter in Uganda
and by nearly 15 percent in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   And in countries where injected drugs are a major source of
infection, needle exchange programs supported by the United Nations
at the request of local governments are proving to be effective
prevention strategies, too, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   On the tragic side, however, the U.N. survey found that in 13
nations of Sub-Saharan Africa at least 10 percent of all adults are
now infected with HIV; that in Botswana and Zimbabwe the AIDS virus
has infected one of every four adults; and that in some Africa
towns with populations of 50,000 or fewer, infection rates are
running as high as 70 percent. That last statistic, said Piot and
his senior epidemiologist, Bernhard Schwartlander, is
``unbelievable, but true.''

FEATHERED FOSSILS GIVE THEORY WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Two newly discovered fossil dinosaurs, their arms and tails
adorned with feathers and their bodies dappled with down, offer the
strongest evidence yet to settle the long argument over the
evolution of modern birds, a team of excited scientists said
Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Living more than 120 million years ago, the turkey-sized
creatures were clearly small meat-eating dinosaurs called
theropods, which ran swiftly over the ground, flapped their stubby
wings and shared many of their bony features with true flying
birds.
</P>
<P>
   And although they could not fly, they were clearly among the
crucial ancestral forms that evolved into the first true birds,
according to the fossil experts who analyzed them.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually significant discoveries were announced in
Washington Tuesday by a team of Chinese, Canadian and American
paleontologists who are publishing a full report on the feathered
dinosaurs Thursday in the British scientific journal Nature and
whose work is featured in a cover article in the July issue of the
National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   The feathered dinosaur remains were unearthed from the rich
fossil beds of a dry lake in northeastern China's Liaoning province
where scores of other dinosaurs and their remains have been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discoveries of these feathered creatures certainly support
the hypothesis that birds were derived directly from small theropod
dinosaurs,'' declared Ji Qiang of Beijing's National Geological
Museum, who led the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Said Philip J. Currie of Canada's Royal Tyrell Museum of
Paleontology in Alberta: ``It is a historic moment when a
controversy is resolved. This shows that dinosaurs are not extinct,
but are well-represented by 10,000 species of modern birds.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a commentary to be published in Nature tomorrow,
paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of California at
Berkeley said: ``The discovery should lay to rest any remaining
doubts that birds evolved from small dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Padian is one of the foremost experts on dinosaur evolution, and
in an interview Tuesday he added:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly proof that feathers alone don't make a bird.
These feathered dinosaurs were clearly unable to fly, even though
their skulls, their hollow bones, their three-toed feet, their
wishbones and the evidence of nesting behavior _ typical of all the
small carnivorous dinosaurs _ share those characteristics with
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these are true transitional fossils between dinosaurs and
birds, and they're the first true feathered dinosaurs we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Among all the puzzles that mark science's efforts to sort out
the tangled branches of evolutionary trees, none has been more
intriguing than the search for proof that dinosaurs indeed gave
rise to birds in the eons before a global catastrophe drove them to
extinction 65 million years ago and left their descendants, the
birds, as survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the argument entirely settled today, for at least one
paleontologist, Alan Feduccia at the University of North Carolina,
remains one of a dwindling band of scientists who are unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very interesting find,'' Feduccia said Tuesday in an
interview, ``but these fossils certainly look like flightless birds
to me. I still believe that although birds and dinosaurs may share
a common ancestor, these fossils more closely resemble many other
feathered birds that later lost the ability to fly, like ostriches
and emus and kiwis. These fossils could well be secondary
flightless birds, and they certainly don't have to be dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two newfound dinosaurs has been named
Protarchaeopteryx robusta, and is distinctly more primitive than
the earliest known true bird called Archaeopteryx, that lived about
140 million years ago and whose first fossil was discovered in
1861. The other new dinosaur fossil, a swift runner named
Caudipteryx zoui, was covered with primitive down, and its tail
sported tall plumes that the creature could have fanned out in
display.
</P>
<P>
   The bone structure of the two dinosaurs resembled birds in many
ways, the scientists said, but their leg bones were significantly
longer than their feathered arms _ a clear indication that they
could run swiftly but certainly could not fly, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is what purpose might have been served by
feathers on a dinosaur, and Padian argued they could well have
evolved as a means of display in mating rituals, as camouflage
against predators, or possibly as insulation. ``It is time to
redefine the definition of birds,'' said expedition leader Ji
Qiang.

   VILNIUS, Lithuania _ It is a grim, frightfully intimate job
performed by Juozas Aleksiejunas. He gives guided tours of his
former hell.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old Aleksiejunas escorts visitors around Lithuania's
appallingly well-preserved KGB prison, a lingering monument to the
bleak, brutal days of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt ill when I came back here,'' he said of his first
glimpse of the prison in 1992, almost 50 years after his
incarceration. ``People who left this building after interrogation
here just wanted to see it torn down. But if you tore it down the
evidence would be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania, the first of the three small Baltic states which
broke away from the Soviet Union in 1990, looks back with this
unique museum to the KGB, the feared security apparatus which kept
dissidents in check and punished any notion of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of its capital, the Lithuanian government has
preserved the brownstone building in all its horrific detail _ from
the suffocating isolation chambers to the barren interrogation
rooms. Now, the prison goes by the name of the Genocide and
Resistance Center.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is the wholly preserved padded cell where torture
took place, a room well insulated to mask the inmates' agonizing
screams from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   In another is the ``wet'' cell, where prisoners were stripped
naked and forced to squat for hour after hour on a small metal
platform while frigid water flooded the concrete cell floor beneath
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were brought here, their cases were already
decided,'' said Aleksiejunas, who began working at the museum as a
volunteer and now receives a small salary to augment his pension.
</P>
<P>
   He was a nationalist partisan fighter in the 1940s who spent
four months in the prison in central Vilnius before being exiled to
Siberia, one of an estimated 350,000 Lithuanians who were
imprisoned and banished by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the spot in a gloomy concrete cell where he was
forced to squat for hours under questioning while being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   And then, to emphasize his point, he invites his visitor to
assume the position for only 45 uncomfortable seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lithuanians are eager to assert their nationality and
their liberty from the Soviet past. They want alliances with the
European Union and with NATO that will remind them and the world
that they are no longer shackled to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that message stronger than in the dank, dark recesses
of this museum, which preserves the thick stone walls, bare light
bulbs and heavy steel doors of its infamous place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Grainy black-and-white photos display the fighters who did not
survive their stay. Between 1944 and 1947, an estimated 700 people
were executed at the prison, most of them shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Such ruthlessness by the KGB diminished the armed resistance but
did not stifle the underground antagonism towards the Soviets. Over
the decades of Soviet rule, a steady stream of patriotic writing
was circulated, some of it on display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 an anonymous writer penned: ``They keep our hearts
pinched as with red-hot pliers and they wash their hands in the
blood of our brothers and sisters. Perhaps this independence day
will free our young hearts when the tricolor (flag) waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas was a member of Brothers of the Forest, a
resistance group which first fought the Soviets, whose Red Army
occupied Lithuania in 1940, then the Nazis who followed a year
later, and then the Soviets again, who drove the Germans out at the
end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1945, charged under the notorious Soviet
Article 58 -- betrayal of the socialist state. Three years later,
his parents also paid for his resistance activities. They were
deported to Siberia and their family farm in Lithuania was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be convicted under Article 58. If you were
chatting with three friends and you were talking about cars,
perhaps you might have said that American cars are better than the
Russian ones. If one of your friends was an informant, you ended up
in jail for treason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas spent 18 years in various prisons and labor camps,
including Vorkuta, nearly 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow, a link
in the infamous Soviet gulag.
</P>
<P>
   But the jail in Vilnius was among the worst of it, he recalls,
because here he lost many of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep the memories, to tell people about the
past,'' he said. ``Because without the past there is no future.''

 &HT;    Treasure trove of jewels dates back to 18th century
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With the kind of optimism unique to a
career treasure hunter, Mel Fisher is predicting a golden summer.
</P>
<P>
   There's the treasure one of his subcontractors just found, a
collection of jewels unveiled this week that Fisher says date to
1715 when a fleet of Spanish ships went down in a hurricane south
of Sebastian Inlet. His daughter says they're worth about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the report his office just released that he says
refutes government claims that he sold counterfeit Spanish coins
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's billions and billions of bucks worth of treasure down
there,'' he said Tuesday from a hotel room in Fort Pierce: He's in
town searching for treasure, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to counterfeit coins. I've never had the time.
And I'm going to be too busy this summer too.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old treasure hunter gained the proverbial fame and
fortune in 1985 when he discovered the Nuestra Senora de Atocha.
The sunken ship made him rich and got him in trouble with the
government, which claimed he destroyed a bed of seagrass to get to
the treasure. Since then he's made a career out of finding treasure
and fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has more than a dozen subcontractors working for him
scouring wrecks he found in the Florida Keys and all the way up the
coast. One of those subcontractors, Steve Hancock, found the five
rings and the pair of earrings unveiled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of rings has three emeralds similar to some he found last
year that were appraised out at $380,000,'' said Fisher's daughter,
Taffi Fisher-Abt. ``The pair of pearl earrings each has 11 pearls.
They're very unique looking. It's amazing that he found a pair.
Ususally we find one and we don't find the other one for a year
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher-Abt said Hancock had been out hunting only for a week
when he discovered the jewels last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find a ton more this summer,'' Fisher-Abt said.
``We're just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the report, Fisher-Abt and her father see it as a sign
that good things are going to happen. For one, they hope
prosecutors will drop their investigation of Fisher's shop in Key
West.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began this spring after a man complained that
he bought a coin from Fisher's shop for $5,900 but then an
insurance appraisal said it was a fake. Undercover investigators
bought another coin from Fisher's shop and a state expert said it
too was a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Both coins came with the certificates of authenticity saying
they came from the 1733 treasure fleet that sank off Duck Key. But
state archaeologists told the investigators they don't know of any
coins recovered from site C-2044, the one listed on the
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ludicrous,'' Fisher says. ``C-2044 is entire Monroe
County. Certainly they've recieved gold coins and all kinds of
treasure from Monroe County. Do you know how many wrecks there are
in the Keys?''
</P>
<P>
   No one from the Monroe County State Attorneys Office was
available Tuesday to talk about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In April investigators from the State Attorneys Office and the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement raided Fisher's treasure shop
in Key West and seized 25 to 30 coins.
</P>
<P>
   They were looking for more coins like the two they had analyzed,
coins that Fisher bought from an old friend, Bob Kruse, a Deerfield
Beach investor. Kruse invested in some of Fisher's subcontractors,
Fisher said. Investors in the subcontractors get a share of the
loot found on any expedition. Unfortunately, two of the
subcontractors who supposedly gave Kruse the coins are dead. The
third doesn't remember.
</P>
<P>
   And Kruse does have a conviction on his record for selling
counterfeit coins _ he was sentenced to prison in 1977 in
Pennsylvania for it. But Fisher stands by his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were replicas, that's all they were, and he was giving
them away,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   And he stands by the coins he bought from Kruse.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher sent a coin from the same batch to a Tampa testing
company. The company's report shows deposits on the coins that
match deposits on other coins that have sat at the bottom of the
ocean for years. The coins even had tiny versions of barnacles on
them, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever tried to get barnacles off a boat?'' he said Tuesday.
``It's about impossible. Barnacles make a glue that can't be
duplicated by man. People have tried. How would I get those on
there?''
</P>
<P>
   So why would the government go to such trouble to get him?
Fisher says it's all a conspiracy. Government officials, in league
with environmentalists, have always been after his treasure. The
fact that his shop was raided on April 22 makes him especially
suspicious. Not only was it Earth Day, it's the day federal
officials sued him for the damage done to the seagrass around the
Atocha wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems all so ludicrous,'' he said. ``They did it on
Earth Day. What does that tell you?''

 &HT;    Turtle deaths blamed on busy boat traffic
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Experts are blaming busier boat traffic
spurred by two months of good weather for an increase in turtle
deaths in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Officials report finding 22 dead turtles so far in June between
Boca Raton and Fort Pierce, including one Monday in Delray Beach
and two Tuesday, in Gulf Stream and Manalapan. Boat collisions or
propeller cuts are blamed for at least 14 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While direct comparisons with previous years aren't available,
``it appears we've been having a higher-than-normal level of
strandings,'' said Paul Davis, program supervisor for Palm Beach
County's Department of Environmental Resources Management. ``As
soon as Memorial Day hit, the numbers started jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't blame careless boaters; they say turtles are
hard to see and just happen to be struck when they surface for air.
They urged boaters to avoid or go slower near reefs, where turtles
congregate.
</P>
<P>
   Some injuries could have been old or occurred after the animal
was dead, officials said. Some animals initially may have drowned
in nets and some killed by sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the beached turtles had been dead for several days and
were heavily decomposed or partially eaten, often making it hard to
determine sex, weight, age and cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   While boats were blamed in only 15 percent of turtle strandings
_ dead and alive _ statewide in the last 10 years, they are cited
in 15 of the 29 strandings in Palm Beach, Martin and Broward
counties from January to April and 22 of the 32 in May, the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that there are just more turtles around,'' said
Kristin Fick, a DEP researcher in Tequesta. She said green turtle
nestings and populations fluctuate from year to year.

 &HT;    NBA draft: Past could haunt ex-Gator Williams
 &HT;    (EDS: Written before Wednesday evening's NBA draft.)
 &HT;    By Jorge Milian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jason Williams is no angel.
</P>
<P>
   In less than one season at the University of Florida, Williams
was suspended three times by Gators coach Billy Donovan for
breaking team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Finally midway through last season, Williams was banished for
good by Donovan after reportedly failing a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   None of that appeared to have much effect on NBA teams who were
to conduct their annual draft in Vancouver Wednesday night.
Williams was ranked by most analysts as the second-best point guard
in the draft behind Arizona's Mike Bibby, who is expected to be the
top pick.
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus was that Williams, who played less than
two seasons of college basketball, would be gone by the 15th
selection of the first round and others thought he could go much
higher than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have compared him to Pete Maravich,'' Heat General
Manager Randy Pfund said.
</P>
<P>
   People have also compared Williams to less savory characters
like Lawrence Phillips, Randy Moss and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rodman, Williams sports enough tattoos to satisfy the crew
of a battleship. Williams also has a fondness for earrings and is
saddled with enough baggage to make even Rodman wince.
</P>
<P>
   In his short stay in Gainesville, Williams quit school once,
complained repeatedly about having to attend classes, pouted
incessantly when he didn't play well and, according to several
newspaper reports, failed drug tests twice.
</P>
<P>
   But when Williams managed to keep himself eligible and out of
trouble, he was a magician on the court. Before being booted from
the team, Williams led the Gators in scoring with 17.1 points per
game and was first in the Southeastern Conference in assists (6.7),
steals (2.8) and free-throw percentage (.840).
</P>
<P>
   The high point for Williams came in a victory against eventual
national champion Kentucky at Rupp Arena in early February during
which the West Virginia native scored 24 points and dominated the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately two weeks later, Williams was an ex-Gator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look myself in the mirror and our coaching staff can
look themselves in the mirror and know that we did everything
possible to help this kid,'' said Donovan, who first coached
Williams at Marshall University in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' antics earned him the moniker ``Wild Child.'' To some
in the NBA, he's the draft's wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Boston General Manager Chris Wallace says teams have to consider
the ``Randy Moss factor'' in evaluating Williams. Moss, the
talented but troubled wide receiver, dropped like a rock in April's
NFL draft because of prior legal and behavioral problems. Moss,
ironically, was a teammate of Williams at DuPont (W.Va.) High
School.
</P>
<P>
   But those comparisons are unfair, according to Dan Tobin of
Professional Management Associates, which represents Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a bad guy,'' Tobin said. ``To compare him to Randy
Moss or Lawrence Phillips is apples and oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, for his part, has had little to say since leaving UF.
Williams' representatives have advised the 6-foot-1, 190-pounder to
keep a low profile until the draft.
</P>
<P>
   But while in Toronto interviewing with the Raptors late last
month, Williams told a reporter he's a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're worried about the trouble off the court, but I'm
proving them wrong,'' Williams said of NBA teams. ``I'm on the
right path. I've never given up and I don't plan on making more
mistakes.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Vanbiesbrouck's new leash on life needs scrutiny
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's say there are two brothers named
Bryan and Terry.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say they have a pet dog named Beezer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Beezer has been, mostly, good and faithful. Let's say
he has, mostly, guarded the house well and let's also say just
about everybody in the neighborhood loves him.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say Beezer is getting old and let's say it's going to
be very expensive to keep him around much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's say Bryan, in a position of sibling authority, thinks
it's time to get rid of Beezer. No, not get rid of him that way.
Bryan simply figures he'd be OK without Beezer and Beezer may be
better off living somewhere else, anyway. And let's say Beezer
hasn't seemed at all upset about the prospect of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say Terry isn't so sure about Bryan's plan. Terry
thinks Beezer is still valuable. Terry certainly thinks it's at
least worth the effort of exploring the possibility of keeping
Beezer.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan and Terry have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   OK, apologies for the analogy to Beezer, who, of course, is
Panthers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, who is a kind and decent man
and in no manner of thinking a dog as a hockey player or a human
being.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the Brothers Murray _ Bryan as general
manager; Terry as head coach recently hired by Bryan _ have a
monumental decision to make in the earliest stage of their new
relationship. And the strangest aspect of the situation is that
Bryan and Beezer appeared to have settled this issue a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was in March, with the Panthers in the concluding stages of a
miserable season, when Vanbiesbrouck said, ``Sometimes, you've got
to cut your losses and move on.'' Later, given the opportunity to
retract or soften a statement made in the immediate aftermath of a
game in which he was pulled, Vanbiesbrouck instead bristled, ``I
meant what I said. Absolutely ... things have been going on for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't Beezer biting Bryan, who was serving as general
manager and head coach at the time, then what was it?
</P>
<P>
   Bryan is going along with Terry so far, but doesn't sound
inclined to go too far. And there's a huge gap between so far and
too far. Bryan said on Monday that ``Terry thinks John is a good
goaltender'' and that ``(Terry) likes him.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Terry likes.
</P>
<P>
   No reading between the lines required. Bryan doesn't consider
Vanbiesbrouck a smart investment when the price figures to come in
at something around $4 million per season in a multi-year
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan ponders more efficient use of that kind of money. Think
puppies. Think a litter of young players.
</P>
<P>
   Beezer has played 14 full seasons in the NHL _ that's 98 years
in a dog's life, by the way _ and has spent the last five of those
seasons with the Panthers. But he was mediocre last year (18-29-11
with a 2.87 goals-against average), and animosities were on clear
display all around as Florida dissolved into one of hockey's worst
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Beezer is out there lounging on the porch. Officially, he
sheds the leash next Wednesday when his day of eligibility for
unrestricted free agency arrives.
</P>
<P>
   What should the Brothers Murray do at the outset of their new
alliance?
</P>
<P>
   They should scratch Beezer's ears and tummy and back in
appreciation of all he has done.
</P>
<P>
   And then they should just scratch him from all future plans.

 &HT;    Commentary: Intrusion as their goal
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's always fun, sort of like one of those
back-seat games for the road, to hear a Republican Party gathering
invoke a call for less government intervention and then to count
the ways party faithful want more.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Gov. George Bush was doing the invoking at the state
party convention and sounding Reaganesque. Depending on your
ideological pocket dictionary, Reaganesque means either
``visionary'' or ``contradictory and hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan never wanted to get government off people's backs.
That was a damnable lie. On a host of very personal matters, he
wanted government hip-deep. Abortion. Drug testing. School prayer.
Wiretapping. Pornography. On each issue it wasn't ``Government is
the enemy.'' It was ``Bring on government.''
</P>
<P>
   At the state convention Bush heralded a ``responsibility era''
where people don't turn to government for deliverance but one in
which ``each of us is responsible _ for our actions, our decisions,
our families and our communities.'' The Gipper would give this his
mark of approval.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Bush long, however, to find one of those issues
in which government is next to godliness. That would be the
abortion issue. Since states can't ban it, opponents try to
undercut abortion rights where they can. One that's popular would
be to require parental consent when minors seek abortion. Bush said
such a requirement would be high among his priorities if
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Given a moment's analysis this is a peculiar cause for real
conservatives. Its premise is the doctrine of ``parental rights,''
which means, ``government stay out of family matters'' _ that
parents' rights are inviolable.
</P>
<P>
   But who's the parent here? If we are to take ``parental rights''
literally, proponents should be crusading for the right of the
pregnant teen _ the real parent here _ to decide for herself.
</P>
<P>
   What you learn is not to put rhetoric to the test when you hear
``government is the enemy.'' A lot of these people want government
intrusion more than anything in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, like the late Barry Goldwater, clearly are
uncomfortable with these discrepancies, particularly on abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True anti-government sorts would crusade for privacy and freedom
of choice, but remember the rallying cries of Republicans who
pleaded the case for rejected Reagan Supreme Court choice Robert
Bork. They, as did he, decried Supreme Court rulings that made
privacy a constitutional right. They evoked images of rights run
amok, government handcuffed from deciding which private behavior
was OK and which was verboten.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you bet _ this privacy stuff is a dilemma. Anyone who
believes privacy is inviolable has been too long at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   But if privacy is the most fundamental principle of liberty,
that thing guaranteed in the 14th Amendment (to be denied only with
due process of law), its biggest enemy is the Reagan legacy and the
authoritarian impulses it nurtured, particularly within the
religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush hasn't been one to kowtow to that segment of his
party. Indeed, he clashed with former state party chairman Tom
Pauken, who was identified with the more strident social
conservatives. Bush doesn't need their help to lead the GOP in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be fascinating, should Bush run for president, to
see how he contorts himself to please the religious right, whose
blessing he'll need to win key caucuses and primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what he'll have to say to win the love of the
righteous extreme: Government isn't the problem. Government is the
solution.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese artisans have been renovating a secluded
waterside pavilion inside the communist leadership compound where
President Bill Clinton is expected to hold some of his most
sensitive talks.
</P>
<P>
   The 213-acre complex called Zhongnanhai has no equivalent in
America. It is a Beijing-style amalgam of the White House, Camp
David, parts of Georgetown and an incumbent president's national
party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Jiang Zemin told visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright that the vermilion-walled compound was
being spruced up for the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai means ``the Central and South Seas,'' a name taken
from two lakes within the walls that were once part of the imperial
palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is not just China's seat of the ruling Communist
Party politburo and the government's State Council. It is also
where the patriarch Mao Tse-tung used to live. A few of Mao's
former revolutionary comrades-in-arms still have apartments here,
and so do some of China's senior and not-so-senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the Chinese analog of the White House
Communications Agency, the place where Chinese leaders have located
the secure ``hot line'' for urgent communications with U.S.
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai is where China has held all important private talks
for the last quarter-century with American leaders, starting with
U.S. National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger's secret mission in
1971. Visiting French, Russian and other top officials also have
been received here.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it is where Jiang has granted interviews to
well-connected visiting journalists. In the last month, Jiang has
spoken here with coly Shanghai. They impose steep taxes, destroy
some of the worst slums and send off hundreds of prostitutes known
as ``sing-song girls'' for ``re-education.'' The fleeing
Nationalist Chinese forces carry off Bank of China's gold reserves
to Taiwan, leaving Shanghai's treasury empty.
</P>
<P>
   July 1985 _ Rebound. Former English teacher Jiang Zemin, China's
future president, is appointed Shanghai mayor by Beijing communist
authorities. He cultivates a populist image and brings in foreign
investment. Shanghai's economy grows by 110 percent in 1986. Jiang
is promoted to China's Politburo in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   April 1990 _ Takeoff. Ten months after the Tiananmen Square
massacre, Beijing decides to pour massive resources into Shanghai
to turn the city into an ultra-modern high-tech port. A
150-square-mile special zone on the Pudong peninsula is accorded
tax and customs privileges to draw in foreign banks and
manufacturers. Shanghai's economy starts to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1997 _ Bursting. By some estimates, 20 percent of the
world's construction sites are in Shanghai. Five years ago, the
city had one 20-story building. Now it has 966, and dozens more are
under construction.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Sunday evening in the candlelit sanctuary of Dong
Tang, a ``patriotic'' Catholic church, a four-year-old Chinese girl
in a frilly dress sang the memorized words of a hymn with as much
gusto as the adults around her.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 worshipers chanted alleluias, partook holy
communion and heard of miraculous events at the Sermon on the
Mount. Elderly men, young couples, three sweaty teens in baggy
pants -- basketball in tow -- filled two-thirds of the pews last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese-language service looked much like a mass in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the priest could not mention Catholicism's most revered
living figure, Pope John Paul II, or even whisper a reference to an
issue central to the church worldwide: the stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And fortunately for the four-year-old's mother, no hard-line
Chinese authorities were in Dong Tang (East Church) that night
looking for violators of government mandates, because it is
forbidden to spread religion to anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   China controls all Christian groups by forcing them to register
as social organizations, regulating what they preach and arresting
or detaining those who cross the government-drawn line of
acceptable religious practice. Both Protestants and Catholics must
be part of China's ``patriotic'' religious movement, which means
they cannot align with a foreign-based church.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of restrictions advocates of human rights
hope President Bill Clinton's visit today to a Beijing Protestant
church will spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Dong Peiying, 77, saw her religion outlawed and its
sanctuaries desecrated during the Cultural Revolution from
1966-1976. She welcomes any restoration of open religious practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite free for people to worship. There are many people
who believe in religion now. Usually there are no obstacles,'' said
the diminutive white-haired woman leaving the Dong Tang service,
around the corner from Beijing's Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   But she sighed when asked about her church's break with the
Vatican, which China's Communist government directed after the 1949
revolution in order to expel foreign influence from a potent social
force.
</P>
<P>
   Will China's Catholics ever return to Rome's fold?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is possible. We hope it is possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese think tank specialists speak of a possible breakthrough
in informal talks quietly going on between intermediaries for the
Vatican and the Chinese government. To facilitate the reported
compromise, the Vatican would end diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
and take an even trickier step of agreeing Rome would not appoint
archbishops in China.
</P>
<P>
   In back-channel talks in March, a Catholic emissary is said to
have cited as a possible precedent a centuries-old agreement with
French and German monarchs, in which the Vatican reportedly allowed
local authorities to select archbishops.
</P>
<P>
   Even could those conditions be met, the Holy See would face
repeated compromises in reuniting with the Chinese church under
current government controls.
</P>
<P>
   At least four million Chinese Catholics agree with parishioner
Dong that the constraints are not too onerous, and they worship in
the officially-sanctioned church, according to government figures.
Another 10 million Chinese participate in the Protestant churches
registered with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 million or more are estimated to gather in underground
churches in defiance of government regulations, praying in
apartments or caves or fields.
</P>
<P>
   Local enforcement of the national policy is or union that
brought down Poland's Communist regime and the underground
publications that criticized Soviet life. ``The Chinese have been
terribly efficient in wiping out dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   And dissent, according to Western watchers, is exactly what the
Chinese government fears religion may foster -- especially with
today's increasing unemployment and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in China there have been religious sects that have
arisen, especially in the countryside, and gathered a lot of people
and eventually moved to political ends,'' said Brent Fulton,
managing director of the Institute for Chinese Studies at Wheaton
College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The most infamous example was the 1850-64 Taiping Rebellion, led
by a charismatic Chinese who declared himself a brother to Jesus,
called by God to save China from the oppression of the Qing
Dynasty's Manchu rulers.
</P>
<P>
   His militant evangelism attracted legions of followers who
mounted civil war and took over much of central China. Only with
the aid of French and British forces did the Manchus finally quell
the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Today, religion with political overtones particularly is
targeted in Tibet, where authorities suspect the exiled Dalai Lama
wants to return to lead Buddhist followers to independence. Muslim
activists in mountainous Xinjiang Province on the western border
are likewise monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Even in mainstream ethnic Chinese areas, however, deviation from
accepted religious lines spells trouble. From across the country
come reports of religious leaders being arrested or detained,
popular shrines shut down and worship sites trashed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials maintain the charges of religious persecution,
including those made in the latest U.S. State Department Human
Rights Report, are wrong and even fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous reports, they simply pieced together hearsay
and distorted information and used this material as the basis for
their report,'' Ye Xiao Wen, director general of China's Religious
Affairs Bureau said at a news conference in Washington this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese citizens' freedom of religious belief is guaranteed
under the constitution of China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when three prominent American clergymen toured China this
year to assess the status of religion, a key question concerned the
fate of 30 Chinese religious leaders believed detained for reasons
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton College's Fulton, who was in the delegation, said
authorities did not deny religious figures have been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   They practiced religion outside the official sphere and that's
why they were arrested. The official version is they were causing
trouble or getting into political affairs,'' he said.

   BEIJING _ China's new graduates are a rare tribe -- more
informed, more free, more pampered and more job-pressured than any
generation since the 1949 communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They herald a new round of university students unbowed by the
burden of their country's tumultuous recent past, as they take
their turn at molding its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for us students is to enrich ourselves. On
one hand to enrich ourselves with knowledge, and on the other to
broaden our visions,'' said Wang Qi, an earnest 22-year-old
graduating from Beijing University, where she majors in Japanese
language studies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to find students at Beida, as China's most
prestigious, 100-year-old university is nicknamed, speaking of
heavy personal responsibilities to China's future.
</P>
<P>
   That is, when they aren't mesmerized by the NBA Finals or the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At Fudan University in Shanghai, another distinguished school in
a more free-wheeling cosmopolitan setting, senior English major
Shen Yi Ming takes a breezier approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like rolling stones. It's easy to move from job to
job,'' said Shen, 22, a top student who starts working at the Bank
of China this summer. ``Shanghai will be a financial center. I'm
going to play some role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, no one can say just how this tranche of young Chinese
will progress through careers and family. It is a generation that
has no precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Beida's gated campus -- strictly closed to outsiders
since its students began the 1989 democracy movement that ended in
blood at Tiananmen Square -- the world's ways are breaking through.
Students are hooked on the internet, play the Shanghai stock market
and expect to own an apartment one of these years. Intrigued by
foreign technology and management techniques, they say they have no
time for anybody's political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were not even born when the death knell rang in
1976 for Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese leader who twice led into
pandemonium and destruction the country he had revolutionized. They
missed the Cultural Revolution that finally gasped to a full stop
with Mao's death, though their parents were among its most direct
victims.
</P>
<P>
   And they grew up with the late leader Deng Xiaoping's policies
of economic reform and openness. These doctrines they were
spoon-fed in current affairs classes were policies their elders
never envisioned and still may not fully comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Another impact is China's ``one-child'' policy that began 18
years ago and left many of them sibling-less, the ``Little
Emperors'' whose families count on them both ``to do good and do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more like them will follow; one-third of China's
population is under age 16.
</P>
<P>
   Despite national growth rates hovering around 8 percent a year,
China's young graduates see gathering clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Guo Xueliang, 20, is in a two-year program of politics and
administrative management at Beida that used to feed civil servants
to China's far-flung bureaucracy. Has she been walking the halls of
the ministries looking for work?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. I have passed the exam of qualification for public
service. But I'm not likely to work for the government,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guo is holding out for a private company, because the future of
state jobs looks shorter by the week under bureaucratic downsizing
and bankruptcy of unwieldy state industries.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The official China Daily newspaper reported this month that 80
percent of this year's graduating students have found jobs, which
might be an impressive success rate elsewhere. But this is a
country that used to assign every single graduate to a job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year graduating students have been totally
untethered to fend for themselves in the job market. And this
bumper crop of 1.06 million graduates is 17 percent larger than
last year -- the biggest since the People's Republic of China was
founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Beida is China's Harvard, Fudan University its Yale. What keeps
these young Chinese optimistic is knowing they are trained for the
new jobs opening up, while the laid-off workers -- often their
parents -- don't have a clue to making it in the high-tech,
high-finance world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our state-owned enterprises don't pay attention to
management,'' said Chen Feng, 28, an MBA student at Beida. ``So we
are very likely to go to foreign-funded enterprises. In this aspect
foreign enterprises are 100 years ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not want to work for the state, but the young people
who will be the cream of Chinese leadership by 2025 are extremely
patriotic. These students, even when interviewed outside the
presence of journalist-watching monitors, professed not to
understand the flap in America over Clinton visiting Tiananmen
Square, the symbol of democracy's crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe China is not the same today. Maybe the economy is
different. The economy was partly the cause of the politics (in
1989),'' said Chris Yu, 22, a Fudan student who chose the name
``Chris'' for her new job with the Deloitte Touche accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more likely for young people today to care more
about their career, their job and making a contribution to their
country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They have hard work ahead. Lay-offs and the one-child policy may
make them the sole supporter of their parents before they even
begin their own families. But for now they are still in their final
student days and follow universal student ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim now is to enjoy life thoroughly,'' said Fudan's
irreverent Shen, ``and have no regrets about university days.''

100 WORKS FOR CITY BALLET'S 50TH 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Ballet will mark its 50th
anniversary with a yearlong celebration during which 100 ballets
will be performed, Peter Martins, the company's ballet master in
chief, announced at a news conference Tuesday at the New York State
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company is known for its large repertory, Martins
said that ``One hundred ballets is unprecedented, even for us.''
(The troupe's current spring season at the State Theater includes
47 works.) The anniversary offerings range from several premieres
to revivals of such pieces as George Balanchine's ``Bugaku'' and
``Liebeslieder Walzer'' and a new full-evening ``Swan Lake,''
staged by Martins.
</P>
<P>
   Opening night, Nov. 24, will duplicate the New York City
Ballet's inaugural program, on Oct. 11, 1948, of Balanchine's
``Concerto Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and ``Symphony in C.'' All former
dancers with the company will be invited to participate in the
curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutcracker'' will be on view from Nov. 27 through Jan. 3.
Martins said that performances might feature special guests,
although he could not yet list specific names.
</P>
<P>
   The week beginning Jan. 5 has been named a ``Balanchine Black
and White Celebration.'' It will be devoted to many of the
choreographically complex but austerely costumed works (among them
``Agon,'' ``Concerto Barocco'' and ``The Four Temperaments'') that
established Balanchine as a major balletic abstractionist.
</P>
<P>
   The repertory weeks that follow include a premiere to be
announced and special evenings of ballets to Russian, British,
French, Austrian, German, Italian and Polish music, as well as
programs devoted to Stravinsky, Brahms, Ravel, Bach and Chopin.
</P>
<P>
   The winter engagement closes with performances Feb. 23-28
honoring the American choreographer Jerome Robbins and emphasizing
his ballets to European scores.
</P>
<P>
   The company reopens on April 27, when Martins' new ``Swan Lake''
begins a two-week run. Martins said that although much of the
production derives from the traditional version by Marius Petipa
and Lev Ivanov, ``The thinking of Balanchine is a major influence
upon my `Swan Lake.'''
</P>
<P>
   The spring season continues with a two-week Stravinsky Festival
(May 11-23), with a new ballet by Christopher Wheeldon; a weeklong
Tchaikovsky Festival (May 25-30) and a three-week American Music
Festival (June 1-20), with new ballets, to be announced, to music
by Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis. The American festival also
includes programs of early and recent choreography by Robbins to
American scores. The season concludes with ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' June 22-27.
</P>
<P>
   Martins announced that he was planning Monday night seminars
featuring former stars of the company, and that Edward Villella,
Melissa Hayden, Suzanne Farrell, Merrill Ashley and Arthur Mitchell
had already agreed to participate. City Ballet's anniversary will
also be marked by an autumn tour with 26 performances in
California, Texas and New York State (in conjunction with the State
University of New York) and by a major exhibition at the New-York
Historical Society on April 7 through Oct. 17, 1999.  &QL;

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made

who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as

scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.

<TEXT>

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptomsand phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.

<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.

   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

A NEW WAY OF FINANCING NEW YORK STATE COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trustees of the State University of New York
adopted a budget on Tuesday that allows campuses to keep the
tuition and fees they bring in, a step aimed at making the colleges
more responsive to market forces.
</P>
<P>
   The move is widely viewed as a harbinger of the broader
transformation of the university that its board has sought for
several years, but that some legislators and campus representatives
have fought.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges have been turning over their tuition revenue to a
central university pot. The money has then been reallocated under a
complex formula that has allowed the university to keep open
smaller campuses that some see as less economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the budget for next year gives more money to
all campuses. The actual increases for the fiscal year that begins
July 1 range from less than 1 percent for the five Colleges of
Technology to more than 7 percent for the Binghamton, Geneseo and
New Paltz campuses. No increase in tuition is envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   But critics fear that in the long term, the new formula
establishes a Darwinian system that will leave smaller campuses
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this model will lead to many campus closings,''
said Kenneth P. LaValle, chairman of the State Senate's Committee
on Higher Education, ``and that it will factionalize the state
university system, pitting campuses against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislators have long been wary of changes that could
threaten campuses in their home districts. When SUNY tried to pare
campuses several years ago, for example, it was stymied by
legislators who fought the loss of institutions that were important
to their communities economically and culturally.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the new system said it would strengthen the
colleges by encouraging them to improve their programs and attract
more students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colleges will have to go out and hustle,'' said Thomas W.
Carroll, president of the Empire Foundation for Policy Research, a
conservative interest group that has been pressing for a more
market-oriented approach. ``This is a fantastic change from the
socialist cross-subsidy method that has kept people afloat by
administrative fiat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before,'' he said, ``it didn't matter whether you were run
well or poorly. The only thing that mattered was that you didn't
close your doors, or the state legislators would get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Within SUNY, the new budget is seen as a first step toward a
broader system of performance-based financing. Under such a system,
SUNY would allocate tax money to the campuses based on factors like
the types of courses they offered and how their students scored on
standardized tests. SUNY's provost, Peter Salins, has developed a
preliminary list of such performance indicators that he will
discuss with the colleges in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Senator LaValle and other state legislators tried unsuccessfully
last week to pass legislation that would prevent SUNY from adopting
a new financial system. ``My fear was that if we left Albany
without passing anything, the trustees would take action,'' LaValle
said. ``By adopting the budget, they have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than voting on a new system, the trustees, meeting at
the SUNY College at Plattsburgh, adopted a budget that reflected
some of the basic principles of that system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never have voted on an approach,'' said Scott W. Steffey,
SUNY's vice chancellor for university relations. ``But we have
changed the way we have constructed it so there are incentives, and
so that it is easier to see how the money is being apportioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuition represents only about 40 percent, or $600 million, of
the SUNY budget, which will total $1.6 billion next year, up 4.4
percent from this year. Most of the rest comes from state
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Although all of the state-operated campuses will see budget
increases, some will be bigger than others. The university centers
at Albany and Binghamton are among the winners, with increases of
about 7 percent. In contrast, SUNY Buffalo and the state units at
Cornell University will see increases of only about 3 percent. SUNY
Stony Brook will see a 5.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The changes do not apply to SUNY's 30 community colleges, which
draw some of their financing from their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Small colleges, which are seen as most vulnerable unless they
can raise their enrollments, are being at least partly protected
under the new formula. SUNY officials said that they will provide a
certain level of financial support for basic operations at colleges
with enrollments of 5,000 students or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget also raises the amount given to colleges to match
the money they bring in for sponsored research to 20 percent, from
9 percent.

SUPERSTAR, SUPERMOM  
 SWOOPES FINDS TIME TO DO IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
 SWOOPES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most famous mother in the WNBA has a birthday party to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Jackson is 1 Thursday so Sheryl Swoopes is thinking not
only about a game against the Mercury tonight, but the party at
Chuck E Cheese's Pizza on Friday and Jordan's first haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma said you're not touching his hair until he turns 1,''
Swoopes said. ``I've been looking forward to the haircut more than
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 mothers in the 110-player WNBA, four are with the
defending champion Houston Comets, including league Most Valuable
Player Cynthia Cooper, who is raising six of her nieces and nephews
and adopting the youngest.
</P>
<P>
   Because of marketing _ Swoopes was one of three players
trumpeted by the league in its ``We Got Next'' campaign _ and
timing _ she gave birth four days after the league's first game _
Swoopes is Supermom of the 1990s. Husband Eric Jackson, along on
the trip here with Jordan, is sharing as a primary caregiver and,
counting endorsements, mom is bringing home a seven-figure salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing right now is finding enough time to do
everything,'' Swoopes said. ``To do my job, to take care of what
I've got to do off the court, to go home and be a mom, to go home
and be a wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Her schedule became too much June 9, when she missed a pair of
Comets practices, one of them a public workout. Coming a day after
an 81-79 exhibition loss to Cleveland, the absences were
interpreted as the first public sign of Houston hoops not being big
enough for Swoopes and Coop.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes' mundane explanation of dad out of town, grandma ill and
no baby-sitter played less glamorously and certainly was no excuse
for her not informing Comets Coach Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was blown way out of proportion because people
turned it into what they wanted it to be, which was a feud between
me and Cynthia,'' Swoopes said. ``Cynthia had nothing to do with
the reason I was not at practice. Van and I talked and discussed
everything. He knows why I wasn't there, and the team knows why I
wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of team issues, which had nothing to do with any
individual, that needed to be talked out. We talked them out, and
that's that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever was worked out in those critical days before the season
opener left the air clear enough for the Comets to start 5-0, three
short of the league record for consecutive victories. And the
deeper Houston moves into the 30-game season, the more its stars,
including Tina Thompson, are able to see how they can peacefully
co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   All play different positions: the 5-foot-10 Cooper at shooting
guard, 6-foot Swoopes at small forward and 6-2 Thompson at power
forward. When they are aligned just right, as they were last week
against Cleveland in combining for 69 points (Swoopes 25, Thompson
23, Cooper 21), the opponent should be entitled to an early
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Even when one of them is way off, like Swoopes' 0-for-10
shooting against Los Angeles on Sunday, the others respond (50
points combined from Cooper and Thompson) and someone else steps up
(Monica Lamb's 14 points and 11 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's saying a lot about our team,'' Swoopes said. ``I can't
ask for a better situation than I'm in right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it takes more than five players to win. I know that,
Cynthia knows that. We know we're in a great situation. You've got
Cynthia on one wing, myself on the other wing. You've got Tina
inside or outside. You've got Kim (Perrot) at the point. When Wanda
(Guyton) is healthy, she's a monster on the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, 27, made her name in Texas, first at Brownfield High
School, then as national Player of the Year at Texas South Plains
Junior College and Texas Tech, which won the 1993 NCAA title by a
bucket over Ohio State. She was the third-leading scorer for the
U.S. National Team that went 60-0 in 1995-96 and won the Atlanta
Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Eight players off that Olympic team became the nucleus of the
American Basketball League while Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Rebecca Lobo
and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield cast their professional future with the
WNBA. Nikki McCray is the only one so far to have switched sides,
trading her 1996-97 ABL MVP title for a job with WNBA expansion
Washington Mystics.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes' unplanned pregnancy rocked the boat a bit, and there
were critics of her rush back to the court six weeks after giving
birth. She made it into 11 games, including the playoffs, with only
flashes of the player who averaged 24.9 points and nine rebounds at
Texas Tech and was too perfect for The Swoosh (Nike) not to enlist
for Air Swoopes, a shoe now in its fourth model.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes was to have played on the American team that completed a
9-0, gold-medal run at the World Championships on June 7, but she
withdrew in favor of a full training camp with the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like the timing was right,'' she said. ``It was
very important for me to be in camp, not just so I could get in
shape and work in Coach Chancellor's system. The biggest thing was
to show my teammates I had an opportunity to go and do something
else, but this is my job and this is more important to me right now
than the World Championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the LA game _ ``I've never, ever a day in my life
played that bad,'' she said. ``I just felt I was out there taking
up space'' _ the results have been promising. Although her average
plunged four points to 15.8, she still is ninth in WNBA scoring and
also contributing four rebounds, two assists and two steals per
game while playing 30.6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not enough for the Lake Avenue Badgers, who
harass Swoopes about her shooting in a new Nike commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes is shown harmlessly playing in the park with Jordan when
three Badgers, chiefly actress Kyla Pratt, soon to be seen with
Eddie Murphy in the movie ``Dr. Doolittle,'' suggest her jump shot
needs some work. ``Girl, where is your mama?'' Swoopes asks. ``Mama
can't help your jump shot,'' responds Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   A line that must have flashed through Swoopes' mind a time or
two during her fiasco at the Forum and the Mercury faithful hope to
be chanting tonight. &QL;

NO. 14 MAY BE LUCKY FOR COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Unlike last year, when they sat in frustration until
drafting Finnish defenseman Juha Gustafsson with the 43rd pick, the
Coyotes depart for Saturday's NHL entry draft in Buffalo, N.Y.
armed with a first-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   What type of player will they be drafting at No. 14?
</P>
<P>
   If the history of the No. 14 pick runs to form, probably a solid
if not spectacular player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the prominent names taken at No. 14, and you know
exactly why our scouts have put in thousands of hours and have
traveled hundreds of thousands of miles to uncover possible
talent,'' Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of projection, skill and plain luck that
goes into picking a player who in five or 10 years someone will
say, `Can you imagine Phoenix got that guy with the 14th pick?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It can and has been done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the Boston Bruins drafted Terry O'Reilly with the 14th
pick. He played 14 years and 891 games for the Bruins, scoring 606
career points before retiring to become the coach.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers tabbed center Rick Middleton at No. 14
before wrongheadedly trading him to Boston for an aging Ken Hodge.
Middleton retired after a 14-year career in which he played 1,005
games and 988 career points _ nearly a point a game.
</P>
<P>
   And wing Brian Propp played 15 years and scored 1,004 points in
a 1,016-game career.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, such up-and-coming stars as Chicago wing Ethan
Moreau, Colorado wing Adam Deadmarsh and Washington defenseman
Sergei Gonchar have been No. 14 picks. So were defensemen Calle
Johansson, Stephane Quintal, Terry Carkner and Bobby Dollos.
</P>
<P>
   The book is still out on the past three No. 14 picks:
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Michel Riessen, who is still developing in Switzerland
and has Edmonton drooling to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Center Marty Reasonor, who led Boston College to this year's
NCAA title game and is contemplating whether to sign with St. Louis
or return to college.
</P>
<P>
   And defenseman Jay McKee, who has fluttered between Buffalo and
the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we'll be able to pick a player who will have a
long and productive career in this league,'' Smith said, reminding
that Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk was a 19th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Smith is right.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1969 _ 30 entry drafts _ only injury-prone center Pat
Peake (1991), left wings Claude Bovin (1988), Normand Leveille
(1981) and Alex McKendry (1976), center Jim Malone (1980) and right
wing Danny Lucas (1978) can be described as wasted picks at No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to when O'Reilly, Middleton and Propp were taken,
Smith said the draft is a much bigger crapshoot now.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967-68 season, the NHL changed the minimum draft age
from 18 to 20, then changed it to 19 after the '78-79 season and
back to 18 after the '79-80 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know a lot more about a player and it's easier to project
him when he's 20 than it is when he's 18,'' Smith said. ``In two
years we may or may not know if our 14th pick was worth it or not.
You're taking young kids, sometimes frail, and trying to project
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 17, I weighed 185 pounds. When I played in the NHL,
I weighed 210 pounds. There was absolutely no way I would have been
the first pick of the draft (1978) in an underage draft like today.
Those two years have really increased the margin of error in
selecting any of these guys.'' &QL;

RAW GARCIA NEEDS MORE POLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas - Just when there was growing talk among the
Diamondbacks' power group that Karim Garcia hadn't made the
necessary adjustments to warrant sticking around, the still
baby-faced outfielder flashed some of his raw talent.
</P>
<P>
   The ballclub's decision-makers are suddenly in a holding pattern
with Garcia, waiting to see if the last two games have been an
aberration or if some of what they've been drilling into his head
is finally filtering through.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia remains on the chopping block, but his last two games
have helped restore the faith of the higher-ups within the
Diamondbacks organization, which selected Garcia fifth in the first
round of the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   One day after going 2 for 4, Garcia flicked a single to
right-center field on a curveball from Texas' Aaron Sele Tuesday
night, an at-bat that drew raves from within the Diamondbacks'
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he slapped a single the opposite way, going with an
outside pitch instead of trying to yank it through the right side
of the infield, a bad habit which resurfaced during Garcia's final
at-bat when he tried to pull an outside breaking ball and wound up
meekly grounding to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I need to be more consistent,'' the 22-year-old
acknowledged. ``I'm not frustrated but it bugs me when I don't do
better. I want to do better. At least I'm seeing progress now, I'm
not going backward.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while Garcia, who spent a month at Triple-A Tucson but was
recalled on May 31, was simply treading water. After going 2 for 4
in each of the last two games, he's pushed his post-Tucson average
up to .272.
</P>
<P>
   Overall he's batting .209, but he was at .143 when he was sent
down on April 27. He's also got seven extra base hits and 12 RBIs
in 66 at-bats since returning, better than the five extra-base hits
and four RBIs he had in 63 at-bats when he was sent down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they know it takes time,'' Garcia said. ``I definitely
feel more relaxed at the plate now because I have more of an idea.
I look for certain pitches and think of the count and the situation
in the game. I'm watching how they pitch to left-handers before I
come to bat. Before I was watching but not really digesting.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because the last two games have offered a better view
of Garcia does not mean he's on solid ground. After Sunday's loss
in St. Louis, a series in which Garcia went 2 for 11, there was
growing support from within to ship him back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major leagues is an accountable place,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``Production is expected at some point. He's done
some things well and some things he needs to become more consistent
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia may be looking at the All-Star break as a cutoff to show
his progress. It's not inconceivable that if he slips back into
those bad habits, Garcia could find himself back in a Sidewinders
uniform by mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid can play,'' hitting coach Jim Presley said. ``He can
hit, run and has some big-time pop. Those are things you can't find
every day. He's got to put his tools to use. It's starting to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is smart enough to know his big-league fate is currently
up in the air. He has the chance to have some big games the next
three nights if, indeed, Garcia has learned anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will draw a mostly hard-throwing Rick Helling
and Todd Van Poppel, another predominantly fastball pitcher, before
Seattle's Bill Swift takes the mound Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since Showalter has sat Garcia against left-handed starters,
Garcia should then take Saturday and Sunday off. The Mariners plan
to start Jeff Fassero and Jaime Moyer, both lefties.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks did not lie when they said Garcia is a work in
progress. It's just that at times this particular work seems to be
coming along slower than the Red Mountain Freeway. &QL;

TKACHUK TRADE RUMOR REBUT TED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith and the agent for
star left wing Keith Tkachuk each scoffed at reports on a Phoenix
radio station that Tkachuk will be traded within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   KGME-AM (1360), citing two unidentified sources purported to be
friends of Tkachuk, reported throughout its morning show Tuesday
that Tkachuk will be dealt to one of four teams _ the Chicago
Blackhawks, the San Jose Sharks, or the New York Rangers or
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely nothing to it,'' Smith said. ``It's simply
rumor time. I read somewhere today where (Jeremy) Roenick will be
traded before training camp. Now I'm hearing Tkachuk will be
traded. It's just another rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still operating under the premise of having both of these
guys here next year. That hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   KGME morning host Bruce Jacobs, however, went so far as to say,
``Tkachuk is flat-out telling people that he's going to be gone. .
. . He's big-time unhappy, and he says he's going to be traded
within the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk's agent, Bob Murray of Boston, said he was shocked by
those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Keith does not want to be traded. He's made that very
clear from the beginning,'' Murray said. ``He likes it in Phoenix.
He wants to stay there. I don't think Keith has ever said anything
else. It makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't know how friends might interpret a conversation _
if they ``are'' friends. But no, he doesn't want to be traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, the Coyotes' captain, is in Winnipeg, where his annual
charity golf tournament is scheduled to begin Thursday, and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A trade could happen, however, if the Coyotes can't reach an
agreement with Murray on a multiyear contract extension for
Tkachuk, 25, the team's leading scorer the past three seasons and a
two-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been negotiating for the past month or so,
and although they remain distant in discussions over money, the
talks have been productive and professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I talked a bit last Wednesday when we met (in
Washington), and we talked again this morning,'' Murray said
Tuesday. ``I wouldn't say things are great, but I wouldn't say
they're bad, either. We're talking. We're getting to the heart of
it and the nitty-gritty pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who has two years remaining on his contract worth $2.8
million next season and $3 million the next, reportedly is seeking
a new pact worth at least $7 million a season. &QL;

 &HT;    Commentary: TQP: Total Quality Parenting
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I saw the first lemonade stand of summer the other day. I was on
my way to pick up our youngest son at a friend's house. As I turned
the corner onto his street, I saw a hand-painted cardboard sign,
taped to a stick and stuck in the ground: ``Ice Cold Lemonade, Big
Cup 50 cents, Little Cup 25 cents. Ice Cold Water, Big Cup 40
cents, Little Cup 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   How cute, I thought to myself. Nothing like hot, summer days and
enterprising little kids. It's a milestone of almost every child's
life.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled up closer to the stand and, sure enough, there was my
son and his friend, manfully minding shop over the card table that
held his mom's best Tupperware pitcher and an ice chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirsty?'' my son asked, running to the curb to meet me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me the Big Cup,'' I answered grandly, digging into my
purse.
</P>
<P>
   When I handed over my 50 cents, he ran back to his friend and
shouted, ``That makes $2.75 for each of us!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day's work. With the heat index at 108 degrees,
the two budding businessmen had a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, why is $2.75 earned by standing in the suffocating
heat such a bonanza compared to the $5 a week we hand him for doing
his chores? He hardly takes note of those earnings, even though he
arguably has to work harder for them. No, the thrill comes from
planning, making and selling the product himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different for adults. This sense of ownership _ be it a
program at church, a product on the shelf or a marketing plan _
translates into the difference between participating in something
and caring deeply about it.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of the old joke about the ham-and-egg breakfast.
In producing it, the joke goes, the chicken is involved, but the
pig is committed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure we want our commitment to go that far, but it does
make a point. For most of us to achieve any level of sacrificial
commitment, we must feel our input is valuable and essential.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, businesses were all abuzz about TQM, Total
Quality Management. It's pretty much the same philosophy described
above, practiced in the workplace. Small-group meetings are held
regularly among employees, their ideas and suggestions are sought
and implemented as much as possible. The message is loud and clear:
You are important to this organization, you make a difference, we
value you, we're listening to you.
</P>
<P>
   TQP should become the buzzword for all of us rearing children _
Total Quality Parenting. We should strive to make each family
member feel important, feel valued, know that his or her presence
makes a difference. Most important of all, perhaps, it would create
opportunities to listen, not lecture.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty easy trap to parent like an autocrat. After all,
that's what many of our parents did, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me why. I'm the parent, that's why. Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, I'm not going to claim I've never said that to my
chidren, but I've tried not to. It belittles and demeans them. It
says, ``Your input on this doesn't matter to me. I don't care what
you think, and I don't even want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a hunch many of us at times treat our co-workers and
friends with more courtesy and respect than we do our own family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Our son helped his friend close down shop for the day, hopped in
the car and proudly showed me his take-home pay. When you're the
youngest of three sons, it's easy for your accomplishments to get
overlooked. After all, two others already have been there and done
that.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of lemonade stands in my life, but until today I
hadn't seen this one _ the one that my son and his friend made. I
couldn't have been prouder of him, and I told him so.

ANALYSIS: RULING UNLIKELY TO AFFECT WINDOWS 98 RELEASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the dust kicked up in the legal battle
over the Microsoft Corp.'s right to include Web browsing software
in its Windows 95 operating system, a ruling by an appeals court
today in the software giant's favor will have almost no impact on
the imminent release of Windows 98, a new version that integrates
the browser even more tightly.
</P>
<P>
   What the ruling and the suit have managed to do is focus a lot
of public attention on a product that has been playing to
widespread yawns in computer industry publications. In recent
weeks, even Microsoft has been playing down revenue expectations
for Windows 98, which is scheduled to go on sale at retail outlets
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the software publisher appears to have generated even
less enthusiasm for Windows 98 among corporate computer buyers,
where a consensus appears to be emerging that this upgrade should
be skipped in favor of Windows NT, a more powerful and robust
version of the operating system designed for large networks of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clearly that NT is the future in the corporate
market,'' said Mike Elgan, the editor of Windows magazine, a
computer industry news weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Corp., a maker of agricultural equipment, based in
Racine, Wis., is representative of many corporate buyers who have
decided to forego upgrading their entire company to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to, in an evolutionary fashion, migrate to
NT,'' said James Hatch, Case's chief information officer. ``We
haven't evaluated Windows 98, and we don't see a compelling need to
orchestrate a mass change.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Tuesday's ruling might have an impact, analysts said, is
in emboldening Microsoft to adopt a tougher stand in its
contractual dealings with computer makers and Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, several computer makers have announced
that they will ship their products with Windows modified so that it
opens with a customized screen that either identifies the brand or
offers icons that link to sites on the Internet chosen by the
manufacturers. This was a practice that Microsoft had forbidden in
its contracts in recent years but did not fight after the Justice
Department included the company's restrictive contracts in the
antitrust lawsuit it filed in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that Microsoft will have more muscle to reapply the
screws,'' said Jessie Berst, editorial director of AnchorDesk.com,
a Internet publication of the Ziff-Davis Corp. ``Recently, we've
seen large manufacturers such as NEC Corporation, Compaq and
Gateway become emboldened by the Justice Department's pressure.
This gives Microsoft the court sanction to reinstitute its previous
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling will also put new pressures on the Netscape
Communications Corp., which created the commercial Web browser
market with its Navigator software only to lose much of that market
to Microsoft in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Netscape executives sketched out a new
business strategy: to transform its home page into a ``portal,'' an
industry buzz word used to describe massive World Wide Web sites
that attract heavy Internet traffic with a mixture of search
engines, Web directories, news, online shopping and entertainment.
Such sites are becoming lucrative in attracting advertising and
steering Web users into the expanding world of Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   However, while NBC and the Walt Disney Co. both invested in
portal sites this month, analysts have remained cautious about the
revenue prospects for such a strategy by Netscape, which has no
search technology or content of its own. The popularity of its home
page rests primarily with the fact that it is the first site that
people see after they install the Navigator browser. As the market
shifts toward Microsoft's browser, Netscape's online traffic could
well sink.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Netscape suffered two setbacks this week. The first
involved server software, the programs that run on the large
computers that host Web sites. Since competition with Microsoft in
the browser market forced Netscape to give Navigator away free,
server software has been a main source of revenue. On Monday, IBM
announced that it would begin supporting Apache, a free Web server
that competes against Netscape's server product.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Tuesday, the appeals court ruling meant that Microsoft
can continue to include its Explorer browser with about 90 percent
of all computers sold in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape has gotten a one-two punch, and it's only Tuesday,''
said David Readerman, a financial analyst at Nations Banc
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After competition with Microsoft forced Netscape to stop
charging for Navigator, its revenues from browser sales fell from
$17 million in the quarter that ended in December to zero in the
quarter ending in April, Readerman said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Readerman is estimating that Microsoft will realize
$2.24 billion in revenue from sales of Windows 98 to computer
makers and retail customers in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives acknowledge that they are doing far less to
promote the upgrade than they did with Windows 95. Industry
analysts say the company is spending only about $10 million on
marketing versus almost $200 million for its introduction of
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say we're ratcheting back,'' said Yusuf Mehdi,
director of Windows marketing at Microsoft. ``In fact, outside of
the Department of Justice coverage _ which has been extensive _ I
think that Windows 98 has been an under-hyped product.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to Windows 98 in the news media's coverage of the
antitrust suits has been ``bittersweet,'' Mehdi said, because while
it brought the issue of browser integration the public's attention,
it did so in a negative context.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one retail chain sees the impact differently.
CompUSA, the nation's largest computer retailer, will open its
doors at midnight on Wednesday in an effort to make the release of
Windows 98 a ``marketing event,'' said Larry Mondry, an executive
vice president at CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Microsoft spent,'' he said. ``The government
gave them so much free advertising they probably didn't have to
spend as much. There is much more interest now than there ever
would have been.''

<P>
   NEW HOLLAND, Pa. _ Eli's grandfather reckons that the Amish are
like other folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the best environment for the Plain People is the
farm,'' he explained, standing in a well-ordered woodshop near
fertile fields that his family has cultivated for six generations.
``So just like you will save and bend over backwards to send your
children to college, we will save and bend over backwards to help
our sons and daughters buy a farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Eli's grandfather _ who does not want to be
identified further because of church strictures _ and the 36,000
other Plain Sect disciples in picturesque Lancaster County is that
developers are encroaching on farmland they have tended since
William Penn welcomed their persecuted forebears nearly three
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is the fastest-growing county in Pennsylvania as
families move in from Philadelphia and other East Coast cities.
Instant neighborhoods have sprung up on what were once rolling
dairy pastures and carefully plowed fields of produce, corn and
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, recent years have brought bumper crops of tourists.
Motels and theme parks are now as commonplace as barns and silos,
and tour buses outnumber Amish buggies on the crowded roadways.
Land prices have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 40 years, the county has lost more than 103,000
acres of farmland to development _ an average of about seven acres
per day. The loss is especially dramatic considering that the farms
are among the most productive in the nation and are typically less
than 100 acres in size.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of local preservationists, the World Monument Fund
last year named Lancaster County one of the world's 100 most
endangered historic sites, along with the Taj Mahal, the ruins of
Pompeii and other threatened global treasures.
</P>
<P>
   With a lifestyle historically rooted in agriculture, the Amish
are at a cultural crossroads. Four decades ago, 95 percent of the
county's Plain Sect populace worked on farms, compared to about 50
percent nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   The Plain People have adapted economically _ finding outside
jobs and nurturing their own enterprises _ but the changes are
threatening their simple and spiritual way of life, warned
Randy-Michael Testa, a Dartmouth College professor and author of
``After the Fire: The Destruction of the Lancaster County Amish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: How far can a people bend until something
snaps?'' asked Testa.
</P>
<P>
   Now bearded Amish men in black trousers and straw hats and women
in long dresses and white bonnets watch warily as suburban sprawl
paves over much of the good earth between Paradise and Bird-in-Hand
and Intercourse and other colorfully named villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more and more commercial development, it creates a
conflict, if I may say so, for land use,'' said Eli's grandfather,
who believes it would be sinful to call attention to himself and,
like most Amish, does not want to be photographed or publicly
identified. ``But the commercial developers are able to pay more
for the land. That takes it out of agriculture, which doesn't suit
me.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   When Amish settlers arrived in this lush valley in the early
1700s, they found a place to heed the Biblical words: ``Be ye a
people set apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 130,000 or so Old Order Amish in North America, about
20,000 live in Lancaster County. The sect and setting were
popularized in the 1985 movie ``Witness,'' starring Harrison Ford.
The county is also home to 16,000 Old Order Mennonites _ spiritual
cousins who share many of the same beliefs but are less rigorous in
their separation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th Century, the Amish and Mennonites were persecuted in
Europe because they were Anabaptists _ believers in voluntary adult
baptism. The Old Order sects are known as the ``Plain Folk,''
adverse to ostentation and committed to their faith, family and
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish are famous for their pacifism, simplicity, plain garb
and curiously selective rejection of modern technology. For
instance, they will not hook into the local electric utility _
maintaining independence from government _ but do use generators to
produce their own electric power. They won't allow phones in their
houses _ fearful of the disruption of family time _ but do have
phones in outside sheds.
</P>
<P>
   They don't buy cars and rely on horse-drawn buggies for getting
about the county, but they will ride in cars owned by outsiders,
whom the Amish call ``English.'' They farm with horse-drawn plows
and harvesters rather than with tractors and combines. Their
children can ride scooters, but not bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Amish children still attend one-room schoolhouses, with their
formal educations ending with the eighth grade at age 14. The
adults pay income and property taxes but neither contribute to nor
collect from Social Security. They don't serve in the military or
in public office. They don't participate in federal farm programs.
And they don't demonstrate against rezonings of land use or lobby
for government protection of agricultural acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their belief is very clear on this. They are not going to tell
the rest of society what to do,'' said Herman Bontrager, a local
insurance executive and leader in the preservationist movement.
``It is very important to them to maintain integrity and honesty in
their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, local preservationists explained, the Amish would
move to other rural regions or adopt non-farm occupations rather
than engage in any sort of organized public policy ``fight'' to
save the county's farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live their faith more than speak it,'' Bontrager said.

father grew tobacco before his death, and where her nephews now
tend this traditional cash crop. She works in a mini-mart in nearby
Ronks and thereby ``knows both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me here is a respect of the religion. It keeps you
down to earth more. You don't get swept up in the fast pace. You
appreciate what you have more. You know the blessing of the rain as
well as of the sunshine,'' she explained. ``I believe there is one
God and each of us has to find our own way to reach Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly outspoken for an Amish woman, she does not equate
this inner peace with willing acceptance of commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the Amish culture is going to survive somewhere,'' she
said. ``But we are blessed with good soil here and it is just not
right to pave over this land.''
</P>
<P>
   But asphalt parking lots already cover much of Lancaster County.
For many Amish families, an agrarian lifestyle is no longer an
option. Indeed, outside jobs are plentiful and ``some have found it
mighty nice to work 'til 5 o'clock and have evenings off. Farmers
work from sun 'til sun and then some,'' said Eli's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Some Amish families have yielded to the temptation of inflated
land prices and have sold out and bought farms in neighboring
counties or Kentucky, Indiana or Ohio. Others make quilts,
furniture or crafts for the tourists. Industrious and notoriously
frugal, some Amish businessmen have prospered and made theological
decisions that the Plain Life does not preclude use of cell phones
or pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to be very optimistic about their ability to adapt
and handle pressures from the outside world,'' said Conrad Kanagy,
a sociology professor at nearby Elizabethtown College. ``Many Amish
families have essentially moved from farm to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes bring complications.
</P>
<P>
   In enforcing federal child labor laws, for instance, the Labor
Department has fined some Amish sawmills and furniture shops for
employing teen-agers in what otsiders regard as hazardous jobs. In
earlier times, these youngsters would have gone to work on their
family farms after finishing their schooling at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Two Amish men from Lancaster County were recently charged with
dealing in cocaine that was purchased from members of the Pagan
motorcycle gang. One of the Amish suspects was working as a roofer
outside the county when he met the Pagans.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes Magazine recently reported that some Amish businesses
have become so profitable that the sect has a snowbird community of
vacation homes in Pinecraft, Fla., where wealthy Plain People
escape the cold of Lancaster County winters. Amish elders worry
about such compromises of the Ordnung _ rules of living _ that even
bans zippers as excessive conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the farm is the best place to raise a family,'' said
Eli's grandfather. Through barnyard chores, children learn
responsibility at an early age. It is the daily duty of 9-year-old
Eli, for instance, to care for calves. Extended families stay
together, building additions to farmhouses as offspring marry.
Sunday meetings are held in parlors and barns, since the Amish have
no churches.
</P>
<P>
   If Lancaster County's farmland is not preserved, the traditional
Amish way of life will fade away, predicts Testa, the Dartmouth
professor who has lived with the Plain People for his academic
studies.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an Amish parable to describe the dangers of gradual
change. ``If you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will hop
out,'' he said. ``But if you put it in comfortable water and
gradually raise the temperature, the frog will stay until it is
cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Fred Daum still lives in the Lancaster County house were he was
born in 1930. During his boyhood, he would see more buggies than
cars pass by on New Holland Pike. Now, fearful for the future of
his Amish neighbors, he is an organizer for LAND, the Lancaster
Alliance for New Directions, one of several preservationist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The conservationists have generated considerable sentiment
against haphazard sprawl. They have tried to establish Urban Growth
Boundaries outside of which development would be banned, but some
communities in the county have spurned this concept. The county's
Agricultural Preserve Board provides tax protection against rising
property assessments for farmers who promise never to develop their
land. The preservationists have managed to stave off a state
transportation department plan to build a four-lane highway through
the farmland, but feasibility studies on the project continue.
</P>
<P>
   Divine providence brought the Amish to Lancaster County, wedding
some of the world's best farmers to some of its most fertile soil,
Daum explained. ``They belong here.''

1997 was a big year for Ben Affleck. He charmed independent-film
fans in the surprise hit 'Chasing Amy,' charmed mainstream-film
fans in the surprise hit 'Good Will Hunting,' and finally charmed
worldwide audiences for the 1997 Oscars in winning the Best
Screenplay statue. Now he's co-starring with Bruce Willis and Liv
Tyler in 'Armageddon.' Affleck talks about the new movie, his
romance with Gwyneth Paltrow, how he has handled the sudden rush of

   5. SONNY SIDE UP Jazz saxophone great Sonny Rollins has been
speaking out on social issues for decades. His 1958 'Freedom Suite'
was a harbinger of the civil rights era. Now, 40 years later, he
has turned his attention to the environment on his new CD, 'Global
Warming.' ``If you are a black American, you can't help but be
political,'' he admits. Rollins sees his shift from civil rights to
the environment as a natural progression. ``We all know the
progress of racial justice,' he says. ``That's a hard thing to
dent, because the urge to feel superior is part of human nature.
But the environment is the common denominator; it's the equalizer
that will force everybody to act together.'' By Bob Blumenthal.

   Editors, attention Managing Editors, Wire Editors:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning comprehensive
coverage of President Clinton's trip to China. Here is a
preliminary outline of stories to be filed today for release on
Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SUMMIT (Xian, China) _ A curtain-raiser from the ancient
capital of Xian, Clinton's first stop, a look at the risks and
benefits for President Clinton. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-GOALS (Beijing) _ A curtain-raiser from Beijing, on what
China wants out of the visit. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ZHAO (Beijing) _ A story on the ousted party chief Zhao
Ziyang, who has made an impassioned plea to China's Communist party
to admit the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown was a mistake. By Erik
Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   We will update this advisory as appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, we call your attention to these stories which have
already moved:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FREEDOM (Shanghai) _ There is a growing realm of personal
freedom in China, where ordinary people now make choices about
travel, work, study and love with less government interference than
at any time in the nearly 50 years since the People's Republic was
established. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-MIDDLECLASS (Beijing) _ Like a phoenix rising from the
ashes of communism, the last few years have seen the a stunning
growth of a flourishing Chinese middle class. Ten years ago, this
group did not exist, but now its core of independent businessmen
has been joined by a growing number of private-sector lawyers,
artists and employees of joint-venture companies. It is first
defined by what its members have: computers, microwaves, interior
decorators and, increasingly, cars and homes. But the rapid
accumulation of material things has left its psychological mark as
well, infusing this group with a kind of independence, and carefree
optimism, that has not existed in China for decades. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   (With art)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CLINTON (Beijing) _ In his global vision, it seems, Bill
Clinton ranks right up there with Richard Nixon. Nixon will ever be
revered here for reviving ties between the United States and the
formerly isolated China. Now, in the days before Clinton arrives
for his first state visit to China, he is being lionized in the
official press and among elements of the intelligentsia as a
far-sighted statesman who had the wisdom to change course with
China, shifting from his initial attack stance to his current
policy of close engagement. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PIRACY (Shanghai) _ Accustomed to putting its best face
forward for an important guest, China is cleaning itself up for
President Clinton's arrival on Thursday. Not only are roads being
repaved, buildings whitewashed and entrance-ways decorated on
countless routes where the president is expected to travel during
his nine days in China, but the authorities are also cracking down
on many of the illegal activities that are ordinarily tolerated
these days, like the sale of pirated video and music compact disks.

APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS RULING ON WINDOWS 95 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (See also MICROSOFT-ASSESS) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Undercutting a central argument in the government's
new antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., a federal appeals court
Tuesday overturned a lower court's order in an earlier, similar
case against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a setback for the Justice Department and for
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued the
order, which had required Microsoft to offer its Windows operating
system software separate from its software for navigating the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is scheduled to preside over the trial in September for
the new antitrust suit, which was filed last month by the Justice
Department and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling Tuesday struck down a preliminary
injunction that Jackson issued against Microsoft in December after
the Justice Department had argued in a separate case that Microsoft
was illegally using its monopoly in operating system software to
gain an unfair advantage in the market for browser software.
</P>
<P>
   But in its ruling Tuesday, the appeals court said that Jackson
had ``erred procedurally'' by issuing a preliminary injunction
without giving Microsoft a chance to present its case, and
``substantively'' by misinterpreting the intent of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Stating a principle that legal experts say would clearly apply
to the new antitrust suit as well, the court said that Microsoft
had the right to determine what features and functions to include
in its operating system as long as the combination ``offers
advantages unavailable'' if a consumer were to purchase separate
software products and combine them to achieve similar capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The same bundling of browser and operating system is a central
feature of Microsoft's latest version of Windows _ Windows 98 _
which goes on sale Thursday, and it is one of the core complaints
of the Justice Department and 20 states in their current suit
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's ruling is not likely to have any immediate
impact on what consumers get when they buy personal computers, it
signals that the Justice Department will likely face a hostile
legal atmosphere as it heads toward the September trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of
having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of
technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust
law,'' said the text of Tuesday's decision by a three-judge panel
of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest here only that the limited competence of courts to
evaluate high-tech product designs and the high cost of error
should make them wary of second-guessing the claimed benefits of a
particular design decision,'' the text said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a terse, three-sentence statement
expressing ``disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reviewing the opinion to assess our options,'' the
statement said. ``We remain confident that the evidence and our
legal arguments in our antitrust case filed May 18 will demonstrate
that Microsoft's conduct has violated federal antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice
Department's antitrust office, said: ``This cuts the legs out from
under the Justice Department on their new case. It's potentially
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's leaders were jubilant, and investors seemed to share
their enthusiasm, bidding up shares of the company's stock $4.9375
each in heavy trading Tuesday, to a closing price of $100.75.
Meanwhile, shares of Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's
only direct competitor in browser software, fell on the news,
ending the day at $26.1875, down 56.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned from this decision is that integrating new
features into our products is a good thing to do, and that's what
these judges say is the right thing to do,'' said Robert Herbold,
Microsoft's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, senior vice president for law and corporate
affairs, said he invited Justice Department officials ``to review
the decision carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the department gave no indication that it intended to
modify or drop the case that is scheduled to go trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that Jackson had erred when he appointed a
``special master'' to advise him on technical matters when he
considered the first case last fall. Microsoft complained that the
individual chosen, Lawrence Lessig, a law professor from Harvard
University, was biased.
</P>
<P>
   The same appeals court had tentatively suspended Lessig's
appointment, and in the ruling Tuesday the court dismissed him from
the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Lessig said, ``This is an extremely
difficult case, and I am grateful to both sides for the patience
and respect that they showed me during the brief time that I worked
with them on this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could appeal Tuesday's ruling to the full
appeals court, or to the Supreme Court. In one sense that might not
seem to be a high priority, since the old case deals with
integrating a Web browser in Windows 95, a product that has been
superseded by Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   But Litan, director of Economic Studies at the Brookings
Institute, suggested that the Justice Department might consider an
appeal as a stalling tactic, in essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given this ruling today, Microsoft could be expected to come
in with a motion to dismiss the new case _ or for a summary
judgment of the case,'' he said. ``To forestall that, they might
decide they need to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial on the new case is scheduled to begin September 8, and
the appeal probably would not have been completed by then.

GROWTH OF TELECOM EVIDENT AT SUPERCOMM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Michael E. Kannell   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Supercomm drew attendance from all points on the
telecommunications compass.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day industry trade show here earlier this month, was
attended by an estimated 40,000 people and drew top executives from
companies that make equipment as well as those that provide all
manner of telecom services _ both wired and wireless. A sampling of
conversations with some of these executives shows how quickly the
lucrative field is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton (Carly) Fiorina, president of the global service
provider business at Lucent Technologies, a unit that accounts for
60 percent of Lucent's $26.4 billion in annual revenue, was one of
the many top executives attending Supercomm.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina, who helped shape Lucent's spinoff from AT&AMP;T, said the
surge of people to Supercomm reflects the industry's stunning
growth. ``We are only beginning to tap the demand. That market is
being driven by an insatiable global demand for data-intensive
applications and mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent came away from AT&AMP;T with one of the greatest research
engines in the world: the 26,000 people at Bell Labs. The company
now sells a wide array of products to so many markets that AT&AMP;T _
once virtually its only customer _ represents only 10 percent of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has made several acquisitions and invested in some
start-up companies with interesting technology. But despite the
industry's spate of mergers, Lucent will not again meld itself into
some larger identity, Fiorina said. ``We intend to be a great name
in the 21st century _ with our name intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Teleport Communications Group is headed into the AT&AMP;T fold.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Annunziata, chairman, president and chief executive of
New York-based Teleport, said the spectacular growth of Atlanta has
made the area itself a draw for telecommunications companies.
Teleport, which provides local communications service to
businesses, recently opened an office here.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new role is to provide the shock troops for AT&AMP;T's
assault on the local phone markets, going after the most lucrative
parts of the market served by the regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where people will have a choice,''
Annunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T does $12 billion a year in business with the regional phone
companies _ money that Teleport can save for the company,
Annunziata said. ``I build the link, and I don't spend that with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The target is huge and growing: ``There is a $105 billion local
market. There is plenty there for us to cut up, so that we can grow
and for the (Bells) to grow as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Vienna, Va.-based Teligent Inc. is building wireless local
networks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another great opportunity to change the landscape of
local phone service,'' said Richard Hanna, Teligent senior vice
president. ``You don't have to get a huge share of the market to do
well. Teligent is an integrated communications company that offers
small and medium-sized businesses local, long-distance, high-speed
data and Internet services over its own, digital wireless networks
in 74 major metropolitan areas throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The local business market _ which will include local,
long-distance, wireless phones, data and Internet _ will reach $250
billion in 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all politics are local, perhaps all telecommunications will
someday be global.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walz, president of Iridium North America, came to Supercomm
to promote company plans to start providing a global wireless
service in September using 72 satellites. ``We will flick the
switch, and the world is wired for wireless. If you want one phone,
one number and one invoice, you can do it with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent billions of dollars, yet expects no rush
of subscribers. ``Our business plan is predicated on having just
under 5 million customers by 2002. That's out of a market that will
be about 10 or 12 million people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, that small group of customers will likely be the cream
_ traveling professionals who need to stay in touch no matter where
they are and are willing to pay for the privilege. This group
includes executives from huge corporations, ``all the way down to a
small business owner whose livelihood depends on going to Japan,''
Walz said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other global services are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's phones, which will cost several thousand dollars will
be capable of bouncing signals off a satellite overhead or
switching to the local cellular phone service _ if there is one.
About 90 percent of the world has no wireless coverage. In fact,
one-third of the United States has none, Walz said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the world's population has no phones at
all.

TRACKING COMMERCE ON WEB IS A FULL-TIME JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Frances Katz   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the Web was inhabited by the likes of ESPN,
MSNBC, Coca-Cola and Sony, nobody really cared who was surfing the
Web or what exactly they were surfing to. But once the medium
progressed from being a cool pastime for computer hipsters into a
serious business, the corporate world demanded the Web be
quantified and measured. Advertisers wanted to target their
advertising dollars on the Web just as they do on TV and in print.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Web measurement firm is one of a handful of
Web tallying wannabes vying for acceptance from corporate bean
counters. Founded in the summer of 1996 by two former Turner
Broadcasting executives, Jeff Levy and Tim Cobb, the company has
taken Nielsen's TV research methods and adapted them to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we looked at the Web, we saw there was nobody applying this
kind of approach,'' Levy says. ``Back in 1995-96, counting how many
`hits' you got didn't provide the kind of information advertisers
needed. Advertisers care about the Nielsen type of stuff,'' he
continues, ``How much time a user spent at a Web site.'' Other
companies such as Media Metrix and Net Ratings use a similar
research model as will Nielsen in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Most advertisers, ad agencies and the research community say
Relevant Knowledge's methodology and third party data assessment is
a Web measurement service they can live with. However, some still
find fault with the company's data, as they do with all current Web
measurement firms. The search engine Alta Vista claimed Relevant
Knowledge has under-reported its actual number of unique visits by
more than 5 million users.
</P>
<P>
   But even with this type of dispute, Levy and Cobb still have the
power to influence major Web media buys from clients such as
Microsoft and Intel. Companies such as the Gen-X Webzine Tripod
frequently cite their high ratings from Relevant Knowledge in their
press releases and company statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also has enough influence in shaping the advertising
standards and naming conventions on mainstream Web sites such as
Yahoo and Warner Brothers to ensure Relevant Knowledge can capture
their data.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Cobb founded Relevant Knowledge after they decided the
Web wasn't being accurately measured in a way meaningful to
advertisers or the Web sites themselves. ``We said `Wouldn't it be
great if we could get a random group of users and develop a
tracking software and process the data to give to customers?'''
</P>
<P>
   Relevant Knowledge randomly selects a panel of users who agree
to have their Web usage monitored for two years. Participants are
directed to a special Web site to download the software that will
track and record the data of every Web site they visit.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Relevant Knowledge had 6,100 users and are hoping to
ramp up to 10,000 users by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Levy says the sample Relevant Knowledge uses is larger than the
Nielsen TV sample because there is so much fragmentation on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concerned with tracking millions of sites,'' he
says. ``Our focus is on people who are using the Web for commercial
advantage, for buying and selling products.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is constantly surprised by the information it turns
up. ``Observation changes behavior,'' he says. ``My first thought
is that nobody's going to go to a porno site if they knew they were
being watched and we would get this sort of G-rated view of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   But what they found out was the software was so unobtrusive that
users were wandering all over the Web to everything from CNN to
more X-rated fare. He also notes 35 users must visit a site before
it is officially recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Levy acknowledges Relevant Knowledge may not be the perfect way
to measure Web usage, but he still believes his company is closer
than most. ``Nobody measures it right,'' he says. ``But we are the
arbiter of who is number one.''

SECURE IN MY OWN IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laziness is a vice, but a mighty useful one. Time and again,
it's led people to invent truly clever ways of doing things, simply
to avoid physical or mental labor. In fact, some of the most
interesting recent developments in computer security were created
to cope with the temptation to let things slide.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer security systems depend at least in part on
passwords, a notoriously risky method because of the weaknesses of
human memory. Most of us pick obvious words that are easy for some
vandal to guess. Or we end up using the same password over and over
for different purposes _ logging onto the office network, for
instance, and getting our electronic mail, and signing on to
America Online. It's all because we're too busy or too lazy to
memorize a couple dozen different passwords, or to pick words like,
say, syzygy, that you don't see every day.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Holy Grail of data security is the creation of
systems that can let authorized individuals get control of a
computer without having to memorize anything.
</P>
<P>
   Now the solution is at hand, thanks to a technology you'll be
hearing a lot about in the next few years. It's called biometrics,
and it's about letting people use their own physical
characteristics as a password. In essence, we're teaching computers
to recognize an individual by his glance, his touch or the sound of
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   It works, too. Several Boston-area firms, including Miros Inc.
of Wellesley, Viisage Technology Inc. of Littleton and Polaroid
Corp. of Cambridge, sell security systems that let companies
identify people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is presently beyond the reach of small businesses or
individuals, but other biometric products aim for the paranoiac on
a budget. Voiceprint software, for instance, doesn't require any
special hardware _ just a computer with a sound card and a
microphone, which is standard issue these days.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago company called Veritel offers a voiceprint product for
locking up your most sensitive computer files. Its $59.95
VoiceCrypt system is available for Windows 95, 98 and NT systems.
It lets you do drag-and-drop encryption of any files on your
computer, making them unreadable by nosy colleagues. Nothing new
there _ products like Norton Your Eyes Only have offered this
capability for quite a while. What makes VoiceCrypt especially cool
is that you get access to the files by reciting a password into a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Most speech-recognition programs, like Dragon Systems Inc.'s
Naturally Speaking and IBM's ViaVoice, are designed for dictating
memos into a word processor. You must spend a couple of hours
training these programs to recognize your voice. But VoiceCrypt
only needs a minute or so to analyze the characteristics of your
voice. You also type in answers to test questions that serve as a
backup password _ for instance, what color was your first car? If
you ever lose your voice, you can still type your way into the
system, without having to memorize yet another password.
</P>
<P>
   During a test of VoiceCrypt, I sometimes had to repeat myself
several times before the software could identify me. I also found
that it isn't too choosy about passwords. I could say any word that
came to mind, and VoiceCrypt would let me in if it recognized my
voice. But VoiceCrypt passed the most important test: Several of my
colleagues have tried to talk their way past it, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   There are other biometric possibilities for those willing to buy
extra hardware. The Canadian firm American Biometric Co. sells
BioMouse, a $299 device that plugs into a parallel port and reads
your fingerprints. Just press a digit against the BioMouse and
you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Some caution is in order. Biometric systems raise an important
privacy concern. You don't want firms sharing your faceprint,
fingerprint or voiceprint data with other firms, or the government,
without your permission. And they ought to store the data in an
encrypted format so nobody can steal it. I foresee the need for a
federal biometric privacy law before we'll feel entirely safe
around these gadgets. But imagine being able to read your e-mail by
saying ``open sesame,'' or getting money out of an ATM simply by
staring at it. It's a lazy man's dream.

NOT IN THE CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOUG BAILEY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite signs that Apple Computer Inc. is making a comeback _
analysts suggest the company will grow faster in the next nine
months than it has in the past two years _ software developers are
still wary about supporting the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the evidence is anecdo-tal: A sales rep at an Oregon
company called Mentor Plus, which makes the only flight planning
software available for the Mac, advised me last week to buy the
Windows version because his company may soon abandon the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Other instances prove to be temporary: Intuit Inc., maker of the
best-selling Quicken financial management package, said earlier
this year it would no longer support the Mac, but reversed itself
within days after Apple revealed its new retail strategy, which
included bundling Quicken on its new computers.
</P>
<P>
   As Apple fans, we've learned to live with the uncertainty about
the future of our software. But it's infuriating when the company
folding the tent on Apple products is Apple itself.
</P>
<P>
   I've written before about the strange saga of the Apple PC
Compatibility Card, a plug-in device that puts a Pentium processor
under the Apple hood, allowing you to switch between operating
systems. Apple unveiled the card not too long ago, saying it was
100 percent compatible with Windows 95. But the card, which cost
about $900, could barely run Windows 95 and then could only run
about half of the programs written for it. The problem was it came
with 16-bit drivers that did not support many of the new features
in Windows 95, including long file names. Compared with
compatibility software solutions made by Connectix Corp. (Virtual
PC) and Insignia Co. (SoftWindows), Apple's expensive hardware
device was only marginally better in some areas and much worse in
others.
</P>
<P>
   When card owners complained, Apple hinted it would update the
card with 32-bit drivers. But suddenly, late last year, Apple
abandoned support for the card altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mark Fonnemann, a Boston College student who, like me, was
stuck with a barely usable PC card for his Mac. Fonnemann started
an Internet campaign to reverse Apple's decision. Failing that, he
tried for months to persuade another company, Orange Micro Inc.,
which also makes PC compatibility cards for the Mac, to produce
32-bit drivers for the Apple card.
</P>
<P>
   Fonnemann, with the help of thousands of Mac users stuck in a
similar situation, almost succeeded. Orange agreed to help rescue
buyers of Apple's card but needed cooperation from Apple to get at
its proprietary software code. Apple refused.
</P>
<P>
   The story doesn't end there, though. Orange last week released a
new 32-bit version of its PC compatibility card and offered it to
owners of the Apple cards for just $399 (the product lists for
$549). By offering the new card, Orange believes Apple card owners
will be able to salvage some of their original investment _ the
Windows 95 operating system ($129) and possibly the extra RAM
bought for the card. However, Orange's card comes with just 16
megabytes of the new SDRAM, just barely enough to run Windows 95
plus some other programs. Adding more SDRAM will bring the price of
the card into the $500 to $800 range.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the response to Orange's program, which lasts
until August, has been so overwhelming the company was unable to
send me a card for evaluation in time for this column. But
Fonnemann has one and his review, along with his lengthy
correspondence with Apple and Orange, can be viewed on his Web site
at www2.bc.edu/(tilde)fonneman/apple.html.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, anyone want to buy an Apple PC Compatibility
card? Cheap.

 Microsoft Sets Its Sites on Home Loans  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you trust Bill Gates to pick your mortgage broker?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is betting you will. The software giant plans to
launch a new Web site this summer to help home buyers find
mortgages and houses.
</P>
<P>
   Called Home Advisor, the site will be Microsoft's third
electronic commerce venture. The Redmond, Wash., firm already runs
successful Web sites selling cars and airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be acting in General Electric style, by having a
top site in each category,'' said Chris Stevens, analyst at the
Aberdeen Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they increase their Internet properties, they have the
ability to cross-reference their listings and find out more about
people,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced its intention to get into the $10 billion
online real estate and mortgage market last year and confirmed
yesterday it will launch Home Advisor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft was building its site, dozens of competitors are
already vying to cater to home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the online mortgage business, top players include HomeShark
of San Francisco and E-Loan of Palo Alto, which are both
celebrating their one-year anniversaries this month, and Intuit of
Mountain View, which is preparing the third version of its
8-month-old QuickenMortgage Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the real estate listings business, top sites include the
National Association of Realtors, which has already got 95 percent
of the market covered with its Realtor.Com site, and
Minneapolis-based CyberHomes, which has amassed 75 percent of the
nation's home listings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its late entry, many are betting that Microsoft will
bulldoze its way into a top spot in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time Microsoft comes into an electronic service, it puts
an 800-pound gorilla in the ring,'' said Vernon Keenan, senior
analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   But most online home-buying services are reluctant to speak
badly of their soon-to-be competitor. Instead, they say they hope
Microsoft's arrival will grow the market for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest competition is not Microsoft, it's simply making
people aware that (buying a mortgage online) is an option,'' said
Ned Hoyt, CEO of HomeShark. ``I'm happy to have Microsoft to spend
the money to do that for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some competitors have begun gearing up for Microsoft's
arrival. E-Loan started blanketing the Seattle area with ads three
weeks ago and is currently raising $10 million for a nationwide ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of a trust issue with Microsoft,'' said
E-Loan CEO Chris Larsen. ``We think people will probably wonder,
`Are they going to sell my data?' We would never ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said he hopes to show consumers that they will get a
better deal by buying a mortgage directly through E-Loan rather
than by getting a referral to a loan officer from the Microsoft
site.
</P>
<P>
   That's because E-Loan _ as well as HomeShark and Intuit _ offers
customers a break on the commissions usually charged by loan
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The online brokers charge about 0.5 percent of the mortgage,
while an ``offline'' loan officer usually charges between 1 and 2
percent commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because Microsoft is referring customers to loan officers rather
than writing loans itself, it cannot offer similar savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't tell customers that you're saving them thousands
of dollars, then why (would they) bother'' buying a loan online,
said Keenan, the Zona analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit realized just that after launching its mortgage site last
fall using the referral model. In March of this year, Intuit
switched to originating loans _ and giving home buyers a price
break _ instead of simply charging mortgage bankers for customer
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've evolved quite a bit,'' said Alison Berkley, senior
product manager for QuickenMortgage.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said she is worried that Microsoft will repeat its
Web browser strategy: Gain market share by giving away products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What concerns us the most is if they destroy the entire
economics of the industry,'' Berkley said. ``Because of their deep
pockets, they have the ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft product manager Larry Cohen dismissed the notion the
company would give anything away on its site. He said he doesn't
expect Microsoft to displace any competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not focused on beating HomeShark or beating Intuit,''
Cohen said. ``There's room for multiple players. It's not one
winner takes all.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the area of real estate listings, Microsoft may even have
some catching up to do. Home Advisor is slated to launch with
complete real estate listings for some _ but not all _ metropolitan
areas, while its competitors have amassed sizable portions of the
U.S. market. Microsoft hasn't yet said which locales it will
target.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Realtor.Com has 1.2 million home listings _ out of
the roughly 1.3 million listings in the nation, according to
Michael Keller, vice president of marketing at RealSelect Inc. in
Westlake Village (Los Angeles County), which produces the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can see how Microsoft will have a challenge gaining a
foothold in an industry where a leader like us is already
established,'' Keller said.

AUTO TECHNOLOGY: UNDER THE HOOD _ COMPUTER NERDS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Automakers and their dealers are facing a severe shortage of
automobile service technicians _ they used to be called
``mechanics'' before computer chips took over most of a car's
functions. While the auto companies are recruiting newcomers, they
are also looking for ways to help current workers do their jobs
more efficiently and precisely.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, technicians at three Cadillac dealerships are
testing a new computer technology developed by the General Motors
Service Technology Group that lets them call up reams of service
information with a spoken request. Called Smart Mentor, the system
includes a small computer that can be worn by the technician and is
equipped with software that guides him through the diagnostic and
repair process.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its advanced speech-recognition technology, the Smart
Mentor is easy to master even by people who have never used a
personal computer. The technician talks to the computer carried in
a pouch attached to the waist. A portable monitor hooks to the
bumper or fender of a car. The monitor displays text, animation and
video instructions to diagnose and repair the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Roach, senior project engineer for General Motors'
Service Technology Group, demonstrated the system at the New York
auto show in April, by telling the computer that a 1997 Cadillac
Seville had an electrical charging problem. A list of symptoms
popped up on the screen, and Roach selected those that the car was
exhibiting. The computer diagnosed the problem, suggested the tools
the technician needed to make the repair and displayed a diagram of
the area to be worked on.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-free system allows the technician to continue working
without leaving the job to look up information in paper manuals or
a distant computer. In addition, Smart Mentor should help
technicians pinpoint problems more precisely, reducing the
possibility that they will recur.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this good for customer relations, the shortage of
service technicians requires that they work more efficiently. Two
years ago, GM chairman John Smith told the National Automobile
Dealers Association that by the turn of the century, 60,000
technician jobs would go unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is looking to the military to fill some of those
jobs. Indeed, the Smart Mentor system was developed in cooperation
with a consortium that included the Defense Department and military
contractors. The same approach will be used by the military to
repair tanks and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the technician shortage is the increasing complexity
and additional electronics of today's cars and trucks. In 1965,
GM's service manuals contained 5,000 pages of text; the manuals now
run to 120,000 pages, and are likely to reach 200,000 pages within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the system is Coast Cadillac, Sarasota, Fla.; Suburban
Cadillac, Troy, Mich., and Lindsay Cadillac, Washington.

SMALL TOY COMPANY SEEKS NET ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Many small retailers are trying to figure out
how to make the Internet work for them. Holt Co. thinks it's found
a way.
</P>
<P>
   When Roz and Ed Holt started Holt Co. in 1979, the small Waltham
firm sold school furniture and equipment, such as overhead
projectors, to private schools. Today, the couple's son, Paul,
presides over a toy retailer and school supplier that aims to sell
most of its merchandise over the Internet, rather than from its
cramped Holt Educational Outlet store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to grow this company,'' says Holt, president
of the $10 million private firm. ``The research I have done says
the fastest, most economical way to grow was the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Holt Educational's technological refocusing, which
Holt estimates cost the company $300,000, is a tale of a successful
foray onto the World Wide Web, a medium that has brought mixed
sales results for both the toy industry and businesses in general.
This month, Holt plans to launch version 2.0 of its Web site, along
with separate sites for its subsidiaries. In a few years, Holt
says, he intends to take the privately financed company public.
</P>
<P>
   And Holt, which sells its products over the Internet, through a
mail-order catalog, and in its retail outlet, is anticipating
on-line growth. Currently, 10 percent of Holt's sales are from the
Web site; Paul Holt predicts those sales will rise to 50 percent of
the total next year.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say Holt Educational, unlike other educational
and general toy stores, found profits on the Web because of its
integrated financial and ordering systems and its attention to
customer preferences in designing the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's specialization in educational toys, particularly those
for children with learning disabilities, has also helped the
company create its own niche: developmental toys for busy,
well-educated, high-income parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents who are on the Internet have no time,'' says David
N. Lord, promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive
just this week. ``It's a lot harder to buy an educational toy than
to buy a Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, Holt Educational has branched out from educational
supplies, creating a school furniture division, Holt Furniture
Environments, and a communications hardware subsidiary, GroupCom,
which markets videoconferencing equipment and related items.
</P>
<P>
   But the core business remains Holt Educational, run out of a
basement miniwarehouse below Holt's corporate offices, packed with
toys, teachers' supplies, and brightly colored stickers. Unlike
Toys ``R'' Us and other mass retailers, Holt concentrates on toys
that develop skills, such as reading or coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell the metal trains with a generator,'' Lord says.
``We sell the wooden ones which the child puts together. My
three-year-old daughter plays with her wooden train every night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the modernization of this division that Paul Holt decided
to tackle first. That was almost three years ago. Holt Educational
already had a mail-order catalog business, but adapting to Internet
commerce required a technological overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   First, Holt hired Lord, a former department store executive with
a degree in accounting, as finance chief and chief information
officer. Lord, like all members of Holt's senior management team,
has young children.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Holt and Lord devised called for scrapping the
company's old computer system and buying new hardware. Of paramount
importance was integrating the new accounting and Web commerce
software so orders coming in over the Internet would not have to be
typed into a separate inventory system.
</P>
<P>
   With the Great Plains accounting program and Microsoft's Site
Server 3.0, which Holt Educational was the first to test in April,
the outlet's Web site reduced transaction costs from $2.25 to 50
cents, Lord says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you order on our Web site, it automatically prints out a
packing list and we ship it,'' Holt says.
</P>
<P>
   Holt Education has 20,000 products available on its Web site; by
year's end, Lord says, 50,000 toys will be available. Holt's
12-member Web development team also included what Lord calls
``value-added'' features, like a regular advice column written by a
Lesley College education professor. The site's gift registry has
10,000 child subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's site also allows customers to search for toys by several
criteria, including price, manufacturer, and category. Buyers can
track the status of their orders on a special FedEx package
tracking page. The company is continuously tailoring the site to
consumers' interests: when management discovered that longtime
store customers were printing their order forms off the Web site
and bringing them into the store to avoid paying shipping costs,
Holt decided to plan an in-store fulfillment center for this
year'sholiday season.
</P>
<P>
   And the efforts are paying off, Holt and Lord say: the average
site visitor looks at 21 pages, and 50 percent of Web hits are
return visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year from now, we feel the Internet will overtake the
catalog,'' he says. The company is growing about 20 percent a year,
with sales for next year projected to be about $12 million. Of
that, about $2 million are expected to come from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Building on what they see as a successful formula, Holt and Lord
say the site's updated version will include customer profiling,
allowing the company's computers to automatically show specific
products that individuals have ordered or looked at previously.
``It makes it easier to shop on our site,'' Holt says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Holt is not the largest toy company around, nor has
its Web site established itself as the most popular place to buy
toys on the Internet. Indeed, the market leader, Paramus,
N.J.-based Toys ``R'' Us Inc., this week launched its own Web site,
which will sell mainly mass-market toys such as Barbie. And other
competing Web sites abound, particularly those that sell Beanie
Babies and other hot toys.
</P>
<P>
   eToys, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based Web toy seller financed by
venture capital, launched a site in March 1997 that features both
educational and mass-market toys. While the company won't release
sales or Web hits figures, eToys says it sells 3,000 products over
the 'Net. It recently bought rival Toys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jane E. Saltzman, vice president for merchandising at eToys,
says sites like hers combine the interactivity of a retail store
with the 'Net's search capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's really great about being on the Internet,''
she says, is that the addition of eToys' keyword searches lets
customers ``recreate the absolute best experience of being in a
land-based store.''
</P>
<P>
   Fierce competition on the Internet also forces retailers to
constantly monitor prices, making toys cheaper, says Jerry
Bloomberger, who owns La Toys Etc., a Cedarhurst, N.Y.-based retail
store and Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the airline system, where you can get a Delta flight
for $100 and then you see a USAirways flight for less,'' says
Bloomberger, who specializes in Beanie Babies and other hot toys.
</P>
<P>
   But some retailers say the future of toy stores may not depend
on Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks I now that have gone on the Internet haven't had a
tremendous amount of success with it,'' says Sally Lesser, owner of
two Henry Bear's Park toy stores in Cambridge and Newton, and
president of the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association, a
trade group with 700 members. ``I'm not sure that the people on the
'Net, once they visit your site, are going to become your
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And industry specialists disagree over whether the Web is an
effective medium for marketing toys at all. Some argue that even if
the Web does hold promise for toy sellers, Holt may not be the
best-positioned company to do business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe value is inherent in the product, my sense is
that people are looking for more than a discount,'' says David L.
Hesel, a toy store owner and industry consultant in Concord, and
past president of ASTRA, who calls Holt ``a nonplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   At Holt Educational Outlet, nonetheless, Holt and Lord see the
Internet as their future. Indeed, they say, only differentiation
from other companies' Web sites will ensure their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years from now, every company will be on the Internet,''
Lord predicts. ``It goes back to adding value.''

PARTITIONING COULD ADD CAPACITY, BUT NOT A WHOLE NEW HARD DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a 1.2-gigabyte hard disk with 1 GB used up. I was told
I could effectively have a 2- or 3-GB hard disk by partitioning it.
True? If so, how do I go about it? And if I want to add a 5- or
6-GB hard drive, how can I tell if my system would support it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Someone gave you some bad information. It would be wonderful
if partitioning a hard disk could double its capacity, but no,
that's not true.
</P>
<P>
   Partitioning breaks a large hard drive into what appears to your
system to be multiple, smaller drives. It's like building a wall on
your drive, and saying everything on one side of the wall is drive
C, and everything on the other is drive D. You don't get two 1-GB
drives; instead, your 1.2-GB drive becomes two 600-MB drives _ or
however you configure them if they are not identical sizes.
</P>
<P>
   You can gain some hard drive space by partitioning, though. As
I've written in this space before, in the original File Allocation
Table system used with MS-DOS and early Windows 95, smaller drives
require less overhead per file, known as clusters. Bigger drives
require bigger clusters, so more space is wasted per file. The
wasted space, known as ``slack,'' can be as much as 40 percent of a
big drive.
</P>
<P>
   You don't necessarily need to partition, however, if you have
the right operating system. FAT32, a kind of file system found in
the most recent versions of Windows 95 and in the upcoming Windows
98, reduces cluster size on larger disks. When I converted a 1.2-GB
drive that was about 66 percent full to FAT32 recently, I gained
about 120 MB from the smaller cluster size! The amount of reclaimed
space varies, depending on the size and number of files on your
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your system will support an extra-large drive depends on
the operating system and the system's BIOS, which manages a PC's
most basic systems. Check with the manufacturer of your computer to
see what it will support. You probably can use special software
that would come with such a disk that would let an older PC see all
of the large drive's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a computer about a year ago that came with USB
ports. I haven't had a need to use them until now. I bought a
digital camera that uses USB and I can't get it to work. My system
doesn't see the USB ports, even though I have the add-in for
Windows 95 that enables USB support. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many early systems with USB ports were shipped with the
feature turned off in the BIOS. Check the manual for your PC to see
how to get into the BIOS' setup feature. From there, look for a
setting to toggle your USB ports on or off.
</P>
<P>
   However, be aware that doing this will take up one of the
interrupt settings in your system, also known as IRQs. These are
the doorways through which your system's various devices talk to
the main processor. The USB ports, fortunately, take only one IRQ _
each device you add to the USB ports (they will hold more than
120!) will not require a separate IRQ.
</P>
<P>
   If you are out of available IRQs, you may have to do some
juggling, and even disable other devices, to turn your USB ports
on.
</P>
<P>
   Although most PCs have only two USB ports, you can now buy USB
hubs _ boxes with multiple ports that attach to the main port on
your PC. Like the hub used in an Ethernet network, it requires a
power supply. It has the benefit of bringing your USB ports up to
your desktop, instead of being stuck on the back of your CPU. Then,
you can plug several devices at once _ say, your digital camera, a
scanner, maybe even a mouse and keyboard _ into the hub.

BEST IN THEIR CLASS STILL AREN'T PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s Pentium II chip finally has made it into notebook
computers, which is something of an engineering feat. Anyone who's
seen what the Pentium II desktop chip looks like _ it's remarkably
similar in size and shape to a video game cartridge _ can
appreciate what it takes to cram it into a portable machine.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of Pentium II-based notebook computers have two other
challenges with this chip. First, it runs hot _ very, very hot. The
heat sink, a metal device that draws heat away from the chip, is
massive on the desktop version, further complicating the portable
design issues.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pentium II is a hungry chip. In order to provide lots of
computing power, it gobbles battery power.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered these problems the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   I use a portable computer to take notes when I conduct
interviews, and I often don't have a table to work on when I'm
talking to subjects. By the end of my first lap-based interview
using a Pentium II system, I was holding the notebook by the edges
with my knees to keep from scalding my thighs. Yeow!
</P>
<P>
   And flying from Houston to New York and trying to write this
column, I realized I'd better type fast. Trying to write on a plane
became a race against the clock. While traditional Pentium-based
notebook computers routinely get 3 to 4 hours of battery life, I
was hard-pressed to eke 2{ hours out of either of the Pentium II
notebooks I tried.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those two downsides _ and they are substantial _ both
systems I looked at were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   IBM ThinkPad 600 _ $4,350, IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the aforementioned heat and power problems and a
couple of glitches, the ThinkPad 600 comes pretty close to
fulfilling my elusive dream of finding the perfect notebook
computer. This is one fine portable.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 266-megahertz Pentium II chip, 32
megabytes of memory, a four-gigabyte hard drive, a built-in 56K
modem, stereo sound and speakers, a 13.3-inch active matrix
display, a removable CD-ROM drive that could be replaced by a
floppy disk, all the ports you'd expect and headphone and
microphone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   As with all ThinkPads, it uses the TrackPoint pointing device,
and it remains the best implementation of this style of pointer.
The TrackPoint, which looks like an eraser jammed between the G, H
and B keys, is responsive, yet precise.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard has a near-perfect feel _ not too mushy, but not so
stiff that your fingers tire quickly. The layout is nice, too _ I
didn't find myself accidentally bumping the wrong keys, or hitting
the backspace key when I meant to hit delete.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 is relatively small for a Pentium II notebook _ most of
the others I've seen and tried are full-sized machines. This is
thin, about an inch, with a relatively small footprint. It weighs
about five pounds when stripped down to its barest essentials.
</P>
<P>
   However, it can be frustrating to use. It would not run my word
processor of choice, WordPerfect 8, no matter how many times I
reinstalled or applied service patches to the software. And the
modem was a bit flaky, occasionally refusing to connect to a
variety of other systems.
</P>
<P>
   The ThinkPad comes with all kinds of goodies. The modem can be
used as a speakerphone, and there's software support on board for a
video phone.
</P>
<P>
   But, there are the heat and power issues. The ThinkPad couldn't
make the Houston-to-New York run without petering out. And you can
keep your coach-class meal quite warm by resting it on the
ThinkPad's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Latitude CPi _ $3,300, Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude is Dell's bread-and-butter business portable, the
one it aims at big companies. Dell plans to keep its design the
same for some time, so computer departments don't go nuts trying to
keep up with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean this isn't a state-of-the-art machine. The
Latitude is fast _ it really approaches desktop power. It also has
a sleek, classy design, being only 1{ inches thick. Although it's
the same size as most other full-sized notebooks, its curved
corners and sculpted cover make it look more compact than it is.
Like the ThinkPad, it weighs about five pounds when stripped for
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude I tried was similar in configuration to the
ThinkPad, though it came with 64 megabytes of memory, which is
standard. It lacked the ThinkPad's built-in modem _ in fact, one is
not even available from Dell, which I think is a mistake. Dell will
sell you a PC card, but PC-card modems get lost and damaged. I'd
rather have one built inside the unit. However, it does have a
built-in Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude also has a relatively dark screen. Even at full
strength, it wasn't as bright as the ThinkPad. And if you turn it
down to save battery life, you'll find yourself squinting a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude uses a flat touch panel as its pointer. It's a
rather poor implementation of that technology. Fiddling with the
settings, I could never get it right _ it was either sluggish or it
zipped across the screen at the slightest touch.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard, though, is as nice as the ThinkPad's. It's got a
softer touch, but still has a solid feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell got quite toasty on the bottom _ it was the model that
had me gripping its sides with my knees _ and its battery life was
dismal. I averaged about two hours with it, mainly because I didn't
want to turn the screen down to save power.
</P>
<P>
   While the power of these systems is undeniable _ with the
exception of the G3-based Apple PowerBooks, these are the fastest
portables you can buy _ heat and poor battery life make them
underachievers when it comes to the needs of road warriors. They'd
probably be fine as desktop replacements if the furthest you take
them from the office is your own living room.

MOUSEBOARD EASES USER STRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two products in today's column offer a new way of doing things.
One of them is a different approach to the keyboard. The other
takes the mouse off the desktop and puts it on your leg.
</P>
<P>
   First, the desktop-to-leg mouse move:
</P>
<P>
   There are some times during a computer session that the keyboard
is rarely used. The mouse is the only input device used. Playing
solitaire is one example. Navigating the Internet is another. Some
games rely on mouse movements and clicks.
</P>
<P>
   MouseBoard allows users to move the mouse from the desktop to
their leg or lap. The MouseBoard is about the size of a desktop
mouse pad and made of stiffer material. The board is mounted on a
thick piece of foam that's concave on its bottom so that it fits
the contour of the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Alan K. Lovejoy, founder of Medias &AMP; Co., a Colorado company
that makes the MouseBoard, said the product is particularly
appealing to ``designers and engineers on Abode or Quark who were
getting very sore arms after a busy day. Lately, we've started
getting calls from retired folks who love to surf the Internet, but
are troubled by arthritis or an arm injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy said he came up with the idea when a friend of his,
Charlee King, was using the mouse to play Hearts on the computer.
``She said her arm was getting sore,'' said Lovejoy, adding that
when she placed a book on her leg and moved the mouse to it, the
shift in position provided some relief. Keeping the book in place
was the problem. MouseBoard's saddle-like shape solved that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works well with a mouse with a cord on it,'' said Lovejoy,
``but if you have a cordless mouse that gives you a lot of freedom,
it really works well. That lets you lean back and get
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   MouseBoard is most useful in situations where control is totally
with the mouse. ``If you're going to be switching back and forth
between the mouse and the keyboard, it's more convenient to leave
the mouse next to the keyboard,'' said Lovejoy. ``But for those
times when you're using just the mouse, MouseBoard lets you relax
instead of leaning toward the computer all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   I use a trackball instead of a mouse, but the MouseBoard works
equally well with either. It's main function is to reposition the
device being used, so it really doesn't matter if a mouse or
trackball is being moved to a more comfortable location.
</P>
<P>
   The MouseBoard weighs about four ounces, has a 7{-by-10-inch
surface available in blue, black, red or purple, and costs $19.95
plus shipping and handling. It is available on the Internet
(www.mouseboards.com) or by telephone at (303) 814-1973.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL, YET ODD LOOKING
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Natural Keyboard still looks strange, even after
being around since 1994. Microsoft grouped the keyboard into two
parts, splitting it between the 5-6, t-y, g-h and b-n keys. Then it
bent those two sections at a slight angle so the wrists sit
straighter when typing.
</P>
<P>
   The design is supposed to give a more relaxed typing position.
More than 3 million of the keyboards have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite is the successor to that
keyboard. It was introduced at the first of the year, and retains
the odd look of its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, following the computer trend of smaller and
cheaper, with new features.
</P>
<P>
   The Elite takes up slightly less desk space than the original.
It connects to the computer only through a PS/2 connection _ the
end of the connector is round and about the thickness of a pencil.
If you have one of the standard keyboard connectors about as thick
as the end of a thumb, the Elite doesn't use it. It does, however,
come with a Universal Serial Bus adapter to turn the PS/2
connection into a USB connection.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard has three more keys than found on standard 101-key
keyboards. There are two keys that work with Windows operating
systems, allowing users to bring up the ``start'' menu and to use
Windows' shortcuts. A third key functions as a right-mouse button
without having to leave the keyboard to use the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated street price of the keyboard is about $55-$65.

WINDOWS 98 OFFERS LITTLE FOR HOME USER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's all the fuss about Windows 98? Unless you're an attorney
with the U.S. Justice Department, should you, a home user, care?
The big rollout will come June 25. Should you be in front of your
favorite computer store with a lawn chair to get in line for the
early copy?
</P>
<P>
   I won't be. Not because I already have a reviewer's beta copy,
but because I'm less enthusiastic about Windows 98's arrival than I
was about Windows 3.0 or Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the giant leap from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95, the move
to Windows 98 is only a small step _ at least for today's home
user.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Windows 98 does boot up faster. (Macintosh users love to
say, ``That's a great feature? You can re-boot quicker after a
crash?'') It does a little more than Windows 95. Some things are
easier to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some applications pop up quicker _ in some cases 50 percent
faster _ under Windows 98 than Windows 95. But is it all that
important to my computing session to have America Online start up
in 15 seconds instead of 30?
</P>
<P>
   Does Windows 98 run on my everyday workhorse computer? Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   It probably will in the future, perhaps even this year. But not
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 can run two or more monitors from a single computer.
It's a nice feature _ one that is more enticing to business users
who might be doing spreadsheets and databases at the same time _
than it is a home user. It has a more efficient file-management
system to save hard drive space. But with hard drives holding
gigabytes now instead of megabytes, home users may not find the
space need as pressing these days.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 still wants to have a good-size chunk of real estate
on the hard drive. A typical installation takes about 195
megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also supports USB _ the universal serial bus. The USB
is wonderful: Got a new scanner? Plug it into the USB, and Windows
98 automatically knows the brand, model and what communications
ports are available for it. More stuff to add on? Simply plug it
in.
</P>
<P>
   There are some peripherals that are USB compatible, but right
now, there are more that aren't than are. In that respect, Windows
98, to steal a boast from Panasonic, is just slightly ahead of its
time.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 has many advantages over Windows 95. If I were a
systems manager, I'd be looking at its possibilities by the end of
the month. But unlike Windows 95, which had immediate advantages
for both home and business users, Windows 98 seems to pave new
roadway for business while filling in potholes in the road of home
computing.

 Just for Fun: Philips' hand-held unit performs many functions
worthy of PC  
 By Yusuf Davis   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTANTA _ The Velo 500 from Philips is a hand-held PC whose
price and functions land it midway between a personal digital
assistant and a laptop PC.
</P>
<P>
   Using Windows CE (the pared-down version of Windows) as the
operating system and 24 megabytes of memory, the Velo can perform
many of the tasks of a portable PC, including light word
processing, connecting to the Internet and sending and receiving
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a large, bright screen, the Velo is easy to see
and use. It has a built-in 28.8k bps modem, which is accessed
through a pop-up phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   With miniature card slots for memory expansion and system
software upgrades, the unit is totally upgradable and will be
useful for years to come. Like other PDAs, the Velo has a tiny
keyboard, which reduces typing to hunt-and-peck.
</P>
<P>
   A docking station, AC adapter, phone cable and rechargable
battery pack are included.
</P>
<P>
   The Velo 500 has a suggested retail price of $650. For more
information, visit the Web site http://www.velo.philips.com.
</P>
<P>
   Saving your memories
</P>
<P>
   The Snapshot Photo Scanner can help you turn that shoebox full
of snapshots into a digital photo album in your computer. When
digitized, the images can be stored for posterity, edited for fun
and profit, or incorporated into other documents.
</P>
<P>
   Just plug the scanner into any Windows-compatible PC (sorry Mac
users) and the unit is ready to go. It will accept photos up to 4
inches by 6 inches and deliver images with an 800-by-1,200 pixel
resolution, in a rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Bundled with a variety of image-editing software, the package
contains everything you need to organize and store images or create
dazzling documents, snazzy images and other special effects. You
can also use the software to drop your pictures into pre-designed
greeting cards, invitations, certificates or awards. Or you can
create your own cards and calendars and send them all as e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Web site http://www.kodak.com.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, grab that image
</P>
<P>
   Another good way to get images into your computer is with the
QuickClip from Connectix. The difference between this unit and a
scanner is that QuickClip is an image-capture device, able to grab
video images as well as still images from a source and transfer
them to a computer file.
</P>
<P>
   QuickClip will grab images from a camcorder, VCR or laser disc
and place them into Web pages, newsletters and e-mail messages. It
comes with all the necessary software to capture images and store
them in a number of sizes and formats.
</P>
<P>
   Though it works well with Windows 95, QuickClip is designed
primarily for use with Windows 98 and is one of the first USB
devices available for video capture. It can grab up to 15 frames
per second and digitize them to a PC image in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   QuickClip retails for $99 and can be seen at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .connectix.com.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanical helper
</P>
<P>
   Emiglio is a multitalented, remote-controlled robot that can
serve as waiter or the life of the party. His eyes light up and his
helmet flashes as he roams about the room doing his master's
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   With movements directed with a wireless remote control, this
2-foot-tall robot can carry refreshments on a removable tray and
transport small objects in his spring-loaded digits or larger
objects in his included backpack.
</P>
<P>
   A microphone in the remote lets users supply Emiglio's voice. He
can speak in your voice or transform your words into a futuristic
digitized voice or a mechanical-sounding robot voice.
</P>
<P>
   When the party's over, Emiglio becomes a sentry night light.
Just plug in the included AC adapter and his helmet glows to
illuminate a hallway, entry or child's room.
</P>
<P>
   Available from the Sharper Image, Emiglio retails for $99.95.

 Cyberscene: Ocean of information available for boating
enthusiasts  
 By Bill Husted   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Long before there were brave surfers navigating
cyberspace, there were men -- and women -- who went to sea in
boats.
</P>
<P>
   While you might not be ready to go to sea today, this is the
right time of the year to spend some time on a lake, river or pond
in a boat. Whether you are an old hand or just now considering
taking up boating, you can use the sea of information on the World
Wide Web to set a fun and safe course.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go boating. In fact, let's go to Lets Go Boating, a Web
site at http://www.letsgoboating.com/. This is a good starting
point because most of the information is aimed at the beginner.
You'll find topic areas such as ``How much does it cost?'' ``Where
can I go?'' and ``How do I learn?'' There's also a link that will
take you to an area that will let you search for local marinas (a
great resource, since many both rent and sell boats).
</P>
<P>
   Our next port of call is called Boating America, and you can
find it at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .boatingamerica.com/. This is really a fine place to spend some
time. One of the few things associated with boating that doesn't
cost money are the stories boaters tell each other, some of 'em
true. You'll find a selection of these stories on this page.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the start. You'll also be able to get
information about boating conditions in each of the states, browse
classified ads for boats that are for sale, and view sections
featuring gadgets that can soon deplete even the most generous
budget and tips on boating safety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the handiest features here is the bulletin board section
at http://www.boatingamerica
</P>
<P>
   .com/bbs/. You'll be able to leave notes for other users, asking
for advice or giving it. Things get really specific here. Where
else could you find a heated discussion about the valve adjustments
for a Mercury 3.0-liter Mercruiser engine? The value of this area
is the ability to get the sort of exact information and help you
wouldn't be able to find in the articles and features.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best boating water around can be found in Army Corps
of Engineers lakes. That's why you may want to bookmark a site at
http://www.gorp.com
</P>
<P>
   /gorp/resource/us(underscore)nra/ace
</P>
<P>
   /ga.htm that lets you search these lakes and recreation areas by
state. You'll find 10 entries for Georgia, starting with Lake
Allatoona and finishing up with West Point Lake. Once on that page,
you can click on any of the 10 entries for screens full of really
specific information -- everything from fees, to a breakdown of the
recreational facilities and launching areas, to information about
hiking and camping.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Mall at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.themarinemall.com/ is mostly about buying stuff, but then so
is boating. There's a discussion forum that has areas for topics
such as fishing, boat handling and mechanical and maintenance tips.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find also links here to various retailers and
manufacturers as well as a classified ad listing. But there is
more, including links to various other boating pages as well as
links to weather information and a boating events calendar.
</P>
<P>
   One link that should come in especially handy is to the U.S.
Coast Guard. You'll find tips for boating safety here as well as
help understanding the rules and regulations for boating.

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this year, many callers wanting flight information from
United Airlines will speak not to a person but to a computer that
acts like one. It will ask when and where the caller wants to
travel, look up flight schedules and converse using synthesized
speech.
</P>
<P>
   A caller can say, ``I want to fly from New York to San Jose next
Wednesday morning.'' The system recognizes the names of 1,200
airports around the world and understands concepts like ``next
Wednesday.'' Employing advanced forms of artificial intelligence,
it interacts with a caller just as an agent might, even checking to
confirm that it has heard correctly _ ``Did you say Austin or
Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   United's system is only one example of a wave of new computer
technologies that understand spoken language and are poised to
sweep through the American economy. In areas as diverse as airline
reservations, retailing, directory assistance, banking, medical
transcription, computer help desks and secretarial services,
machines that can recognize thousands of words and phrases _ and in
accents as diverse as Brooklyn and Pakistani _ are rapidly becoming
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speech recognition has passed a threshold,'' said Raymond
Kurtzweil, a leading researcher in the field of artificial
intelligence. In the next few years, he predicted, ``The bulk of
business transactions will take place between a person and an
automated personality.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be problems at first. Some people will have to speak
more slowly or clearly than they normally do. And the computers
still get tripped up by jargon, accents and questions they are not
programmed to answer. For example, an airline reservations system
might find itself stumped by a question about ground
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But the systems promise customers new ease in performing every
type of transaction. Executives at companies developing the
technology say that speech recognition systems are being eagerly
embraced by consumers who have grown weary of waiting for customer
service representatives and of using a keypad to navigate the
seemingly endless mazes of automated menus.
</P>
<P>
   And the relatively few consumers who have found themselves
talking to a computer are generally positive about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   For users of United Airline's speech recognition system, there
is often a reaction of wonder when they realize that a computer
understands their words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it feels like it's smarter than I am,'' said Tony
Molinaro, a United manager. He began using the company's
reservation system, which is now available only to employees,
several months ago and routinely uses it to book flights.
</P>
<P>
   At first he said his sessions would take slightly longer than
with a human being because the computer would ask him additional
questions about which airport he wanted to travel to in the Los
Angeles area. But he has since become an expert user.
</P>
<P>
   The system has enough sophistication to know about the members
of his family who are eligible to fly. For example, when he refers
to his father, the computer asks, ``Do you mean Ben?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very neat that it understands me,'' Molinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the user's age appear to have any bearing on the ease
of adapting to speech recognition. Arthur Edwards of Fort Myers,
Fla., 82, is a satisfied user of the voice service offered by
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the discount stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get stock quotes and don't like to have to wait,''
Edwards said. The system almost always recognizes without error the
stocks he mentions, he said, although he did recall that it once
had trouble with some stocks traded on a Hong Kong exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he was quite comfortable talking to computers.
``I've seen lots of changes in my life,'' he said, ``and these days
I spend my time trying to keep up with the grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new systems will have a big effect on the
American work force. The number of jobs created or destroyed by
such systems is a matter of much debate. But many labor experts
agree that the new technologies will contribute to the growing
polarization of the job market into high- and low-skilled jobs and
a corresponding disparity in wealth.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, they will create high-paying jobs for computer
programmers and for the many marketing people who sell their work.
But in the process, they will destroy semiskilled jobs in customer
service, and many people now earning moderate incomes will be
forced to move into low-skill jobs at the bottom of the employment
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the scariest economic problem of our time,'' said
Timothy Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University who has
studied the effect of new technologies on income distribution.
``The most important technological changes tend to be related to
big changes in the distribution in wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, jobs that have been among the fastest growing, like
travel reservations, telephone sales and customer service, are in
danger of being replaced by inexpensive and increasingly flexible
speech recognition systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. became the nation's first
retailer to install a computer system that answers all phone calls
at the company's 833 stores, responding to queries and
automatically routing calls to the right department.
</P>
<P>
   Sears executives say that while 3,000 jobs were affected by the
new system, no workers were laid off. Because of the strength of
the economy, the company was able to reassign its telephone
operators to new jobs as sales and stocking clerks, but those jobs
might not be possible in times of slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The same bullish economy is also fostering widespread investment
in speech recognition technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Charles Schwab began allowing customers to buy and
sell mutual funds over the phone using software developed by a
Silicon Valley start-up, Nuance Communications. The system
understands the names of more than 1,300 funds and can respond to
requests for price quotes for more than 13,000 stocks.

 Is Earthlink Linked to Scientology?  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I recently read in an online publica tion that Earthlink _
one of the largest Internet service providers _ is run by the
Church of Scientology. Is this true, or is it one of those
unfounded Internet rumors?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The latter seems to be the case. It's true that Earthlink
founder Sky Dylan Dayton is a Scientologist, as were several other
top officials of the company when it started out. The company early
on also got some business from the church and its affiliates. But
the church appears to wield no influence over the company, nor is
there evidence that Dayton pressured workers to join up.
</P>
<P>
   FYI, Scientology came under heavy fire on the Internet after it
sued another ISP, Netcom, because a disgruntled former Scientology
minister posted copyrighted church documents on a bulletin board
that had a contract with Netcom. The postings included a 17-page
transcript of confidential lectures by Scientology founder L. Ron
Hubbard. Netcom settled the suit in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I'm getting ready to take the plunge and buy a notebook
computer. Is it worth spending more for an active matrix display,
or is dual scan good enough. I plan to use the computer for word
processing, some spreadsheet work and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; An active matrix display (also known as TFT) contains more
than 1 million transistors _ three behind every pixel on the
screen. By comparison, a dual scan display uses just a couple of
thousand transistors that send signals through wires behind the
screen. Not surprisingly, active matrix provides a sharper picture,
which can be seen well even when viewing at an angle. By
comparison, dual scan displays are not as bright, and tend to
deteriorate when viewed at an angle. If you think you'll be using
your new notebook on a desk with proper lighting, a dual scan
display should be fine. But if you'll be working on a bus, a train
or a plane, active matrix is the way to go. It's also a must if you
plan to use the notebook for presentations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a clearer picture, active matrix can
handle more colors and higher resolution than dual scan. But all
these advantages come with a price. You can expect to pay at least
$600 more for active matrix in a new notebook.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Long URLs don't fit in the space allowed for it on my
Internet Explorer browser. How can I look at the whole thing to
make sure I typed it correctly?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Try this: Place your mouse pointer just to the left of
where it says Links on the address bar (just to the right of the
address space). The pointer should turn into a short line with
arrows at either end. Hold down the left mouse button and drag to
the right to increase the size of the address space.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I'm about to buy a new computer, and I'd like to be able to
transfer my Favorite Places and Address Book entries to the new
computer from AOL on my old computer. Is there and easy way to do
this?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Relatively easy. The Favorite Places are saved in a file
named after your screen name. Typically you'll find it in
c:aol30organize. Your address book info is in two files, AddrBk.ind
and AddrBk.lst, both of which are in c:aol30idb.
</P>
<P>
   Using Windows Explorer (which you'll find in the Programs menu),
save those three files to a floppy disk. Then place them in the
same folders in AOL on your new computer. (You may be asked if you
want to overwrite files already installed. Go ahead and do it.)
Then you should have access to your Address Book and Favs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I've been having a problem printing out pages from Web
sites. The last line of the page is sliced in half, with the top
half of the line at the bottom of the first page and the bottom
half of the line at the top of the next page. While it's usually
legible, it's still annoying. Any solutions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Try adjusting your margin settings. Click the file menu in
your browser and choose Page Setup. Then decrease the bottom margin
a little.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the Week &QC; AOL users who are involved in fantasy baseball
leagues can set up a portfolio that includes statistics for all the
players on their fantasy team. Go to the keyword Stats BB, then
click Player Portfolio and follow the instructions. After creating
your portfolio you can check how your players did today, yesterday,
for the past week, two weeks, three weeks or for the entire season.
You can also get information on injuries and player transactions.

 UNDATED: 13,000 stocks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March, American Express Co., the nation's largest travel
agency, began testing a service that will allow its corporate
customers to call computers for flight information or to make
airline, hotel and car reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Automation has already had a profound effect on telephone
operators. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number
of jobs for telephone, directory assistance and in-house operators
fell to 164,000 from 400,000 between 1970 and 1996, a decline of
236,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than a fifth of those _ 51,000 jobs _ have been lost in the
six years since the first rudimentary speech recognition was
introduced, according to labor economists and AT&AMP;T executives. That
system, which can recognize just five terms _ ``collect,''
``operator,'' ``third party,'' ``credit card'' and ``person to
person'' _ saves ``several hundred million'' dollars a year, most
of it in labor costs, AT&AMP;T says.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907, when AT&AMP;T and Western Electric Co. combined their
engineering operations and created the Bell Telephone Laboratory,
the growth of the telephone industry has been marked by cycles of
huge expansions in employment followed by periods of automation.
</P>
<P>
   The era of operators who manually connected calls at large plug
boards began to end in 1919, when mechanical switching was
introduced, ushering in the era of dial telephones. The first
automated call processing went into service in Brooklyn in 1938,
but it was not until an entirely electronic switching system was
introduced in 1963 that operators began to disappear entirely from
the process of completing calls.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the creation of ``megacenters'' that handle calls
for large regions has significantly reduced phone company
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the workers affected by the concentration of jobs in such
centers was Addie Brinkley, who after 40 years of working as an
operator in eight different cities quit her job in August 1996
after AT&AMP;T closed its call center in Modesto, Calif., and asked her
to move to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brinkley's job had fallen victim to a new computerized
system that performed many of the functions traditionally handled
by operators. AT&AMP;T executives say they accomplished the cutbacks
with almost no layoffs, but union representatives and operators
like Ms. Brinkley tell a more unsettling story.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to quit rather than move to a directory assistance
megacenter in Reno, she said, mirrored the experience of thousands
of other phone company workers who have been eased out in the last
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw thousands of people lose their jobs,'' she said, ``and I
saw the devastated lives.''
</P>
<P>
   While few economists assert that speech recognition will be a
job killer overall, many predict that like other information-based
technologies introduced in the last decade, it will bring profound
changes, positive and negative, for workers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While today's speech recognition systems are not perfect _
United Airlines officials said their system had a call completion
rate of 98 percent _ they are adequate when used with scripts that
reduce the range of expected human answers. And they will improve
rapidly if the development of current speech recognition technology
is any indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confluence of small things, from better software design
to dramatically cheaper and faster computers,'' said Ronald Croen,
chief executive of Nuance. ``There was no single breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition began in the 1960s when computer scientists
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon
University, Stanford University and other centers began to research
the idea with financing from the Pentagon's Advanced Research
Projects Agency, which created the original Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism of researchers and prototypes built in the
1980s, commercial applications remained elusive. It was not until
the early 1990s that companies ranging from giants like IBM to
start-ups like Dragon Systems began offering the first commercial
systems. These systems, designed for personal computers, initially
recognized only individual words and forced users to speak slowly
and unnaturally.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial turning point came in 1992, when AT&AMP;T introduced
the five-term speech recognition technology into its nationwide
long-distance network.
</P>
<P>
   One indicator of the effect that speech recognition is likely to
have in the workplace emerged soon after the United Parcel Service
lost its battle with the teamsters' union last August. Scrambling
for new ways to save labor costs, UPS quietly deployed a speech
recognition system developed by Nuance that gives package tracking
information in response to a caller's spoken commands. Last
Christmas Eve, the system handled 193,000 calls, double the daily
average for UPS. Company officials declined to say what the system
cost but said it had paid for itself in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Wilson, a teamsters spokesman, said that the system had
resulted in ``a tremendous loss of workers,'' adding, ``This has
been a contentious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For Croen of Nuance, the changes are justified because the jobs
that are being replaced are so tedious. He cites annual employee
turnover rates of more than 60 percent for call centers at which
operators answer repetitive questions.
</P>
<P>
   However unrewarding the work, some labor experts worry about the
number of jobs at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main sources for new jobs for the middle class over
the past 15 years have been telephone sales and
information-related,'' said Robert Reich, the former secretary of
labor, who is a professor of economic and social policy at Brandeis
University. ``Now all those jobs are on the line.''

 Layoffs Likely In Broderbund Acquisition  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Learning Company's acquisition of Broderbund is likely to
result in some job cuts and product realignments because both
companies employ significant workforces in the Bay Area and make
many competing software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs probably won't be announced until after the $420 million
deal _ confirmed yesterday _ closes in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their jobs for the next 60 to 90 days'' until
the merger closes, said Lauren Tanny, Broderbund's vice president
of marketing. Although she said she doesn't expect major layoffs,
The Learning Co. has approved a severance package.
</P>
<P>
   One of Broderbund's core products, The Print Shop suite of home
publishing software, competes directly with Printmaster, which is
made by The Learning Co.'s Mindscape division.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's best-selling Family Tree Maker and clip art and
encyclopedia products also compete with Learning Co. offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will spend the summer figuring out ways to
integrate those product lines. One print program, for instance,
might be sold at a higher price, or one might move into an office
market.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Perik
said he will ``de-emphasize'' Broderbund's entertainment line,
which includes Warlords, The Journeyman Project, and Last Express.
But he said he will keep the smash hit Myst and its sequel, Riven,
which was released late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In educational software, Broderbund's well-known titles _
including Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Arthur, and Dr.
Seuss _ can be sold right alongside The Learning Co.'s Reader
Rabbit, Oregon Trail and Cluefinder software.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Perik _ who kept pronouncing
the name of his newly acquired company ``Borderbund'' _ said the
deal should result in ``the first pure $1 billion revenue line from
a consumer software company.''
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1997, Broderbund had sales of $192 million and The
Learning Co. had $392.4 million in sales. But this year, The
Learning Co. has acquired several companies, including Novato-based
Mindscape, and Broderbund is expected to do $300 million in
revenues, including sales from Riven.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund employs 1,100 people, with 600 at its headquarters in
Novato and 100 in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., based in Cambridge, Mass., employs 2,000
people, including 300 in Novato and 300 in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund stock closed yesterday up $2.25, or 12 percent, at
$18.75 on the news. The Learning Co. closed down 11 cents at
$24.89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broderbund has been struggling for a few years. In the hands
of a company like The Learning Co., shareholders will see a better
return,'' said Andrea Williams, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan
and Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. will swap eight-tenths of a share for each
share of Broderbund stock. The Learning Co. expects its earnings
per share to rise about 10 cents this year due to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been reached yet on the board of directors or on
the fate of Broderbund CEO Joe Durrett.

ASKING SOFTWARE TO RECOMMEND A GOOD BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clerking at a New Haven book shop one afternoon 15 years ago, a
novelist named Kitty Florey watched two regular customers approach
the display racks, their faces furrowed with consternation. ``I get
tired of these after a while,'' one said, indicating a stack of
best sellers, ``but I don't know what else to read.'' Ms. Florey
bounded across the Oriental rugs to propose a few titles by Anne
Tyler and Barbara Kingsolver. Her manager, just a pace behind,
suggested Ms. Florey's own latest book.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning in the TriBeCa offices of a software company
called Muze, the same Kitty Florey typed into a computer the
catalog information and plot summary of ``The Man in the Box,''
Thomas Moran's novel about an Austrian family that shelters a
Jewish doctor from the Nazis. Then she listed the book under such
categories as ``caring and caretaking,'' ``fugitives'' and
``Holocaust survivors.'' All the material became part of Muze's
data base, which some 300 bookstores offer to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Florey's evolution parallels American society's: from an
old-fashioned, personal brand of taste-making to a high-tech
variety made possible by the advent of what is known as agent
software. This software, sometimes described with the more specific
term ``collaborative filtering,'' compiles information that
consumers provide about their taste in the arts and past buying
patterns and analyzes the data to recommend books, videos, films
and CDs. It is used by such major retailers as the online bookstore
Amazon.com and the Columbia House music club. Microsoft recently
paid $40 million to acquire the agent-software company Firefly, and
Amazon.com just leased Muze's software for use in its new online
music store.
</P>
<P>
   As such developments demonstrate, artificial intelligence is
offering an alternative to _ or even a replacement for _
flesh-and-blood arbiters of culture. The consumer who decades ago
took cues from a critic like Edmund Wilson or a mass-audience
magazine like the original Life can now click on Muze or Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us feel a little uncomfortable,'' says Ms. Florey, the
senior fiction editor at Muze, ``because we all come from a
background of studying literature and believing great books are
beyond categorization. At the same time, you feel like you're
opening it up to people who wouldn't go down that path otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Florey's own divided feelings frame the larger debate. For
the creators and buyers of agent software, it gives consumers a
matchless tool for navigating through an overwhelming number of
choices to find art they will cherish. For critics, including those
conversant with computer technology, collaborative-filtering
software threatens to take the idiosyncratic process of forming an
esthetic and replace it with the soulless logic of code.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are losing their ability to really reason for
themselves, to look at things for themselves,'' says Patricia
Galvis Assmus, a fine-arts professor who directs the Center for
Research in Art and Technology at the University of Massachusetts.
``In one sense, collaborative filtering is not that different from
a bibliography at the end of a scholarly report. And that's fine.
The problem is that people rely on it solely and don't take the
initiative beyond the software. In this country, people are so
enthused with technology that browsing a library just isn't as
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Assmus' vision does not persuade fellow scholars like David
Thornburn, a professor of literature and director of the
Communications Forum seminar series at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. He has been pleased to click onto Amazon.com's Web
site and find its Netperception software presenting him with book
titles based on those he most recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel as if cultural value is threatened by this
software,'' Thornburn says. ``It seems not to have a judging
function but a consumer-advice function. I had bought `Cold
Mountain' for a gift, and the software was intelligent enough not
to offer me every other best seller. It didn't recommend Tom
Clancy. It recommended `The God of Small Things,''' also a first
novel of literary distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made that distinction,'' he added. ``It was accurate about
the things I enjoy reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent software arose in the late 1980s from a mixture of
commercial and cultural motives. John Hey, later one of the
founders of the software company Likeminds, started out as an MIT
student and movie buff who wanted to be steered to films without
having to learn plot details from reviews or conversations. Hey
invented two forms of collaborative-filtering software, installed
them in kiosks and sold the kiosks to video stores in the Cambridge
area. The store's customers put in their ratings of films they
rented, forming a reservoir of data that could be matched to the
personal preferences entered by any user.
</P>
<P>
   Muze developed a different approach. It began by leasing and
digitizing printed catalogs of music and books. Then it hired
people like Ms. Florey to cross-reference the entries by themes,
categories, genres and subgenres. These range from such
conventional terms as literary/avant-garde to those Muze itself has
coined like galactic empires and space opera. Lately, the Muze
staff has passionately debated whether to add the designation angst
bunny for what Ms. Florey described as ``young women in the Village
with black clothes and lots of body piercings.''

 Former Sybase Workers' Startup Gets $10 Million in Cash  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gang of refugees from Sybase havespawned a new genre of
databases, and today their startup will be blessed with $10 million
in venture cash.
</P>
<P>
   Even in these inflated times, that's a big bet on Cloudscape
Inc., which is trying to popularize a program that ships data to
handheld devices.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudscape of Oakland was born two years ago when ex-Sybase
engineers Nat Wyatt and Howard Torf saw opportunity in two trends.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the rise of Java, a programming language that
creates portable programs which can travel easily over the
Internet. The second was the popularity of Palm Pilots and now
Windows CE devices, handhelds too small to run conventional
databases.
</P>
<P>
   For their first $500,000 in seed funding, Wyatt and Torf lined
up impressive backers like Informix co-founder Roger Sippl and
longtime Sybase marketing whiz Stewart Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   Today's financing round is led by Mohr, Davidow Ventures, which
hopes the $10 million cash inflow will send Cloudscape aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Merv Adrian, an industry analyst with Giga Information Systems,
said Cloudscape will need that cash to compete with the current
market leader in mobile databases _ a prize if you guessed that
it's Sybase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real trick ... is to line up software partners to create
niche applications, and that costs money,'' Adrian said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate objective is to create programs that insurance
brokers might use on Windows CE handhelds, or that car salesmen
might whip out on a Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sybase and Oracle both have databases that send info to
mobile gadgets, IDC analyst Evan Quinn said Cloudscape's database
is written in Java, which has the technical advantage of being
easier to ship over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudscape won't have the Java-database space to itself for
long. DataBean in San Mateo is working on a competing Java-based
package. DataBean was founded by Bruce Scott, formerly one of the
top database programmers at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Zooming in: &LR;  San Francisco-based Xoom will announce today that
it has acquired SiteMail, a vendor of free Web-based e-mail for an
unspecified sum. Xoom will soon add free e-mail to the list of
services it offers members.
</P>
<P>
   What is Xoom? If you have to ask, then you're not one of the 1.7
million people who've created personal Web pages in Xoom's
fast-growing electronic community.
</P>
<P>
   Xoomers pay no fees for their plots in cyberspace. Instead,
users fill out personal profiles and agree to accept e-mail sales
pitches that, in another context, would be called spam. Xoom gets
paid for being the middleman in these direct marketing pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in September 1996 by veteran entrepreneurs Chris Kitze
of Lycos and Laurent Massa of the Learning Company, Xoom's
35-person staff is adding new members at the rate of 22,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The company is currently in a quiet period prior to the filing
of an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Car talk? &LR;  With four venture capitalists on stage, the
Churchill Club had a sellout crowd at last week's dinner speech in
Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   With the Valley awash in cash, and everybody carrying around a
business plan, dinner-goers hoped to grab a card from such venture
veterans as Sam Colella, Irwin Federman and Michael Child.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jim Breyer of Accel Partners who stole the show by
treating the crowd to a translation of venture capital euphemisms.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when VCs say their startup is pursuing ``an
acquisition strategy,'' what they really mean is their current
products have no market. ``Limited downside'' is just another way
to say things can't get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Breyer waxed serious long enough to say that when evaluating
startups, he looks for Hondas in their parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a profit mentality and expense controls from
Day One,'' said Breyer, who steers clear of firms with Porches and
Beemers out front.
</P>

 UNDATED: body piercings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such discussions underscore the fact that the intelligence
behind the software is not artificial; the raw material was
provided by human beings, whether customers typing in their book
preferences or editors in computer companies deciding how to
categorize a particular book. What the software does, in computer
jargon, is ``find patterns in the noise'' _ use mathematical
formulas to determine which books or films or CD's had the greatest
probability of matching either a consumer's stated preferences or
actual record of purchases. Although not all retailers choose to do
so, they can have the software adjusted to put extra emphasis on
particular titles.
</P>
<P>
   In whatever variation, collaborative-filtering software surged
with the refinement of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the
early 1990s. Likeminds, for instance, went on line for such clients
as Columbia House, the cable network Cinemax and the Web site
Moviecritic.com. What customers got was convenience in choosing a
product; what retailers got was an identity and a marketing profile
of each buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Technological innovation, though, tells only half the story of
the agent-software bonanza. The software entered the cultural
marketplace just as the power of highbrow critics, general interest
magazines and television networks unchallenged by cable was
dissipating.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons for the mandarins and the shapers of
opinion in the past is that there were limitations on the
availability of information to people,'' says Stephen Kanzler, the
president and chief executive officer of Likeminds. ``Fifty years
ago, even 20 years ago, how many people actually got to go to the
Louvre or the Metropolitan Museum of Art? So if there was an
opinion needed on a work of art or a book or a cultural trend, we
were dependent on the people who had access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the information is ubiquitous. You can look at the Louvre
collection on the Net. The sifting of information and opinion is
the problem. It's the old drinking-from-the-fire-hose problem. How
do you sort through it? An agent can help a consumer get what he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Florey of Muze speaks more bluntly. Speaking of the New
Haven bookstore, she says: ``At a place like the Foundry, we didn't
need machines. The guy who owned it prided himself on knowing. At
the superstores, there's nobody you can ask. They don't have
booksellers who make their career out of loving books.''
</P>
<P>
   But precisely because agent software intends to cater to
personal taste as a commercial strategy _ Likeminds' slogan is
``Every individual a market'' _ scholars like Carol Gigliotti of
Ohio State University criticize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Firefly Web site, you'll see this phrase,
`loyal and dynamic communities built on shared interest,''' says
Gigliotti, a professor in the Advanced Computing Center for the
Arts and Design and the project director for an online journal
about computer ethics. ``What these dynamic communities are about
is brand loyalty. They're not about an idea, a value, a spiritual
concept. They're about the market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, where the prevailing political philosophy seems
to be libertarian, the notion of a vast bazaar of information is
populist. Even as a literary critic himself, Thornburn of MIT
contends that the pre-eminent cultural critics of mid-century
America performed a disservice by creating ``a false dichotomy
between high culture and popular culture,'' stranding art forms
like jazz. Agent software, in comparison, weights any and every
opinion equally.
</P>
<P>
   Which is part of what disturbs Dr. Gigliotti. ``There's a big
difference between knowledge and wisdom,'' she says. ``And a great
deal of what's on the Web has to do with information, which is
confused with knowledge, which is confused with wisdom. Wisdom can
understand knowledge and decipher information. We're allowing a
very random, nonexperiential machine to say what we should like.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate proceeds, Kitty Florey writes novels by night and
enters data by day, her office shelves crowded with the London
Review of Books, the Threepenny Review and a cheese sandwich on
whole wheat. A few carrels over works Molly Siemers, the
genre-fiction editor. As an English major at Vassar, Ms. Siemers
wrote a thesis on the author Djuna Barnes' refusal to be
categorized for her blackness or lesbianism.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Ms. Florey and Ms. Siemers have paused in their
categorizing duties to determine which books carried the most
cross-references. The winner, as well as they can reckon, is ``Tom
Jones,'' without about 150. Proust also ranks high, as does
``Middlemarch.'' And there are several unexpected competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given my own books dozens of themes,'' Ms. Florey says.
``I'm shameless.''

 Windows 98 Upgrade Just Windows Dressing  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows 98 proves a main contention of Microsoft's most vocal
critics: Take away competition, and innovation also disappears.
</P>
<P>
   How else can you explain this uninspiring ``upgrade'' to Windows
95, which goes on sale Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 contains few improvements over Windows 95, the
operating system that runs most of the personal computers in the
universe. And none of the improvements are earthshaking enough to
make anyone run out and pay $89 for it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not as bad as Apple, whose wheezing Macintosh
operating system is looking for a major overhaul 14 years after its
introduction. But you'd think the world's largest software company
could come up with something exciting in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made no secret of its plan to combine Windows with
Windows NT, the version of the operating system used in corporate
networks. That will take place sometime next year. So Windows 98 is
really just a placeholder, something Microsoft hopes will keep
sales up in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, most new PCs will come with Windows 98. The
real question is whether individuals who already own PCs should buy
the upgrade, which includes the latest version of Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: If your Windows 95 system is doing the job for you,
if your printer and modem and other peripherals work properly and
if your Internet setup is satisfactory, don't bother with Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you already may have some of the advantages claimed by
Windows 98, and you can get others for free:
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft's free Web browser, Internet Explorer 4.0, includes
the Active Desktop that comes with Windows 98. This feature lets
you single-click your way around and makes folders look like Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   _Windows 98 comes with DirectX technology that improves the
performance of 3-D video games. But most high-performance games
also come with DirectX, which you can install at the same time you
install the game.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 does have a few genuine goodies. It launches
applications a little faster than its predecessor. And it's also
faster at shutting down your system.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it has built-in support for DVD drives and USB ports,
which let you plug in printers, scanners and such and use them
without first having to configure them.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is easier than Windows 95 to set up the first time
you use it. The program automatically configures printers, monitors
and other peripherals. On the down side, it can take up to an hour
to install the program.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also makes it easier to get on the Web, with an
Internet Connection Wizard that recommends an Internet service
provider in your area and guides you through the process of signing
up.
</P>
<P>
   Other small benefits: There's a ``Maintenance Wizard'' for
keeping your PC fine-tuned, trouble-shooting wizards for when
things go wrong, and a feature for automatically going online and
updating Windows when Microsoft comes up with improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, however, is that Windows 98 looks almost
identical to Windows 95, and the average person might not be able
to tell the difference at all.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- For most computer users, the burning issue concerning
Microsoft's Windows 98 isn't the one grabbing the headlines _ the
antitrust questions it raises for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, home computer users are wondering whether they should
be lining up at dawn on Thursday to buy the latest version of
Windows when it officially hits the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Microsoft bills the newest Windows as a much
improved version: faster, less likely to cause your computer to
crash or freeze, and loaded with dozens of new features to make
computing easier and more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as predictably, given the contrary nature of writers and
analysts, the majority of those folks see Windows 98 as a
relatively minor upgrade. It's been called a stopgap release
designed to provide bug fixes and updates that are already
available free for the downloading to Web-savvy users at
Microsoft's site (http://www.microsoft.com).
</P>
<P>
   This is the last in the consumer-grade series of Windows. The
way things stand now, it's unlikely there will be a Windows 2000 or
2003. Microsoft plans to standardize _ something the company is
famous for already _ on Windows NT in upcoming releases. In the
future, there probably will be several versions of NT, Microsoft's
industrial strength version of Windows, which _ up to now _ has
been mostly aimed at businesses and power users.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using the beta version of Windows 98 for several
months and installed an advance copy of the final commercial
version that will be sold in stores for $109. The recommendations
aren't as easy to make as when Windows 95 was introduced. That
program was a clear technical knockout winner when compared to
Windows 3.1, which it replaced.
</P>
<P>
   So you'll have to decide. To better help you make up your mind,
let's take a look at some of the things that set Windows 98 apart.
</P>
<P>
   Look and feel
</P>
<P>
   Most people will be delighted to know that the familiar Windows
desktop hasn't changed much. In fact, unless you watch the Windows
98 startup screen, you'd be hard-pressed to tell at a glance
whether the program is Windows 95 or 98. While those who put a lot
of stock in the way a program looks may be disappointed, most
people will be glad to know that they won't have to relearn
Windows. Unlike the shift between 3.1 and Windows 95, you won't
need the skimpy user's manual to know how to launch programs and
use most Windows features.
</P>
<P>
   Stability
</P>
<P>
   This is Microsoft's biggest selling point _ this Windows is the
most stable yet. While even a few months of everyday use isn't
enough to make any definitive judgments about stability, it does
seem less likely to crash or freeze. The chief complaint of some
analysts _ that this is a minor upgrade _ may actually work in
Windows' favor here. Since it is not a radical redesign, there was
plenty of time to fix problems discovered in Windows 95 and not
enough changes to introduce many new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Installation
</P>
<P>
   Most experienced users know this, but novice computer users will
be relieved to know the installation process is automatic and does
not remove any of the programs or data used under Windows 95. I've
installed Windows on six separate machines and _ with one exception
_ the installations were flawless. The one exception was a PC
connected to a local area network. Apparently, some of the
specialized network software caused problems and _ when the
computer was restarted _ it reported that some of the files needed
for the LAN were missing. However, reinstalling that software and
then reinstalling Windows 98 solved the problem. Expect to spend
about 45 minutes to an hour installing Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   New features
</P>
<P>
   There are too many to list and describe here. But heading the
list of the most important changes is FAT32. FAT is computerese for
``file allocation table'' and describes the way computers and hard
disks keep track of and store programs and data. With this version
of Windows, FAT32 offers a much more efficient method and some
users _ especially those with extremely large hard disks _ may save
hundreds of megabytes of storage space because of the efficiencies
of this new method.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty feature is the ability of the disk fragmentation
software to change where your programs are stored on your hard disk
based on how often you use each program. By putting the most often
used programs in the best positions, they'll load faster at the
expense of loading time of seldom-used programs. You'll need to use
the defragmentation program several times before you'll notice a
difference but _ over time _ you will see improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the controversial melding of Internet Explorer
and the Windows desktop. That's one of the features that caused the
Justice Department to file the antitrust suit, since new users may
never try the competing browser from Netscape. Using this feature,
you can make launching a program and navigating through the file
system very much like using the Web. You get a more graphical look
and only need to single-click to perform most functions. However,
this feature seems to slow down most computers dramatically and has
not been popular with many earlier users.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, what's the answer to the big question: Do you
line up at dawn on Thursday to buy Windows 98?
</P>
<P>
   A lot depends on whether you enjoy the early morning. Windows 98
itself isn't enough of a change to make that dawn trip. However, it
is a legitimate improvement _ as you would expect from a major
program developed by a company with the resources of Microsoft _
and there's no doubt that most of us will be installing new Windows
sooner or later.

 Free-Speech Victory in Internet Case  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online free-speech advocates scored a major legal victory
yesterday when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Internet service
providers are not liable for defamatory material that appears on
their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the nation's high court let stand a federal
appeals court decision which determined that the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 shields providers against legal attack for libelous or
obscene material they distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision encourages full and robust speech on the
Internet,'' a relieved AOL general counsel George Vradenburg told
The Chronicle. ``If the phone company were responsible for
filtering the content of every call that contained comments that
were libelous, pornographic or hate-filled, voice traffic would
grind to a halt. And so would correspondence on the Internet _ if
we had lost this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The court justices denied an appeal by Kenneth Zeran, a Seattle
artist and filmmaker, who sued AOL in 1996 for defamation after
being the victim of a wide-scale cyberhoax.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City in 1995, an unknown user posted a message on an AOL
message board that advertised ``Naughty Oklahoma T-Shirts.''
Prospective customers were instructed to call ``Ken'' at Zeran's
home phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, similar messages were posted on AOL
message boards, prompting a tidal wave of abusive phone calls and
eventually the wrath of an Oklahoma City radio station announcer,
who encouraged listeners to call Zeran's home.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail was exposed as a ruse a few weeks later. The
perpetrator is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Zeran sued AOL in 1996, insisting the company had a duty to
remove the defamatory posting immediately, tell its members that
the message was untrue and screen future defamatory material. He
said AOL removed the fake ad, but refused to post a retraction as a
matter of company policy.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge in Virginia and then a federal appeals
court ruled in favor of AOL, Zeran appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court. He said his case presented the court ``with the first
opportunity to interpret the limits of immunity granted online
service providers'' by the 2-year-old Telecom Act.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers have keenly followed the Zeran case
as a signpost of their responsibility for material posted on their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been a spate of libel cases ensnaring
Internet companies as third parties,this is the first to involve
the country's high court.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge Incident
</P>
<P>
   In April, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman dismissed AOL as
a defendant in a White House adviser's $30 million defamation suit.
Sidney Blumenthal and his wife, Jacqueline, sued AOL and
self-styled ``Internet informer'' Matt Drudge over an inaccurate
online report in August that said Blumenthal had a ``spousal abuse
past.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL pays Drudge, who unearthed the Monica Lewisky scandal,
$3,000 a month to distribute his column.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedman ruled that Drudge himself is still potentially
liable and must defend the lawsuit in Washington, D.C., rather than
in California where he is based. Blumenthal sued the columnist even
though Drudge retracted the story and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, however, erases any doubts
about an Internet service provider's culpability and treats them
more like phone companies than the Fourth Estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is better off if we don't treat ISPs as publishers.
They are common carriers,'' said Tom Leonard, a University of
California at Berkeley journalism professor. ``Once you try to
regulate content online, you're heading down a dangerous road.''
</P>
<P>
   Providers are ``thrilled with the ruling,'' said Deb Howard,
president of ISP Consortium, a Minneapolis organization that
represents 220 small- to mid-sized providers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that ISPs should not be held responsible
for their customers' posting,'' Howard said. ``Don't shoot the
medium, go after the person with the message. We can't be the
thought police and we certainly aren't the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Russo, a computer law attorney in Palo Alto, said the
decision ``gives the Internet freer rein in what people can say
than the traditional media. It doesn't put any control on what
people say online.
</P>
<P>
   ``ISPs are passive carriers,'' Russo said. ``It is very hard for
them to police their environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're AOL.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, a Mammoth Operation
</P>
<P>
   The world'3 most popular online service has little control over
what its 12 million subscribers say online: It processes 30 million
pieces of e-mail a day and oversees 19,000 chat rooms. AOL's
Instant Messenger Service, which lets Web users chat and send
instant messages to one another,is available to more than 80
million Web users.
</P>
<P>
   AOL monitors language on its chat rooms under a terms of service
agreement that prohibits vulgarity, obscenity and threatening
messages from its users. The policy, like Netcom's and others, is
intended to maintain a community standard. Violators of the
so-called TOS face expulsion from the online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to set a standard somewhere between a phone company
and the press: We're not AT&AMP;T abd we're not ABC,'' AOL's Vradenburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Netcom spokeswoman said the San Jose ISP does not believe in
monitoring its customers' online conversations, but it will not
hesitate to eject subscribers who frequently use offensive language
under its terms of service agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sacrifice the rights of the many for the stupidity of
the few,'' said ISP Consortium's Howard.
</P>
<P>
   She empathizes with Zeran, she said, but believes he chose the
wrong party to sue. ``Hash out your problems with the other person
and, if you have to, contact the local authorities. To implicate
the carrier is not the point.''

CONFERENCE TAKES ON INTERNET PRIVACY AGAIN  
 COPYRIGHT TREATY RAISES CONCERNS ON RESEARCH  
 SMALL START-UP TO OFFER FIRST HDTV BROADCASTS

   Conference Takes On Internet Privacy Again
</P>
<P>
   If the Commerce Department's weekly conference calls are any
indication, the chief result of its summit meeting on Internet
privacy in Washington this week will very likely be frustration on
all sides.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 75 representatives from government, industry and
civil liberties groups burning up the phone lines during marathon
sessions recently on such topics as children's privacy and
legislative alternatives to self-regulation, the dialogue has
followed a distinctly predictable pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry says, `This is what we're doing to protect privacy;
we say, `It's not enough,''' Mark Rotenberg, the director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, said in an
interview. ``It's kind of a nightmare actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the growth of the Inturnet and electronic commerce
depends on the government's staying out of the way, the Clinton
administration has advocated a policy of self-policing to address
widespread concern by Internet users over their personal privacy on
line. But in the wake of a Federal Trade Commission report that
found the online industry had taken virtually no steps over the
last year to ensure consumer privacy, that position is getting
harder to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the agenda for this week's privacy conference is
chock-full of industry panels with titles like ``Evaluating the
Effectiveness of Self-Regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   And a group of about 50 companies and associations is set to
announce the creation of an ``online privacy alliance,'' whose
members will have to take a pledge to participate in ``effective
and appropriate self-regulatory enforcement activities and
mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the summit meeting, the Commerce Department is
supposed to submit its own report to President Clinton next month
evaluating the state of online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I expect that on the first of July we'll be able to say
effective self-regulation is in place; no, absolutely not,'' said
Becky Burr, the assistant secretary of commerce. ``But somebody
told me U.S. businesses often rally in the last few minutes of the
game.'' _ AMY HARMON
</P>
<P>
   Copyright Treaty Raises Concerns on Research
</P>
<P>
   Legislation intended to strengthen international copyright
protections in cyberspace has run into an unexpected enemy: some of
the United States' best computeR-security experts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bill would ratify two international treaties
negotiated under the authority of the World Intellectual Property
Organization, both of which have the backing of some of the
nation's largest media companies and software publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But language in the House bill, which is expected to come before
the Commerce Committe% this week, has alarmed computer security
experts, who say that House Resolution 2281 would make it illegal
for them to carry out their basic work in testing computer security
by barring attempts to break the security safeguards used to
prevent unauthorized copying of creative work published on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should security products be exempt from Consumer
Reports-style analysis?'' said Bruce Schneier, president of
Counterpane Systems, a security consulting firm in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of the House bill said that the proposed law was
broader than the treaty because it was intended to keep people from
undermining online copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sent forward by the House Commerce Subcommittee on
Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection last week, and is
to be reviewed this week by the full House Commerce Committee. _

   Small Start-Up to Offer First HDTV Broadcasts
</P>
<P>
   After years of high-profile planning for high-definition
television, the first regularly scheduled national HDTV broadcasts
will be by a company with a decidedly low profile.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up company, Unity Motion, based in St. Louis, plans to
transmit its first experimental programming Tuesday at a
demonstration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to show that we really can broadcast,'' said Sean
Henry, a company vice president. ``Up to now we've just been a
small company nobody's ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity Motion, which was founded six years ago, received a
financial infusion in February from Marion Bass Securities, a
venture capital firm in Charlotte, N.C. Using that money, Unity
Motion has ambitious plans for a direct-broadcast satellite HDTV
service.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in September and using leased space on a Telstar
satellite, the company intends to begin full-time broadcasting of
two channels of high-definition programming _ movies, sports and
other entertainment shows, from programmers still to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, the company hopes to have four to six
channels on the air and 30 within two years.
</P>
<P>
   As with all early HDTV broadcasts, receiving the service will
require real motivation on the part of the consumer. A subsariber
will need a small satellite dish and a Unity Motion receiver box
that, together, will sell for $2,495.
</P>
<P>
   These will not be compatible with other satellite television
services. Until the first HDTV sets go on sale in the fall at a
price of $7,000 or more, the only televisions capable of displaying
these or any other HDTV signals will be expensive projection TV
sets capable of showing high-resolution images.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to give consumers a financial breather, Unity Motion
will not begin charging its monthly subscription fee of $30 or $40
until next spring. _ JOEL BRINKLEY

THE LEARNING COMPANY MAKES BID FOR BRODERBUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN FOST   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Learning Co. made a $419 million bid yesterday to acquire
Novato-based Broderbund Software, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's board of directors met yesterday to decide whether
to accept the offer, the sources said. The board's decision was not
known last night, and spokespeople for both companies refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the deal would create a software powerhouse.
Broderbund is one of the pioneers of educational multimedia
software, and its computer games Myst and Riven are among the
best-selling titles of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., based in Cambridge, Mass., has roots in
Fremont, and it maintains an office there. It is locked in a fierce
battle with Cendant Corp. for dominance in the educational software
market, and it has voraciously acquired smaller software firms,
including Novato-based Mindscape in March and San Francisco-based
PF.Magic in May. Earlier this month, it acquired Sofsource, a
publisher of educational and test software, for about $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The price of $20 a share is 21 percent above Broderbund's Friday
closing price of $16.50. The Learning Co. stock closed at $25
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the deal is expected to close by August 31.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund strongly hinted last week that it was up for sale.
Rumors that Hasbro was considering buying the company sent
Broderbund's stock up 30 percent over two weeks, and Broderbund
announced that it had hired Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to
``explore strategic alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Broderbund also announced that its earnings for the
third quarter would fall short of analysts' expectations. It
forecast a loss of 12 to 15 cents per share, or $2.5 million to
$3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, Broderbund has eliminated 135 positions,
all in the Bay Area. It currently employs 1,100 people, 320 of whom
are in Novato.
</P>
<P>
   Although sources said no immediate layoffs would be announced,
many of Broderbund's products overlap with The Learning Co.'s
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's The Print Shop competes with Mindscape's
Printmaster, and the two companies also have competing genealogy
products.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Rodoni, Broderbund group vice president who oversaw the
education, productivity and genealogy business units, would leave
the company, according to sources. Rodoni, who joined Broderbund
when it acquired Banner Blue of Fremont, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Broderbund's educational titles, including the popular
Carmen Sandiego series and its Living Books division's Dr. Seuss
software, make it a logical choice for a merger with The Learning
Co., according to John Girton of Larkspur-based Girton Capital
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education-wise, there's a nice fit,'' Girton said.
</P>
<P>
   When The Learning Co. acquired Mindscape, company President
Kevin O'Leary declared, ``Our strategy is to be the No. 1 consumer
software company, period.'' With that acquisition, The Learning Co.
became No. 2 in number of software packages sold through stores,
second only to Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. _ which employs about 260 workers in Fremont
and Redwood City _ faltered last year, laying off about 50
employees and paring back its product line. Since that time, the
firm has trimmed its debt and gone on a buying binge. In 1997, The
Learning Co. recorded a loss of $475,000 on sales of $392.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund lost $13 million on sales of $192 million last year.
Girton said the company should register close to $300 million in
sales this year, and he noted that it holds $137 million in cash
and short-term investments, which would be substantial assets for a
debt-heavy company like The Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   Once a high-flyer, Broderbund has struggled in recent years as
the consumer software market grew increasingly cutthroat. During a
period of furious consolidation, Broderbund was the last well-known
maker of consumer software to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., then based in Fremont, was bought by
Massachusetts-based Softkey in 1995, and the combined company took
the name of the acquired firm.

HOME NETWORKING GETS BIG BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JONATHAN MARSHALL   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of leading high-tech companies is announcing support
today for technology that could slash the cost of wiring homes for
high-speed computer networks to less than $100 per computer.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to hook computers together over existing phone
wires so family members can surf the Web together, share printers
or shoot one another in computer game competitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Phoneline Networking Alliance enjoys support from such
giants as Advanced Micro Devices, AT&AMP;T, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM and Intel Corp. It promises to get inexpensive home networking
technology into stores by the fourth quarter of 1998 _ in time for
holiday shopping sprees.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 15 million U.S. households already have two or more
PCs, but only a tiny fraction have networks to link them up. A
major deterrent is the complexity and mess of wiring up old houses
_ a job that can easily cost as much as a new computer if done by a
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   If the alliance has its way, consumers will be able to create an
instant network simply by plugging their computers into a phone
jack. They will need to install a special network card into their
computer or buy an inexpensive device that connects between a
parallel or USB port and a phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   Such devices are expected to cost under $100 per computer, said
Cyrus Namazi, a marketing manager at AMD in Sunnyvale and chairman
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, many computers will have chips on their
motherboard to make phone-line networks even simpler.
</P>
<P>
   The standard should ensure low prices for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD, Lucent, 3Com, Intel and Rockwell are all competitors, but
we are trying to build the market'' through the alliance, Namazi
said. ``We are cooperating to proliferate this technology. As soon
as the market's big enough, we'll go cut each other's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   If the technology is truly ``plug 'n' play'' _ a key goal of the
alliance _ consumers should find plenty of applications for home
networks, Namazi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a child upstairs working on homework and a mother
downstairs wanting to get access to her corporate network, they can
share Internet access,'' he said. ``You could put a network camera
near the crib to keep an eye on the baby or at the door to see
who's knocking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Arlen of Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.,
questioned whether consumers would flock to embrace the technology.
``The whole idea of a home network is so geek-oriented that it's
very difficult to see this as a mass market anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said he projected that more than 7 million U.S.
homes will have computer networks by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But he said most applications proposed for such networks, such
as sharing files and printers or playing games, have little appeal
to consumers. ``The main driver for this technology will be sharing
high-speed Internet access,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is embracing technology devised by Tut Systems in
Pleasant Hill, a privately held company founded in 1991 by Martin
Graham and Matt Taylor, a professor and graduate student at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Tut's ``HomeRun'' technology allows data to race across phone
wires at speeds up to 1 megabit per second, roughly 40 times faster
than a standard modem. Ordinary phone service isn't affected.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Tut announced that it received $15 million in
new investments from three strategic partners: Microsoft Corp.,
Tokyo-based Itochu International, and AT&AMP;T Ventures. Microsoft
announced a marketing alliance with Tut last year.
</P>
<P>
   A Sunnyvale startup, Epigram, is working on phone networking
technology operating at 10 megabits per second, equal to the speed
of most common corporate networks. Epigram is a founder of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Many other companies are pushing alternative home networking
strategies. Utah-based Intelogis Inc., for instance, sells devices
for under $100 that plug into electrical sockets in the wall and
send data over home power lines. But its network tops out at 350
kilobits per second and requires encryption to prevent neighbors
from picking up the signals on their power lines.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Home Radio Frequency Working Group, which includes
some of the same players in today's announcement, said it would
promote wireless home networks, using radio links to connect
computers, printers and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern California startup, ShareWave, promises this fall to
make available this wireless equipment capable of multimegabit
speeds, but the cost is likely to be several hundred dollars per
computer. Its technology could be useful for reaching rooms with no
phone jacks or mobile computer users lounging by the pool.

CONSORTIUM SEEKS TO CREATE IN-HOME COMPUTER NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bid to make computer networks as common in homes as they
are in offices, 11 high technology companies including IBM, Lucent
and Compaq have teamed up to develop standards for systems that
transmit data at high speeds over the copper telephone wiring
inside almost every house and apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The companies intend to announce the formation of the group,
called the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance, Monday at the
Digital Living Room conference in Laguna Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the computer industry, the telephone and cable
television industries have been rushing to develop new ways to link
homes to cyberspace at speeds that far exceed those possible using
today's common modems.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's large local phone carriers have joined with Compaq
Computer Corp., Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in a group called
the Universal ADSL Consortium in an attempt to deliver torrents of
data over phone wires. Many of the nation's largest cable
television companies have formed a venture called At Home to do the
same thing using cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   But those initiatives have done little to address how computers
and other advanced electronic devices communicate within homes. The
consortium being announced Monday plans to use telephone wiring to
create fast in-home networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using phone lines, consumers don't have to rewire the
house, they don't have to put in any external hubs, they don't have
to add any connections,'' said Mark Carpenter, director for
Internet and home networking for Compaq, the No. 1 maker of
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to publish its first technical standards in the
third quarter and expects its members to ship products based on the
technology by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, for instance, could include plug-in cards in its
computers that allow users to make an in-home network simply by
plugging computers into standard telephone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium expects its efforts to enable data-transmission
rates of up to one megabit a second. That is more than 20 times the
speeds generally made possible by today's telephone modems but is
much slower than the speeds used in modern office networks.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said the technology would allow people to use their
telephones in the standard fashion even as the same wires carry
Internet data between machines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tony Grewe, an applications strategy manager for Lucent
Technology Inc.'s microelectronics unit, said the group at Lucent
that was working with the new group was separate from the task
force working with the ADSL consortium, but that the two groups
consult regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides games, most people would seem to have little use for a
quick in-home network if the home itself had no high-speed link to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The core technology for the group's efforts is being provided by
two small private companies, Tut Systems Inc., based in Pleasant
Hill, Calif., and Epigram Inc., based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The
other members of the group are 3Com Corp., Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., AT&AMP;T Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel and Rockwell
International.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the group does not include any local phone companies.
``The phone companies have no control over these lines inside
houses,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is not in the local phone business in a major way, but its
wireless unit is leading the company's involvement with the home
networking consortium. AT&AMP;T has explored the use of wireless
technology to offer routine local phone service. So far, those
efforts have borne little fruit in the market.

WINDOWS 98 PACKS TV PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WARREN WILSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Any new product succeeds or fails based on what might
be called its bomb index, how much bang it gives for the buck. In
the case of Windows 98, the index should also include the length of
the fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from antitrust issues, discussion about the
operating-system upgrade Microsoft Corp. will release Thursday has
focused on what it will deliver right away _ smoother operation,
more Internet features, more disk space, for example _ and whether
those things are worth about $90 at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important over the long term are new features in Windows
98 that most consumers may not notice at first: software that turns
the personal computer into an intelligent, interactive television
and delivers mountains of news, entertainment and financial
information without tying up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The reason these features may take awhile to ignite consumer
interest is that they require a television tuner card, an add-in
device still far from commonplace in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   But hardware makers are pushing to make tuner cards an easy,
inexpensive option for consumers. Microsoft, by adding the software
to Windows today, is aiming to foster and profit from another
explosive business as the computer and the television come together
at last.
</P>
<P>
   Sound cards provide a good analogy, said Steve Guggenheimer, the
Microsoft product manager responsible for its digital television
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we added sound support into the operating system,
adding a sound card was pretty hard to to. Now you can't find a PC
without a sound card,'' Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've added the fundamental building blocks for TV
reception, it will start to increase over time,'' he said. ``It's
another logical extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes new software called WebTV for Windows that,
in conjunction with a tuner card, turns the PC into a television
monitor and program guide. It lets the user make transactions or
find out more about a topic _ tools that are similar to, though
separate from, those in Microsoft's WebTV set-top products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just used the WebTV brand to represent the TV technologies
that have been added to the PC,'' Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also includes a similar technology from Intel Corp.
called Intercast that combines images and data, an example of which
is NBC's coverage of the U.S. Open over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers could follow the action on San Francisco's
Olympic Club golf course in the conventional way, but Intercast
viewers could click on graphics on their PC screens to study the
course hole by hole, find biographical data about the contestants
and learn more about the PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation packaged with Windows 98 is a
data-broadcasting service developed by a Phoenix company called
WavePhore.
</P>
<P>
   Called WaveTop, it distributes various types of news,
entertainment, financial and other data using a portion of the
television signal called the ``vertical blanking interval,'' the
horizontal black stripe that appears on a television screen when
the vertical-hold control goes haywire. Users view the information
in a browser, just as they would on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   WavePhore reaches 100 U.S. markets, about 85 percent of the
population, through a distribution deal with the Public
Broadcasting Service.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar in concept to the popular Pointcast service on the
Internet, but because the data is sent in a TV signal, it can be
updated constantly without tying up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   WaveTop transmits 170 megabytes of data every day _ 10 megabytes
an hour for 17 hours a day, general manager Sandy Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   WavePhore officially launched the service in April, but is
counting on a boost from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's going to generate a tremendous awareness of
broadcasting data to your home PC,'' Goldman said. ``That's one of
the main objectives for us _ to hitch our wagon to Microsoft, to
help us educate the market. And second, by including our software
in (Windows 98), you don't have to look for it _ it's already
included.''
</P>
<P>
   As demand grows, a number of manufacturers are vying to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ATI Technologies makes a product called the ``All-In-Wonder''
that combines TV-tuner and graphics adapter capabilities, and
replaces the computer's existing video card.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Hauppauge Computer Works and ixMicro, make
boards that work in conjunction with the existing video card.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary, but have dropped substantially in the past couple
of years, said Mike Richmond, manager of broadcast products in
Intel's consumer products group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really a testament to the cost reduction that's very
common in our industry,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   A few computer makers have begun including TV tuners as standard
equipment, but it will be awhile before they become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers ``don't want to make a device standard until
they can get it for under $30,'' which typically means $75 to the
customer, said Scott Naylor, product manager at ixMicro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to get the cost down low enough to where it can
be part of a standard machine,'' Naylor said. ``And we're also
working with them to do build-to-order options.''
</P>
<P>
   A tuner board is often a good option for someone buying a new
computer for a home office, he said. For $80 or so, it adds TV
features that would cost a few hundred dollars in a separate unit.
The same logic applies in college dorms, where computers are
common, but space and money are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Tuner boards are also popular with stock brokers, who use them
in desktop computers to monitor television news, and in Pacific Rim
countries, where tiny apartments make it difficult to install a
television and a computer monitor, said Rufus Connell, an analyst
with Frost &AMP; Sullivan in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, adding TV functions to the PC is not about
replacing the television, Microsoft's Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of putting the PC in the living room and
everyone in the family huddling around it to watch TV,'' he said.
``It's a matter of getting TV information in another area, when I'm
not close to a TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of television and computer technology won't
result in a single all-powerful device, he said. Instead, just the
opposite is likely to happen _ there will be new types of devices,
all with more intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at a convergence of devices here but at a
convergence of technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we might see this moving forward is that devices will
get better and better at sharing information. . . I'm going to want
my information, my personal information, anywhere, at any time.''

MILITARY FACES GIANT JOB OF FIXING COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometime in 1993 _ memories are hazy and nothing was
written down for the public _ the North American Air Defense
Command in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., conducted a test to see what
would happen to all their computers _ the ones that warn of a
nuclear attack _ on New Year's Day of the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As with nearly all computers, years were designated only by
their last two digits _ ``98'' for 1998, ``99'' for 1999, and so
on. A few engineers were starting to speculate: When 2000 comes
along, the computers would read it as ``00'' and think it was 1900.
What would happen?
</P>
<P>
   What happened was, everything froze _ the screens that monitored
the early-warning satellites and radars and other communications
systems that would detect a flock of missiles or bombers coming our
way. ``It all locked up at the stroke of midnight,'' recalled
Robert Martin, a top computer specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was not present at the simulation, but his life has been
ruled by it ever since. At the Mitre Corp. in Bedford, one of the
leading Pentagon contractors working to solve this problem, Martin
is the ``focal point'' for ``Y2K'' _ the cognoscenti's abbreviation
for ``Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is hardly restricted to NORAD. The Defense
Department has about 25,000 computer systems _ 2,803 of them
classified as ``mission-critical systems,'' meaning that, without
them, the military could no longer carry out a major mission.
</P>
<P>
   These include computers for ``all kinds'' of weapons, Martin
said, ``the full spectrum,'' from nuclear missiles to a sergeant's
battlefield laptop, as well as the various satellites, sensors,
radars, and communications networks that link them into a unified
fighting machine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what computers are not affected by the Year 2000 problem,
Martin replied, ``I can't think of many.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem is now a well-known bug _ the one demon in the
bag of popular millennial nightmares that is based not on
Nostradamus or other mythic apocrypha, but on hard science.
</P>
<P>
   Every federal agency, bank, and major corporation has teams
devoting thousands of manhours to solving the problem in the next
18 months, before the deadline inexorably strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the military may be the hardest hit, because the
consequences could affect not just paychecks and power grids, but
war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials are hopeful that they will fix at least all
the critical systems in time, but they admit it will be a close
call, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000 problem is the electronic equivalent of El
Nino,'' Deputy Defense Secretary John J. Hamre told the Senate
Armed Services Committee two weeks ago. ``This is going to have
implications in the world ... that we can't even comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries' militaries could be especially devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at least have a program to deal with the problem,'' noted
Bruce Blair, a nuclear-weapons specialist at the Brookings
Institution. Most countries ``have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, only four countries _ the United
States, Britain, Canada, and Australia _ are doing anything to
prepare their military computers for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre said the situation is so grim that the Pentagon is
developing a program to share data from US early-warning satellites
with other countries, including Russia and China. Otherwise, come
2000, such nations may find themselves in the dark, uncertain
whether an attack is coming or not _ which, in a crisis, could
provoke great anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who has interviewed several Russian nuclear officers,
said Russia faces particularly dire straits. Since its army has
collapsed, it is relying far more on its nuclear weapons for
security. And, because of shortages in manpower and money, its
nuclear weapons are becoming increasingly vulnerable and its
early-warning network more riddled with gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is just a piling-on of a whole nest of problems,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Top Pentagon officials did not become fully aware of the problem
until October 1995, during an interagency meeting called by the
Social Security Administration. The agency had been performing its
own simulations, which showed that Year 2000 glitches could cause
millions of citizens to stop getting their retirement-checks _
perhaps even expunge their names from the records _ because the
computers, ``thinking'' it was 1900 instead of 2000, would conclude
that all these beneficiaries were way too young to qualify for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting resulted in a directive, sent to every relevant
office in the Defense Department, to address Y2K as a top priority.
By the end of next year, $1.9 billion will have been shifted from
various weapons programs to prepare for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,803 ``mission-critical'' computer systems, the Pentagon
reports that 812 _ 29 percent _ are fixed, and most of the rest are
being renovated.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hamre testified, the program is four months behind
schedule _ not a small matter, given that 2000 is 18 months away.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Mitre's Martin explained, is that some of the fixes
are taking much longer than anyone could have estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The smlution, for most computers, is for programmers to go into
the software code and do one of two things. Either they change the
symbol for years from two digits to four digits (for example, from
``00'' to ``2000''). Or, they change the code so that the computer
reads year-numbers greater than ``50'' to mean the 1900s _ and
smaller than ``50'' to mean the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, however, is many of these computers are old and
nobody who is still around knows what the code is. ``That's a big
problem,'' Martin said, ``finding the code.''
</P>
<P>
   Even once that problem is solved, Hamre warned the Senate,
``there is no guarantee all ... systems will be free of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the commercial computer industry might not be able to
supply the large quantity of hardware _ the communications hubs,
routers, and servers _ needed to make the fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the fixes themselves need to be tested and de-bugged _
which, as anyone who has purchased a software program during its
first weeks on the market knows, can take a while.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, military computers interact with each other and with
civilian computers _ and these interactions could unfold in
unforeseeable ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a web of connectedness,'' Martin noted. If even one
connection in this web has a Year 2000 problem, the whole system
becomes ``a house of cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it is not entirely predictable just how any given
house of cards might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chrysler Corp. conducted a test of its Y2K solutions at
an assembly plant last year, the time clocks malfunctioned, causing
the security system to shut down, making it impossible for anyone
to leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillips Petroleum Co. ran a simulation onboard an oil
vessel in the North Sea, a safety system designed to detect a
deadly gas, hydrogen sulfide, shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, real-life failures have taken place that only
begin to hint at how far-flung the problems might be.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of possible military disasters was the incident in the
1991 Gulf War, when a Scud missile blew up a barracks in Saudi
Arabia, killing 28 National Guard troops inside.
</P>
<P>
   A post-mortem of the disaster revealed that the Patriot
air-defense battery failed to shoot down the Scud because the clock
in the Patriot's radar system was not properly synchronized.
</P>
<P>
   The radar had been designed to be left on for only a short
while. Its clock viewed a day as 23 hours and 59 minutes long.
However, once this particular Patriot arrived in Saudi Arabia, the
radar was left on continuously. So its clock drifted away from the
actual time by one minute per day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriot system's computer detected an incoming Scud
missile, it would see the missile on two radar screens and send
both blips to another computer controlling its fire-control system.
But since the two blips were not synchronized, the fire-control
computer could not connect them _ could not see them as a target.
</P>
<P>
   The Scud tragedy illustrates why the clocks and calendars inside
computers matter so much.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a weapons specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, explained: ``Systems generally require
time-synchronization in order to talk to each other. A lot of
systems use time-synchronization as a way to establish data
links.'' So, if one computer says it is 1900 and another says it is
2000, ``they can't talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ludicrous that Y2K should be a problem,'' Pike
said. ``I mean, two digits in a software program? Causing
catastrophes of these magnitudes?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamre put it another way in his Senate testimony: ``If we built
houses the way we build software, the first woodpecker to come
along would destroy civilization.''

IBM BEGINS MAKING FAST, CHEAPER CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without fanfare but with potentially far-reaching significance
for the semiconductor industry, IBM has begun the industry's first
large-scale production of a type of chip that may reduce prices and
improve performance and portability for cellular phones and other
wireless communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   The chips are based on technology developed by IBM Corp. in the
early 1980s for mainframe computers and redirected toward consumer
products. It combines the standard silicon used throughout the chip
industry with germanium, a metallic element that is so efficient a
conductor of electricity that it may reduce the power consumption
of portable devices as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The use of germanium, which is relatively easy for chip makers
to work with and is well suited to the electronics of
high-frequency radio communications, enabled IBM engineers to
combine wireless communications components and silicon digital
transistors on a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   By consolidating equipment and capabilities that typically
require several chips or components, makers of cellular telephones
and other consumer products can reduce the size and complexity of
those products. Industry experts say it may eventually be possible
to create the entire electronics of a cellular phone on a single
chip.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications may include home receivers for
direct-broadcast satellite television and various kinds of portable
devices for wireless connections to the Internet. Many analysts
also expect silicon germanium chips, because of their high-speed
processing ability, to play a key role in future network-switching
equipment for routing all sorts of Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM is assembling the technologies that will allow it to
pounce on the communications industry,'' said Dan Hutcheson,
president of VLSI Technologies of San Jose, Calif., a market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The components market into which IBM will be selling the chips
is now estimated at $540 million a year, but the company predicted
that its own piece of the market would exceed $1 billion annually
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Initial customers for the IBM chips, which the company began
producing in large quantities last week at an updated plant in
Burlington, Vt., are Hughes Electronics, Harris Semiconductor,
National Semiconductor, Northern Telecom and Tektronix. All five
companies have also licensed IBM's technology to incorporate into
their own product designs. IBM said it had two dozen additional
customers, which it was not yet ready to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Although IBM declined to discuss pricing for the new chips,
industry analysts estimated that it might sell for $10 and replace
a cluster of components now costing as much as $100.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-performance, lower-priced chips may also pave the way
for ``soft radios,'' the industry's emerging term for a new type of
cellular phone that could use software to conform automatically to
whatever format and frequency the local cellular system employed.
Such a phone, in theory at least, could be used in any region of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Holy Grail for the cellular telephone industry,''
said Lawrence Larson, a professor of electrical engineering at the
University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Further in the future may lie more speculative but potentially
vast markets for applications like collision-avoidance radar for
automobiles. Such systems, long considered impractical because of
cost, may be within the reach of inexpensive
silicon-germanium-based devices.
</P>
<P>
   The components of the IBM chip that are based on germanium
involve analog technology _ meaning that they convert sound, light
or physical motion into electrical patterns analogous to the
original source. Analog chips are required in digital devices like
cellular phones to convert the human voice into an electronic
signal that a digital chip can translate into the binary-code data
of ones and zeroes used in modern communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's breakthrough involved, in essence, combining the germanium
analog conversion device with standard silicon digital transistors
on a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives say that as many as 50 other companies are
pursuing similar technology, but industry analysts agree that IBM
has taken a clear lead in silicon germanium chips.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They've found their way around a lot of obstacles,'' said Fred
Zieber, president of Pathfinder Research Inc., a San Jose, Calif.,
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives predict that silicon germanium will put new
competitive pressure on the current market for several exotic
semiconductor technologies, including gallium arsenide.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, gallium arsenide has been the most promising material
for extremely high-speed computing and communications applications.
But semiconductors based on it have been expensive and difficult to
manufacture, confining its use mainly to high-performance computing
and limited consumer applications.
</P>
<P>
   Initial versions of IBM's silicon germanium technology were
developed in the early 1980s by Bernard Meyerson and other
scientists at the company's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., who were seeking a way to speed the
performance of mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s, though, IBM had altered the technology course
of its mainframes, basing them instead on an inexpensive chip
process known as CMOS, for complementary metal oxide semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   So Meyerson and his team redirected their silicon germanium work
toward a new class of chips that would combine all the functions of
analog communications equipment and digital computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say this was a failed mainframe technology,'' said
Paul Horn, senior vice president for research at the Watson
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had long known that by adding tiny amounts of
germanium to silicon, it would be possible to achieve notable
increases in the speed at which transistors direct, or switch,
electrons through a chip's circuitry. Because of differences in the
sizes of silicon and germanium atoms, however, semiconductors made
from composites of the two materials typically failed.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerson's solution was to find a relatively low-temperature
technique for creating a thin film of germanium that could be
successfully bonded to silicon.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a semiconductor manufacturing process that
combined the benefits of low-cost silicon and ultra-high-speed
germanium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're able to achieve is speed without scaling down the
size of the transistors,'' Meyerson said. ``That translates into
added speed without cost.''

MICROSOFT WINS KEY LEGAL BATTLE; STOCK SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WARREN WILSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. won a key legal victory Tuesday that it said
affirms its freedom to design its software without outside
interference and erodes claims by antitrust regulators that it
doesn't compete fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington,
D.C., propelled Microsoft's stock to a record high and prompted
jubilation among the company's top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold proclaimed Tuesday ``a great
day for consumers'' and said the decision ``reaffirms the central
principle ... that every company should have the freedom to improve
its products and integrate new features on behalf of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and legal experts agreed that the ruling was a
significant win for the company. But they warned that the issues
are far from settled, and that in any case Microsoft's market power
and hard-nosed business tactics will continue to draw regulators'
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are anything but out of the woods,'' said industry
analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. ``They have an image
that leads people to assume they're guilty until proven innocent
... until they fix their fundamental image problem, their exposure
to litigation remains significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice said little. It issued a
three-sentence statement saying it was disappointed with the
ruling, which came in a relatively narrow case filed last fall, but
remained confident it would prevail in the broader antitrust case
it filed last month along with companion litigation filed by 20
states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Central to all of the cases has been the claim that Microsoft
has abused its Windows software monopoly by forcing computer makers
to also accept its Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of computers sold today are equipped with the
Windows operating system. Computer makers had no real alternative
to Windows if they wanted to replace Internet Explorer with an
alternative browser _ such as Netscape Navigator _ for computer
users to navigate the Internet and the World Wide Web, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claimed it had combined the browser and the operating
system in a single ``integrated'' product on the basis of consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel supported that view, voting 2-1 in Tuesday's
ruling that it was ``inclined to conclude'' that the combined
operating system and browser was a ``genuine integration''
permitted under the 1995 consent decree at the heart of that case.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Justice Department had not shown a ``reasonable
probability of success on the merits,'' the appeals panel decided
unanimously to cancel a preliminary injunction issued in December
by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that required
Microsoft to offer computer makers a browserless version of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It also was unanimous in vacating Jackson's decision to refer
the case to a special master, saying it found the case ``devoid''
of anything ``remotely `exceptional''' to trigger that procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuke to Jackson, the appeals court said his decision to
refer the case to Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig was
``either a clear abuse of discretion or an exercise of wholly
non-existent discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the appeals court had tentatively suspended Lessig's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday Lessig said, ``This is an extremely
difficult case, and I am grateful to both sides for the patience
and respect that they showed me during the brief time that I worked
with them on this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges did not rule on Microsoft's claim that
Lessig was biased against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most heartening to Microsoft, however, was that the ruling went
far beyond those procedural questions to scrutinize major issues of
product design and the proper role of courts _ issues at the heart
of the case filed last month.
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the appeals ruling will be an ``important and
weighty authority in guiding the trial court,'' Bill Neukom,
Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs,
told reporters and analysts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out passages in the ruling that he said supported two
of Microsoft's most important points: that the law should encourage
innovation and integration in pursuit of better products for
consumers, and that courts should generally avoid interfering in
such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of
having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of
technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust
law,'' the panel said in one passage that Neukom took care to point
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a validation of the company's legal right to continue
to do what it has been doing,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Browser rival Netscape Communications issued a statement late
Tuesday stressing that the ruling ``most certainly did not decide
the broad antitrust case'' filed last month and echoing the Justice
Department's view that Microsoft would ultimately lose that case.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., antitrust expert Phil O'Neill said the
government would likely seize on a portion of the dissenting
opinion in which the judge outlined an alternative view that she
said the two other judges hadn't adequately considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's basically saying ... `Since I am able to come up with an
equally plausible construction, you ought to wait until the
fact-finding is done before you declare the game over,''' O'Neill
said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill agreed that overall, the ruling was a ``huge
victory'' for Microsoft, both symbolically and practically, and
predicted that Jackson would ``probably read this thing 100 times''
in weighing the next case, scheduled for trial on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said (to the lower court judge), `You got
nothing right here,''' O'Neill said. ``He's got to be pretty
discouraged by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the appeals ruling was replete with nuggets that looked
like gold to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated version of Windows and Internet Explorer offers
more functionality than the sum of the two products separately, it
said, adding, ``This strikes us as an essential point.''
</P>
<P>
   And the integration must logically be done by Microsoft; it
would be ``absurdly inefficient'' for computer makers or end users
to do it, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested in several places that courts should try to stay
out of the way, noting at one point, ``Courts are ill equipped to
evaluate the benefits of high-tech product design.''
</P>
<P>
   It even questioned the value of pursuing the consent-decree
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of our interpretation of the consent decree, tentative
though it be, the Department (of Justice) may well regard further
pursuit of the case as unpromising,'' the panel said, ``especially
given the alternate avenues developing in its recently launched
separate attacks on Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those avenues lead anywhere is also far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cuts the legs out from under the Justice Department on
their new case,'' Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust office, told the New York Times.
``It's potentially devastating.''

CODE BREAKER CRACKS SMART CARDS' DIGITAL SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ART ADV: Photo showing Paul Kocher is being sent to NYT photo

 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the companies in the smart-card business, Paul Kocher may be
too smart for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Kocher's four-man consulting firm in San
Francisco has kept big credit-card companies and banks on edge by
sharing details of his discovery of a way to break into the newest
version of smart cards _ credit-card size devices that contain a
tiny computer chip and can be used for a variety of purposes
including storing so-called digital cash.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kocher's intent has been to warn the industry and sell
it possible solutions, his expertise _ in the hands of thieves,
counterfeiters or impostors _ could compromise the security
safeguards of smart cards, which are coming into widespread use in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are at the center of the plans by the banking and
credit-card industries to cut costs and improve customer
convenience by replacing conventional magnetic-stripe cards with
ones that not only can act as a debit or automated-teller-machine
card but can also be loaded with digital cash that would function
as legal tender wherever merchants have digital-cash decoder
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in the technology will be crucial to the
industry's plans. And that may help explain why, since word leaked
of Kocher's break-in methods two weeks ago, the industries
promoting smart cards have tended to play down his technique by
calling it a ``laboratory attack'' that could be replicated by
perhaps a handful of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip cards are the most secure technology around,'' said Steve
Schapp, the executive vice president of Visa International in
charge of developing smart cards. ``They are very hard to break.''
</P>
<P>
   Kocher and his colleagues were able to crack the digital code
designed to make the smart cards tamperproof by drawing
mathematical inferences from the fluctuating electrical power
consumption of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sophisticated type of analysis, but the rudimentary
``laboratory'' _ in this case a three-room office suite, some
garden-variety PCs and several thousand dollars of electronics
equipment _ indicates that it does not require elaborate tools to
crack what is supposed to be a highly secure digital safe.
</P>
<P>
   As details of the technique circulate, as they invariably do in
the hacker underground, imitators will almost certainly try to
duplicate Kocher's experiment. For his part, Kocher, who at 25 is
already a well-known expert in code breaking, said, ``As the
expertise becomes more widely available, the threats will become
more than academic.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a
research group in Menlo Park, Calif., said the approach had
``enormous potential as another technique for breaking weakly
designed and badly implemented devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Though already in wide use as bank cards in Europe, smart cards
in the United States have been mainly used so far for controlling
access to buildings and protecting against fraudulent use of new
types of cellular telephones. But U.S. banks have begun
experimenting with the cards, as Chase Manhattan is doing in a test
of Mastercard International's Mondex system on the Upper West Side
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Banks trust that the computer chips embedded in tamper-resistant
packaging will act like a virtual branch office, dispensing money
and crediting accounts to the right people. But if someone could
break through the card's defense, then that person could conduct
fraudulent transactions, load counterfeit digital cash onto the
cards or create various other forms of mischief.
</P>
<P>
   So even as smart-card executives seek to play down the threat
posed by Kocher's discovery, and they stress that no known
break-ins of his sort have occurred in the real world, the industry
knows it must continuously improve smart-card software and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, this is an arms race; the attackers will always
get better,'' said Richard Fletcher, the head of strategy and
planning of Mastercard's Mondex smart-card division. ``The only
defense and the best defense against future attacks is to keep
moving and keep changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Hubbard is the vice president of marketing in the United
States for Bull Smart Cards, a company that says it has shipped
more than 120 million money-carrying smart cards throughout the
world. He said that his company had known about the Kocher type of
attack for more than four years and had installed safeguards to
thwart it. But, Hubbard said, ``You can never say a card is 100
percent immune.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some other industry executives expect it to take
perhaps two years before there will be smart cards and related
hardware that will be impervious to Kocher's type of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher said he had approached the smart-card industry last year
with the details of his discovery because he knew that criminals
might also use the same tricks. But he said that he did not
publicize his findings, so that the industry would have time to
adopt defenses, including techniques for which he has filed for
patents and which he is now licensing to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   He publicly announced the smart-card security flaw two weeks
ago, only after The Australian Financial Review published an
article about his break-in technique.

APPEALS COURT DISMISSES WINDOWS 95 INJUNCTION  
 BY JULIA ANGWIN  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft won a short-lived legal triumph _ and sparked hopes of
a long-term victory _ against federal antitrust enforcers yesterday
when a federal appeals court overturned an injunction against
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will become moot tomorrow when Microsoft launches the
successor to Windows 95 _ the Windows 98 operating system _ at a
party in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the U.S. Court of Appeals decision bodes
poorly for the government's separate lawsuit against Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an uphill battle for the government,'' said Sam
Miller, a San Francisco attorney who led the anti-Microsoft case at
the Justice Department four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The news caused Microsoft stock to soar $4.94 to an all-time
high of $100.75 and boosted the value of Microsoft chief executive
Bill Gates' holdings by $2.7 billion to $54.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts cautioned investors against irrational
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' said David Readerman, analyst at
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``But it gives Microsoft some
support for its September 8 trial (on Windows 98).''
</P>
<P>
   Government antitrust enforcers are currently battling Microsoft
on two related fronts: Windows 95 and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   On Windows 95, federal prosecutors accused Microsoft in October
of violating a 1995 antitrust agreement by requiring
computer-makers that want Windows 95 to install Microsoft's Web
browser. In December, a federal judge temporarily barred Microsoft
from forcing computer-makers to accept both products.
</P>
<P>
   On Windows 98, the Justice Department and 20 states accused
Microsoft last month of violating a broader set of federal
antitrust laws by using its monopoly power in operating system
software to muscle its way into the Internet market. A trial is set
for September 8.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's decision by a three-judge panel overturned on
procedural grounds the December preliminary injunction issued by
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson against Windows 95. The panel
unanimously found that Microsoft was not given adequate notice
before the injunction was issued.
</P>
<P>
   That means that in 90 days Microsoft will be free to require
computer-makers to install Internet Explorer with Windows 95.
However, while Microsoft will continue to offer Windows 95,
customers are likely to pick Windows 98 instead.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also unanimously overturned on procedural grounds the
lower court's decision to appoint Harvard law professor Lawrence
Lessig as a ``special master'' to help on the case.
</P>
<P>
   However, the panel stopped short of calling Lessig biased _ a
claim Microsoft made after discovering that the professor had once
written an e-mail that contained anti-Microsoft sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   And the panel split 2 to 1 on the most important part of the
ruling _ the question of whether Microsoft has the right to include
separate products such as its Web browser in the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long argued that it has the right to put anything
it wants in its software _ even a ham sandwich _ if that is what
customers want.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Stephen Williams and Raymond Randolph appeared to
substantiate Microsoft's argument in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine how the ruling could have been better for
Microsoft,'' said Joe Sims, antitrust attorney at Jones Day, Revis
&AMP; Pogue in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
   In their 38-page decision, the two judges wrote that Microsoft
should be allowed to integrate any two products that work better
together than separately ``regardless of whether ... (they) ... are
marketed separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patricia Wald wrote in a dissenting opinion that the
benefits of integration should be balanced against evidence that
the two products serve separate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft attorney William Neukom said he believes the 2-to-1
victory will give ``substantive guidance'' to Judge Jackson, who
must decide later this year whether Windows 98 illegally includes
Microsoft's Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty fatal to the government's case,'' added Charles F.
Rule, a Washington antitrust attorney who consults for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it was ``disappointed'' with the
appeals court decision and was ``reviewing its options.'' It could
ask the entireDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals to
review the panel's decision or it could appeal directly to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft competitors said it's too soon to count them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real battle will occur ... in September,'' said Mike
Pettit, executive director of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft coalition
based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's just another twist in the protracted legal
battle between the government and the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a very good day for Microsoft,'' said Rich Gray,
a San Jose antitrust attorney. ``But the Justice Department's
lawsuit is still very much alive.''

 UNDATED: break-in technique.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kocher's company, Cryptography Research, analyzes and tests
computer-security hardware and software for many of the leading
computer companies. His discoveries of flaws in supposedly secure
technologies have drawn attention in the past _ as in 1995, when he
found that he could break into smart cards by simply timing how
long it took them to process data.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of this newly disclosed smart-card problem, Kocher
and his colleagues found that the cards' consumption of electrical
power could disclose vital information about the secret key that
protects the money or other data on the chip.
</P>
<P>
   By watching the monitor of an oscilloscope, a device that
measures the power use on a screen similar to the way a cardiac
monitor displays a patient's heart action, Kocher's team was able
in some cases to use the electrical pattern from a single
transaction to decipher the key to the code. In other cases, they
were forced to use more sophisticated statistical techniques to
analyze the results from as many as 1,000 transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher said his team had spent at least as much time looking for
solutions as it had in identifying the security flaw. A possible
remedy involves masking the transaction in digital noise by adding
meaningless random calculations that would consume random amounts
of current.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible solution, which according to Mastercard
officials is being incorporated in the latest version of its Mondex
smart-card software, is to vary the order of the operations in the
software to make it more difficult to identify patterns in the
consumption of power.
</P>
<P>
   A banking-industry goal with smart cards is to cut costs by
eliminating the need for central approval of a debit or credit
transaction. By some estimates, the marginal costs for clearing a
smart-card transaction are well under a penny. Credit-card
transactions, however, typically require a long-distance computer
network and a large central database for examining each deal, and
the transaction eventually means billing a customer and cashing the
payment checks.
</P>
<P>
   These steps add up to 25 cents a transaction, on average,
compared with about a penny for a smart-card transaction, in which
all the authorization information _ and even the money itself _ can
be contained on the card's chip.
</P>
<P>
   To create an audit trail that might help track fraud, however,
Visa International's smart-card system uses merchant terminals that
report transactions to a central data base at the end of each day.
``We don't feel it is a good idea to have the security depend upon
the chip itself,'' said Philip Yen, a senior vice president of Visa
International. ``We think it's more important to have complete
system security.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, of Mastercard's Mondex, contends that including any
sort of central control runs counter to the purpose of a smart card
_ giving customers the ability to use the money on a card just like
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical point of any digital cash system is that you're
off line,'' he said. ``There's no online link at that point. You're
critically dependent upon the card's security.''
</P>
<P>
   As the banks debate the security trade-offs, there is one
certainty: Paul Kocher and others like him will continue to look
for chinks in the smart-card armor. And as Kocher likes to remind
the industry, ``We have not yet encountered a card that couldn't be
broken.''

EXCERPTS FROM APPEALS COURT RULING ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (With MICROSOFT-SUIT) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the decision by a three-judge panel
of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
overturning the injunction against Microsoft Corp. Judges A.
Raymond Randolph and Stephen F. Williams found for the company;
Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented in part.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   We find that the district court erred procedurally in entering a
preliminary injunction without notice to Microsoft and
substantively in its implicit construction of the consent decree on
which the preliminary injunction rested. ...
</P>
<P>
   We must decide whether the preliminary injunction was correctly
granted. ... Microsoft argues that the district court failed to
comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(1)'s command,
``No preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the
adverse party.'' We agree. Obviously the department's request for a
contempt citation provided no such notice, for the governing
criteria are completely different. To defeat the contempt petition,
all Microsoft had to do was to show that the department failed to
meet its burden of showing that the consent decree unambiguously
barred its conduct. For a preliminary injunction, by contrast,
traditional equitable standards would require the Government to
show substantial likelihood of success on the merits (here, that
the decree, properly construed, barred the conduct), plus risk of
irreparable injury, lack of substantial injury to the opposing
party and consistency with the public interest. ...
</P>
<P>
   At oral argument the department claimed that when the Government
seeks a preliminary injunction under a statute, its showing of a
likelihood of success on the merits supplants the normal need for
assessment of the interim risks. This is true under some
circumstances. First, it is clear that if a statute confers a right
to an injunction once a certain showing is made, no plaintiff _
neither governmental agencies nor private parties _ need show more
than the statute specifies. ... Second, and not entirely distinct
in the cases, lurks the proposition that when a governmental entity
sues to enforce a statute, irreparable injury is presumed to flow
from the violation itself. ...
</P>
<P>
   The district court did need to find irreparable injury before
granting the preliminary injunction. The absence of notice had the
effect of precluding the introduction of evidence and argument on
this requirement, and the omission was far from trivial. At oral
argument, the department conceded that it had offered no evidence
on the subject, and Microsoft suggested that it could have
forcefully contested anything the department might have offered,
alluding to information _ obviously not in the record _ that no
O.E.M. had, since entry of the preliminary injunction, sought to
take advantage of its terms. ...
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the department engage in a brief battle over the
extent to which antitrust law may be relevant to this dispute.
Without wasting time on the parties' somewhat exaggerated
positions, we can simply say that Microsoft is clearly right that
the decree does not embody either the entirety of the Sherman Act
or even all ``tying'' law under the act, and the department is
equally right to point out that the consent decree emerged from
antitrust claims, unresolved though they were, so that we must keep
procompetitive goals in mind in the interpretive task. ... However,
an antitrust consent decree cannot be read as though its animating
spirit were solely the antitrust laws. ...
</P>
<P>
   The court's task, then, is to discern the bargain that the
parties struck; this is the sense behind the proposition that
consent decrees are to be interpreted as contracts. ... To find the
meaning of an ambiguous provision we look for the intent of the
parties, just as we would with a contract. ... In that quest we may
rely on the same aids to construction as we would when interpreting
an ambiguous contract. ...
</P>
<P>
   For antitrust criteria, the department draws on Jefferson Parish
Hosp. District No.2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984), for the proposition
that products are distinct for tying purposes if consumer demand
exists for each separately. (The department notes correctly that
this does not require demand for one product without the other but
simply demand for the two products from different sellers.) ... We
are not convinced that these indicia necessarily point to
separateness, especially those that depend on Microsoft's
treatment. ... The department offers no means of distinguishing an
upgrade from a separate product. Versions developed for different
operating systems may be better understood as different products
altogether; hence, their relevance to separateness is obscure.
Distribution of software code on a separate CD-ROM shows nothing at
all about whether the code is integrated into an operating system.
...
</P>
<P>
   And while the department says that the proviso would protect
Microsoft from a charge that it had violated the decree by adopting
a technology incompatible with other firms' products. ... In its
attempts to define the ``product'' I.E. , the department
consistently invokes the concept of ``browser functionality.'' ...
But if functionality is the criterion of identity (which the
department asserts so as to claim that the ``browser
functionality'' in Windows 95 is the same product as I.E. 4 for
other operating systems), Windows 95 looks like a tie-in of two
products (MS-DOS and Windows 3.11) that were sold separately in the
market: it contains the functionalities of both. On the
department's reading, it should thus be prohibited unless Microsoft
refrains from marketing MS-DOS separately. There is some suggestion
that Microsoft has in fact continued to license MS-DOS separately,
at least to end users. ... More significantly, the consent decree
does not condition its approval of Windows 95 on Microsoft's
marketing behavior with respect to MS-DOS. The failure to produce
the right result when applied to Windows 95, one of the situations
clearly resolved by the decree, is a fatal flaw. ...
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in both parties' readings Microsoft's behavior
determines the permissibility of conditioned licensing. This would
be no defect if the behavior were in some way relevant to the
economic principles of tie-ins. But it is not. The department
offers no theory as to how a seller's abstaining from separate
marketing of the tied good might blunt the possible anticompetitive
effects of bundling. .. It seems especially beside the point where
the goods are complements used in fixed proportions. A monopolist
who ties two such goods has no obvious reason to market the tied
good separately: since all buyers of the tying good will also take
the tied good, the residual market for the tied good will be
minimal. ...
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's goal was to preserve its freedom to design products
that consumers would like. Antitrust scholars have long recognized
the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, and any
dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purposes
with antitrust law. Thus, a simple way to harmonize the parties'
desires is to read the integration proviso of s IV(E)(i) (a proviso
in the consent decree) as permitting any genuine technological
integration, regardless of whether elements of the integrated
package are marketed separately. This reading requires us, of
course, to give substantive content to the concept of integration.
We think that an ``integrated product'' is most reasonably
understood as a product that combines functionalities (which may
also be marketed separately and operated together) in a way that
offers advantages unavailable if the functionalities are bought
separately and combined by the purchaser. ...
</P>
<P>
   The second point is. ... there should be some technological
value to integration. Manufacturers can stick products together in
ways that purchasers cannot without the link serving any purpose
but an anticompetitive one. ... Thus if there is no suggestion that
the product is superior to the purchaser's combination in some
respect, it cannot be deemed integrated. ...
</P>
<P>
   The test for the integration of Windows 95 then comes down to
the question of whether its integrated design offers benefits when
compared to a purchaser's combination of corresponding stand-alone
functionalities. ...
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is thus that integration may be considered
genuine if it is beneficial when compared to a purchaser
combination. But we do not propose that in making this inquiry the
court should embark on product-design assessment. In antitrust law,
from which this whole proceeding springs, the courts have
recognized the limits of their institutional competence and have on
that ground rejected theories of ``technological tying.'' A court's
evaluation of a claim of integration must be narrow and
deferential. ...
</P>
<P>
   We defer to neither party in interpreting the consent decree; in
fact, we reject both parties' readings. We suggest here only that
the limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product
designs and the high cost of error should make them wary of
second-guessing the claimed benefits of a particular design
decision. ...
</P>
<P>
   The parties agree that the consent decree does not bar a
challenge under the Sherman Act. ... On the facts before us,
Microsoft has clearly met the burden of ascribing facially
plausible benefits to its integrated design as compared to an
operating system combined with a stand-alone browser such as
Netscape's Navigator. ... The ultimate sorting out of any factual
disputes is a different question, and one we, of course, cannot
resolve on the limited record before us. ...
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that integration brings benefits does not end the
inquiry we have traced out. It is also necessary that there be some
reason Microsoft, rather than the O.E.M.'s or end users, must bring
the functionalities together. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the products have no separate existence, it is incorrect to
speak of the purchaser combining them. ... What, then, counts as
the combination that brings together the two functionalities? Since
neither fully exists separately, we think the only sensible answer
is that the act of combination is the creation of the design that
knits the two together. ...
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that there is a reason why the integration must
take place at Microsoft's level. This analysis essentially replays
our comparison of Windows 95 to a bundle of MS-DOS and Windows 3.11
and concludes that the Windows 95/IE package more closely resembles
Windows 95 than it does the bundle. The factual conclusion is, of
course, subject to re-examination on a more complete record. On the
facts before us, however, we are inclined to conclude that the
Windows 95/IE package is a genuine integration; consequently, s
IV(E)(i) does not bar Microsoft from offering it as one product. ..
</P>
<P>
   Special masters may not decide dispositive pretrial motions. ...
The department also proposes that this is a case of such
technological complexity as to be ``exception(al). So far as the
meaning of the consent decree is concerned, that is clearly false;
the words are in plain English, and if their meaning is not clear
it is not because of some deep technological issue but because of
uncertainties in the purposes of the parties that drafted the
decree, the sort of uncertainties that pervade contract actions.
...
</P>
<P>
   The reference to the master was in effect the imposition on the
parties of a surrogate judge and either a clear abuse of discretion
or an exercise of wholly nonexistent discretion.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: LEGISLATION GATHERS FORCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a climate where any regulation of the Internet in its
commercial infancy is considered high treason, many law experts are
dismayed at the tidal wave of restrictive legislation _ governing
everything from software filters to digital copyrights and public
domain information _ being drafted and enacted by states and the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Currently these experts find themselves battling yet another
``solution in search of a problem'' in the form of a far-reaching
revision to the Uniform Commercial Code _ the body of law, mostly
common to all 50 states, that governs a broad range of commercial
transactions, including the sale of goods.
</P>
<P>
   The revision, a 200-page epic called Article 2B, would legislate
on the sale of virtually all kinds of digital information,
including data, text, images, sounds, computer programs, software
and data bases.
</P>
<P>
   When work on 2B began in the early 1990s, ``our primary concern
was software,'' said Gene Lebrun, the president of the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (www.nccusl.org).
The conference is a volunteer group responsible for revising and
updating the code in conjunction with, and monitored by, the
American Law Institute (www.ali.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``But as technology changed,'' Lebrun said, ``we figured that
eventually software would go the way of the 78-rpm record, and the
law would probably be outdated.'' So instead, he said, ``we started
working on contracts governing all copyrighted information.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, many critics say, was the first step down the wrong
path. Article 2B is so overbroad and complex, the critics say, that
it threatens to bury in legalese the very electronic commerce
industry that it was created to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   As its foundation, the Article supports the controversial
``shrink wrap'' license, used for years by software companies,
which asserts that consumers do not ``buy'' a software product, but
merely buy a license to use the software in limited ways.
</P>
<P>
   Most courts have refused to uphold these licenses for many
reasons _ not the least of which, they say, is that buyers cannot
be held to a contract that they only see after they have already
paid for the product.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the enormously complex Article 2B was built around the
shrink-wrap premise.
</P>
<P>
   It renames this shrink-wrap license a ``mass-market contract'' _
a term that many lawyers consider an oxymoron, since one party to
the contract, the buyer, is not free to negotiate its terms in
advance. What is more, it details a complex legal and technical
infrastructure for governing and enforcing these contracts for all
digital information sold.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some legal scholars assert there can be little
argument that Article 2B is bound to run into trouble as the
commercial Internet continues its chaotic development.
</P>
<P>
   For example, jurisdictional problems abound. The Uniform
Commercial Code's provisions become law in any given state only
after they are adopted by that state's legislature. So what happens
when an information product _ software, music, whatever _ is
purchased in a state that has not signed on to Article 2B but was
sold in a state that does?
</P>
<P>
   And how does one apply the rules when a single purchase buys
both information and more traditional goods _ say, for example, a
WebTV system? What parts of the law apply to which parts of the
same transaction?
</P>
<P>
   As it is written today, Article 2B is so convoluted that even
those who are intimately involved have difficulty answering such
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the text say? It is difficult to follow in many
respects,'' said Geoffrey Hazard, the director of the American Law
Institute and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
``When I'm talking to you on the telephone, for example, we're
exchanging information _ we're even doing it electronically. Is
that governed by this law? They say no, but I say why not? It's not
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 2B even tries to legislate in territory that does not
yet exist. For example, it would make legally binding any
transaction made by an ``electronic agent'' that acts on behalf of
a buyer. Such a law seems more than premature when this kind of
``agent technology,'' although anticipated, has not yet made a
successful foray out of the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who support Article 2B are convinced that new laws are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding and resolving some of these issues is essential
to making the Internet work,'' said Holly Towle, a partner with
Preston Gates &AMP; Ellis LLP, who was hired to represent the Business
Software Association on the Article 2B committee. (The
association's guide to 2B is at
www.softwareindustry.org/issues/guide/index.html.) ``You have to
solve some of these things or companies will be reluctant to put
their information onto the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But her point of view has some powerful opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contract law that's stated in terms of regulating information
is just infeasible and therefore undesirable,'' Hazard said. ``I do
think changes could be helpful in defining electronic contracting.
I think there's potential in governing software to some extent.
Beyond that, I'd like to feel that I understand the text of the
Article. And we're still engaged in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong sentiments seem to be having an effect. The final
draft of Article 2B was scheduled for consideration by state law
commissioners at their annual meeting in July; instead, the group
will keep hearing opposing arguments and working with Professor
Hazard to modify Article 2B.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to us, `Don't you know how important this is?' We
say, `You bet we do, and that's why we won't support a statute that
will create a lot of problems,''' Hazard said. ``This legislation
would govern an enormous amount of commerce, and a set of
difficult-to-understand rules of uncertain scope wouldn't be
helpful. We'd be back to square one.''

RULING ALLOWS MICROSOFT TO REQUIRE BROWSER WITH WINDOWS 95 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US government's landmark antitrust campaign against
Microsoft Corp. was dealt a potentially serious blow Tuesday, after
a federal Appeals Court threw out an injunction that restricted the
way Microsoft can sell its Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadly worded ruling, the federal Appeals Court for the
District of Columbia overturned a temporary injunction issued in
December that had barred Microsoft from requiring computer makers
to include Microsoft's Internet Explorer browsing software on
machines that run the Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling could weaken the government's position in a
much broader case brought by the Justice Department and 20 states
on May 18. That case alleged Microsoft abuses its market power to
thwart competition. The issue of whether Internet Explorer and
Windows can be bundled together also is at the heart of the case,
which will be tried in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad news for Justice,'' Robert Litan, a former senior
antitrust enforcer at the department told Bloomberg News.``On the
surface it looks like it cuts the legs out from under Justice on
the browser operating system part of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives hailed the ruling as vindication of the
firm's long-standing practice of adding new features to its
operating systems. The decision ``affirms our central principle of
every company being able to improve its products and integrate new
features for the benefit of consumers,'' said Microsoft chief
operating officer Bob Herbold.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief legal counsel, William Neukom, said the
ruling should also apply to the government's broadercase against
Microsoft. ``Many of the government's arguments in the lawsuit
filed last month are identical to their arguments in the case just
decided in favor of Microsoft,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock soared on Tuesday's news, closing at 100 3/4, up
4 15/16 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a statement expressing
disappointment,and saying that antitrust regulators were
considering their next moves. ``We remain confident that the
evidence and our legal arguments in our antitrust case filed on May
18, 1998 will demonstrate that Microsoft's conduct has violated
federal antitrust law,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has argued that by forcing companies that
use Windows 95 to also use Microsoft's browser, the company is
shutting out competition from rival browser makers, like Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's 2-1 ruling, the court threw out an injunction
issued by US District JudgeThomas Penfield Jackson in Washington
and held that Microsoft did not violate a 1995 consent decree with
antitrust regulators. The Appeals Court said that because a
combined operating system and browser would benefit customers, the
1995 consent decree ``does not bar Microsoft from offering it as
one product.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ruling, Microsoft is once again free to compel
computer makers to install Windows 95 with the Internet Explorer
icon visible when the computer is started up. The company says that
it hasn't yet decided whether it will do so, but that so few
computer makers actually removed the icon that the issue is
unimportant. In addition, nearly all computer makers are switching
over to Windows 98, which goes on sale in stores Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The same federal Appeals Court ruled last month that Jackson's
injunction did not apply to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing last month in the Windows 98 antitrust case, which
also is being heard by Jackson, the judge suggested he was eager to
hear the Appeals Court ruling: ``It may be that we will have a
decision in that case and we will have some expression of appellate
opinion on some of the issues that will cover this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court Tuesday also overturned the appointment of
Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig as a ``special master'' who
was to study the evidence in the Windows 95 case and provide
recommendations to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The court called Jackson's appointment of Lessig an ``imposition
on the parties of a surrogate judge, and either a clear abuse of
discretion or an exercise of wholly nonexistent discretion.'' The
court did not address Microsoft's claim that Lessig was unsuited to
the task, because he purportedly had shown evidence of bias against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by Harvard Law School, Lessig declined to
express an opinion on the ruling. But he defended the right of
Microsoft attorneys to question his impartiality. ``Any litigant
has the right to a fair and impartial adjudicator, and it was
wholly proper for Microsoft's attorneys to raise any question that
they had about my background and my writings.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned how much impact Tuesday's ruling will
have on the government's broader case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it means that the government will lose their
case in September against Microsoft,'' said Lisa Wood, an attorney
at the Boston firm of Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish. ``I think that the
decision is a narrow one,'' said Wood, who is vice chairman of an
antitrust committee of the American Bar Association &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wood said that the essence of the ruling focuses only on details
of the 1995 consent decree between the government and Microsoft.
While the Appeals Court was highly critical of the Justice
Department's analysis of Microsoft's actions in the Windows 95
case, Wood said that those portions of the court's opinion don't
set a legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Microsoft critics agree. At ProComp, a lobbying group that
recruited former Senator Bob Dole and former federal judge Robert
Bork to campaign against Microsoft, the ruling was dismissed as a
sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the real battle will occur in the compelling
and historically significant Sherman Act antitrust case that will
be tried in September,`` said ProComp executive director Mike
Pettit. ``That case is based on antitrust law, which is broader
than the consent decree language in today's ruling, and goes to the
heart of Microsoft's anti-competitive and predatory practices that
span the computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mountain View, Calif., Netscape officials were cautious. The
appellate ruling applied to Windows 95 and was decided ``largely on
procedural grounds,'' the company noted in a statement. ``It most
certainly did not decide the broad antitrust case,'' Netscape said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape shares dropped 9/16 to $26 3/16 on the Nasdaq Tuesday.

SECURE IN MY OWN IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laziness is a vice, but a mighty useful one. Time and again,
it's led people to invent truly clever ways of doing things, simply
to avoid physical or mental labor. In fact, some of the most
interesting recent developments in computer security were created
to cope with the temptation to let things slide.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer security systems depend at least in part on
passwords, a notoriously risky method because of the weaknesses of
human memory. Most of us pick obvious words that are easy for some
vandal to guess. Or we end up using the same password over and over
for different purposes _ logging onto the office network, for
instance, and getting our electronic mail, and signing on to
America Online. It's all because we're too busy or too lazy to
memorize a couple dozen different passwords, or to pick words like,
say, syzygy, that you don't see every day.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Holy Grail of data security is the creation of
systems that can let authorized individuals get control of a
computer without having to memorize anything.
</P>
<P>
   Now the solution is at hand, thanks to a technology you'll be
hearing a lot about in the next few years. It's called biometrics,
and it's about letting people use their own physical
characteristics as a password. In essence, we're teaching computers
to recognize an individual by his glance, his touch or the sound of
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   It works, too. Several Boston-area firms, including Miros Inc.
of Wellesley, Viisage Technology Inc. of Littleton and Polaroid
Corp. of Cambridge, sell security systems that let companies
identify people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is presently beyond the reach of small businesses or
individuals, but other biometric products aim for the paranoiac on
a budget. Voiceprint software, for instance, doesn't require any
special hardware _ just a computer with a sound card and a
microphone, which is standard issue these days.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago company called Veritel offers a voiceprint product for
locking up your most sensitive computer files. Its $59.95
VoiceCrypt system is available for Windows 95, 98 and NT systems.
It lets you do drag-and-drop encryption of any files on your
computer, making them unreadable by nosy colleagues. Nothing new
there _ products like Norton Your Eyes Only have offered this
capability for quite a while. What makes VoiceCrypt especially cool
is that you get access to the files by reciting a password into a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Most speech-recognition programs, like Dragon Systems Inc.'s
Naturally Speaking and IBM's ViaVoice, are designed for dictating
memos into a word processor. You must spend a couple of hours
training these programs to recognize your voice. But VoiceCrypt
only needs a minute or so to analyze the characteristics of your
voice. You also type in answers to test questions that serve as a
backup password _ for instance, what color was your first car? If
you ever lose your voice, you can still type your way into the
system, without having to memorize yet another password.
</P>
<P>
   During a test of VoiceCrypt, I sometimes had to repeat myself
several times before the software could identify me. I also found
that it isn't too choosy about passwords. I could say any word that
came to mind, and VoiceCrypt would let me in if it recognized my
voice. But VoiceCrypt passed the most important test: Several of my
colleagues have tried to talk their way past it, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   There are other biometric possibilities for those willing to buy
extra hardware. The Canadian firm American Biometric Co. sells
BioMouse, a $299 device that plugs into a parallel port and reads
your fingerprints. Just press a digit against the BioMouse and
you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Some caution is in order. Biometric systems raise an important
privacy concern. You don't want firms sharing your faceprint,
fingerprint or voiceprint data with other firms, or the government,
without your permission. And they ought to store the data in an
encrypted format so nobody can steal it. I foresee the need for a
federal biometric privacy law before we'll feel entirely safe
around these gadgets. But imagine being able to read your e-mail by
saying ``open sesame,'' or getting money out of an ATM simply by
staring at it. It's a lazy man's dream.

HYGIENE CHOICES ROLL ON AND ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING TO RESTORE LEDE) We are paralyzed by
choices.
</P>
<P>
   This occurred to me recently as I stood in a supermarket aisle,
puzzling over the array of deodorants available to me.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it seems simple enough to just stick with what you've been
using and move on to the frozen foods, assuming no one has
complained about a funky aura following you around, but the
plethora of choices always amazes me. I stood there for several
minutes as a steady stream of shoppers swirled past, trying to make
a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow of labels included Suave, Mum, Mitchum, Ban, Arm &AMP;
Hammer, Secret, Soft and Dry, Dry Idea, Degree, Gillette, Right
Guard, Sure, Teen Spirit, Crystal Clean, Degree, Arid, Brut, Old
Spice, Speedstick, Lady Speedstick and Speedstick Ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   Speedstick Ultimate? I love that. Why does the company make any
other kind of deodorant? Who is going to settle for Speedstick
Inferior when they know Ultimate is out there?
</P>
<P>
   But these were just the brands available. Once you've narrowed
that choice down, you still have the various types to contend with:
</P>
<P>
   Wide-ball roll-on, clear soft solid, scented, unscented, wide
solid, ultra-dry soft solid, unscented wide solid, silken solid,
clear gel, invisible dry, powder fresh, shower fresh and, in a nice
nod to a simpler time, regular. &QL; 
THINKING TOO MUCH
</P>
<P>
   Winnow these choices down and you finally . . . wait, one more
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Deodorant?
</P>
<P>
   Antiperspirant?
</P>
<P>
   Or deodorant AND antiperspirant?
</P>
<P>
   The idea, as I understand it, is simply to prevent stinking.
Anything beyond that and you're thinking about it too much.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, I spotted razors. Lots of razors. Bic
Sensitive Skin. Bic Tough Beard. Bic Twin Sensitive Skin. Bic Twin
Tough Beard. Bic Silky Touch. Bic Original (sigh). Gillette Good
News. Gillette Custom Plus. Gillette Sensor XL. Gillette Sensor XL
for Women. Gillette Custom-Plus Pivot. Gillette Daisy Plus.
Gillette Agility. Schick Protector (ah, the anti-Van Gogh model).
Schick Tracer. Schick Tracer FX. Schick Personal Touch Silk
Effects.
</P>
<P>
   I could be wrong, but I don't believe it was always thus. I grew
up in a small town, so maybe stores there didn't stock staples in
so many different varieties.
</P>
<P>
   My father relied on my mom to pick up his hygiene supplies. And
he didn't have to specify his order. ``Pick up some deodorant and
razor blades'' did the trick. &QL; 
FAR FROM FATHER
</P>
<P>
   So, for the duration of my life, anyway, he always used the same
brands. He enveloped himself in a small cloud from sprays with
standard Right Guard in the old brown can, which managed to make
him smell like a doctor's office. He shaved with a single-blade
Gillette razor better suited to scraping paint off furniture (tough
beard).
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the apple sometimes does fall a good distance from
the tree, I am a sucker for variety. I hate to use the same thing
twice, which is why I bought the Schick Protector. I was perfectly
happy with my Gillette Sensor. But the Protector offered, in
addition to an Ultra Glide Comfort Strip, Pivoting Blade,
Rubberized Grip, Protective Cover and Holding Stand, ``Safety
Wires,'' which ``provide unsurpassed safety from nicks and cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   I've not noticed any real difference. I've tried shaving with
one razor and then another. I've even tried shaving half my face
with one razor and half with the other to see whether anyone
noticed a cleaner, closer look.
</P>
<P>
   No one did.
</P>
<P>
   All these choices could drive a man to drink. Let's see, there's
Fat Tire, Shiner Bock, Pete's Summer Brew, Pete's ESB Lager, Pete's
Wicked Ale, Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blonde, Samuel Adams Cherry
Wheat, Samuel Adams Summer Ale, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Henry
Weinhard's Dark, Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Ale, Budweiser, Bud
Light, Coors, Coors Light, Miller, Miller Lite, Miller Genuine
Draft, Miller Genuine Draft Lite . . .
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. By the time I decide, I won't be thirsty anymore. &QL;

ANALYSIS: RULING UNLIKELY TO AFFECT WINDOWS 98 RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (With MICROSOFT-SUIT) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the dust kicked up in the legal battle
over the Microsoft Corp.'s right to include Web browsing software
in its Windows 95 operating system, a ruling by an appeals court
today in the software giant's favor will have almost no impact on
the imminent release of Windows 98, a new version that integrates
the browser even more tightly.
</P>
<P>
   What the ruling and the suit have managed to do is focus a lot
of public attention on a product that has been playing to
widespread yawns in computer industry publications. In recent
weeks, even Microsoft has been playing down revenue expectations
for Windows 98, which is scheduled to go on sale at retail outlets
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the software publisher appears to have generated even
less enthusiasm for Windows 98 among corporate computer buyers,
where a consensus appears to be emerging that this upgrade should
be skipped in favor of Windows NT, a more powerful and robust
version of the operating system designed for large networks of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clearly that NT is the future in the corporate
market,'' said Mike Elgan, the editor of Windows magazine, a
computer industry news weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Corp., a maker of agricultural equipment, based in
Racine, Wis., is representative of many corporate buyers who have
decided to forego upgrading their entire company to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to, in an evolutionary fashion, migrate to
NT,'' said James Hatch, Case's chief information officer. ``We
haven't evaluated Windows 98, and we don't see a compelling need to
orchestrate a mass change.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Tuesday's ruling might have an impact, analysts said, is
in emboldening Microsoft to adopt a tougher stand in its
contractual dealings with computer makers and Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, several computer makers have announced
that they will ship their products with Windows modified so that it
opens with a customized screen that either identifies the brand or
offers icons that link to sites on the Internet chosen by the
manufacturers. This was a practice that Microsoft had forbidden in
its contracts in recent years but did not fight after the Justice
Department included the company's restrictive contracts in the
antitrust lawsuit it filed in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that Microsoft will have more muscle to reapply the
screws,'' said Jessie Berst, editorial director of AnchorDesk.com,
a Internet publication of the Ziff-Davis Corp. ``Recently, we've
seen large manufacturers such as NEC Corporation, Compaq and
Gateway become emboldened by the Justice Department's pressure.
This gives Microsoft the court sanction to reinstitute its previous
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling will also put new pressures on the Netscape
Communications Corp., which created the commercial Web browser
market with its Navigator software only to lose much of that market
to Microsoft in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Netscape executives sketched out a new
business strategy: to transform its home page into a ``portal,'' an
industry buzz word used to describe massive World Wide Web sites
that attract heavy Internet traffic with a mixture of search
engines, Web directories, news, online shopping and entertainment.
Such sites are becoming lucrative in attracting advertising and
steering Web users into the expanding world of Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   However, while NBC and the Walt Disney Co. both invested in
portal sites this month, analysts have remained cautious about the
revenue prospects for such a strategy by Netscape, which has no
search technology or content of its own. The popularity of its home
page rests primarily with the fact that it is the first site that
people see after they install the Navigator browser. As the market
shifts toward Microsoft's browser, Netscape's online traffic could
well sink.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Netscape suffered two setbacks this week. The first
involved server software, the programs that run on the large
computers that host Web sites. Since competition with Microsoft in
the browser market forced Netscape to give Navigator away free,
server software has been a main source of revenue. On Monday, IBM
announced that it would begin supporting Apache, a free Web server
that competes against Netscape's server product.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Tuesday, the appeals court ruling meant that Microsoft
can continue to include its Explorer browser with about 90 percent
of all computers sold in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape has gotten a one-two punch, and it's only Tuesday,''
said David Readerman, a financial analyst at Nations Banc
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After competition with Microsoft forced Netscape to stop
charging for Navigator, its revenues from browser sales fell from
$17 million in the quarter that ended in December to zero in the
quarter ending in April, Readerman said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Readerman is estimating that Microsoft will realize
$2.24 billion in revenue from sales of Windows 98 to computer
makers and retail customers in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives acknowledge that they are doing far less to
promote the upgrade than they did with Windows 95. Industry
analysts say the company is spending only about $10 million on
marketing versus almost $200 million for its introduction of
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say we're ratcheting back,'' said Yusuf Mehdi,
director of Windows marketing at Microsoft. ``In fact, outside of
the Department of Justice coverage _ which has been extensive _ I
think that Windows 98 has been an under-hyped product.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to Windows 98 in the news media's coverage of the
antitrust suits has been ``bittersweet,'' Mehdi said, because while
it brought the issue of browser integration the public's attention,
it did so in a negative context.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one retail chain sees the impact differently.
CompUSA, the nation's largest computer retailer, will open its
doors at midnight on Wednesday in an effort to make the release of
Windows 98 a ``marketing event,'' said Larry Mondry, an executive
vice president at CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Microsoft spent,'' he said. ``The government
gave them so much free advertising they probably didn't have to
spend as much. There is much more interest now than there ever
would have been.''

 Tech Report: A phone that relays messages, or the call  
 By Michael Kanell   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Technology breeds technology.
</P>
<P>
   The more big advances in high tech become a part of our lives
--offering new methods to communicate, work and play -- the more
little devices come piggy-backing into view, offering themselves as
ways to do all those things a tad more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Television gave us the remote control. Computers have spawned
all manner of software, not to mention the Internet and e-mail. And
then there are phones. For decades, families were happy to have a
working phone line that led to the black square phone sitting on a
desk.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed. Now there are cordless phones for home
and wireless phones for the road. Along with those advances come
some potential problems. For instance, you can't be in two places
at once -- at least, not yet -- and if you are on the road, you're
missing calls at home. Oh, sure, you have an answering machine or
voice mail, but to get the messages you'll either have to go home
or remember to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   But for some people -- especially those running home offices or
small businesses -- it would be nice to hear the phone ring right
away. Even better would be a way to screen calls. For mobile
professionals, a combination of those services could be very
useful. Especially for those people who are paged each time they
get a message, yet don't want to talk to everyone who calls.
</P>
<P>
   Phone analysts have talked for years about a future in which
everyone will have one number, a system that will follow you around
from one phone to another. And some phone companies -- including
MCI and BellSouth -- have offered services in which calls can be
forwarded to wherever you are.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the hardware option. You will need at least
two phone lines, but SoloPoint, a California-based company, offers
a device that is meant to give users both screening and ``real
time'' access to home calls from the road.
</P>
<P>
   The SoloPoint M-200 hooks to your home phone. When a call comes
in, the M-200 immediately dials your wireless phone -- or a remote
wired phone, if you like -- which should ring within a few moments.
After picking up whichever line you are near, you are given a
chance to listen to the caller leave a message. Then it's up to you
whether you want to connect to the caller by pushing a button. If
you just hang up, the caller never knows you were listening in,
says Don Nanneman, a vice president at SoloPoint.
</P>
<P>
   The M-200 costs $250 and can be ordered directly from the
company (1-888-765-6225). For more information, call Solopoint
(408-364-8850) or visit its Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .SoloPoint.com).
</P>
<P>
   Newsprint, the Net and truth
</P>
<P>
   The Net is bad for the truth. We have all heard the concerns
--self-righteous and otherwise -- about truth as a victim in the
development of technology. The Internet has been targeted as the
scourge of responsible journalism, blamed for the death of
credibility, the demise of good reporting and the end of facts as
we know them.
</P>
<P>
   There was Pierre Salinger and his reliance on Net sources for
saying the U.S. military shot down TWA Flight 800. There was The
Dallas Morning News posting false reports about Secret Service
agent voyeurs. There was Matt Drudge and his false reports about
Sidney Blumenthal. There was Matt Drudge and his true reports about
the investigation of President Clinton. There was ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   You also may have noticed the recent embarrassment The New
Republic suffered as the result of stories written by Stephen
Glass. The reporter apparently spent a lot of time making things
up, while creating evidence such as notes, Web sites, voice mail
messages and faxes to support his stories. According to New York
Times reporter Robin Pogrebin, Glass spent as much time creating
fiction to lend his stories believability as he would have taken to
do them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The work of young Glass -- by all accounts, a talented writer
--raises questions about journalism and technology and shows the
dangers of making assumptions -- which is, by the way, the first
principle of journalism. Neither the Net nor print seems to have a
monopoly on truth-telling. Glass' concoctions ran, not on the Net,
but in the mainstream and respectable printed press. His pieces
were in Rolling Stone, George and Harper's, and he had a story
scheduled for The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His deception came to light as the result of work by Forbes
Digital Tool, an online news operation.
</P>
<P>
   AOL settles sailor's complaint
</P>
<P>
   There's been a settlement with Tim McVeigh -- not the Oklahoma
bomber, the sailor who had the beef with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   That McVeigh, who listed his marital status as ``gay'' in an
online profile, was identified to Navy officials by AOL after the
online service had promised its users anonymity. The Navy lost a
court case over its investigation of McVeigh and gave him full
retirement benefits. Now AOL has admitted settling McVeigh's
complaint against it, saying the breach of privacy was caused by a
human error and that customer service reps will undergo ``scenario
training'' so they don't give out any more personal data, according
to The Industry Standard's Media Grok.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will pay an undisclosed amount in damages to McVeigh,
according to Media Grok, which covers and comments on the Internet.

   There are those who expect us eventually to have complete
mobility, pounding on our keyboards deep in the Amazon rainforest
while taking calls on our cellular phones.

   A California company, InnoMedia Inc., offers the InfoWave, a
device that lets notebook and personal computers wirelessly connect
from distances up to 800 feet to ``a remote computer, modem,
printer or other peripheral.'' The link is made using a 900 MHz
signal, which can transmit data at a rate of 85k bps, according to
InnoMedia.
</P>
<P>
   InfoWave costs about $250. For more InnoMedia product

 Tech Tools: Page design program hidden behind layouts  
 By Jack Warner   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- I haven't looked at Microsoft Publisher in several
years, and my first glimpse of Publisher 98 was something of a
shock; it appeared to have been dumbed down rather severely.
</P>
<P>
   It has more wizards than the last five Tolkien rip-offs put
together. You want to do a nice newsletter? Fine. Here are two
dozen possibilities, each just a little different from the other,
and none anything like what you have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It resembles, in fact, programs from what Microsoft apparently
views as its chief rivals, PrintMaster and Print Shop. Both of
those programs are intended to help people put together simple
broadsheets, greeting cards and the like.
</P>
<P>
   I had always thought of Publisher as standing between those very
simple and relatively inflexible layout programs and the high-end,
highly complicated productions like PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it does not come with a manual; rather, there is a thin
booklet called a Companion. It seems more oriented toward design
philosophy than program instruction, although the latter can be
found there.
</P>
<P>
   I had just about decided Microsoft had thrown Publisher to the
dogs when things began to fall together and I discovered the old,
relatively muscular page design program lurking under all the
layers of generic, pre-masticated layouts.
</P>
<P>
   You can still set up your own text and picture frames quite
easily, and build a newsletter your own way, if you have a good
idea of how you want it to look. This seems a lot easier than
taking one of the pre-formatted designs and trying to hammer it
into your own concept, unless your concept is pretty similar to the
set piece.
</P>
<P>
   If you select Blank Publications, you can then pick from a full
page, a postcard, a business card, a book fold, side fold or top
fold card, a tent card, a poster, a banner or an index card, which
should cover everything you might need. You can also do a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Web page creation, though, appears to be the most important new
thing about Publisher 98. It does Web pages easier, if not as
elaborately, as Microsoft's Front Page.
</P>
<P>
   You can build a Web page the same way you make a newsletter
--using frames for text, objects and graphics. Any of these frames
can be made into links to other pages or other sites or to large
blocks of text. It seems the only significant things missing are
the Web-bot features of Front Page.
</P>
<P>
   Unification is also emphasized in Publisher. If, for instance,
you have set up a standard newsletter format in Publisher, you can
translate that directly into a Web page design. The program will
examine the newsletter for elements that won't work properly on the
Internet, point them out and suggest what you can do about them.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been unified, itself, to look like the core
Microsoft Office programs. Creating text works the way it does in
Word, with background spell-checking and auto-correction. Of
course, it brings in text from Word readily.
</P>
<P>
   The program assumes the output is going to be sent to a color
inkjet printer. Most folks using a program like this don't expect
to be sending their output off on disk for high-end offset
printing. Nonetheless, if that's what you have in mind, it includes
an Imagesetter print driver, with the option of installing a print
driver from your printer.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher 98 is a really slick piece of work, especially for
people who want to set up a Web site and then have some paper goods
-- the ever-present newsletter or even a restaurant menu -- that
follows the same style.

 TechnoBuddy: Get ready for the inevitable visit of Windows 98  
 By Bill Husted   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Back when I was a kid, the arrival of my Uncle Bill
at our house was a great event.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Alaska and -- to folks living in Arkadelphia, Ark.
-- that was every bit as exotic as if he were a permanent resident
of Mars or Paris, France ... both places seemed about as far away.
</P>
<P>
   The house was cleaned, we stocked up on the sort of food we
usually ate on Sundays, and my brother and I got new blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to tell you that Windows 98 is anything as
important as the arrival of my Uncle Bill. After all, he usually
gave us silver dollars and told stories about Alaskan-grown
strawberries that got danged near as big as heads of lettuce. Uncle
Bill was a storyteller and free with his money.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is merely an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you will need to get ready for its arrival. You
probably won't need new blue jeans, but you do need to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrival of Windows 98 draws near, let's talk about how
you can get your computer ready for the newest version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you've already taken care of the first item on my list,
adding RAM. All the versions of Windows, including 95, are about as
hungry as a puppy with a tapeworm. Forget all the minimum
requirements and make sure you have at least 32 megabytes. Get 64
if you possibly can. With either version of Windows, RAM works a
lot like a supercharger when it comes to speed. You will notice a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Next you need to take a hard look at your hard disk. Truth is,
even 1-gigabyte disks are becoming too small for folks with a full
complement of programs. The good news is that hard disks -- just as
is true with RAM chips -- are cheaper than ever. The bad news is
that all these cheap prices can sure add up if you need RAM and a
bigger hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want to consider a faster modem if you have anything
less than a 56k bps modem. Now what, you ask, does upgrading a
modem have to do with installing Windows?
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact this is an Internet world nowadays, Windows
uses the Web for a remarkable feature that automatically looks for
updates to Windows itself and then helps you install them. That
means that, if you use the built-in feature, it's less likely
you'll miss an important bug fix or software update. But some of
these updates are huge -- 6 or more megabytes. You'll want to make
the download fast enough to make the process relatively pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   Next, make a quick inventory of multimedia accessories such as
video card, sound card and the like. Windows makes good use of
graphics and sound, but if your computer is more than three years
old, you'll likely want updates here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I wouldn't worry about is rushing out to buy a new
computer to take advantage of the USB (universal serial bus)
technology. Don't get me wrong. It's neat stuff -- with USB you'll
be able to connect a lot of gadgets to your serial bus without
worrying about conflicts. But you'll be buying a new computer soon
enough, so don't use USB as an excuse. If your PC is at least a
Pentium running at 166 megahertz, it should do just fine with
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check your wallet. If you are like most people, you'll
soon need to find about $109 because -- no matter what you think
now -- you'll almost certainly upgrade to Windows 98 within the
next three or four months.

 Mac News: Nisus Writer a bargain as substitute for Word  
 By Charles Haddad   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- If you're looking for a powerful yet inexpensive
alternative to Microsoft's Word 98, check out Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   The price of this word processor has been lowered to $85.95,
making it a heck of a good deal. Nisus (pronounced ``nicest'') not
only offers most of Word's features, it can do many things the
market leader cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus, for example, has 10 editable clipboards, unlimited undos,
synchronized scrolling between windows and the ability to rename a
document without closing it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nisus has a more-powerful find feature, letting you
search and change things across several documents at the same time.
And it has an interactive page preview feature that immediately
updates a document as you change margins, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading to Word 98 would cost $149. A new stand-alone version
of Word costs $399.
</P>
<P>
   Some features missing
</P>
<P>
   While strong, Nisus does have some glaring weaknesses that make
it a poor choice for some tasks. It lacks, for example, the
powerful outlining feature in Word. Nor does it support
multiple-column formats in a single document view.
</P>
<P>
   Its table feature is also weak compared with Word's, which now
lets you draw tables of any size in a document.
</P>
<P>
   But for writing -- whether a one-page letter or a 1,000-page
book -- Nisus is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the program is lean. Nisus needs 5.5 megabytes of
internal memory to run, while Word takes nearly twice that amount.
It's also faster and more responsive than either Word or
WordPerfect.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that, unlike its competitors, Nisus runs out of a
computer's internal memory. Sometimes that can cause problems, but
most of them can be fixed by giving Nisus more internal memory.
</P>
<P>
   Uncluttered look
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any other word processor, Nisus sports a simple, clean
look. Your screen is not cluttered with bars of buttons as with
Word and ClarisWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus has plenty of buttons and toolbars, but they are hidden
until you call them up. Most of them reside as tiny buttons drawn
into the right margin and bottom left corner of a document.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nisus' greatest strengths is the ease of adjusting it to
your personal working style. You can assign keyboard commands to
any function. Automating repetitive chores is also a breeze. You
can also assign a keyboard command to any automated task.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike Word 98, Nisus works with any Mac. That includes
older models such as the IIsi, the Classic and the LC.
</P>
<P>
   You can try out Nisus Writer by downloading a free demo from the
company's Web site at
http://www.nisus.com/nisus(underscore)writer.html. Give it try
before automatically opting for Word 98.

TRUTH IS NEVER MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Her name is Patricia Smith. Occasionally, I would
read her stuff on the news wire.
</P>
<P>
   Every columnist whose work is distributed nationally reads the
work of other columnists whose work is distributed nationally.
We're curious about what our peers are doing. Maybe somebody has an
idea worth stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Allen said once that imitation is the sincerest form of
radio. Same thing with columnizing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still waiting to do my own version of a column Jimmy Breslin
wrote when I was a high school kid. He turned out a gem on the guy
who dug John F. Kennedy's grave _ on that ordinary working man's
feelings about that extraordinary working day. One of these days,
maybe I'll get a chance to do something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith wrote for the Boston Globe. She's a gifted,
lyrical, almost magical writer. On the side, she does poetry and
other literary stuff. When I worked as an editor, I wrote novels,
but I have trouble doing that now. Four columns a week drains that
part of my brain.
</P>
<P>
   So, I would sometimes read her stuff on the wire, as she might
sometimes have read mine. I was a fan. That's why my jaw simply hit
my desk the other day when I read a story about her firing by the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith had been piping quotes. That's an ancient
newspaper term for making it up _ for sticking imaginary words into
imaginary mouths and printing them. In her farewell piece to Globe
readers, she admitted that she'd done that a few times, just to
lend drama to the point she wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   She was ashamed of it, she wrote. She'd become a columnist by
entering journalism through the back door, as a writer first rather
than as a reporter. She suggested that perhaps the craft's prime
directive _ that facts are sacred above all else _ hadn't anchored
deeply enough in her consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Patricia Smith had done the wrong thing, and the
Globe had done the right thing by sending her on her way. It was a
big topic in newspaper city rooms. Unless you live in Boston,
though, it wasn't a hot subject for discussion elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But, you know, the world seems increasingly filled with rabid,
foaming press-haters. I hear from a good half dozen of them every
week. They tend to be hard right-wingers. Their favorite delusion
seems to be that we news people are lying to them _ and to you,
too, by the way _ out of a deep-seated desire to sway the general
population to liberal political causes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a fairly middle-of-the-road guy. I tend to filter politics
through a half-century of life experience. You see enough
stupidity, and it's difficult to be doctrinaire on public issues.
</P>
<P>
   I lean toward what's likely to work, not to what conforms to
some rock-hard ideology.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm always surprised to hear from these people.
That's why I was surprised to hear from a few of them concerning
Patricia Smith. Ah-ha, they gloated. So, you guys do make it all
up, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, we don't. Sure, I'm a writer. But I'm a reporter
first. No fiction here. I'll save that for the next novel _ if I
ever get around to doing another one.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect? Hardly. I average about five corrections a year. But I
don't invent people. I don't pipe quotes. And do you know why not?
</P>
<P>
   Because, to write a column honestly, you need to grasp in your
gut that the truth as you see it is never, ever more important than
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how elegantly you phrase it.
</P>

MORE VIOLENCE FEARED IN RESTIVE MEXICAN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ The peace process with the
Zapatista rebels is dead and mounting tension in the Chiapas
highlands makes widening bloodshed nearly inevitable, some
observers here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is completely stymied,'' said Carlos David
Alfonzo Utrilla, a member of the conservative National Action Party
and a congressional candidate in the southeastern Mexican state of
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doors are closing, time is passing, and the pressure is
building,'' Alfonzo said. ``With the conditions we have here now, I
see the possibilities of large outbreaks of violence within the
next three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring such warnings were two shootouts June 10 involving
government forces and Zapatista rebels. At least nine people,
including a state policeman, died in some of the worst fighting
since a 1994 uprising for democracy and Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   The shootouts near El Bosque came shortly after the resignation
of San Cristobal's Roman Catholic bishop, Samuel Ruiz, from the
civilian commission that was overseeing the peace accords signed
two years ago by the rebels and the government. The agreement has
foundered.
</P>
<P>
   With Ruiz's resignation, the civilian commission disbanded and
only a commission of Mexican legislators was left to broker talks
between the Zapatista leader, Subcommander Marcos, and the
government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   The government's peace commission faces uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Amado Avendano, a San Cristobal newspaper publisher and 1994
candidate for governor in Chiapas, said Ruiz ``acted as a cushion,
a shock absorber'' in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could tell the Zapatistas to hold on a little longer, to
keep cool,'' Avendano said. ``But now the (rebel force) is alone
against the government. I don't know if it is a coincidence, but
three days after Samuel's resignation, we saw the confrontations
with the Zapatistas.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Zedillo _ who has traveled
to Chiapas four times in just over a month _ wants to jump-start
the dialogue, but the Zapatistas refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president clearly called for direct, unconditional
dialogue last week,'' the official said on condition of anonymity.
``We are sitting at the table waiting for them to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But few outside of Zedillo's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party take that at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has hardened its position and
heightened military action,'' Alfonzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo is double-talking. He says he wants peace talks, but
puts every obstacle in the way to realizing them,'' Alfonzo said.
The president has denied such charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas launched a 10-day uprising in January 1994,
seeking rights for the mostly impoverished Indians in the region
and more self-rule. At least 150 people died before a unilateral
cease-fire spawned a series of peace talks over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the peace talks dragged on, violence simmered throughout
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by Mexican army troops, most of the Zapatista forces
holed up in mountain camps near the Guatemala border. Marcos
maintained contact with the outside world through a series of
communiques issued via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But clashes between civilian Zapatista supporters and a growing
number of pro-government paramilitary groups _ particularly in the
northern part of the state _ boiled over with the massacre of 45
unarmed civilians at a church in the hamlet of Acteal in late
December.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shooting, Zedillo ousted the governor in
Chiapas and fired Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet Chemor,
replacing him with tough-talking Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a
veteran politician with rumored presidential ambitions. Labastida
took on the task of getting the peace process in Chiapas back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   Government negotiators played up constitutional problems with
indigenous autonomy aspects of the peace accords and called the
Zapatistas back to iron out the differences, but Subcommander
Marcos wanted the accords respected as signed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, frustrated Zapatistas began setting up their own
autonomous municipalities. Zedillo and the state government
declared the Zapatista municipalities unconstitutional, and the
state police have disbanded at least four in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes in El Bosque this month followed its proclamation as
an autonomous Zapatista municipality.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's resignation may mark the end of the peace accords. But
the move was necessary, argued Gonzala Ituarte Verduzco, vicar of
justice and peace in the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (commission) had become a part of the state's plan to
delay the peace process, serving as a whipping boy and diverting
attention from the real issues,'' he said. ``Now we (the church)
can propose new initiatives, new ideas for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Zedillo condemned ``the theologians of violence,''
an apparent reference to Ruiz, who is known as the ``Red Bishop''
for his 40-year work with Chiapas' poor Indians.

ROCK, ROLL AND RINGING IN THE EARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nick Ferrandino can still hear his sister's
advice, but he isn't listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is an audiologist and has always told me to wear ear
plugs,'' said Ferrandino, a rock guitarist from Albany. ``Part of
me knows she's right and part of me just doesn't enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrandino, 34, has been playing guitar for more than 15 years,
most recently with Lughead, an alternative rock band that prides
itself on sheer volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The louder the better as far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's aware of the danger. Musicians are among those most likely
to develop hearing problems, including a condition known as
tinnitus.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as head noise. An annoying ring, buzz or
high-pitched hum that affects one in seven Americans or about 36
million people. Of those, seven million have a severe case. Many
also suffer from hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone suffers from ringing in their ears at some time,
usually after a loud concert or a fireworks display. For people
with severe tinnitus, the ringing is constant. It can strike at any
age and is a lifelong problem.
</P>
<P>
   Tinnitus isn't a disease. It's a symptom that can be caused by a
lot of medical conditions, including high blood pressure, allergies
to cheese and chocolate and chronic use of certain medications,
like antibiotics and aspirin. With musicians or people who operate
heavy machinery, noise trauma is often to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people describe it like an engine running or like the
buzz of a horsefly'' said Donna Wayner, a audiologist at the
Hearing Center of Albany Medical Center and author of a new book,
``Hear What You've Been Missing: Coping with Hearing Loss.'' ``It
drives some people really nuts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Kelley of Colonie, N.Y., has spent the past 15 years
trying to cope with the changing landscape in her head. She was
diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus when she was 35.
</P>
<P>
   Her problem wasn't loud music but nerve damage from an unknown
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually its like sleeping in the woods,'' she said of her
tinnitus. ``It can be very noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the noise is like a radio or an alarm clock, and on
one afternoon, Kelley said it resembled somebody dialing a
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to listen to it,'' she said. ``It's annoying
because you can't shut it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinnitus is a source of frustration for those who suffer from it
and audiologists who try to help.
</P>
<P>
   There's no cure. Wayner helps people learn how to live with the
problem and counsels them on ways to focus their minds away from
the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will tell you. `I've had it for 40 years and I
don't pay attention to it,''' she said. ``It depends on the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's tinnitus gets worse when she's under stress. To help
her cope, she attends a monthly support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep it out of focus so it's not the biggest thing in
my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because tinnitus is such a complex condition with no single
cause, there's no recipe for prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians, however, take a risk every time they play without ear
protection. Consider Pete Townsend of The Who. He's suffers from
tinnitus and hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   H.E.A.R., a national group known as Hearing Education and
Awareness among Rockers, is trying to promote ear protection for
musicians and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrandino has no problem hearing the warnings. He just isn't
ready to turn down the volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it doesn't come back to haunt me later on,'' he
said.

BLACK AUTHOR EXPLORES ROOTS IN DEPRESSION-ERA ARKANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At the age of 75, after a career as a civil
engineer with the state of New York and a variety of business
ventures in retirement, Mars Hill is adding another accomplishment
to his varied resume: novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the genesis of ``The Moaner's Bench,'' however,
went according to the script for the Albany man. It is a
coming-of-age story about a black boy in Depression-era Arkansas,
being published in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always dreamed about writing a great play and getting it
produced on Broadway,'' said Hill, a playwright and guiding force
behind a local theater group, the Black Experience Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had his heart set on a playwriting workshop in 1987 during
the summer Writers Institute he attended at nearby Skidmore
College. But the playwriting unit was filled, and Hill was placed
in the fiction section with novelist Russell Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wasn't interested in writing fiction,'' Hill
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He was told that Banks _ author of the acclaimed novels
``Continental Drift,'' ``The Sweet Hereafter'' and
``Cloudsplitter'' _ was a fine teacher. Hill said he'd never heard
of Banks. Hill became a reluctant fiction student anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The first assignment was to write five different openings to a
novel of five pages each. Due tomorrow. ``I thought, is this Banks
fellow crazy?'' Hill recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled, recycled some old material, and more or less
completed the assignment. Banks and the other students then
critiqued the five openings and the group voted on the one they
thought best, the one Hill should continue for the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying I wanted to write the one about the railroad,
and Banks and the others said my best was the opening for `The
Moaner's Bench,''' said Hill, who finally relented and accepted the
teacher's advice.
</P>
<P>
   In Banks, a white novelist who has probed black-white relations
and race in America perhaps more deeply than any other novelist of
his generation, Hill found a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks turned out to be right,'' Hill said. ``He was very
encouraging and got this book going for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But real life got in the way of the novel about the segregated
South of the '20s and '30s, begun that summer of 1987. The opening
chapter of ``The Moaner's Bench'' sat on a shelf in Hill's
third-story attic writing space in his home for years as he got on
with the present.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring in 1983 after a 25-year career as an engineer, Hill
tried a succession of businesses. None lasted long or struck gold
for Hill and his wife, Alvania, a retired teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He kept writing plays, which now number in the dozens. He also
began course work for a doctoral program in humanistic studies at
the University at Albany. He returned to ``The Moaner's Bench'' as
part of his dissertation and chipped away at the manuscript over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, Hill trudged up four flights of stairs in the back
of their elegant Greek Revival home. At the top landing, Hill
ducked slightly under the attic doorway. His tall frame is topped
with a leonine head and a cloud of white hair that ends in soft
cascades of dreadlocks at the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, he cleared a space at the desk amid unruly piles
of papers and books and Jet magazines and went to work beneath
posters of Malcolm X and Gandhi. Hill trained his eyes on a
computer monitor and tried to conjure the Arkansas he knew as a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars has always had a lot of discipline and has been able to
accomplish any goal when he sets his mind to it,'' his wife said.
``He'd go up to that attic to write like he was going to a job
every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly a decade of fits and starts for Hill to complete
the manuscript of ``The Moaner's Bench.'' The title comes from the
term in the Southern Baptist tradition where sinners must kneel
until the spirit moves them to admit wrongdoing, leaving them open
to redemption.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he decided it was ready to send out to publishers. Only
he did not have a literary agent and he had never published a
novel.
</P>
<P>
   He sought out the advice of William Kennedy and the writer Peter
Burchard, of Williamstown, Mass., both of whom gave Hill contacts.
Other writers also gave advice.
</P>
<P>
   He sent out 10 unsolicited query letters to major publishers. He
got one mixed up, though, so that inside the envelope addressed to
HarperCollins was a letter with the name of a Morrow editor.
</P>
<P>
   The letter languished in the stack of unsolicited queries known
as ``the slush pile'' until it caught the attention of a
HarperCollins editor intrigued by the address error.
</P>
<P>
   Up from the slush pile Hill's letter rose, phoenix-like, against
all odds. A HarperCollins editor contacted him and asked to see the
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, leaning back in his battered desk chair recently, sipped
pineapple-orange juice and paused for effect in his molasses-paced,
husky-voiced narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The editor, he said, called a few days later, breathless. ``Did
you sell it yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he had not. ``I'll be up on the train to Albany
tomorrow morning with a contract,'' the New York-based editor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story behind the book is amazing,'' said Betsy Areddy,
senior publicist with HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moaner's Bench'' ($24) will go on sale nationwide in late
September under the HarperCollins literary imprint, HarperFlamingo,
the imprint for best-sellers Barbara Kingsolver, Isabel Allende and
Louise Erdrich.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Hill was given an advance double the average amount paid for a
first novel, he was told, but neither the author nor the publisher
would reveal the figure. The size of the first printing has not
been set yet, Areddy said, but a national marketing campaign is
planned as well as an author's tour to Chicago, New York and
Arkansas.

<P>
   He will return to Pine Bluff, Ark., where Mars Hill III was born
in the forest lands about 30 miles from Little Rock. Two siblings
died young and seven survived, five girls and two boys. Hill's
father was a merchant who ran a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never slaves. My ancestors were free people,'' Hill
said. ``We were in the forest, where timber was big business. My
grandfather owned 1,000 acres of land and gave property to each of
his children when they got married. We weren't cotton farmers in
the river bottom land. My childhood wasn't Richard Wright's
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's father died of complications from diabetes when Mars was
11 and the boy was placed in the care of a rich uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a disciplinarian, a real Southern Baptist,'' Hill said.
``He drilled into me duty, religion and work. My life became a
Bildungsroman.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that life Hill fictionalizes in ``The Moaner's Bench,''
told in the voice of a boy much like himself looking back to the
fire-and-brimstone rearing by Uncle Pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, I spent some time on the moaner's bench as a boy in
Pine Bluff,'' Hill said with a throaty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes his book is about redemption in metaphorical
terms. ``The racial problems in this country stem from the fact we
don't admit slavery was wrong,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get past that until we admit a crime was committed
against a people,'' he said. ``The country won't heal until we make
that admission. That old racial baggage will pull us down until
America does its time on the moaner's bench.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father died, Hill's mother remarried and the seven
kids were split up, with Hill and a sister going to Chicago to live
with relatives. Hill was drafted into the Army during World War II.
He finished high school in Chicago after his discharge and later
studied engineering at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hill got a job with Boeing in Seattle, where he got involved in
theater accidentally in the early '60s. ``My wife went to the Y,
where they were rehearsing `Emperor Jones,''' he recalled. ``The
director saw me and recruited me to play the engineer. I told him I
was an engineer, not an actor. He kept after me and I finally said
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill and his wife moved to Albany in the mid-'60s. He
established the Black Experience Ensemble shortly after he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is often stranger than fiction, Hill has decided. Readers
can decide for themselves when ``The Moaner's Bench'' hits
bookstores in the fall.

RETIREMENT SAVING EXCUSES FRAUGHT WITH SELF-DECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans are constantly told they are not saving enough for
retirement. In aggregate, that may be so. But we are not
aggregates.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a recent survey of working Americans by the Employee
Benefit Research Institute. This survey looks at four groups: those
born after 1964, 1954-1964, 1946-1953 and before 1946. The
following are percentages of each group, younger to older:
</P>
<P>
   Expect to retire by 60: 46, 42, 35 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   Are ``very confident'' of having enough money: 32, 22, 18 and
25.
</P>
<P>
   Have some retirement savings: 65, 70, 76 and 78.
</P>
<P>
   Have at least $100,000: 5, 10, 21 and 34.
</P>
<P>
   Have nothing: 35, 30, 24 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also divides Americans into five types by the way we
think, plan and spend:
</P>
<P>
   Deniers: ``It's pointless to save for retirement. I might not
live that long.'' This group, generally older, is the most
deliberate in its refusal to save.
</P>
<P>
   Strugglers: ``Save? I can't afford it.'' These tend to be
middle-aged high-school graduates. They tend to prefer
forced-savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   Impulsives: ``Save? I want to buy.'' This group is mainly young,
married and raising families. Their appetites leave no room for
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious savers: ``I save a little. I hope it's enough.'' This
group tends to be middle- or higher-income, many of them divorced
or separated.
</P>
<P>
   Planners: ``I learned to save as a kid.'' These are the
disciplined savers. Most know how much they need for retirement.
They typically are educated, take more risks and earn more.
</P>
<P>
   Half the non-savers in the institute's survey said the No. 1
reason they didn't save was lack of money. But it's notable that
half offered another reason. When savers and non-savers were asked
if they could afford to put away $20 more per week, the institute
got a ``yes'' from 57 percent of the savers _ and 55 percent of the
non-savers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like a lot of money, a thousand bucks a
year,'' says Paul Yakoboski of Employee Benefit Research Institute.
``If they start early, $20 a week could make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are saving. What the survey shows, Yakoboski
says, is that many are doing it with ``blind hope, faith and
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are also relying on retirement plans. Virtually all big
companies offer such plans, but many small ones don't. When asked
why not, employers with no plans most often told the researchers
that their employees would rather have the cash.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to fly in the face of another fact. Attorney William
Song, head of the employee benefits group at Davies Roberts &AMP; Reid
in Seattle and a consultant to the U.S. Department of Labor, says:
``Seventy-five percent of union members have pension benefits. It
is less than half for non-union employees.''
</P>
<P>
   When employees get together in unions, they want pensions. So
are those small employers deluded? Dishonest? Some may be, but it's
not necessarily so. Yakoboski noted that the work force in small,
non-union companies is less permanent than the average union shop,
lower paid, and most especially, younger. ``These are people
typically not focused on retirement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second most frequent reason for not having a retirement plan
was ``uncertain revenue.'' When asked what might induce them to
offer a retirement plan, two-thirds of these no-retirement
employers said ``increased profits.''
</P>
<P>
   But half also said ``demand from employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Among small employers with a retirement plan, only 35 percent
said it was a big help in attracting and keeping good employees _
and 19 percent said it was of no help at all.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement issue, in a way, is like medical insurance.
Government would like to have us all covered. On June 4 and 5,
President Clinton hosted a national conference on retirement
savings at which he and his labor secretary urged people to save
and companies to offer retirement plans. Song, who attended that
conference, notes particularly the value of defined-benefit plans,
in which the dollars-per-month are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said for a system of imposed
discipline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is also a plan of imposed discipline. Without
imposed discipline, more of us would end up wheeling around grocery
carts. But Americans resist too many impositions. We remain diverse
and cantankerous, some of us planners, some of us impulsives, some
of us deniers. The deniers are undoubtedly fools and should be
subject to all the propaganda that
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, T. Rowe Price and guys like me can throw at
</P>
<P>
   them.
</P>
<P>
   But if they persist, it's their retirement.

CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS BRAND-NEW TERRITORY FOR MANY IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALLYCASTLE, Northern Ireland _ As the sun dipped along the
Causeway Coast the other night, someone pointed out to 78-year-old
Joe Cahill that he had been on the run for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the run longer than that,'' he quipped, flashing
a mischievous grin as he walked this seaside town in County Antrim
looking for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Joe Cahill, a convicted killer and former chief of staff
of the Irish Republican Army, has spent most of his life on the run
or in prison. Now, he is campaigning for a seat in the new Northern
Ireland assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill is one of 296 candidates for the 108-seat body that will
be elected Thursday. Many of them are political neophytes. Some,
like Cahill, are convicted killers and products of a peace process
that led to the Good Friday agreement approved overwhelmingly by
voters last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new day,'' Cahill said, explaining how an old
``military'' man like him could ``go political.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for fighting is over,'' he concluded. ``The time for
dialogue is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, each of Northern Ireland's 18
districts will receive six seats in the new assembly. Unlike last
month's referendum, in which voters gave a simple yes or no to the
agreement, Thursday's election will call for them to rank
candidates in order of preference.
</P>
<P>
   In some districts, as many as 23 candidates will appear on the
ballot. Under the proportional representation system created here,
all who garner about 14 percent of the vote will get seats. Any
votes they receive above that level will be distributed to other
candidates according to preference.
</P>
<P>
   This means that both the voting and the tabulation process will
be complicated and time-consuming. Final results are not expected
until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the historic importance of the election, Northern
Ireland approaches it with a post-referendum apathy, exacerbated by
the drama of the World Cup soccer finals under way in France.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 71 percent of voters in Northern Ireland supported
the Good Friday agreement, which formed the political institutions
aimed at resolving one of the world's most intractable conflicts.
More than 80 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, the highest
turnout in Northern Ireland's 77-year history. But the turnout is
expected to be more in line with a general election _ about 67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that a small vote will help hard-core
anti-agreement forces win enough seats to wreck the assembly. Such
a daunting prospect could lead paramilitary groups, whose
cease-fires have been essential to the peace process, to conclude
that democratic politics cannot work here.
</P>
<P>
   But others like Sydney Elliott, a senior lecturer in politics at
Queen's University in Belfast, dispute the theory that a lower
turnout favors anti-agreement forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the referendum brought out a sizeable number of
(Protestant) evangelicals who took a moral position in voting no.
But politics to them is a dirty business, and I don't think you'll
see them voting this time around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost three times the number of candidates running
than the average in general elections and nearly twice as many as
those who ran in 1982, the last time Northern Ireland held an
assembly election. The plethora of candidates is explained in part
by the $47,000 salary assembly members will receive.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott believes that it is the historic nature of the
assembly that has attracted such a large field. Thursday's vote
marks the first time since 1972, when local government was
suspended and direct rule was imposed by British Parliament, that
most people here have agreed to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-agreement parties have called on their supporters to give
second preference votes to others who want the assembly to work.
Still, Elliott and others believe Thursday's vote will be cast as
usual, mostly along sectarian lines: Catholic nationalists who
aspire to unity with the Irish Republic will vote mostly for the
moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) and Sinn Fein,
the party linked to the IRA. Protestant unionists who want to
remain part of the United Kingdom will vote mostly for the Ulster
Unionists and the Democratic Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Alliance Party, the only large bloc that attracts
both Catholics and Protestants, could benefit most from the
tactical voting.
</P>
<P>
   Which unionists win seats will determine the ability of the
assembly to withstand the efforts of obstructionists. Next week,
the two biggest vote getters, expected to be the Ulster Unionists
and the SDLP, will put forward a first minister and deputy who will
lead a 12-member shadow cabinet until the assembly is functioning
in the fall. Ten other ministers will be appointed according to the
size of their party's vote. Sinn Fein will probably get two cabinet
posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists are led by the Rev. Ian Paisley, the
fundamentalist preacher who is adamantly opposed to Sinn Fein's
inclusion in the government. The Ulster Unionists, meanwhile,
remain divided over the issue of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble accepts British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's word that the IRA must gradually give up its
arsenal if Sinn Fein is to remain in the assembly and IRA prisoners
are to be released over the next two years. But dissidents don't
trust Blair and insist on ironclad assurances.
</P>
<P>
   Those who opposed the agreement are waging a campaign based
onthe same issues they used against the referendum - the fate of
weapons and prisoners. But this bloc received only 29 percent of
the referendum vote, and unless it does much better, it will be
hard pressed to obstruct the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly has mechanisms to encourage power-sharing and
consensus politics. On any contentious issue - and nearly every
issue is contentious in Northern Ireland - 30 or more members can
request a measure be passed by 60 percent of the assembly. This
calculus would prevent a repeat of the simple majority-rule system
in Stormont, the local parliament suspended in 1972, where
unionists used their majority to discriminate systematically
against nationalists and exclude them from power.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump in his hometown of Ballymena, the buckle of
Northern Ireland's Bible belt, Rev. Paisley insisted that his
forces need only 30 seats to render the assembly unworkable. As he
strolled around Ballymena, Paisley received almost universal
adoration. A lone heckler, an elderly Protestant named James Mark,
followed Paisley, urging the 72-year-old preacher to ``love your
neighbor. Love the Roman Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Paisley, a shoo-in for the assembly he has sworn to destroy, was
unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's strategy of running Cahill in Paisley's North Antrim
constituency appears designed to irritate Paisley as much as elect
Cahill. Paisley has called Cahill's candidacy ``an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen McAllister disagrees. A mother of two young children in
Waterfoot, a small town on Antrim's rocky, majestic coast, she
thinks Cahill's candidacy proves that the IRA is serious about
using politics to fight for a united Ireland. She believes that
former loyalist gunmen are setting the same example as they work to
stay part of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people look up to someone like Joe Cahill. If he
says its time for politics, then it's time for politics,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill has been surprised by how friendly people have been on
the campaign trail, including Protestants who abhor his IRA past.
``The only person who hasn't been respectful is Paisley,'' he said.
``He said I should have been strung up a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, just before he was to be hanged for his role in the
murder of a Belfast policeman, Cahill received a last-minute
reprieve. His cellmate, Tom Williams, went to the gallows. Asked if
Williams, an IRA icon, would support him or those who favor more
IRA violence, Cahill didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom would be right beside me,'' Cahill said. ``We spent the
last 4 1/2 weeks of his life together. You get to know a person in
a situation like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill's gentle, grandfatherly demeanor and thick eyeglasses
belie his past, which was dedicated to the use of violence to force
the British to leave Northern Ireland. But as he trudged around
Ballycastle's neat streets shaking hands, Cahill talked about the
future, not the past, as he acknowledged he hadn't set foot in the
town in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1969, I haven't been around a hell of a lot,'' he
chuckled, recalling his three decades on the lam or behind bars.

WHITE HOUSE PUSHES FOR GAY NOMINEE AS ENVOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House is making a concerted push for
philanthropist James Hormel to become ambassador to Luxembourg,
setting the stage for a prolonged battle with conservatives who
oppose the openly gay nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's supporters have been energized by recent statements on
homosexuality by leading Republicans, including a comment by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, who compared homosexuality to
alcoholism or kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and gay rights groups now say the issue has
become bigger than Hormel's confirmation and has evolved into a
question of whether the Senate should judge people on the basis of
their sexual orientation rather than their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle here has to be defended,'' said Kevin Ivers,
director of public relations for the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP
gay rights group. ``He deserves to be judged on his merits in an
up-or-down vote.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the administration plans
to keep working to get a vote by the full Senate. ``We're not
thinking in terms of a recess appointment right now,'' he said.
``What we are thinking of is in terms of a vote on the floor of the
Senate, just like the Constitution says.''
</P>
<P>
   A recess appointment allows the president to make appointments _
and sidestep the Senate's role of confirming nominations _ when
Congress is not in session. The appointee can serve until the end
of the congressional term.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee, heir to the Hormel meat-packing fortune, is a
former dean at the University of Chicago law school and a
contributor to a range of partisan and nonpartisan causes. His
nomination, made by President Clinton eight months ago, was
approved by North Carolina Senator Jesse Helm's Foreign Relations
Committee, though Helms did not vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   But the nomination has languished in the Senate after a small
group of conservatives, including Senator Robert Smith, a New
Hampshire Republican, put a hold on considering it. It's not clear
what the administration can do to clear the logjam.
</P>
<P>
   After Lott told a televison interviewer last week that he
thought homosexuality was a sin and likened it to sex addiction,
alcoholism and kleptomania, administration officials garnered
momentum for their cases.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Lott's comments, House Majority Leader Richard Armey
of Texas also said homosexuality a sin and quoted a Bible passage
he interpreted to mean that homosexuals, among others, shall not
inherit the Kingdom of God.
</P>
<P>
   The statements did not sit well with some Republicans, including
Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York, who wrote to Lott urging him
to schedule a vote on Hormel, saying the ``nomination is being
obstructed for one reason, and one reason only _ the fact that he
is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's Senate opponents insist their view on homosexuality is
not why they oppose him, but rather Hormel's advocacy of gay
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with his homosexuality. It has to do with
his advocacy and his anti-Christian bias,'' said Smith's press
secretary, Lisa Harrison. She said Smith became a critic of Hormel
after viewing a videotape of a 1996 gay rights parade in San
Francisco. Hormel provided some commentary in the video that Smith
thought mocked the Catholic faith, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who voted against
Hormel's nomination in committee, said he also would oppose him in
a Senate vote. Like Lott and Armey, Ashcroft said homosexuality is
a sin, though he did not go as far as Lott in defining it as a
dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are nominated to represent this country have to be
evaluated for whether they represent the country well and fairly,''
Ashcroft said at a luncheon with reporters last week. ``His conduct
and the way in which he would represent the United States is
probably not up to the standard that I would expect,'' said
Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a leader in promoting a lifestyle. ... And the
kind of leadership he's exhibited there is likely to be offensive
to ... individuals in the setting to which he will be assigned,''
Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Alphonse Berns, Luxembourg's ambassador to the United
States, said the people of his country would welcome Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay rights organization, said the comments by
Republican leaders clearly were aimed at reaching out the extreme
right of the party.

<P>
   There was a time when Michael Bailey, an expert in computer
graphics development, toed the party line: He told people that a
two-dimensional image of an object on a computer screen could
convey as much detail and enlightenment as the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years he's become something of a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to tell those people that I was wrong,'' he says.
``It's embarrassing, but graphics are just not as good as having an
object to touch and hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has rediscovered a need that we all, as babies,
instinctively recognized. When babies see something new, they
immediately want to explore it with their tiny fingers. It's the
way they acquire a solid working knowledge of the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Now a growing number of scientists are discovering, along with
Bailey, that a picture just won't do for their purposes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Objects large and small can be represented with physical models
_ and these are Bailey's new passion.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into his office at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and
you can't help noticing them littering his desk. Most have the
color, heft and polished softness of carved wood. His collection
includes a human heart, fist-size molecules and a strangely
flattened jack-o'-lantern.
</P>
<P>
   They look like solid wood, but all were crafted from paper and
glue.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor was a copy machine-size device called the Helisys
1015 Laminated Object Manufacturing Rapid Prototyping System _ or
LOM.
</P>
<P>
   The LOM is the star of the center's Tele-Manufacturing Facility,
which Bailey runs.
</P>
<P>
   (The LOM, a computer in Bailey's office and a link to the
Internet constitute the entire Tele-Manufacturing Facility.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tele-Manufacturing Facility represents the latest chapter in
the decade-long history of the attempt to turn computer graphics
into solid models _ a process known as rapid prototyping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that even before you pick up the model and touch
it, you've already gathered more information than if you just
looked at it on a flat computer screen,'' Bailey says. ``We're
trying to figure out why, but my hunch is that it has something to
do with the way your eye can vary its focus on a solid model.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Johnson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research
Institute, a LOM-created model of a protein turned out to be a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson studies the black beetle virus, a simple pathogen that
infects insects, so that he can better understand more complex
viruses that plague humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses have the same problems to solve whether they are HIV
or insect viruses,'' Johnson explains, ``and this one is very easy
to work with because it has only two genes.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of careful work, Johnson thought that he and his
colleagues completely understood the black beetle virus. They knew,
for example, that 180 identical copies of one protein linked
together to form the virus' geodesic dome-shaped outer capsule,
they knew how those links were forged and they could program a
computer to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Johnson handed his data over to Bailey, who then built
nine copies of the protein, each 20 million times actual size. When
Johnson got his hands on the protein models, he assembled three
into a clump, just as they assemble themselves in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning the proteins over in his hands, Johnson saw a hole
where the three molecules met. In all his years of studying the
proteins, this hole had eluded him. Computer graphics couldn't give
him enough sense of depth to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Johnson saw the hole in the model, he recognized that
it was a perfect fit for a peglike protrusion on another surface of
the three-protein chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an alignment just like you would align things if you
were fitting together pieces of wood,'' Johnson says, ``and we
hadn't realized it. We didn't even know we had missed it. Now it is
possible to design small molecules that can fit into that hole and
block the assembly of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   LOM begins building an object by creating the bottom-most layer.
Paper fed off a roll is glued to a metal platform inside the LOM,
and a carbon-dioxide laser then traces an outline on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Any paper lying outside the outline then gets crosshatched by
the laser, and the metal platform drops down a fraction of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of paper is then rolled out on top of the first
layer, and as they are heated to 400 degrees, the two layers fuse.
The laser now cuts a new outline for the second layer.
</P>
<P>
   The machine repeats this process hundreds or thousands of times,
and when the last layer has been rolled and cut, Bailey can pay the
model off the platform with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   The model is a solid block, but the crosshatched areas
surrounding the object fall away easily. The smaller pieces wedged
into cracks and crevices can be fished out with tools that look
like dental picks.
</P>
<P>
   The process can take anywhere from a few hours, for simple
models like the human heart in Bailey's office, to more than a day
for complicated molecules like the black beetle virus protein.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scorched edges of the paper form the exterior
surfaces of the parts, the finished product has the appearance of
aged wood, which can be accentuated by a coat of lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dru Clark, a graduate student at the University
of California at San Diego, Bailey has created hundreds of models.
Some are exotic: topographical maps of the seafloor and Venus, a
swirling hurricane. Others are traditional manufacturing models,
like gears and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   The data for building these models generally come to Bailey's
office over the Internet. Before a model can be built, though, the
data must be translated into a geometric representation of the
object's surface _ a mesh of as many as 600,000 tiny triangles.
</P>
<P>
   The translation isn't always smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the computer graphics on the screen
doesn't care about solidity,'` Bailey says ``You can do all kinds
of things with graphics and the computer will happily draw it up
because you are simply modeling appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can build only those physical objects that can exist in
three dimensions. There here are mathematical rules that must be
followed. If a gap is hiding in the data, for example, it can
become a crack in the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a crack, the machine can get confused about what
is inside and what is outside,'' Bailey says. ``For instance, if I
drew a circle on a piece of paper and asked you what was inside,
well, that's easy. But what if I drew an arc? What is inside? I
don't know. It could be the area on the bottom of the line, or it
could be the area on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has built a program that will let his computer
automatically check data for these sort of errors, with the
ultimate goal of making the LOM produce finished models without his
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   These subtleties of turning strings of ones and zeros into a
piece of sculpture are pretty much lost on the researchers who send
Bailey their data files, but he doesn't mind their indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists don't want to know, they just want the model.
They are only interested in the science,'' Bailey says. ``And that
is the purpose of the project _ scientists don't have to be
mathematicians or engineers.''

do with the way your eye can vary its focus on a solid model.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Johnson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research
Institute, a LOM-created model of a protein turned out to be a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson studies the black beetle virus, a simple pathogen that
infects insects, so that he can better understand more complex
viruses that plague humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses have the same problems to solve whether they are HIV
or insect viruses,'' Johnson explains, ``and this one is very easy
to work with because it has only two genes.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of careful work, Johnson thought that he and his
colleagues completely understood the black beetle virus. They knew,
for example, that 180 identical copies of one protein linked
together to form the virus' geodesic dome-shaped outer capsule,
they knew how those links were forged and they could program a
computer to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Johnson handed his data over to Bailey, who then built
nine copies of the protein, each 20 million times actual size. When
Johnson got his hands on the protein models, he assembled three
into a clump, just as they assemble themselves in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning the proteins over in his hands, Johnson saw a hole
where the three molecules met. In all his years of studying the
proteins, this hole had eluded him. Computer graphics couldn't give
him enough sense of depth to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Johnson saw the hole in the model, he recognized that
it was a perfect fit for a peglike protrusion on another surface of
the three-protein chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an alignment just like you would align things if you
were fitting together pieces of wood,'' Johnson says, ``and we
hadn't realized it. We didn't even know we had missed it. Now it is
possible to design small molecules that can fit into that hole and
block the assembly of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   LOM begins building an object by creating the bottom-most layer.
Paper fed off a roll is glued to a metal platform inside the LOM,
and a carbon-dioxide laser then traces an outline on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Any paper lying outside the outline then gets crosshatched by
the laser, and the metal platform drops down a fraction of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of paper is then rolled out on top of the first
layer, and as they are heated to 400 degrees, the two layers fuse.
The laser now cuts a new outline for the second layer.
</P>
<P>
   The machine repeats this process hundreds or thousands of times,
and when the last layer has been rolled and cut, Bailey can pay the
model off the platform with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   The model is a solid block, but the crosshatched areas
surrounding the object fall away easily. The smaller pieces wedged
into cracks and crevices can be fished out with tools that look
like dental picks.
</P>
<P>
   The process can take anywhere from a few hours, for simple
models like the human heart in Bailey's office, to more than a day
for complicated molecules like the black beetle virus protein.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scorched edges of the paper form the exterior
surfaces of the parts, the finished product has the appearance of
aged wood, which can be accentuated by a coat of lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dru Clark, a graduate student at the University
of California at San Diego, Bailey has created hundreds of models.
Some are exotic: topographical maps of the seafloor and Venus, a
swirling hurricane. Others are traditional manufacturing models,
like gears and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   The data for building these models generally come to Bailey's
office over the Internet. Before a model can be built, though, the
data must be translated into a geometric representation of the
object's surface _ a mesh of as many as 600,000 tiny triangles.
</P>
<P>
   The translation isn't always smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the computer graphics on the screen
doesn't care about solidity,'` Bailey says ``You can do all kinds
of things with graphics and the computer will happily draw it up
because you are simply modeling appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can build only those physical objects that can exist in
three dimensions. There here are mathematical rules that must be
followed. If a gap is hiding in the data, for example, it can
become a crack in the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a crack, the machine can get confused about what
is inside and what is outside,'' Bailey says. ``For instance, if I
drew a circle on a piece of paper and asked you what was inside,
well, that's easy. But what if I drew an arc? What is inside? I
don't know. It could be the area on the bottom of the line, or it
could be the area on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has built a program that will let his computer
automatically check data for these sort of errors, with the
ultimate goal of making the LOM produce finished models without his
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   These subtleties of turning strings of ones and zeros into a
piece of sculpture are pretty much lost on the researchers who send
Bailey their data files, but he doesn't mind their indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists don't want to know, they just want the model.
They are only interested in the science,'' Bailey says. ``And that
is the purpose of the project _ scientists don't have to be
mathematicians or engineers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For 139 years, ever since its delicate bones and feathers were
found splayed on a limestone slab in a German quarry, Archaeopteryx
has had the distinction of being the most primitive bird known.
</P>
<P>
   Its clawed wings, toothy beak and long bony tail, most
paleontologists now believe, show the transformation of a lineage
of bipedal dinosaurs into birds.
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery, the 145-million-year-old Archaeopteryx has
perched alone on a low branch of the avian evolutionary tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now the old bird finally has company. In March, paleontologists
described a 65- to 70-million-year-old bird from Madagascar, which,
though younger than Archaeopteryx, is almost as primitive. In life
it would have resembled a little winged Velociraptor.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists found the fossil in a quarry in northwestern
Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sampson of New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old
Westbury, N.Y., came across a wing bone embedded in rock.
Suspecting that more of the skeleton might be hidden in the rock,
he dug around the bone and shipped a yard-long block to the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, where the fossils could be
carefully extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the wing bone, the researchers thought they had a
relatively ordinary bird (it even had nodes on one edge where
feathers were once lodged) _ until they uncovered the tail. Modern
birds have a stub to anchor a fan of feathers; the Madagascar bird
had a bony tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looked really primitive,'' says Catherine Forster of
Stony Brook. ``I remember a preparator was working on the foot, and
I joked that wouldn't it be funny if the foot had a big sickle
claw?''
</P>
<P>
   She was remembering that in the 1970s John Ostrom of Yale had
suggested that birds were closely related to dromaeosaurs,
predatory dinosaurs with giant sickle claws on their feet. This
group included dinosaurs such as Deinonychus and Velociraptor,
which probably disemboweled prey with their claws.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Archaeopteryx had evolved, most paleontologists
assumed, this weapon had dwindled to an ordinary bird claw.
</P>
<P>
   After she made her joke, Forster left the lab to teach an
anatomy class. Half an hour later a colleague called from the lab
to tell her that the bird did indeed have an inch-long sickle claw.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recovered part of the bird's tail and spine, the
pelvis, much of its legs, parts of its arms and a shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   To determine its closest relatives, Forster compared it with
seven birds and eight dinosaurs, using a computer to calculate the
simplest evolutionary pattern that could produce their anatomic
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis showed that the Madagascar bird was nearly as
primitive as Archaeopteryx, possibly located on the same side
branch of bird evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Forster and her colleagues have named the bird Rahonavis
ostromi.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rahona' is a Malagasy word,'' Forster says, ``with a double
meaning: 'cloud' and 'menace.' We thought it was a good name for a
flying killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Forster also honored Ostrom with the name because the fossil
further supports the bird-dinosaur connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although most paleontologists subscribe to Ostrom's ideas today,
there are critics. Some argue that dinosaurs lost their fourth and
fifth fingers while birds are missing their first and fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have looked at dinosaur fossils found recently in
China and have argued that they had crocodile-like lungs radically
unlike those of birds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Forster and others, the many primitive bird and birdlike
dinosaur fossils found recently in Spain, China and Argentina
bolster Ostrom's theory.
</P>
<P>
   Rahonavis, Forster says, is a particularly strong link in the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a primitive bird, it looks almost exactly like
Archaeopteryx, and it has a dromaeosaur foot, which is a pretty
clear link to its dinosaur origins.''

OLD NORTH CHURCH BALANCES PIETY, PATRIOTISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the Rev. Stephen Ayres, vicar of the Old North
Church in Boston's North End, closed the church to tours because of
a funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   A guide leading a tour group was shocked when Ayres told him he
couldn't come inside. ```What do you mean you're closed?''' Ayres
recalls the guide saying. ```The church is always open between 9
and 5.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ayres said his response was, ``Hello _ this is a church;
funerals happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   While most tour guides are understanding, Ayres offers the
anecdote to underscore the challenge of running Old North _ making
sure people realize that one of America's most famous churches is
not a museum but home to a living, worshiping congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists are always amazed that this is not a dead church,''
said Ayres, who has been vicar since May of last year. ``This is a
living community of faith. That's also a message that we're trying
to get out to people moving into the North End.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is hitting home, judging by the growing number of
people showing up for Sunday services. Ayres says that about 120 to
140 regularly attend the liturgy. The number of members has jumped
in recent years from 20 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a sense that the congregation is becoming
more vibrant and that is certainly a positive development,'' said
Ayers, seated inside his office while yet another tour group filed
through the sanctuary a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The church's robust growth is a byproduct of the changing
demographics of the North End, long identified as a tightly-knit
Italian enclave. In recent years, the neighborhood has attracted
many single professionals and young couples, some of whom have
found their spiritual niche at Old North.
</P>
<P>
   Immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, ``Paul
Revere's Ride'' it was the church from which Robert Newman agreed
to shine one lantern if the British approached by land and two if
by sea. It was built in 1723 as an Anglican congregation to provide
for the spiritual needs of the surrounding townsfolk. Old North is
officially called Christ Church in the City of Boston and is part
of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The church flourished for decades. In the early 1800s, the Rev.
Asa Eaton, leading a thriving and affluent congregation, opened the
country's first Sunday School. More than 200 children were
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The church's decline began in the mid-19th century when an
influx of Irish immigrants and Russian Jews transformed the
neighborhood. This was followed later in the century by a wave of
Italian newcomers, who gave the community the distinctive flavor it
still has today.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this century, only a handful of people
worshiped at Old North. Eventually, the parish was reduced to a
mission and taken over by the Episcopal bishop. Even today, the
Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the diocese, officially is the
rector of Old North, though Ayers is in charge of daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   The church boomed as a tourist spot when the Freedom Trail was
developed in the 1950s. Today, it is the second-most-popular site
on the trail, after the USS Constitution. More than 750,000 people
will trek through its storied walls this year. The church even has
its own Web site (www.oldnorth.com).
</P>
<P>
   Ayers, who came to Old North after six years at Emmanuel Church
in Wakefield, said he realizes that he must balance the patriotic
with the pious.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, the church plans to renovate some of
the buildings on the Old North campus and to add new space.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that visitors do not fully appreciate the role that
religion played in the country's founding. ``Was God blessing
America by starting the revolution from the steeple of a church?''
Ayer said.

   Before Before beginning a three-day visit to Austria June 19,
Pope John Paul II said he hoped to try to salve the wounds of a
church reeling from news that the country's most senior prelate,
archconservative Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, had been accused of
sexually molesting a schoolboy 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Groer was forced to resign as archbishop of Vienna. Several
priests and monks also accused Groer of sexual abuse. ``The pope
and his bishops want to help overcome these problems,'' John Paul
said during his weekly audience at the Vatican Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _James C. Dobson, the powerful conservative political activist
and founder of the faith-based Focus on the Family, was said to be
recovering in a Colorado from what doctors said was a mild stroke.
Dobson entered a hospital in Colorado Springs late Tuesday after
becoming sick, according to a statement from his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing as well as could be expected,'' Dobson said in the
statement. ``I will need to continue to take some time to get back
on my feet. Please pray for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Dobson did not suffer any paralysis or loss of
consciousness. Dobson said his cardiologist told him, ``You must
have had an angel looking out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he has emerged as a major political player who
is pressuring the Repbulican Party to heed the concerns of social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   _The Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ,
the state's oldest and largest Protestant denomination, voted
overwhelmingly at its recent convention to oppose the death
penalty. The church joins the Roman Catholic Church as well as
liberal Protestant denominations and Jewish congregations in
opposing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   _Metropolitan Methodios, bishop of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of
Boston, received a welcome surprise recently when George Behrakis,
a well-known church benefactor, announced that he was donating
$500,000 towards the purchase of a diocesan camp and retreat
center. Behrakis, who runs a pharmaceutical company, revealed his
donation at a diocesan dinner. The camp and retreat center will be
located in Contoocook, N.H.

SLIM PICKINGS FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins know all about highly touted center Vincent
Lecavalier, a sure bet to be one of the top picks _ if not the very
highest _ in Saturday's National Hockey League entry draft in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   They know of his Joe Thorntonlike size. They know of his 115
points in 58 games in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with
Plymouth last year. They know he is very skilled and has a nice
change of speed in his skating. They know he needs to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   And most of all they know, in all likelihood, it doesn't matter
how much they know about Vincent Lecavalier. Or, for that matter,
David Legwand. Or Bryan Allen. Or Dmitri Kalinin. Or Vitaly
Vishnevsky.
</P>
<P>
   All are among the best of the best in this year's crop of
prospective NHLers. And, barring a major trade to vault up in the
draft order, all will be long gone before the Bruins get near
making their first pick.

<P>
   What a difference a draft year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bruins got a big-time boost _ and a healthy shot
of hope for years to come _ when they took Thornton with the first
pick overall and Sergei Samsonov with the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they don't pick until No. 48, and to make matters
even more sticky, at least in the short term, they could lose more
than they gain this weekend because they stand to surrender a
player _ perhaps veteran forward Mike Sullivan or defenseman Dave
Ellett _ to the aptly named Nashville Predators in Friday's
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft is part of the business, said assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell. And the fact that the Bruins have a
solid group of younger players should take the sting out of losing
a body and not having high picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Joe Thornton comes in and has more of a role in the
team's success,'' O'Connell said. ``And hopefully Sergei will be
more prominent, start to the end, as will (P.J.) Axelsson and (Hal)
Gill. Hopefully those young players will step it up a notch,
(Jason) Allison as well as (Anson) Carter. (Kyle) McLaren still. We
have quite a few young players and hopefully they will improve.
They should improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bruins had the first overall pick in the draft
for the first time since 1982, when they took Gord Kluzak. And they
had two picks in the top eight for the first time since 1970, when
they took Reggie Leach at No. 3 and Rick MacLeish at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' first selection has never been as low as this year's
No. 48. They also have the 52d pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we have to wait and see,'' said O'Connell. ``Last
year I'd say we definitely had the control of the draft. This year
is more wait and see. See what's available.''
</P>
<P>
   And hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope 20 people make mistakes,'' O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hoping somebody slips, which happens,'' said director
of scouting Scott Bradley. ``What if a kid rated in our top 27
slips into our 45 range? That would be nice, and it's what we're
hoping for, but we're not counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they counting on a trade and certainly not counting on
coming up with two players who will make the team out of training
camp next fall as Thornton and Samsonov did last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have only six picks overall in the draft's nine
rounds. They would have picked 19th but traded their first-rounder
to Colorado for Landon Wilson and Anders Myrvold in November 1996.
The No. 48 pick is their own and the No. 52 is a compensatory pick
they got from Toronto for the Leafs' signing of free agent Kevyn
Adams. They also have picks in the third round (No. 78 overall),
fifth round (135), sixth (165), and ninth (250). They traded their
fourth selection to Los Angeles with Jozef Stumpel and Sandy Moger
for Byron Dafoe and Dmitri Khristich, their seventh-rounder to
Calgary for Sullivan and their eighth-rounder to Vancouver for
Grant Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   Six picks overall, starting with No. 48?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a good deal of pressure to get a player,''
Bradley said. ``You don't want to get shut out in a draft. Ever. If
three or four picks out of this batch of six picks played with the
Bruins, we'd be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going in you think every guy has a chance, but you
have to look at the numbers. I don't have them in front of me, but
if you get two or three players out of one year, you're doing
terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Joe DiPenta of Nova Scotia and Boston University and
Bobby Allen of Hull and Boston College are ranked Nos. 33 and 34
among North Americans by the Central Scouting Service, and when
goaltenders and European players are added in, they could well be
around by the time the Bruins pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, like all teams, have been checking out prospective
picks for months and will convene as a staff today in Buffalo. They
will conduct interviews with 20-30 players in the next couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Saturday, well after the Vincent Lecavaliers and
David Legwands have stepped to the podium and modeled their new
team jerseys, the Bruins will get their turn to pick a player.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bright side to where the Bruins stand, said
O'Connell. He thinks the talent available in the draft last year
was a little stronger than what's up this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we took a good time to have a bad year,'' said
O'Connell of the last-place finish that got the Bruins a
first-place pick last year. ``But who knows?''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Eric Moffett graduated from Princeton University last year
with a degree in economics, the Houston native knew he wanted to be
a businessman. Rather than choose an industry, however, Moffett
took what is becoming a more familiar road for recent college
graduates: He became a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett joined the Boston office of Bain &AMP; Co., a strategy
consulting firm, as an associate consultant, a two-year position.
In his eleven months at Bain, Moffett has worked on cases involving
the software and financial services industries; he recently joined
the company's private equity group. And although he eventually
wants to start his own company, Moffett says Bain is teaching him
essential business skills. Better yet, his colleagues and bosses
understand that he might not want to be a consultant forever _ and
they support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture really tends to foster entrepreneurial ventures,''
Moffett says, citing the case of Intuit Inc., the Mountain View,
Calif., software firm started by former Bain consultant Scott D.
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   As college students _ especially those who, like Moffett, have
liberal arts degrees _ put off making binding decisions about their
careers until later in life, management consulting is growing
increasingly popular as a step along the way toward a business
career.
</P>
<P>
   At Bain, about 7,000 resumes stream into the Boston office each
year from college seniors eager to snag one of about 70 job offers,
says Chris Bierley, vice president in charge of associate
consultant recruiting for Boston. In the past five years, Bierley
says, Bain's application rate for associate consultant positions
has jumped 20 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Monitor Co.'s applications have grown each year; the
firm now gets 15,000 resumes nationwide from undergrads who want to
work in the North America division, says W. Sean Ford, head of
global recruiting for the Cambridge management consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Mercer Management Co. saw its college graduate
applications jump 10 percent this year; only about 2 percent of
applicants are offered a job. McKinsey and Co., also a major New
York management consulting firm, hired 487 undergrads last year, up
from 396 in 1996 and 356 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As the major consulting firms increase their overall personnel
about 15 percent a year, Ford says, Monitor and its competitors
have seen competition for associate consultant-level jobs heat up.
And today students graduating with less technical majors, such as
English and philosophy, are also lining up for interviews at
Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a broader range of majors applying year to year,''
Ford says. ``It's not just economics majors.''
</P>
<P>
   College seniors and consulting firms seem to be a perfect match.
A recent graduate may be looking for an interesting, well-paying,
short-term job with maximum exposure to different industries;
consulting concerns need energetic 22-year-olds with proven
problem-solving skills who are willing to travel frequently and
work long hours as part of a case team. Associate consultants at
major firms make about $40,000 per year; other expenses, such as
briefcases and PalmPilots, are often company-subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of 21-year-olds today are interested in being able to
solve a variety of problems and get a breadth of experience,'' says
Cathy Baker, head of nationwide recruiting at Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   And it's fun, young consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In strategy consulting, the recent undergrad has the
opportunity to gain a bird's-eye view of the entire firm and how it
operates,'' says Tami J. Goven, an associate consultant who joined
Bain's Boston office last summer. ``You're typically working with
the most competitive, pressing issues a company faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Goven's story echoes the trend sweeping undergraduates into
consulting jobs. The Minneapolis native graduated from Duke
University in 1997 with a double major in economics and public
policy. After interning in the legislative affairs department of
Sun Microsystems, Goven realized she preferred a corporate
get-it-done attitude to the relative inefficiency of government.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``consultant'' used to apply most often to retired or
maverick executives who sold their expertise. But the new breed of
consultants knows little to nothing about its clients' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With no experience in industry, Goven doesn't make solo
boardroom presentations to multimillion-dollar companies. But the
young consultant, who works about 60 hours a week, says an
undergrad's abilities _ ``people skills, communication skills,
analytical skills'' _ are still valued in a case team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, brain power may be the most important thing a consulting
firm gets out of most young hires. ``A lot of business is difficult
to teach in books,'' says Moffett, the economics major. ``The only
real thing that came out of college that helped was the ability to
solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And this lack of experience in any one industry may be an asset.
A successful applicant usually has ``very strong academic
performance and the ability to work in teams,'' rather than
extensive exposure to the business world, Ford says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things young consultants pick up on the job is
the lingo: ``Strong time-management skills,'' ``ramp-up period,''
and ``stream of analysis'' are all buzzwords that pepper Goven's
speech. But more than a supply of stock phrases, consultants say,
taking a two- to four-year job at a management consulting firm can
help the ambitious young businessperson land a job in industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take former Bain consultant Daniel J. Krifcher, now vice
president of America Online's AOL Studios, which develops new
concepts for the Virginia-based Internet provider. In 1983, after
graduating from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School
with an undergraduate degree in systems and finance, Krifcher went
to Bain's Boston office, where he spent almost five years. The
consulting firm financed a start-up mortgage company he co-founded
after moving on.
</P>
<P>
   But leaving consulting didn't mean Krifcher left behind the
consultant's way of thinking, what he calls ``an analytical rigor,
a discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exaggerating when I say that having been a consultant
right after college really set the tone for my career,'' says
Krifcher, who joined AOL after earning his MBA from Harvard
Business School. ``I learned that there's always an answer, always
a solution, no matter how complicated the problem and how short the
time frame.''

IT'S MCCAIN VS. THE BAD GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a man be too big for his political party?
</P>
<P>
   That question becomes pivotal to the challenge that a
presidential bid by Arizona Senator John McCain poses for the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   As a war hero and prisoner of war whose dogged committee work
has made him one of the most important members of the Senate
majority, McCain has attained a stature and level of popularity
that probably eclipse that of any other Republican. There are other
war heroes in the Senate _ Kerry and Kerrey, for two _ but McCain's
life story is the most dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   A screw-off at Annapolis (``I stood fifth from the bottom of my
class at the Naval Academy,'') a brash brat whose father and
grandfather were Navy men with ships named after them, McCain was
flying a Navy fighter over Vietnam when he was shot down, injured,
captured, tortured, and put on ice in the Hanoi Hilton for six
years, refusing offers to be repatriated ahead of his turn, denying
the enemy their propaganda payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years in Congress has seen him rise to chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee. But his stout efforts to reform the
corrupt campaign finance status quo, and his bloody but
unsuccessful bid to curb teenage smoking, have placed him against
the leadership and consensus of his shame-faced Republican
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It was the unrestricted soft money from the big tobacco barons,
as well as limitless contributions to individual senators
(including Democrats) and more than $40 million in targeted
broadcast advertising in the backyards of wavering GOP senators
that enabled Big Tobacco to bring the Senate Republicans to heel.
By working closely with White House advisers, and carving a
sensible middle-ground position on the complex issues around the
how-do-we-get-teenagers-to-stop-smoking? question, his Commerce
Committee voted 19-1 for a bipartisan compromise that had the
support of 57 of the Senate 100. Not enough, alas. The tobacco
lobby went to work on Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, and some of McCain's Republican pals who had voted
with him in committee turned around and stabbed him in the back in
the cloture vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lott came up with 42 others beside himself, and they stood fast
for cancer, emphysema, and teen smoking. As a result, McCain glumly
recounted for a journalist lunch crowd Monday, ``3,000 more kids
will start smoking today, and one thousand of them will die
prematurely'' from tobacco-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   In his home state and elsewhere, tobacco company ads savage
McCain as a big-government liberal, a big-tax man, who has it in
for smokers, and people who like small government and low taxes.
It's the crudest kind of advertising, unanswerable at anything like
that volume, and it has turned voters against him, even back home,
where he's up for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   After November, McCain decides if he'll hazard a presidential
primary run. He knows now that he'll have the tobacco lobby after
him, as well as the Soft Money Industry, a shadowy collection of
special interests, whose nefarious influence is magnified by the
surreptitous supply of soft money to sycophantic senators.
</P>
<P>
   There are others riled at McCain _ the telecommunications giants
who have been ripping off consumers with higher phone and cable
rates (cable's up 17 percent in two years, fellow chumps), and the
ethanol lobby, which has ferocious clout with the corn-selling
farmers of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spit in the eyes of his North Vietnamese captors for six
years, and for his trouble they broke his arms and booted his butt.
Now the tobacco lobby is trying to do what the North Vietnamese
prison guards could not do _ break his will. The rifle butt has
been replaced by the TV spot, broadcast all over the back country,
riling the ranchers and rodeo hands of Arizona, telling them to
despise a senator who merely wants their kids to have a better
chance of not dying from lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the late Paul Tsongas, his cancer in remission and his
conscience running full-bore, took on his party's sacred cows in
the 1992 election cycle has a (OK, former) senator of some national
stature so gone to war against his party's orthodoxy. With Tsongas,
it was the Democrats refusal to buck any union dictate, do any kind
of favor for big business, or acknowledge the inefficiencies of
certain economic nostrums that made his pro-business policies
heresy for some in his party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a latter-day Tsongas to many, is a true-blue
conservative who scoffs at suggestions he defect to the opposition
party. This is not a guy who defects, period. But even this
brass-bottomed conservative cannot stomach the soft money crack
habit of his colleagues, and their allegiance to the campaign funds
dangled by Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a rather complicated personal history, and to a
penetrating query about his readiness to have his personal life
dredged up for public inspection, he replies evenly: Take your best
shot. His life is wide open, he's had his peccadiloes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to maintain that it's nobody's business. And
if that is something that hurts me, then that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a guy who can be intimidated. And in today's tawdry
politics, that alone makes him worthy of considering no matter what
your philosophy.

EUGENE MCCARTHY ON HOW TO KEEP POLITICS (REASONABLY) CLEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- The topics that lather area code 202 seem to
Beltway inmates random and unconnected. Not far away, in the
serenity of the Rappahannock Valley and in the shadow of Stony Man
Mountain, the mess seems coherent, of a piece.
</P>
<P>
   The flights and frights of campaign finance and special
prosecutors arise from a gullibly innocent lust for ``reform,'' an
effort ``to take the politics out of politics,'' according to
Eugene J. McCarthy. He's been writing books for 40 years, and his
latest, ``No-Fault Politics,'' laced with quotations from
Chesterton, Shakespeare, and ``Mr. Dooley,'' is as sharp as a
Minnesota winter.
</P>
<P>
   Calling special prosecutors ``a cure that spreads the disease,''
he writes: ``Congress has avoided its ultimate responsibility. It
has encouraged the courts to become deeply involved in prosecution
at a high level of politics. The function of the courts is to
judge, not to prosecute or appoint prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's solution? He has more faith in the Constitution than
do the ``reformers,'' whose legislation produced special
prosecutors. ``It is better to place the area of doubt within the
range of popular judgment than to pretend that partisanship does
not exist,'' he writes. ``We should abolish the special prosecutor
laws and practices and let Congress, the press, and the people make
the judgments. Better to overdo the impeachment process than
continue to abuse the silly and destructive special-prosecutor
process we now have.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment? The prospect rattles stemware in Georgetown, but
McCarthy thinks it can be a natural feature of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you remember when I said in the campaign that at the end
of my term impeachment would set a good precedent?'' he asked from
his Virginia farm. Having covered his 1968 campaign for president,
I do remember vividly what he said he would do first if elected:
``Tear down the fence around the White House.'' McCarthy disdains
cant and orthodoxy. Elected to the House in 1948 and to the Senate
in 1958, he made history in 1968 when he challenged the reelection
of President Lyndon B. Johnson. At 82, he is as trenchant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there's a premium on informers and bounty hunters,'' he
says. ``Stool pigeons are part of the judicial system. It seems
like everyone's a repo man now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's dissent extends to the ``puritan virtue'' of
``process liberalism'' infecting proposed changes in campaign
finance. ``The myth is twofold: that process equals policy and that
a good process is a clean or uncorrupted process. This is a
mechanistic and a simplistic view of public life and action, one
that bets everything on procedural reform,'' he writes. ``For the
innocents of our time, politics can never be clean enough. So in
the name of doing good, the innocents do much harm.''
</P>
<P>
   He names ``notable innocents.'' John Gardner is Public Innocent
No. 1 because the founder of Common Cause, ``with some help from
other people and organizations, reorganized Congress and
presidential politics ... into ineptitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, McCarthy wrote ``Frontiers in American Democracy,''
which warned how innocence could menace the coming decades: ``The
innocent is disposed to favor massive effort and all-out war rather
than containment or limited war, to demand action leading to final
decision when postponement of trouble or limited or even temporary
good may be the best that can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene McCarthy is not a prophet without honor, but he is a
private citizen without a Senate platform. He did not choose to run
again in 1970, in part because Public Innocent No. 2, Margaret
Chase Smith, ``generally a sound legislator,'' answered 1,000
consecutive roll-call votes, even though meeting roll calls ``is in
many ways the least important thing that senators do. Shortly after
I left the Senate, a roll-call vote was taken on what to do with
the remains of Smokey the Bear.''

&HT;        MORE WASTE WOULD BE STORED AT WARD NUCLEAR SITE, REPORT
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 23 -- The company that hopes to run the
proposed nuclear waste dump in Ward Valley has a history of not
containing radioactive materials at its sites and may be in
financial peril, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   And the company may be planning to put far more nuclear waste in
the site -- in a more dangerous form -- than it had originally
proposed, according to the report released Tuesday by the General
Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report could put additional pressure on a plan which, since
it was first proposed 15 years ago, has been the subject of legal
battles, protests by Native American and environmental groups, and
has been the source of a heated battle between Gov. Pete Wilson and
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings, together with questions raised in (a report
last year by economist F. Gregory Hayden) about the necessity for a
low-level disposal site in California and the ongoing environmental
concerns must raise very serious questions about the wisdom of
going forward with the Ward Valley project at all,'' said Rep.
George Miller, D-Martinez, who along with Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., requested the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that, in light of all this evidence, Gov. Wilson
would terminate this project and end this very contentious and
litigious controversy once and for all,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for American Ecology -- the parent company for
U.S. Ecology, the company that would run the site -- did not return
calls for comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter included in the GAO report, American Ecology's
Joe Nagel attacked the report. ``Specious arguments offered by
project opponents are presented without providing readily available
scientific information which discredits those arguments,'' Nagel
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a proposal to build a waste disposal site in the
Mojave desert near Needles for low-level radioactive materials from
hospitals and nuclear plants. The plan to sell the land for the
site from the federal government to the state of California was
approved by the Bush administration on the day before Clinton took
office. The Clinton administration reversed the decision soon after
taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the original land transfer was legal is the subject of a
pending court battle. But many groups have also questioned the
safety of the site because of the nature of the nuclear waste that
would be dumped and because of the proximity of the site to the
Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that American Ecology had disposed of
significantly more high-level plutonium at its other sites in
Washington, Kentucky and Nevada than had been previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   At one site, in Beatty, Nev., which was used as a model for the
Ward Valley plan because of its similar desert location, employees
illegally dumped liquid nuclear waste -- which is barred from the
proposed Ward Valley facility -- throughout the 1970s. American
Ecology, then called the Nuclear Engineering Company, pleaded ``no
contest'' to two criminal counts and was fined $5,000 for each.
</P>
<P>
   Another facility at Maxey Flats, Ky., was run by the company for
25 years until it was closed in 1977 because the plutonium dumped
there had ``migrated'' hundreds of feet from its original burial
site. It is now a Superfund site.
</P>
<P>
   And, the report found, the company dumped 47,800 55-gallon drums
of radioactive wastes in the Pacific Ocean near the San Francisco
Bay between 1946 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visual observations using remotely operated vehicles and
submersibles show that many of the drums have ruptured and spilled
their contents onto the sea floor,'' according to the report. ``The
conclusions of the studies that have been conducted to determine
the levels of radioactivity vary on the significance of the
contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   In its application for the Ward Valley facility, U.S. Ecology
estimated that less than 1 pound of plutonium would be buried at
the site. However, according to the report, the company actually
estimates that it will dump about 124 pounds of plutonium-239 -- a
highly radioactive form that environmentalists say is 200 times
more toxic than weapons-grade plutonium -- at Ward Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies that assertion. ``U.S. Ecology never
projected that 120 pounds of plutonium would go to Ward Valley,''
Nagel wrote in his response to the report, adding that they only
used the figure in a safety analysis because they wanted to use a
``conservative overestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that an environmental impact study done
jointly by the state of California and the federal Bureau of Land
Management did not adequately address questions of whether
radioactivity could be released into the atmosphere, the water
table, or the surrounding land.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Gov. Wilson, who has been fighting to purchase the
land for the dump since 1991, were unavailable for comment.

ACTIVIST BLAMES FRIEND'S DEATH ON SITE POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATFORD, Conn. _ The Little League diamond is surrounded by a
chainlink fence, topped with rusty barbed wire and entangled with
weeds. The old light poles lean precariously toward the infield.
And the scuffed and faded red scoreboard looks down upon rotting
wooden bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Raybestos field is built on landfill used by the now defunct
asbestos producer. It's where John O'Connor, the Cambridge
environmental activist running for the 8th Congressional District
seat, played baseball as a kid along with a friend, John (Kit)
Peters, who died of testicular cancer at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in his campaign, O'Connor is blaming the toxic waste just
below the grass and otherwise strewn about this town, for Peters'
death. That event led to O'Connor's interest in environmental
protection and his work to win Congressional approval of the
Superfund environmental cleanup laws in the 1980s, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But town officials and health experts say there is no proof that
Kit Peters died as a result of exposure to toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of assertion is unfounded. It's understandable that
people who played on the field or people who had exposure to areas
where the waste was buried, particularly if individuals developed
cancer, will be suspicious about the cause of their cancer and may
link it to that exposure. But there is absolutely no evidence in
all of the studying we've done that can show us definitively the
cause and effect,'' said town health director Elaine O'Keefe.
</P>
<P>
   A decades-long study released several months ago by the
Connecticut Department of Public Health analyzed cancer data from
the department's Tumor Registry, one of the oldest in the country,
and environmental contamination data from the Environmental
Protection Agency. Computer-generated models were developed to
estimate exposure based on how close those with cancer lived to the
sites in Stratford, where the former Raybestos Corp. (now called
Raymark Industries) dumped its waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``No association between low birthweight and exposures to
Raymark waste was found,'' the study reported. ``In addition, no
consistent association was found between mesothelioma, testicular
cancer and all cancer cases occurring to persons under the age of
25 in Stratford and Raymark's waste exposures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bladder cancer rates and so-called early onset cancer, or cancer
in young people, were slightly higher, the report found, around
some Raymark sites, although the latter was found not to be
statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said Tuesday it doesn't matter that the scientific
evidence doesn't support his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Connecticut official who claims the study doesn't show a
health threat is an idiot masquerading as an expert,'' he said.
``Epidemiology is the crudest science of the sciences. It might
find a public health disaster, but nine times out of ten it misses
clusters of cancer. The larger point is that community exposed all
sorts of kids to proven poisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Raybestos made brake and clutch linings for cars at its Main
Street plant from 1919 until 1989, generating waste such as lead,
asbestos, PCBs and solvents that were dumped on public, residential
and commercial sites throughout the town _ a fact the study
supports.
</P>
<P>
   The plant itself is gone _ flattened, cleaned up, and
meticulously capped with asphalt pavement. There has been talk in
the town about soliciting a grocery store to move to the site. But
the Little League field remains off limits.
</P>
<P>
   The company left behind a $100 million national priority
Superfund site, a neighborhood filled with stories like those of
Kit Peters' parents _ who never sued the company _ and John
O'Connor, who is still suspicious enough to incorporate the story
into his Congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``John O'Connor grew up near a ballfield built on an asbestos
dump,'' begins O'Connor's television ads which began airing
Tuesday. ``The dump caused one of his friends to die. Of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents, Aldana and Peter J. Peters, still live around
the corner from Raybestos Field. Aldana Peters says there was never
much of a controversy about the dumping in the neighborhood. And
she thought better in 1974 of writing a letter to the local paper
to suggest a link between her son's death and environmental
factors. She said she was worried that property values would
diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Aldana Peters says she doesn't really remember John
O'Connor but recalls his family. She had not heard he was running
for Congress until his campaign called before the TV ads began
airing in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wondered what happened to them,'' she said.

AMERICA ONLINE TARGETS GERMAN SITE USING `AOL' TRADEMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM SOMACH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An Internet casino that called itself AOL Casino
but had no connection to America Online Inc. has pulled the plug on
itself after being slapped with a cease-and-desist order.
</P>
<P>
   The casino, at www.aol-casino.com and run from a computer in
Germany, went on line about a month ago in hopes of nabbing a share
of the lucrative Internet gambling market. Gamblers around the
world were able to open betting accounts at AOL Casino with a
credit card and then play blackjack, craps, roulette and other
casino games on line.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the nation's No. 1 Internet service provider,
did not operate, sponsor, endorse or approve the AOL Casino,
America Online spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's legal department sent the AOL Casino a
cease-and-desist order June 16, telling the cyber-casino to stop
using the AOL name, Primrose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has spent lots of time, energy and money to
build the AOL brand name and we will not allow the name AOL to be
linked to something that we are not affiliated with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the gambling site stopped operating, visitors to the World
Wide Web site now see another Internet casino _ the Circus Casino,
at which gambling is ``for fun without real money.''
</P>
<P>
   Circus Casino, also located at www.circus-casino.com, also is
based in Germany and is run by the same people who ran the AOL
Casino, according to Internet domain registration records.
</P>
<P>
   The real Circus Circus casino chain, which runs several real
casinos in Nevada, recently filed suit for trademark violation
against Circus Casino, but Circus Casino continues to operate on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach anyone connected with AOL Casino for comment
were unsuccessful. A reporter's questions e-mailed to the AOL
Casino a week ago went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America Online is not satisfied with the demise of
AOL Casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``The domain aol-casino.com is still in use, as a link to
another casino, and that's no good,'' Primrose said. ``The whole
intention there is still to use the AOL trademark to drive traffic
to their site, so they have not fully complied with the terms of
the cease-and-desist order.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a cyber-gambling industry watchdog said America
Online's actions against the cyber-casino are just the beginning of
a new trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of casinos on the Internet that are illegally
using the names of established companies like AOL or Circus Circus
or Caesars Palace,'' said Lewis Gruppo, operator of Gamblersworld
(www.gamblersworld.com), a Web site that monitors the on-line
gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``With almost 200 casinos on line nowadays, it's the quickest
way for a new on-line casino to get name recognition,'' Gruppo
said. ``And if you name yourself after something as well-known on
the Internet as AOL _ that's instant name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the established companies whose names have been stolen by
on-line casinos are now starting to fight back,'' he said.
``America Online is the first company to get rid of a cyber-casino
that stole its name, and Circus Circus is trying. Other companies
will follow.''

WORLD CUP WORSHIP A LONELY SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does a red-blooded American man get some time alone in Bill
Clinton's America? Here are the magic words: ``I'm going to watch
the World Cup. Anyone care to join me?''
</P>
<P>
   In a real country, like Great Britain, 95 percent of adult males
surveyed said they'd rather watch a World Cup game than have sex
with the woman of their dreams. In Germany, on the day the Fourth
Reich launched its 2-0 blitzkrieg of Team USA, employers expected _
and got _ zero attendance during the match time.
</P>
<P>
   But here? Don't get me started. The day of Germany-USA, I
waltzed around the Great Metropolitan Newspaper hunting for cronies
to savor the action with me. In the Living Arts section where I
work, the ``men'' were all waxing their ballet slippers, or
``appreciating'' Masterpiece Theatre preview tapes. I wandered over
to the GMN's legendary Sports section, and (itals)the television
sets weren't even turned on!(unitals) What kind of country is
this!?
</P>
<P>
   Men, women, children _ I'm telling you ... don't miss out.
Forget Michael, forget Pedro, forget the stupid U.S. Open, and
stupider Wimbledon. Those events are like streetcars; they'll come
back. The World Cup is unquestionably the greatest sports show on
earth, featuring the greatest athletes in the world. Even if they
do smoke in the locker room at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   How do I love World Cup? Let me count the ways. The ABC/ESPN
television broadcasts are sensational. You get to see two 45-minute
periods of commercial-free sports action, unadulterated by silly
``up close and personal'' profiles of athletes. In this galaxy, Bob
(Bootlicker) Costas is far, far away. The Cup commentators
helpfully explain the niceties of the game, and, more refreshingly,
they often shut up.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe in ethnic identities, World Cup soccer
reveals what a fool you are. The stolid Bulgarians; the quicksilver
Brazilians; the _ yes _ ruthlessly efficient Germans; the striving,
earnest, Americans whose star playmaker got kidney-kicked 30
seconds into the US-Germany game. The pain didn't last long; for
all intents and purposes, a perfectly executed German head goal
ended the match eight minutes later. Wilkommen to the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   This much said, national identity has proven to be a very
fungible commodity in World Cup '98. The American captain was a
German citizen until 1992. But that's nothing; defender David Regis
was a Frenchman until 25 days ago. Iran's coach lives in San
Francisco. Nigeria's coach, Bora Milutinovic (funny, doesn't sound
Nigerian) is in his fourth consecutive Cup, for his fourth
consecutive team. His previous employers were the United States,
Costa Rica, and Mexico. To paraphrase the great Tom Lehrer, Cup
allegiances are ruled by expediencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most blessedly, for all the kicking and shoving, head-bashing
and referee-baiting, the World Cup is not about the world, but
about sports. Only a moron, or Bill Clinton, cared about the
political implications of the US-Iran game. There were none. But
the soccer implications were huge, and it made for great viewing.
Both Nigeria and Colombia have changed governments since the World
Cup began. Who cares? If the teams come home winners, the
politicians can fool around to their hearts' content.
</P>
<P>
   And the game? I think the game is terrific. Sure, there's not as
much scoring as, say, when Tim Wakefield is on the mound for the
Sox. (Unforgettable Sunday Globe Page One headline: ``The
Netherlands ties Belgium, 0-0, in an intense, defensive soccer
struggle'') But the first 45 minutes of Colombia-Tunisia was one of
the most gripping athletic tilts I've ever watched. That same day,
Monday, the lead of the England-Romania match changed twice in the
last 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Can World Cup soccer usher in a new age of peace and universal
understanding? Possibly not. But if Norway can repeat last year's
sensational upset victory over Brazil, that will be conclusive
proof of the existence of God. At least for the Norwegians.
</P>

STONYFIELD HAS THAT TANG OF SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ Gary Hirshberg has been warming up for a
couple of hours, telling stories about the early days of Stonyfield
Farm. Then he gets to the cows. ``We used to have cows,'' he begins
slowly, stifling a laugh. The cows were in the barn on the
18th-century property in Wilton, where the original Stonyfield
plant was located _ ``held together with bailing twine,'' he says.
His family lived in the adjacent farmhouse. Hirshberg, Stonyfield
founder Samuel Kaymen, and Kaymen's wife, Louise, took turns
hooking up 21 Jerseys and some Brown Swiss to electrical milkers.
The problem was, the farm, in a glorious spot on the top of a hill,
lost its electricity whenever a storm even considered rounding the
bend from Vermont and blowing east.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon a storm hit, Hirshberg continues, ``and of course
we lost power.'' The cows, desperate to be milked, ``were braying
and kicking.'' Louise Kaymen ran into the farmhouse for help. ``At
3:30 a.m., we finished the last cow,'' says Hirshberg who, with
both Kaymens, milked the cows by hand. He lets out a long sigh.
``Then it was time to start again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the day we realized the cows had to go.''
Finally, Gary Hirshberg starts laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this was how decisions were made at Stonyfield Farm.
Since its beginnings 15 years ago as a seat-of-the-pants dairy run
by two counterculture entrepreneurs, Stonyfield Farm Yogurt has
grown to a $43 million enterprise. Hirshberg, 43, is now chief
executive and Kaymen, 62, is now the semi-retired chairman
(``agreeably,'' he says).
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the milking incident, the two men raised cows,
made yogurt from the milk, drove it into Boston, stocked
supermarket shelves, and chatted up shoppers. Faintly interested
consumers found a free carton of yogurt in their shopping carts and
the partners kept their fingers crossed that word of its goodness
would spread.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company sees an annual growth of 35 percent;
projected sales this year are expected to reach $50 million from
refrigerated cup yogurt, frozen yogurt (hard-pack and soft), and
ice cream. About 30 percent of Stonyfield's products are certified
organic, for which customers willingly pay a premium. ``They're the
market leaders,'' says Tim Sperry, Bread &AMP; Circus's regional
grocery buyer. ``They're deeply committed to the New England dairy
industry and they've always kept a good sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Grit, determination, and pluck kept the young company from going
under at least half a dozen times in the early years. Now
Stonyfield understands how to position itself in the marketplace to
keep its spot as the leading seller in New England and New York of
plain nonfat yogurt. ``Our little secret weapon is the plain
quarts,'' says Hirshberg. ``We're the purist's yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times a day, milk from local, family-run dairy farms is
piped into a modest plant here. A $10 million renovation is
scheduled for completion in the fall. Stonyfield has just released
nine new yogurts _ many whole milk _ in what Hirshberg calls
``adult flavors.'' He maintains that enough of the population has
decided that the fear-of-fat craze is over, and he's celebrating
with ``strawberries and cream,'' ``blueberries and cream,''
``vanilla truffle,'' and ``creamy maple,'' all organic and boasting
cream on top.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has been injecting five live cultures into
its yogurts, just added a sixth. Lactobacillus reuteri, developed
in Sweden, is said to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria such
as salmonella and E. coli. ``Medicine didn't recognize nutrition,''
says Hirshberg. ``Now, suddenly, there's an epidemic interest in
vitamins, homeopathy, and cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that microorganisms can effectively boost the immune
system, which is why his yogurt now contains L. casei, S.
thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and bifidus. When
medicine comes around to the health benefits of these cultures,
says Hirshberg, his company will be waiting. ``When they start
turning, we want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the industry leaders, Stonyfield Farm has never
advertised and pays no slotting fees _ money most companies pay
upfront to guarantee prime supermarket shelf space. They give out
millions of free yogurts at nonprofit events such as Earth Day, the
Walk for Hunger, and Share our Strength. ``We want to be the
corporate model for social and environmental responsibility,'' says
Kaymen.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg calls their system of giveaways ``in-your-face
marketing.'' Four years ago, when Snackwell's lowfat yogurt was
launched, they got worried. They took 100 cases of yogurt ``to
every tall building in Boston,'' he says. ``It was so successful,
we took it to New York, then to Hartford. We stood on street
corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Stonyfield yogurt arrived in the market through the back door.
Hirshberg's grandfather A. Murray Ginzberg was a Boston banker who
lived next door to Sidney Rabb, then chairman of the board of Stop
&AMP; Shop. The partners went to Rabb, who seemed disinterested. He
sent them to Bill Gaetani, then a Stop &AMP; Shop dairy manager, now
director of deli sales. Gaetani said, ``I'll give you five stores
and six months. If you sell, I'll give you 12.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once told me I can sell ice to Eskimos,'' says
Hirshberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the Stop &AMP; Shop on Memorial Drive (Cambridge), set
up a table and samples.'' Hirshberg, who talks fast, laughs a lot,
and enjoys his own stories, talked to customers for hours. He and
Kaymen must have had something of a comedy routine going. ``People
called us Ike and Mike,'' says Hirshberg. After six months, the
partners produced, and Gaetani came through with more stores.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers tasted it, says Kaymen, ``the yogurt sold
itself.''

   As it caught on, Hirshberg kept pushing Bread &AMP; Circus to carry
his product. ``We'd been trying to get in for a year.'' Bread &AMP;
Circus buyers told the entrepreneurs that they didn't need another
natural yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg mounted a small campaign. On his 30th birthday, when
friends asked him what sort of gift he wanted, he told everyone the
same thing: ``Go to Bread &AMP; Circus and ask for my yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yogurt is not simply milk that curdles. In order for it to turn
into yogurt, it has to ferment with acid-producing bacteria. Sheep,
goats, and cows have been milked for thousands of years, writes
Harold McGee in ``On Food and Cooking, the Science and Lore of the
Kitchen'' (Collier Books), and the first yogurts were probably
developed after the beginning of dairying.
</P>
<P>
   That milk would have fermented naturally with wild, airborne
bacteria. The recipe has changed little from ancient times.
Stonyfield pasteurizes milk at its plant, cools it, inoculates it
with the cultures, then cools it again.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who are lactose intolerant can often eat yogurt
because ``cultured foods are practically free of lactose,'' writes
McGee. ``The fermenting bacteria use it as fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogurt making began in the United States in 1929 when the
Colombosian family, Armenians who lived in Andover, started Colombo
and Sons Creamery. General Mills purchased the company in 1993 and
incorporated the yogurt division as Yoplait Colombo, based in
Methuen. In 1919, near Barcelona, Isaac Carasso came out with
Danone (named for his son Daniel); he brought it to the United
States as Dannon in 1941. Now called the Danone Group, the company
has captured a 15 percent share of the fresh dairy market
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Stonyfield never intended to get this far. Samuel Kaymen began
making yogurt to keep another project funded. In 1978, he was
running the Rural Education Center in Wilton ``to teach organic
agriculture and care of the earth,'' he says. ``I started making
yogurt because the funding for the school dried up. We had been
making small amounts for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg, says Kaymen, ``was the businessman who came to rescue
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England and New York, Stonyfield is giving both Dannon
and Colombo a run for their money, selling fourth overall in both
markets, and selling first in large, plain quarts, and distributing
to every state in the country. (In New England, Dannon, Yoplait,
and Colombo lead the overall market, in that order.)
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Stonyfield's success is its insistence on the
quality of the primary ingredient: milk. The company buys milk
mainly from family-run dairies that produce either organic or
regular milk without bovine growth hormones (labeled rBGH or rBST),
genetically engineered hormones that increase milk production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary opposition to rBGH arises from an economic
concern: We believe that the widespread use of rBGH will have a
devastating impact on the economic well-being of family farmers,''
writes the company in a position pamphlet. ``One of the founding
objectives of Stonyfield Farm is to support family farmers in all
of our endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   If at any point, customers want to know what Stonyfield is
thinking about, they need only check the carton lids, which are
full of chat about the planet, ecological practices, hunger, and
social change. Ten percent of earnings go to environmental
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   One lid, on stopping handgun violence, almost cost Stonyfield
some supermarket accounts. Dairy buyers told Hirshberg not to
peddle his politics on his products. Hirshberg, who was part of the
committee that erected the Massachusetts Turnpike billboards of
children killed by handguns, kept telling the buyers that all
supermarket shelves are already filled with political messages.
</P>
<P>
   A Stonyfield employee asked to see him. Hirshberg knew perfectly
well that some employees are members of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to thank me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Stonyfield, Hirshberg had been director of the New
Alchemy Institute in Woods Hole, an ecological research group,
after graduating from Hampshire College (during its early years).
He was raised in Manchester, N.H., the son of a shoe manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stonyfield is something of a family affair. Hirshberg's
wife, Meg, who studied integrated pest management at Cornell
University, wrote ``The Stonyfield Farm Cookbook.'' They have
``three little yogurt eaters,'' as Gary Hirshberg calls his kids,
who are 10, 8, and 5 years old. Meg's mother, Doris Cadoux, ``was
our biggest investor,'' says her son-in-law. As director of natural
resources, Nancy Hirshberg, Gary's sister, tracks down fruit and
flavorings. She's the one who finds organic lemons, for instance,
which are squeezed into the new ``low-fat organic luscious lemon.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its sense of calm and organization, there were many
years when things at Stonyfield were chaotic. Beginning with the
stock market crash of 1987, Hirshberg and Kaymen started losing
money quickly. They went around looking for investors. ``Anyone in
a necktie was fair game,'' says Hirshberg. By 1990, the partners
each owned a very low percentage of the company. ``Every Thursday
morning I woke up at 8 a.m.,'' says Hirshberg, ``and I didn't know
where the payroll was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   They never lost sight of the product or their customer base (the
typical buyer is 25 to 54 years old, takes active vacations, is
college-educated with two kids, one or two careers in the family,
$60,000 or more in income, and an interest in the environment).
</P>
<P>
   And today, having bought back a large share of the company,
Hirshberg loves to tell stories about near-misses in the
unpredictable world of business.
</P>
<P>
   Did you hear the one about the rabbi? Early on, the two Jewish
entrepreneurs wanted kosher certification, so they contacted the
appropriate Orthodox rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi who came to see them got lost in New Hampshire for 1
1/2 hours. By the time he arrived, says Hirshberg, he was frazzled
and also surprised to find an 18-room Federal farmhouse with a barn
holding the yogurt works. ``He yelled in his best Brooklyn accent:
`Hirshberg and Kaymen! Two Jews in the wilderness! You pass
certification.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, he began his official inspection. And they did
pass.

LYCOS SHARE RUN-UP BECOMING A MATTER OF FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Lycos Inc. really worth it?
</P>
<P>
   The ``it'' is the astounding value the stock market has placed
on the small internet company. Lycos shares were worth nearly $1.3
billion after they advanced another 4 1/4 to 68 3/4 Tuesday. The
stock has been on a tear to get there: up 66 percent this year and
a staggering 504 percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is among the small group of companies whose sites were
once classified as search engines but have since been acknowledged
as potential ``portals,'' the handful of places where millions of
people will routinely start when they want to get onto the Web.
Flashing ads and hooking customers along those Internet bottlenecks
are presumed to be huge business in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock got a big bump last year when it became one of the
few Internet firms in its class to actually turn a profit, tiny as
it was. The latest fuel added to the fire: Walt Disney Co.'s
purchase of a 43 percent stake in Infoseek Co., a Lycos competitor,
last week. A week earlier, General Electric Co.'s NBC television
network had purchased a majority stake in CNET's smaller Snap
Internet-search directory site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investments by both NBC and Disney have forced traditional
media players to really sit up and take notice of just what their
Internet strategy is going forward,'' said analyst Paul Noglows of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has commented publicly in recent months that it would be
interested in finding a partner in the traditional media world. The
rumor of the moment matches Lycos up with Time Warner Inc., which
has offered content on the Internet with only modest success
through its Pathfinder site and several others sites operated by
its Cable News Network subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The details of such partnerships, which companies suit each
other, and on what kind of ownership terms, may be unclear. But the
deals are sure to be made, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every media company has talked to every portal,'' said
Chris Charron, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass. ``The combinations make an awful lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't automatically justify today's stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., isn't alone as an Internet
company with a gigantic stock market valuation. Yahoo stock is
worth $6.8 billion, and the most valuable of them all, America
Online Inc., is worth $23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, which earned 10 cents per share in its last quarter,
gained 8 1/2 to 1481/16 Tuesday. AOL, which spurned recent
overtures from AT&AMP;T Corp., trades at more than 200 times projected
earnings for the year ahead. It closed Tuesday at 106 1/4, up 5
1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which raised $100 million in a stock offering earlier
this month, is expected by analysts to lose money in the current
quarter and resume earning a modest profit in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals struck this month between Internet firms and media
conglomerates may make business sense, but they shouldn't lead
investors to expect any windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement between NBC and Snap is small potatoes by the
television network's standard: It purchased a controlling interest
in the unit for $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's deal with Infoseek is much harder to value. Disney put
up only $70 million in cash, but threw in its Starwave unit.
Depending on who is guessing at the value of Starwave, which builds
and manages Internet sites, the Disney-Infoseek transaction is
worth $500 million to $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were disappointed. Infoseek stock has actually drooped
since the news last week, falling from 35 to 307/16 Tuesday. But
most of the Internet companies without partners have been hot
stocks this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see the Disney and NBC deals as low-cost hedges on
the Internet by companies that want their share of the Web but
don't know how the business will unfold and are unwilling to
overpay anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Internet investors may indeed look back and see these as the
good old days when companies were young and their stocks cheap. But
paying up today for the stock remains an exercise in faith.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; There's more action in the ranks of United Asset Management Corp.,
the money management conglomerate that has been under pressure to
turn around lackluster results.
</P>
<P>
   UAM said Tuesday that Charles Salisbury, the company's top
marketing executive, would resign next month to spend more time
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Provident Investment Counsel, UAM's second-largest affiliate,
said founder Robert Kommerstad would give up his title of chief
executive and let two younger managers run the 47-year-old Boston
firm.

   One by one, the icons of American book publishing have been
scooped up, often by foreign media conglomerates. Just in the last
few months, Random House and major parts of Simon &AMP; Schuster were
bought &UR;  &LR; by European owners.
</P>
<P>
   But Houghton Mifflin Co., the venerable 166-year-old publisher,
remains aloof from the pack. Bolstered by a strong textbook
business and a small but revitalized trade book division, North
America's last major independent publisher has posted &UR;  &LR; a solid,
though hardly &UR;  &LR; dazzling, track record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a fresh wave of mergers sweeping US publishing, can
Houghton Mifflin stay independent?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for sale,'' declares Nader F. Darehshori, &UR;  &LR; 60,
Houghton Mifflin's chairman and chief executive, who got his start
peddling textbooks to colleges in the Midwest.

   The best defense against a takeover, of course, is
rising &UR;  &LR; earnings and a high stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders do not object to independence as long as profits
are strong,'' says Robert L. Friedman, a senior vice president at
Franklin Mutual Advisors Inc., Houghton Mifflin's largest
shareholder with a 13 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and its president, Michael Price, support management in
its bid to remain independent _ as long as earnings increase. ``We
are certainly comfortable that there's a lot of value in the
company right now,'' says Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Price is known for making trouble when executives of companies
whose shares he owns don't produce results. He recently helped oust
Sunbeam Corp.'s chairman, ``Chain Saw Al'' Albert J. Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sure bet Dunlap's demise didn't go un-noticed in
the &UR;  &LR; Back Bay headquarters &UR;  &LR; of Houghton Mifflin, whose stock has
given investors reason to worry in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In January it fell 24 percent on news that the company's 1998
earnings would be lower than expected because it would have to
spend more to develop new textbooks &UR;  &LR; and inoculate its computers
againt the &UR;  &LR; year 2000 bug. &UR;  &LR; From an October high of 40 1/4, the
stock dipped to 26 3/4 in January. On Friday, it closed at &UR;  &LR; 32
15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, earnings have fluctuated in recent years while sales
have grown only modestly. The company earned $49.8 million last
year on sales of $797.3 million. CIBC Oppenheimer analyst Rudolf A.
Hokanson expects earnings of $37 million in 1998, reflecting the
increased development and computer expenses.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of $1 billion, some analysts &UR;  &LR; think
the stock is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   That could make Houghton Mifflin tempting takeover bait in a
world of increasing consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   In the $21 billion US book publishing market, media giants like
Britain's Pearson PLC &UR;  &LR; and Germany's Bertelsmann AG have bought
American publishers, including top-ranked Random House, formerly
part of the Newhouse empire. Domestic companies like Time Warner
Inc. and Harlequin remain major players, but many of the smaller
companies have been bought by larger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   So far the company that counts Curious George, the children's
book heroine Martha, and novels by Philip Roth in its stable has
managed to stay independent by doing things its own way. Unlike the
big nameplate publishers that have been taken over in recent years,
Houghton Mifflin relies heavily on the dependable but unglamorous
field of textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In its trade division _ which publishes fiction and nonfiction
titles _ it hunts for underappreciated and less expensive authors
and avoids paying huge advances for celebrities' books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has always sought to do things their own way,''
says J. Kendrick Noble, a Texas consultant for the publishing
industry. ``Houghton is run well.''
</P>
<P>
   Darehshori's vision for Houghton's continued independence
includes the ambitious goal of $1 billion in sales in 2000. Analyst
Hokanson rates Houghton's stock a ``hold,'' noting that
Darehshori's sales target ``could be overly optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin itself has participated actively in the
consolidation craze, gobbling up several smaller houses. Founded in
1832, the Boston publisher grew through acquisitions, including
most recently McDougal, Littell &AMP; Co., a textbook company, which it
bought in 1994, and D.C. Heath, Raytheon Co.'s textbook unit, which
it acquired the following year for $455 million.
</P>
<P>
   While textbooks and educational materials are the company's core
business, Houghton also revived its flagging trade and reference
division under the leadership of Wendy Strothman, who joined
Houghton Mifflin in 1996 &UR;  &LR; from local independent Beacon Press.
After a period of rapid turnover in management, Strothman succeeded
in stabilizing the division, which publishes literature,
nonfiction, children's books such as the popular Martha series, and
reference books. &UR;  &LR; Her mantra is ``quality,'' a dictum she follows
in searching for underappreciated authors and refusing to pay huge
book advances for trendy books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are publishing books we think people will be reading for
decades to come,'' Strothman says. ``We are being very selective in
what we publish and the public is responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say Strothman's approach is paying off. The
trade division's authors have won several major awards recently,
most notably the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, which went to
author Philip Roth for ``American Pastoral.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I think they've selected carefully and pushed hard,'' says
Andrew Wylie, Philip Roth's agent. ``We've submitted books to them
that they have not offered on.''
</P>
<P>
   And if anything, the company has stepped up its focus on
educational books, which accounted for 89 percent of sales last
year, up from 77 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houghton has been very careful over the last few years to
identify the school market as the market for them,'' says Charles
E. Hayward, former chief executive of Little, Brown publishing
house in Boston and now a &UR;  &LR; consultant. ``They've deemphasized their
trade division to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trade division's revenues have remained around $90
million for the last five years, and some observers, such as
Franklin's Friedman, suggest Houghton should shed its trade
division to concentrate on textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Houghton Mifflin remains a major player in educational books,
number seven, according to the most recent ranking by &UR;  &LR; the industry
newsletter Subtext. It &UR;  &LR; is especially strong in sales to
kindergarten through sixth grade _ unusual among the major
educational publishers, most of whom concentrate on more profitable
college sales.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Houghton Miff-lin's formula can
help continue its legacy of independence. ``There's no predicting''
whether Houghton will eventually be bought out by a media
conglomerate, says Helene Atwan, director of Beacon Press, Wendy
Strothman's former publishing house. ``Nobody thought that Random
House would be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Houghton Mifflin's fate may hinge on whether the
company can expand past its core strength in school reading. ``I
believe that the way the educational publishing market is evolving,
it's becoming more difficult for companies to remain niche-oriented
and that scale is demanded if one wants to achieve consistent
success,'' Hokanson says. ``Houghton is on that edge between having
enough scale and being a niche player.''

   Twenty-one years ago,  &UR; Linda Greis  &LR; was playing golf with the
guys at Harvard. Not necessarily because she wanted to _ Harvard
didn't have a women's team.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to last week. Greis was rubbing elbows with
professional golfers at the US Open in San Francisco, and  &UR; Arnold
Palmer  &LR; presented her with an Achievement Award from the College
Golf Foundation and Rolex at a dinner hosted by Palmer and  &UR; Jim
Nantz. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Greis, who grew up in Holden, Mass., recalls that when she
entered Harvard in 1977, ``it came on the heels of Title IX,
(enacted in 1975) so absent a women's team, I was welcomed onto the
men's team.'' She went on to earn three varsity letters before
graduating with a degree in economics in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Greis, 39, said that being a minority on the team didn't strike
her as especially unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done the same thing at Wachusett Regional High School,
so playing with guys was not anything different,'' she said. She
admits the caliber of play was different, though. ``It was at the
college level, and we played at The Country Club.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of her teammates treated her differently, Greis
acknowledged that competitors often did a double take. ``I'm sure a
couple of heads turned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since a women's team was not formed at Harvard until 12 years
after she entered, Greis was allowed to enter women's tournaments,
and in 1979 was named Massachusetts Women's Intercollegiate Golf
Champion. She also played on the Harvard women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Greis wanted to stay on the golf circuit, and
tourned nationally in pursuit of her LPGA card. She even attended
the LPGA qualifying school three times, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally hung up my spikes and decided to put my economics
degree to use,'' Greis said.
</P>
<P>
   She currently works for Cambridge Associates, advising nonprofit
institutions in investment issues, and was previously a senior
executive vice president at the Peoples Bancorp of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   On the volunteer side, Greis has been a director of the YWCA of
Central Massachusetts and is a former director of the Harvard
Alumni Association. And she still supports the Harvard teams by
``writing checks, and showing up to cheer them on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the award ceremony last week in San Francisco, Greis was
honored along with former vice president  &UR; Dan Quayle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was
captain of the golf team and top player his senior year at DePauw
University.
</P>
<P>
   Each received a Rolex watch, and their alma mater's golf
programs each received a $2,500 donation. Greis noted that both the
men's and women's golf teams at Harvard will benefit from the
award.

   The 80 women who spent the weekend climbing the White Mountains
to benefit the Elizabeth Stone House are no doubt soaking their
feet now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beth Shapiro &LR; , founder of the four-year-old Wilderness Heals
hike, declared it a success, and said that the Stone House in
Jamaica Plain should reach its goal of $130,000. The Stone House
offers services for women ranging from protection from domestic
violence to skill training to get women back in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   She reported that the ropes given each team for emergency stream
crossings weren't necessary, but rain ponchos were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you I've never seen lightning from up close before
_ it's amazing,'' Shapiro said.

COACH SELECTION CRUCIAL FOR US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Before France '98, the last coach to bring the US
national team to The City of Light for a major international soccer
tournament was George M. Collins in 1924. Collins guided the US to
a 1-0 victory over Estonia, then a 3-0 loss to Uruguay in the Paris
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was a competent businessman and coach; he had a .500
record with the national team. Collins was also an accomplished
writer _ he moonlighted as the Globe's soccer editor, sometimes
using the byline ``George Matthews'' (his middle name) to avoid
detection by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson brought the US to Paris last week, with results
that were less satisfactory. His team is 0-2 in the World Cup,
losing to Germany, 2-0, and to Iran, 2-1. The Americans have one
game left, against Yugoslavia Thursday, but have already been
eliminated in the first round. Sampson will soon be gone, and this
is not to suggest his replacement come from the ranks of the media.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever takes over for Sampson must move the team in a
different direction. Sampson began this process when he became the
first US-born coach to openly acknowledge the Hispanic community,
as his predecessor, Bora Milutinovic, had. Sampson was greatly
influenced by Milutinovic and attempted to meld Milutinovic's
pragmatism with a sort of American concept of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was fortunate to get this chance. He was to be a
caretaker when he guided the team for the first time against
Nigeria at Foxboro Stadium three years ago. The US, sparked by a
long-range John Harkes goal, rallied to defeat Nigeria, 3-2, on
June 11, 1995, and continued to achieve surprising results under
Sampson, including an upset of Argentina in the Copa America in
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampson should have been replaced many months ago, mostly to
save him from the World Cup failure. He wasn't, though, because a
qualified, available alternative couldn't be found.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a chance to do so. There are few proven coaches in
the US. The closest the country has come to producing a successful
professional coach is Bruce Arena, who guided D.C. United to two
Major League Soccer titles. Though Arena is a product of the
system, he has proven to be the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Arena is probably the best candidate, but he might be wise to
remain with D.C. United until 2002 World Cup qualifying begins.
</P>
<P>
   If the US Soccer Federation goes international, it would be wise
to take a lesson from Jamaica, which had excellent luck with Rene
Simoes, a Brazilian. Simoes found eight English players of Jamaican
descent to bolster a team that he described as being as skilled as
``trained seals'' when he arrived. The Jamaicans were athletic,
purposeful, strong, but they lacked discipline and tactical
awareness. Simoes grasped the Jamaicans' strengths and augmented
them with organization and enlightened training methods.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotypical US player has different characteristics than
the Jamaican. Perseverance, physical strength, yes. Ball skills,
no. The next US coach must advocate technique above everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, what US players should be doing is juggling the ball
like seals every chance they get. At least they should be allowed
and encouraged to have fun with the game. This cannot be
accomplished in coaching courses or through structured programs. It
should occur spontaneously, if youngsters are allowed the freedom
to make up their own games and routines.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one US coach can make a policy change. He must
balance the responsibility of attaining results with improving the
standard of play. Sampson constantly confronted this issue in the
proper spirit, but it is going to be a conundrum for whoever is
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign coaches have been hired in the past by the USSF, which
went after the best of the best in the '70s. Dettmar Cramer of
Germany took over the national team, and Rinus Michels of Holland
was hired as an adviser. Cramer was simply overqualified for the
position, as might have been Carlos Alberto Parreira after he won
the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   There are coaches for situations. Milutinovic is a rare
chameleon, one who could teach US players defensive tactics, then
allow Nigerians to gamble with an all-out attacking style. Such a
coach is rare. But they exist, and they could be interested in the
potential of the US.
</P>
<P>
   The US attracts the best healers and scientists, the most
ambitious financiers, the most talented directors and actors, often
seeking opportunities that are unavailable elsewhere. Certainly,
the US has qualified soccer coaches who are in the country for
similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian coach, Jalal Talebi, is an example. Talebi has
resided in Palo Alto, Calif., for 14 years, but he was unnoticed in
his adopted country until he guided the Iranians to victory over
the US. Alkis Panagoulias had a similar international background
when he came to the US from Greece in the '60s. Panagoulias brought
Tab Ramos and others to the national team in the '80s. The next US
coach must find another Tab Ramos or two.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first acts of Alan Rothenberg's USSF presidency was to
hire longtime Fort Lauderdale, Fla., resident Nene Cubillas as a
regional coach. Cubillas, among the all-time leading World Cup
scorers, worked for a week and was never called back. Rothenberg's
good intention was apparently sabotaged by institutionalized
inertia and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The mishandling of Cubillas sent a message. An influential
faction of the USSF would exclude even the most credible of
``outsiders,'' whether they be Cubillas or Talebi. This must
change.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many USSF officials who appear to be amateurs or
glorified volunteers. National team players are coddled, not placed
in a position to succeed. Because of the inexperienced nature of
the support system, they are not afforded the advantages available
from the hundreds of millions of dollars of Nike sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   The insular nature of the USSF activities, the exclusionary
policies of the coaching programs, is reflected in low standards
for the national team and for MLS.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson driven home in this World Cup is that soccer is not a
nice sport in the international arena. There are big-money deals,
great amounts of pride on the line. Cutthroat deals are made off
the field and hard lessons are administered on it. There can be
great joy and pleasure, but there are also real hardships and pain.
There is no place for amateurs and volunteers.

YUGOSLAVIANS KNOW THE CUP'S INS AND OUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-GALMIER, France _ Miljan Miljanic, the president of
Yugoslavia's soccer federation, is chuckling (``We can laugh about
it now'') as he talks about how it was during the sanctions, when
the rest of the world kicked his country out of their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am watching a match and the ball goes over the fence and all
22 players are chasing it,'' he says. ``Because they have only one
ball. If they lose it, they have no game.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball must not stop. That was the Yugoslavs' byword after the
United Nations made them stay home for 2 1/2 years as part of the
punishment for Serbia's ``ethnic cleansing'' policies. Between June
1992 and December 1994, neither the country's national team nor its
clubs were allowed to compete internationally.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs were expelled from the European championships days
before the event. They were kept out of the 1994 World Cup and
readmitted too late to qualify for the 1996 Olympics and European
championships. Their top players had to go abroad to make a living.
And the UN's harsh economic sanctions left the country's domestic
program on starvation rations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football for us became a fight for survival,'' says the
68-year-old Miljanic, who is considered the ``Grandpa'' of Yugoslav
soccer. ``If anything, the sanctions brought us together and made
us stronger. We would not be defeated. And now, we are here. This
alone is a victory for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years on the sidelines, the Yugoslavs are back in
the game, with literally half the world watching. And if they can
beat or tie the Americans tomorrow night in Nantes, they'll advance
to the second round of the World Cup. The ball must not stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs want to stick around this quadrennial festival of
feet as long as they can because they know that their admission
ticket could be revoked again. They know that their government is
under fire from the international community for its armed crackdown
in Kosovo. They know the UN is rattling the saber, threatening
intervention. They know sanctions could be imposed anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to go back to a bad marriage,'' says Miljanic,
wincing.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yugoslavs are determined to make the most of their time
upon the stage, because they have learned how abruptly they can be
given the hook. They were already in Sweden for the 1992 European
tournament when the sanctions were imposed; they were sent home and
had to watch Denmark, their replacement, win the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock of having to go back was unbearable,'' says
Miljanic. ``I never dreamed that could happen. I was so much of a
romantic that I couldn't believe there would be sanctions for
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock turned to bitterness, and then resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctions were imposed on Monday,'' Miljanic says. ``On
Tuesday, we decide how we are going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the game had to continue. So the domestic league,
based around old Belgrade rivals Red Star and Partizan, kept going
even though many top stars joined foreign clubs to keep their
skills at a world-class level. The federation created intramural
``national'' teams and dreamed up competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people laughed,'' says Miljanic, ``but we had to keep
the interest.''
</P>
<P>
   And emphasis was increased on development at the youth level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even children as young as 10,'' Miljanic says. ``Because we
didn't know how long the sanctions would be. We thought they might
be even longer than they were. We needed to make sure we would have
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball must not stop, even if there was little more than the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planes were grounded, the trains weren't working, the
buses had no petrol,'' says Miljanic. ``We had no equipment, no
soccer balls. But every match was played. How did we survive? I
don't know. We did it with creative simplicity and learning how to
be poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federation remained in daily contact with its
stars who were playing in Italy, in Spain, in England, even in
Japan. Eventually, the sanctions would be lifted and the Mijatovics
and Stojkovics and Savicevics would have to pull on the
red-white-and-blue jersey again and put Yugoslavia back on the
global map.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the ban ended, the Yugoslavs felt the aftershock.
Because they hadn't played any international matches, their world
ranking tumbled to 196th and doomed them to a brutal Cup qualifying
group with Spain, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. When the
Yugoslavs needed to beat Hungary in a special playoff to get their
ticket here, their years of bottled-up anger and frustration and
impatience found vent in astounding 7-1 and 5-0 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went to Marseille for last December's draw and found
the football gods had played a perverse prank on them. Besides the
Germans, the three-time world champions whom they hadn't beaten in
25 years, the Yugoslavs drew a pair of political enemies in the US
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The politics they have learned to take with a shrug. If you live
in the Balkans, politics comes with mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many nations we have political differences with,''
says defender Zeljko Petrovic. ``This is just sport. The World Cup
is about football.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Yugoslavs, football was always their way of transcending
politics at home. Though the Serbs and Bosnians and Croats and
Slovenes and Macedonians and Montenegrins made for a volatile
country, they combined for a terrific soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times since World War II, Yugoslavia qualified for the
World Cup, reaching at least the quarterfinals four times. In 1990,
the last time the six republics competed as one, the Yugoslavs came
within a penalty kick of knocking off defending champion Argentina
and making the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Yugoslavia, football is the amazing social phenomenon,''
says Miljanic. ``Only in football was there no war between
republics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavia of 1990 is no more. This Yugoslavia has been
reduced to Serbia and Montenegro and branded an outlaw state. Its
team here has been asked as many questions about politics as
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have questions about politics,'' coach Slobodan Santrac
said this week, in exasperation, ``you can contact our embassy in
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics is what kept one of the world's most entertaining
soccer teams, ``the Brazilians of Europe,'' isolated and peering
through the stadium gate for eight years. Now the Yugoslavs are
back, as the French sporting daily L'Equipe says, ``like a phantom
coming out of the night''.
</P>
<P>
   Miljan Miljanic jokes about it now, but he still has the
1,000-page memorandum he wrote during the sanctions about how to
keep the ball rolling when nobody else will play with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is what I write at the top,'' he says. ``I HOPE NO OTHER
COUNTRY EVER HAS TO USE THIS.''(Eds.: CQ caps)

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Leslie Graves is learning what it's like to
hear her muscles cry, to look down at her hands and see raw patches
of pulp, to make a boat go a little farther and a little faster
when a cruise to Pluto seems more likely and markedly easier.
</P>
<P>
   Her three sisters? They already know. Alison Graves, 38, and Tia
Fischer, 39, rowed on their college teams, and Carie _ well, Carie
Graves, who turns 45 this week, is among the finest sweep oarswomen
in US history, making three Olympic rowing teams and winning a gold
medal in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But Leslie, 43, had long been living in a world of books that
stretched her mind, not her hamstrings; that made her smarter, not
stronger; that touched her soul but did not make it whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was some important part of life I had never
done,'' said Leslie. ``I didn't know what it was, because I had
never done it, but now I'm starting to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Daybreak's mist still hugged the Charles River as she and her
sisters ended a recent training session that will take them to the
Pacific Northwest later this summer: On Aug. 14, they will face at
least 18 other boats in the Women's B 4(plus) category of the Nike
World Masters Games rowing competition.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exciting adventure for all of them, a rare chance as
adults to indulge and revel in their sisterhood, but as they talk
their eyes keep returning to Leslie. In this endeavor, it seems,
she has become the Sister of Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how it feels: that surging at the end, the nervousness
at the starting line,'' said Alison. ``I keep thinking, if we were
to win this race, how it would be for Leslie.''
</P>
<P>
   For Carie, the women's crew coach at Northeastern University,
racing is a natural decision. For Alison, in public relations with
Hewlett-Packard, and Tia, a court commissioner in Los Angeles
County, it's a return to precious memories of hard-earned,
deeply-shared exhaustion. But for Leslie, studying at the
University of Wisconsin for her doctorate in the philosophy of
biology, it's uncharted territory that every day brings a new
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever in my life ever pushed myself to my limit on
anything,'' she said, another workout looming just seven hours
away. ``Relatively speaking, everything else I've ever done has
been a complete cakewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of them, the logistics of rowing together seemed as
daunting as the romance of it was enticing. But Alison remembers
her reaction when the long-distance phone lines started humming
last March as the sisters _ she and Tia in southern California,
Carie in Cambridge, Leslie in Spring Green, Wis. _ began toying
with the notion. ``My first question was, is Leslie going to do
this? If Leslie is going to do this, I have no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they commenced: Carie plotting workouts and lining up
boats, Alison trying to drum up sponsors, husbands entreatied for
their help and patience, everyone flipping their calendars to
figure out when and where they could get together on the water. Hal
Menendez, a Madison attorney who had coxed for the sisters'
brother, Ross, when he was a Badger rower, was quickly lined up as
coxswain. The chance to share a boat, he said, with the legendary
Carie was an intoxicating mix of intimidating and irresistible; any
worries about Leslie's ability to get up to speed were assuaged by
her bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Carie and Ross, father Robert was captain of the 1956
Wisconsin rowing team. ``Based on the rest of the family,'' said
Menendez, ``I knew if she said she would do it, she would be
serious about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting in shape on their own over the summer, it was
October before the sisters came together in Boston for five days of
a major learning experience. ``We have an Olympic gold medalist in
our boat, so you think, we're going to be really good,'' Alison
said. ``After we had our first workout together it became clear
that wouldn't make any difference. Rowing is the quintessential
team sport. We all have to try to be as good as she is instead of
letting her pull us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty bad,'' Carie said.
</P>
<P>
   They reunited in Newport Beach, Calif., over the holidays, where
almost everyone _ including the nine children, ages 19 months to 19
years they have among them _ got sick with stomach flu. But,
between bouts of retching and cleaning up after their kids, the
sisters kept rowing.
</P>
<P>
   In May they regrouped in Newport Beach for just 24 hours,
courtesy of Nike, to film a promotional video for the Games (``This
is like the road trip of all road trips,'' Tia said) before their
training blitz here earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   It was after those eight days of grinding, blistering two-a-day
sessions on the Charles that it all began to come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot further ahead of where I thought we'd ever be,''
said Carie earlier this week. ``We actually did three race pieces,
and they were pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Menendez agreed. ``I came off the water very confident this boat
has a chance to medal, if not win, and that's something people
would not have thought if they saw us eight months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time she signed on to this undertaking, just over a year
ago, Leslie was 35 pounds heavier and, by her own report, proud of
having drifted into fat middle age. Now, muscle has taken over from
fat and middle age suddenly doesn't seem so old _ ``Every time I
see her, she's a different woman,'' said Tia _ but the athletic
psyche is still proving a most worthy opponent. Coming late to the
cultural experience of being coached isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're accomplished in your field,'' said Menendez, ``and
suddenly somebody's telling you what to do and you can't talk
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is altering your self-image. ``You have talent,
Leslie,'' said Tia suddenly, speaking directly to her sister. ``You
underestimate yourself. You need to stop doing that. Now you need
to accept yourself as an athlete, not (as) a housewife with three
kids who's going out in a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to come into this feeling like she was the weak
link,'' said Menendez, ``and I hope she's starting to see herself
as just another link, because that's what she's become.''
</P>
<P>
   With race day just over six weeks away, the sisters look ahead.
On the morning of Aug. 14, at 11 a.m., after leaving their ``mom
worries'' on the shore from which their families will be cheering
and their proud father crying; after coast-to-coast visits in which
they shared Neosporin and ice packs as eagerly as sisterly gossip
and care packages of cookies from mom; after reenacting their
childhood of hard work together on the family farm in Wisconsin,
they will get in their boat.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie knows what she wants to happen next. ``I want to be able
to embrace and welcome what you have to do when you're body is in
extreme pain. That's been a real issue for me. I just want to be
able to not shut down in the face of the pressure. I want every
stroke in the race to be rowed with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to have the words `I can't do this' not be in my
head.''

CALIFORNIA BOOM TO CONTINUE INTO NEW CENTURY, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A closely watched economic report said
California's robust economy will continue beyond 2000 despite the
downtown in trade with Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has its downsides, according to the study,
including traffic congestion, increased pollution and soaring home
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But economists from the University of California at Los Angeles
said in the report that they prefer today's $4.4 billion state
budget surplus to the economic decline experienced only a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe there will be discontinuity
beyond 2000,'' said Tom Lieser, executive director of the UCLA
Anderson Forecast, a quarterly report from the Anderson Graduate
School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected California to continue to grow somewhat
faster than the nation ``over an extended period of time,'' in part
because of an infusion of well-educated workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, beyond 2000, Asia will again be an asset rather than
a liability,'' Lieser said of the only troubling statistics in his
findings _ the decline in exports to South Korea, Thailand, the
Philippines and several other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA study, released Wednesday, is even more optimistic than
that produced by the California Department of Finance, whose chief
economist, Ted Gibson, had been accused by some legislators of
being an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA projects that the growth in California's non-farm
employment, following last year's 3.3 percent increase, will be 3.4
percent in 1998 (compared to Gibson's 3.2 percent) and 2.5 percent
in both 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA predicts associated gains in income _ 7.5 percent in 1998
(compared to Gibson's projected 7.2 percent), 6.5 percent in 1999
and 6.4 percent in 2000. Last year, personal income grew 7.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job growth rates for the San Francisco Bay area remain
superlative, and have shown a tendency to be revised upwards in
annual benchmark reviews,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieser said that in May, the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the
Commerce Department, using 1996 figures, found that the San
Francisco metropolitan area had the highest per-capita income in
the nation: $39,746, a 28.4 percent increase over 1990. New Haven,
Conn., was second at $38,962; West Palm Beach, Fla., third at
$38,962; and San Jose fourth at $35,395.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA quarterly report contained the best news in years for
Los Angeles County, the state's most populous with a payroll of 3.8
million people. The county has spent the '90s in recession or
lagging behind its neighbors to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five months of the year, Los Angeles County had job
growth of 2.8 percent, still below the state average, ``but a lot
more supportive of what is going on elsewhere and it means the
county will not be a net charity case to the extent it has been,''
Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County led the economic parade in Southern California,
with 4.5 percent job growth from January through May, and the
five-county Greater Los Angeles region had a 3.4 percent job gain
and an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth rose by 2.4 percent in San Francisco in the first
five months, and 3.1 percent in Oakland. Statewide, job growth had
been 3.6 percent, a full percentage point higher than the national
rate, and unemployment in California is 5.5 percent, compared with
6.3 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   California accounted for about 15 percent of the national
increase in employment during the 12 months which ended in May.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in much of Asia have affected trade. California
exports to South Korean declined 42.4 percent in the first five
months, and were off 38.6 percent to Thailand, down 18.9 percent to
the Philippines and 12.3 percent to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But exports to Mexico rose 30.5 percent, representing a $750
million increase. There were other major gains in Western Europe
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough good news for now to offset the weakness in
major Asian nations,'' Lieser said.

   CHINA-ODDITIES _ BEIJING _ A typical Chinese urbanite bicycles
down a frenetic rush hour street -- small daughter tucked into a
backseat and packages filling the basket in front. Ignoring the
chaos, he chats into the cell phone clamped to his ear. The scene
is among the legion of arresting oddities that will punctuate the
trip through China of President Bill Clinton and his entourage.
Such culture clashes are no more unusual than those presented to
Chinese visiting America -- for example, when they hunt vainly
through hotel rooms for the terry cloth slippers and thermos of hot
water that are ever -present in Chinese hotels. For centuries,
visitors have been coming to China to absorb the brilliant colors,
pungent scents and tinkling sounds of a land that many in the West
expected to find ``backward.'' But even in the 13th Century Marco
Polo found China filled with marvels, much as travelers do today.
Cell phones, for example, seem to be more pervasive in Chinese
cities than in most any sophisticated American metropolis. People
in taxis, on bicycles, walking down the street, riding a bus,
sitting in restaurants or shopping in book stores, food stores or
shoe stores can be found engaged in intense conversations.

states, checking to see if CDC is involved yet, still trying access
to DHR command center. (McKenna, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   ECOLI-POOLS _ Is it safe to go in the water? Not just White
Water but any neighborhood or private pool? That's the question
parents want answered. The answer is yes, but we'll tell them why
with a review of pool regulations in Georgia, and reassurance that
chlorine kills most bacteria and other germs. Also asking CDC
whether the second known case of transmission of the deadly strain
of E. coli will lead to tighter regulations. And checking to see if
concerned parents are calling the E. coli hotline or their
pediatricians. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ECOLI-FAMILIES _ When a young Alabama boy came down with E. coli
0157:H7, before the Jack in the Box incident raised public
awareness, his mother sprang into action. She formed S.T.O.P., a
network of thousands of parents whose kids also survived the bug.
S.T.O.P's founder will be at the hospital today to meet with
Atlanta Braves shortstop Walt Weiss's child. (Guthrie, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ECOLI-KIDS _ A rundown of the condition of the kids, any changes
in conditions how many kids (if the number changes), their names if
we can get them; any comments from family members about how the
kids are doing. If no comments from family members, might could do
this as a bulleted update, with age, where hospitalized, status.
(Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ECOLI-DISEASE _ When a child gets HUS, how does the disease
typically progress? We'll talk to doctors about what treatment
involves, what can happen, from full recovery to mild damage to
kidneys or lungs and brain, to major damage, to death. (Lee,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

means; how it got its name. (Guthrie, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   ECOLI-RESEARCH _ Checking with Georgia Tech and UGA, which both
have ongoing research into ways to fight E. coli, and with other
researchers about what's in the works to detect or prevent this
deadly pathogen. Georgia Tech is working on a sensor for early
detection and UGA is working on a neutralizing agent. (Aldag,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-HEAT _ Three helicopters are parked at the airport ready
to be used to fight Texas wildfires should they break out. One of
the helicopters is like the one sent to Mexico to fight the fires
there. We take a look at these helicopters and whose manning them.
Also any additional heat-related news. (Thomas, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   OZONE _ The ``ozone action'' alert declared for Thursday, the
third one this week, highlights metro Atlanta's continuing air
pollution problem. And the problem could be even worse than we
think, because the state Environmental Protection Division issues
pollution forecasts based on an ozone standard now declared
out-of-date by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The
difference is stark: Under the new standard, based on levels
averaged over eight hours rather than one hour, metro Atlanta
actually had twice as many ``bad air'' days in May than the five
EPD reported. And if the new standard were applied here, EPD
officials say the region would register three times the average 11
violation days during the ozone season. (CAtlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   MELFISHER _ With the kind of optimism unique to a career
treasure hunter, Mel Fisher is predicting a golden summer. There's

version of Ma Bell, combining long distance and local service. Each
idea was tried, examined or pondered and found wanting. AT&AMP;T had
lost its soul irretrievably it seemed, mostly because its smartest
managers had been dispersed among the regionals and other
enterprises. Now, finally, it seems that AT&AMP;T has found the right
partner, a highly directed dreamer named John Malone, whose simple
idea is to pour the world of information into homes. With Malone's
ideas and dreams, and the wealth name brand of AT&AMP;T, it seems that
the new combination can set a pace for the huge telecommunications
industry. Clearly, the possibility has riveted the attention of all
the players. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ It's always fun, sort of like one
of those back-seat games for the road, to hear a Republican Party
gathering invoke a call for less government intervention and then
to count the ways party faithful want more. Recently Gov. George
Bush was doing the invoking at the state party convention and
sounding Reaganesque. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ It's always fun, sort of like one
of those back-seat games for the road, to hear a Republican Party
gathering invoke a call for less government intervention and then
to count the ways party faithful want more. Recently Gov. George
Bush was doing the invoking at the state party convention and
sounding Reaganesque. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

IN THIS PARK, THE VIEWS SPAN GENERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 28)  
 (JT)  
 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. _ In 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was newly
arrived in Seneca Falls, N.Y., and newly desperate. She had left an
intellectually rich and materially comfortable life in Boston for a
village in western New York Statethat was much smaller and
considerably less developed
</P>
<P>
   Her new home was isolated, and her husband, Henry _ a lawyer who
was an active abolitionist and a budding politican _ often was away
on business. Elizabeth, then 32, was left with her three young sons
and the servants _ ``poor'' servants, no less, she wrote later, and
frequently sick children, since the area was malarial, too.
</P>
<P>
   Her dissatisfaction bubbled out one summer day when she and four
friends _ Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jane Hunt and Martha Wright, who
lived in the area, and Lucretia Mott, who was visiting _ gathered
for tea in nearby Waterloo. Right then, the story goes, they
decided to hold the first known convention on women's rights. A
week later, they met again, and wrote the Declaration of
Sentiments, a list of grievances and remedies modeled on the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, just 10 days after their first meeting, they held
their convention. Despite receiving some publicity in local
newspapers, they were surprised when about 300 people attended,
including many men. One hundred of them signed the declaration,
which soon became a subject of news reports and editorials. Among
the attendees, and the signatories, was the abolitionist Frederick
Douglass, an early and fervent supporter of equal rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   That convention essentially launched the first wave of the
American women's movement, and it is the focal point of the Women's
Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, which is near the
north end of Cayuga Lake, between Syracuse and Rochester. The
national park, which I visited in early June, was dedicated in
1993, and next month it will host a series of events commemorating
the convention's 150th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention's 75th anniversary, the drive for an Equal
Rights Amendment began at Seneca Falls; this commemoration promises
no such milestone, but plenty of interest: This summer, park
officials expect up to 100,000 visitors, including many school and
tour groups, compared with the usual 35,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a park along the lines of Yellowstone: there are no
glorious natural wonders here. Rather, it is an ``idea park,''
which aims to educate, and to bring history alive. It consists of a
three-quarter-acre site with a monument built around the remnants
of the chapel where the convention was held and a visitors center,
as well as the former homes of several of the women who
participated. Its real strength is not in its physical structures,
but in its storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Any tour should start at the visitors center, with its floor of
exhibits on the convention, the period's history and the challenges
women have faced and, in some cases, have overcome. You may wince
at corsets drawn so tight they could crush internal organs, or
perhaps cheer at the dramatic increase in the number of female
athletes since Title IX was passed in 1972. There are also
interactive exhibits, of mixed quality, which try to draw visitors
into debates over the definition of sexual harassment, the
constitutionality of abortion and other similar topics.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits provide an adequate understanding of the events of
that time. But the truly interesting question, as the park's
rangers point out, is not ``What happened here?'' Rather, it is,
``Why here?''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the answer means exploring the town, the chapel area and
Stanton's house on guided tours with the rangers, who are clearly
in love with the history of this place. Their ardor is catching:
Whether or not you are particularly interested in women's history,
you are likely to find yourself drawn into the story of how this
small town became the site of feminism's first salvo.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca Falls sits in the lovely Finger Lakes region, full of
wineries and waterfalls and gorges, which means there is plenty to
do along with an historical tour. There are antique shops, hiking
trails and, just a few miles out of town, the Montezuma National
Wildlife Refuge, a marshy haven for birds (and a good many deer).
</P>
<P>
   The town itself is friendly, and sleepy. (There is speculation,
which Seneca Falls does nothing to discourage, that it was the
model for Bedford Falls in ``It's a Wonderful Life.'') Fall Street,
the main street, runs parallel to the Cayuga-Seneca Canal, and is
lined with small-town shops and restaurants, and museums. There is
the Seneca Falls Heritage Area (also called Urban Cultural Park),
which provides an excellent introduction to Seneca Falls' history,
and the National Women's Hall of Fame, a privately financed museum
that chronicles women's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Cayuga Street, a pretty, tree-lined road off Fall Street, still
has many of the Gothic Revival and Victorian mansions that the
town's wealthy industrialists occupied at the time of the
convention. It is also home to the Seneca Falls Historical Society,
a historic mansion whose features include Victorian rooms,
photographs of events and figures in the women's rights movement,
and an exhibit on the town's Italian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca Falls today has about as many people as it did in 1848 _
around 7,000 _ but none of the ferment. From the 1820s on, this was
a hub of the Industrial Revolution, with factories, tanneries and
mills producing everything from pump engines to knitted goods,
which were moved out by canal. A substantial portion of the town's
industrial heart was wiped out when the state decided to widen the
canal in 1915, creating Van Cleef Lake, which now spreads off
Cayuga Street.

<P>
   A steadicam follows Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone
through the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Hollywood, past the check-in
desk, past a frosted glass mural of Marilyn Monroe, through
faux-grand doors and outside, where the passing traffic hisses and
wheezes on Highland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep up a steady patter as they go, Fraser gesturing
wildly, like a silent-movie clown.
</P>
<P>
   They're shooting a comedy called ``The Blast from the Past,''
with Fraser playing Adam, a young man who'd been raised in an
elaborate underground bomb shelter since the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis by a paranoid scientist father, Christopher Walken, and
mother, Sissy Spacek _ ``June Allyson on Listerine,'' Fraser calls
her.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the 1990s, in spite of its hydroponic garden and fish
tank, the family is running out of supplies. Adam emerges to seek
batteries, toilet paper _ and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, not the psychopath one would expect after a
childhood like this, but a clean-cut, rather starchy fellow with
early-'60s values and impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   He develops an instant crush on tough cookie Silverstone, whom
he meets while trying to cash in a l950s Joe DiMaggio baseball
card.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, all sausage curls and trademark petulance, is
complaining to Adam about her lack of a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never works out, because I'm into butts and legs and hair
myself, so I always end up with some guy who's more shallow than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   No boyfriend? Adam goes into hormonally induced paroxysms of
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Cut. Do it again. And again. And again, as extras playing
Scandinavian tourists mingle with genuine British travelers,
bemused and jet-lagged as they stagger off a bus and wander into a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan was born to play this part,'' says writer-director
Hugh Wilson, a pleasant-faced man in chinos. ``It's all about
innocence, and Brendan exudes innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Fraser's furrowed brow always manages to give him
a rather sweet air of faint bewilderment, which he used to comic
advantage in ``George of the Jungle'' and which made him touchingly
vulnerable in ``School Ties,'' the l991 movie about teen-age
anti-Semitism that gave him his big-screen break.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 feet 3 inches, the 29-year-old Fraser is also a great
lunk of a guy. During a lull in filming, he's settled into a
nondescript armchair, his oversized feet planted firmly on the
carpet in a suite on the 22nd floor of the location hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Against a decorating nightmare of lurid flowered curtains and
fake floral arrangements that could have time-warped out of the
movie, Fraser is talking up a storm, hands flying in all directions
to punctuate his points.
</P>
<P>
   He's usually called shy, a description that makes him balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm thoughtful,'' he says. ``And I'm told I have
infrared vision. I like to understand people before I present
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he adds, he likes to save himself for his performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many comedians won't say boo to you, but put them in front
of a microphone and they blister the wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did to the screen in ``George of the Jungle,''
last summer's surprise hit with kids and critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million-plus box-office gross put the movie on Daily
Variety's Golden Reel list of top moneymakers for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hoo ha for the business end of the things,'' says Fraser,
whose price tag jumped from $1 million for ``George'' to several
million. He also gained a new audience of 7-year-olds, who laughed
at earnest George, and their mothers and baby-sitters, who gulped
at the sight of his well-toned muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe was about the size of a tea-towel,'' says Fraser,
who began a mad weight-lifting routine when he got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it never really seemed like enough,'' he says about his
physique, which he considered nothing more than part of his George
costume. ``I'm glad they took a picture of it, because it sure
doesn't stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser has gotten used to things not staying the same for long.
His father traveled the world promoting Canadian tourism, and the
family went along. The youngest of four brothers, Fraser lived in
Britain, the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he was introduced to the Buster Keaton movies that he
draws on now for comic roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's immense dignity in playing a clown. We're
asked to do everything no one else wants to do, only with
panache,'' he says, perhaps remembering his title role in ``Encino
Man'' _ his other loincloth movie _ in which, as a prehistoric man
unfrozen after millions of years, he shared a dish of dog food with
a Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the move may also have had something to do with Fraser's
becoming an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It influenced me at an early age to be open to different
people,'' he says. ``Or to invent them, or beg, borrow or steal
from them, and pretend they were mine all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's first brush with theater came in an unlikely
setting: the Upper Canada College in Toronto, a New World
incarnation of a British public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't paddled, but we were definitely tested again and
again,'' he remembers. ``We were little businessmen in our suits.
We weren't making money, but we were making marks. That was our
income. I can attest to that: All the old boys have gone on to the
Canadian equivalent of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   He, on the other hand, discovered the small campus theater _ not
as a budding actor, but by stage-managing and selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had bitten. After a stint at the Actor's
Conservatory at Seattle's Cornish College of the Arts, he was on
his way to grad school in Texas when he stopped in Los Angeles to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   He never left. And just a year later, he landed the coveted lead
in ``School Ties,'' an ensemble movie in which he co-starred with
Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wonderful. The same guy you see today,'' Fraser says of
Damon. ``He wasn't trying to make himself look good to charm an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser glances through the hotel window at a grim-looking urban
vista obscured by gray mist, and recalls his first reaction to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt distanced from it,'' he says. ``As I look out right
now, I can't say I recognize this view, because it's always
changing every time I turn around _ if you can see it through the
thick air.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again,'' he continues, ``there's that kind of misty
quality that makes for great black-and-white photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, who collects old Polaroid cameras, describes himself as
``a spectacular amateur'' photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes his cameras everywhere. Takes them to dinner. Maybe
hides behind them. I don't know,'' says director Wilson, who
invited Fraser to his Virginia farm to get acquainted before the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has five children and notes that Fraser, possibly out of
shyness, spent more time playing with the kids than talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraser remembers arriving at the farm after
surviving a combination of back-slapping and ``jealous glares'' at
his Upper Canada College 10th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flown from Toronto into Washington D.C., and the studio
sent a stretch limo to pick him up. He arrived to find Wilson, in
raincoat and hat, waiting for him atop a John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fraser lives in Hollywood with girlfriend Afton
Smith, a former actress he describes as ``dreamy.'' They plan to
marry and live somewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a homebody,'' he says _ dashing the fantasies of a slew of
prepubescent girls and their mothers. ``I've discovered things like
fleece-lined doeskin slippers. Given that and a choice between a
cocktail party ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm drawn to what I don't have,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   What he has very little of, apparently, is free time. With the
success of ``George'' and his newly perceived image as Hollywood
hunk, Fraser is on a hot streak, finding more scripts coming his
way than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Breathing,'' which came out in April, he was a
longhaired innocent again, this time a San Antonio street performer
in search of the true love he's envisioned in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was also recently in Morocco, shooting a techno-version of
the 1939 ``The Mummy,'' and in the upcoming ``Gods and Monsters,''
he stars as the fictional boyfriend of a movie director played by
Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innocence of some of the characters he plays,
the actor himself looks at it all with a faintly jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this is a Restoration comedy,'' he says about
Hollywood. ``We're seeking favor in court. There are jealousies and
rivalries. It's a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the meaning of `play,' is fun.''

   A steadicam follows Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone
through the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Hollywood, past the check-in
desk, past a frosted glass mural of Marilyn Monroe, through
faux-grand doors and outside, where the passing traffic hisses and
wheezes on Highland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep up a steady patter as they go, Fraser gesturing
wildly, like a silent-movie clown.
</P>
<P>
   They're shooting a comedy called ``The Blast from the Past,''
with Fraser playing Adam, a young man who'd been raised in an
elaborate underground bomb shelter since the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis by a paranoid scientist father, Christopher Walken, and
mother, Sissy Spacek _ ``June Allyson on Listerine,'' Fraser calls
her.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the 1990s, in spite of its hydroponic garden and fish
tank, the family is running out of supplies. Adam emerges to seek
batteries, toilet paper _ and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, not the psychopath one would expect after a
childhood like this, but a clean-cut, rather starchy fellow with
early-'60s values and impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   He develops an instant crush on tough cookie Silverstone, whom
he meets while trying to cash in a l950s Joe DiMaggio baseball
card.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, all sausage curls and trademark petulance, is
complaining to Adam about her lack of a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never works out, because I'm into butts and legs and hair
myself, so I always end up with some guy who's more shallow than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   No boyfriend? Adam goes into hormonally induced paroxysms of
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Cut. Do it again. And again. And again, as extras playing
Scandinavian tourists mingle with genuine British travelers,
bemused and jet-lagged as they stagger off a bus and wander into a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan was born to play this part,'' says writer-director
Hugh Wilson, a pleasant-faced man in chinos. ``It's all about
innocence, and Brendan exudes innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Fraser's furrowed brow always manages to give him
a rather sweet air of faint bewilderment, which he used to comic
advantage in ``George of the Jungle'' and which made him touchingly
vulnerable in ``School Ties,'' the l991 movie about teen-age
anti-Semitism that gave him his big-screen break.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 feet 3 inches, the 29-year-old Fraser is also a great
lunk of a guy. During a lull in filming, he's settled into a
nondescript armchair, his oversized feet planted firmly on the
carpet in a suite on the 22nd floor of the location hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Against a decorating nightmare of lurid flowered curtains and
fake floral arrangements that could have time-warped out of the
movie, Fraser is talking up a storm, hands flying in all directions
to punctuate his points.
</P>
<P>
   He's usually called shy, a description that makes him balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm thoughtful,'' he says. ``And I'm told I have
infrared vision. I like to understand people before I present
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he adds, he likes to save himself for his performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many comedians won't say boo to you, but put them in front
of a microphone and they blister the wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did to the screen in ``George of the Jungle,''
last summer's surprise hit with kids and critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million-plus box-office gross put the movie on Daily
Variety's Golden Reel list of top moneymakers for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hoo ha for the business end of the things,'' says Fraser,
whose price tag jumped from $1 million for ``George'' to several
million. He also gained a new audience of 7-year-olds, who laughed
at earnest George, and their mothers and baby-sitters, who gulped
at the sight of his well-toned muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe was about the size of a tea-towel,'' says Fraser,
who began a mad weight-lifting routine when he got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it never really seemed like enough,'' he says about his
physique, which he considered nothing more than part of his George
costume. ``I'm glad they took a picture of it, because it sure
doesn't stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser has gotten used to things not staying the same for long.
His father traveled the world promoting Canadian tourism, and the
family went along. The youngest of four brothers, Fraser lived in
Britain, the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he was introduced to the Buster Keaton movies that he
draws on now for comic roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's immense dignity in playing a clown. We're
asked to do everything no one else wants to do, only with
panache,'' he says, perhaps remembering his title role in ``Encino
Man'' _ his other loincloth movie _ in which, as a prehistoric man
unfrozen after millions of years, he shared a dish of dog food with
a Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the move may also have had something to do with Fraser's
becoming an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It influenced me at an early age to be open to different
people,'' he says. ``Or to invent them, or beg, borrow or steal
from them, and pretend they were mine all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's first brush with theater came in an unlikely
setting: the Upper Canada College in Toronto, a New World
incarnation of a British public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't paddled, but we were definitely tested again and
again,'' he remembers. ``We were little businessmen in our suits.
We weren't making money, but we were making marks. That was our
income. I can attest to that: All the old boys have gone on to the
Canadian equivalent of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   He, on the other hand, discovered the small campus theater _ not
as a budding actor, but by stage-managing and selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had bitten. After a stint at the Actor's
Conservatory at Seattle's Cornish College of the Arts, he was on
his way to grad school in Texas when he stopped in Los Angeles to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   He never left. And just a year later, he landed the coveted lead
in ``School Ties,'' an ensemble movie in which he co-starred with
Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wonderful. The same guy you see today,'' Fraser says of
Damon. ``He wasn't trying to make himself look good to charm an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser glances through the hotel window at a grim-looking urban
vista obscured by gray mist, and recalls his first reaction to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt distanced from it,'' he says. ``As I look out right
now, I can't say I recognize this view, because it's always
changing every time I turn around _ if you can see it through the
thick air.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again,'' he continues, ``there's that kind of misty
quality that makes for great black-and-white photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, who collects old Polaroid cameras, describes himself as
``a spectacular amateur'' photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes his cameras everywhere. Takes them to dinner. Maybe
hides behind them. I don't know,'' says director Wilson, who
invited Fraser to his Virginia farm to get acquainted before the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has five children and notes that Fraser, possibly out of
shyness, spent more time playing with the kids than talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraser remembers arriving at the farm after
surviving a combination of back-slapping and ``jealous glares'' at
his Upper Canada College 10th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flown from Toronto into Washington D.C., and the studio
sent a stretch limo to pick him up. He arrived to find Wilson, in
raincoat and hat, waiting for him atop a John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fraser lives in Hollywood with girlfriend Afton
Smith, a former actress he describes as ``dreamy.'' They plan to
marry and live somewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a homebody,'' he says _ dashing the fantasies of a slew of
prepubescent girls and their mothers. ``I've discovered things like
fleece-lined doeskin slippers. Given that and a choice between a
cocktail party ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm drawn to what I don't have,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   What he has very little of, apparently, is free time. With the
success of ``George'' and his newly perceived image as Hollywood
hunk, Fraser is on a hot streak, finding more scripts coming his
way than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Breathing,'' which came out in April, he was a
longhaired innocent again, this time a San Antonio street performer
in search of the true love he's envisioned in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was also recently in Morocco, shooting a techno-version of
the 1939 ``The Mummy,'' and in the upcoming ``Gods and Monsters,''
he stars as the fictional boyfriend of a movie director played by
Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innocence of some of the characters he plays,
the actor himself looks at it all with a faintly jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this is a Restoration comedy,'' he says about
Hollywood. ``We're seeking favor in court. There are jealousies and
rivalries. It's a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the meaning of `play,' is fun.''

 SENECA FALLS, N.Y: Cayuga Street.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boom and bustle brought industrialists and entrepreneurs to
the area, as well as an eclectic cast of reformers and
religionists. It was a particularly rich time in American social
history, when long-held ideas about everything from imprisonment to
religion to the relation between man and nature were being
questioned. Reform movements brought women out of the home and into
the public sphere, and the fierce debate over slavery prompted
larger questions about equality.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca Falls had its share of traditionalists, including many of
the main line churches, but it also had a distinctly progressive
bent. Many of the town's most successful citizens were Quakers and
abolitionists _ some even knitted wool, not cotton, in their mills
to avoid using a product harvested by slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Stantons themselves were staunch abolitionists: their
honeymoon had taken them to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in
London in 1840. There, Elizabeth met Lucretia Mott, and they bonded
in resentment of the convention's men, who had barred women from
participating.
</P>
<P>
   The Seneca area was also home to many religious revivals. The
revivals were mainly female affairs, and preachers exhorted the
women to interpret Scripture for themselves, and to follow their
own consciences. And women were at the forefront of the burgeoning
temperance movement, too.
</P>
<P>
   The realities around Stanton _ women overburdened by children
and home, without rights of expression, ownership or political
participation _ coalesced with the theories she had soaked up as an
upper-class intellectual. And those thoughts, in turn, mixed with
the spirit of reform that was in the air like so much pollen
waiting to land. The result of this heady brew was the 1848
convention.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to grasp how radical that gathering and the
sentiments espoused there were, since women can now vote, own
property, become educated and, at least in theory, do everything
enumerated as off limits in the convention's declaration.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the convention was roundly ridiculed by newspapers,
and the backlash was so severe that many of the women who had
signed the declaration removed their names. And it was only the
beginning of an extraordinarily protracted struggle: the right to
vote was not won for 72 more years and neither Stanton nor Susan B.
Anthony, who became involved in the struggle for equality a few
years after the convention, lived to see women gain suffrage.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony used to visit Stanton and her seven children (she had
two more boys and two girls after her move) at her Seneca Falls
home. That house is the only one of the three that are part of the
park that is restored and open to the public. Another, Jane Hunt's,
where the women met for tea, is privately owned, and the third, the
M'Clintock House in neighboring Waterloo, where they wrote the
declaration, is in the early stages of restoration. (In summer, the
park offers restoration tours, illuminating the painstaking process
of peeling back layers of history and wallpaper.)
</P>
<P>
   There is little furniture in Stanton's house (though her
wallpaper is reproduced) but a tour still delivers plenty of
fascinating material about her intellectual development and
domestic routine (her boys helped with housework, her girls played
freely). Here, Stanton wrote speeches and planned strategy for
Anthony and others until she emerged from her domestic cocoon in
the 1860s. (How did she balance work, family and home? you may ask.
She found _ and could afford _ a good housekeeper.)
</P>
<P>
   The park rangers also conduct walking tours of Seneca Falls,
painting the image of the village and its characters in 1848,
particularly its women. And you can also visit the old-fashioned
printing press on Fall Street and learn about Amelia Bloomer, who
founded, edited and published The Lily, the first newspaper devoted
to women's rights. She also briefly popularized another concept
that was ahead of its time: women in pants (or bloomers).
</P>
<P>
   From the visitors center, it is also worth signing up for a
chapel tour _ really just a history lesson with a ranger next door
at the remains of Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, where the convention
took place. Over the years, a series of tenants, including a
self-service laundry, gradually whittled away at the chapel, and it
could not be reconstructed because no one knows what it looked
like. (The destruction of history for commerce does have a flip
side: the visitors center used to be a car dealership.)
</P>
<P>
   So, two architecture students, Ann Wills Marshall and Ray
Kinoshita, came up with a design that encased the chapel's
remaining brick and timber in a supporting structure, then
surrounded it with a wall and plaza of sandstone. An amphitheater
next to the chapel overlooks a 140-foot-long wall, on which water
flows over engraved excerpts from the declaration and the inscribed
names of some of the signers.
</P>
<P>
   The space is inviting, encouraging of reverence. And, in a way,
as much as a church destroyed, the chapel structure resembles a
barn being raised _ a fitting image for its role in a revolution's
origins.

CALIFORNIA'S NOVEMBER BALLOT REPLETE WITH INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Californians will be asked to vote on at least
five statewide ballot initiatives in the November general election,
continuing a trend of letting those who go to the polls act as
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   California's tribes are sponsoring a measure that seeks to
change state laws on Indian gambling, a proposition that is shaping
up as the most heated and expensive fight, pitting the tribes
against powerful gambling interests.
</P>
<P>
   Five propositions have been certified for the Nov. 3 ballot. At
least two more are likely to make the ballot before Thursday's
deadline for checking petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
   California is known nationally for its often contentious ballot
measures. In the June 2 primary, voters approved Proposition 227,
which essentially eliminates bilingual education. Past California
ballot initiatives have legalized the use of marijuana for medical
purposes and scrapped affirmative action in state hiring and
contracting.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent measure to qualify for the November ballot is an
education reform package sponsored by Gov. Pete Wilson. The
initiative would, among other things, lock into law Wilson's
efforts to reduce kindergarten through third-grade classes to 20 or
fewer pupils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think kids are far too important to rely on the budget
drafters in Sacramento,'' said Mitch Zak, director of the Wilson
initiative campaign. ``We'd like to see it as a fundamental policy,
not a political contingency.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative also calls for mandatory testing of teachers in
their subject areas, and would give parents new powers to determine
spending priorities in schools by allowing them seats on school
``governing councils.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature still has its chance to add measures to the
November ballot, including a much-debated $9 billion school bond
issue to build new classrooms and repair older schools. The
deadline for such measures is July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures with enough signatures to make the ballot are:
</P>
<P>
   _ A proposition by environmentalists to give $218 million in
state tax credits each year until January 2011 to businesses that
switch from high-polluting vehicles and equipment to
cleaner-burning alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ An initiative by animal-rights groups to ban the use of
steel-jawed traps to kill nongame animals such as bobcats and
beavers for the sale of their fur. It also would outlaw two types
of poison used to kill coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A measure to make it a felony to sell, trade or keep a horse,
burro or mule for the purpose of killing the animal for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an unaddressed issue,'' said Cathleen Doyle, who
co-wrote the Save the Horses initiative. She said 150,000 horses
were slaughtered last year in the United States for their meat,
including an estimated 10,000 in California. ``People don't even
know this is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Sacramento is that one issue will dominate the
ballot: Indian gambling. Analysts are predicting spending in the
race easily could exceed $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would change state law by allowing Indians to
operate slot machines and Las Vegas-style card games, rather than
the bingo and card games they operate now.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal representatives insist it is not an expansion of their
gambling operations. They say it simply would legalize what many of
the 40 California tribes that have gambling operations are doing
now.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes supporting the measure are running ads statewide,
thanking those who signed the initiative petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money to be made from the initiative, and
that constitutes a threat to current gaming interests in the state,
and that includes the state itself,'' which runs the lottery, said
Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the
University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are calling their campaign ``Californians for Indian
Self-Reliance'' and arguing the measure is the only way to keep
some tribes afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribes in the last 10 years of tribal gaming have been able to
put together an industry that has created $4 billion worth of
economic activity in their local communities,'' said Dan
Pellissier, spokesman for the campaign. ``If the initiative doesn't
pass ... that $4 billion of economic activity will diminish. For
some tribes, it could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Two measures still are waiting for certification, though
supporters say they have more than enough signatures to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   One is an initiative to levy a 50-cent-per-pack tax on
cigarettes and other tobacco products to pay for early education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposition, sponsored by critics of the electric
power industry, would give consumers a 20 percent rate reduction,
double the cut ratepayers got under California's landmark
deregulation law that took effect in January.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would prevent the power industry from
recovering losses from nuclear power plants and other money-losing
investments, which ratepayer advocates say add up to $28 billion.

 BELATED FRUITS OF THE OPERATIC '80s   (af)  
 By PAUL GIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scarcity of good new operas in the present decade _ unless
something remarkable happens more than once during the next year
and a half _ makes all the more striking how much was achieved in
the 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen's only stage work, ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' was
presented by the Paris Opera. La Scala in Milan produced the first
three installments in Karlheinz Stockhausen's series of operas for
the days of the week: ``Thursday,'' ``Saturday'' and ``Monday.''
Luciano Berio had two operas staged in quick succession: ``La Vera
Storia'' and ``Un Re in Ascolto.'' So did Harrison Birtwistle, with
``The Mask of Orpheus'' and ``Yan Tan Tethera.'' John Adams's
``Nixon in China'' also made its bow.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of those works have entirely disappeared from the
theater. ``St. Francis'' had a spectacular second production, at
Salzburg in 1992, and will be revived there this summer. ``Nixon''
crops up from time to time, and so do the Berio operas: ``Un Re in
Ascolto'' most recently at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But all these pieces are more likely to go on playing in the
theater of the mind, their scores heard from recordings, and the
recent release on CD of ``Un Re in Ascolto'' and ``The Mask of
Orpheus'' fills two important gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Both works suggest answers to the question of why this great
flowering of opera occurred in the 80s. For one thing, there was
still, within large institutions, some trust in the avant-garde.
For another, composers and writers were starting to discover new
kinds of drama that would fit with new kinds of music.
</P>
<P>
   Action might be many-layered and repetitive, suggesting the
movements of memory or imagination. Characters would often be
mythic figures, whether ancient or modern: people who, again,
already have a place in our minds. Operatic drama was becoming,
like music at the time, fluid and associative.
</P>
<P>
   (The other question, concerning the sharp decline in the 90s,
can be answered with brute simplicity by citing lack of
investment.)
</P>
<P>
   The central character in ``Un Re in Ascolto'' (``A King
Listening'') is an impresario, and his mind is therefore doubly a
theater. What passes through that double theater, seemingly during
his dying moments, are thoughts of a staging of Shakespeare's
``Tempest,'' in which he is both producer and Prospero.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts flit from casting to rehearsal, from rehearsal to
performance, under the shadow of greater tragedies in the greater
theater of real life. The singers Prospero auditions for the
principal female role all challenge him on a personal level and,
finally, also on a political level. Outside Prospero's theater
there is a revolution going on. How can his little kingdom survive?
</P>
<P>
   It can survive, Berio implies, by welcoming into itself its own
obsolescence and decay. If the musical theater can be used to
represent its own workings, then it can get around the
awkwardnesses of its historical and social superfluity. But only
for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Un Re in Ascolto'' not only Prospero but also opera itself
is portrayed in its death throes. The art is simply falling apart,
and Berio's score evokes that dissolution in masterly fashion while
providing broken lines of continuity, notably in Prospero's arias.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Un Re in Ascolto'' is opera dying, ``The Mask of Orpheus''
is opera in birth. Like Berio, Birtwistle recognizes that an
essentially discontinuous, undirected musical style _ a style that
has gone beyond the steady forward movement of tonal harmony _
should equally reach beyond linear narrative. But his alternative
is quite different. Instead of mingling various phases in the
development of one story, he mingles various stories.
</P>
<P>
   The main features of the Orpheus myth are all present in
chronological order in the opera _ the marriage of Orpheus and
Eurydice, her death, his descent into the underworld to retrieve
her, his failure to do so, his death _ but often they are told more
than once in differing ways. They can also be interrupted by
similar stories from Greek mythology, mimed to electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And their importance can be other than expected. For instance,
Orpheus's journey through the underworld occupies the whole second
act, but the score barely registers the events we know from other
Orpheus operas: the hero's musical seduction of Charon, his
pleading with Pluto and Persephone, his backward glance.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``The Mask of Orpheus'' is as deliberately
defective as that of ``Un Re in Ascolto,'' but the effect
Birtwistle creates is of a story being remembered with difficulty,
drawn out from chaos, not of one crumbling away. His theater is
more womb than hospital ward, and his music strongly suggests
pregnancy in its long stillnesses, or birth in its shattering
outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   It also strikes back to harsher times in its scoring for wind
and percussion, with no strings in the orchestra. Even the
marvelous electronic music, prepared in collaboration with Barry
Anderson, sounds ancient: much of it seems to be coming from an
enormous plucked or struck string instrument (Orpheus's lyre),
which embraces the whole aural perspective; other sequences provide
the great echoing voice of a god.
</P>
<P>
   The new recordings of both works come, inevitably, from public
performances. ``Un Re in Ascolto'' (Col Legno WWE 20005/6; two CDs)
is heard in its premiere production, at the 1984 Salzburg Festival,
which does not appear to have been too wonderful. Lorin Maazel and
the Vienna Philharmonic are not at home in Berio's music, nor are
some of the singers, with the notable exception of Sylvia
Greenberg, who is thrilling in the third auditionee's virtuoso
aria.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is also a fair amount of stage noise and
prompting, which makes the whole thing sound like a rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   It is disappointing, too, that the package includes no libretto.
Given only a poorly translated synopsis, which is not cued to the
musical numbers, a newcomer to the work will be lucky to know what
is happening when.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the recording of ``The Mask of Orpheus'' (NMC D050;
three CDs), made at a BBC performance in London in 1996, comes with
almost too much information. The entire libretto, by Peter
Zinovieff, is supplied, and it includes abundant stage directions
and design motifs as well as dialogue that seems to have been cut
from the finished work.
</P>
<P>
   This may give the impression of extreme complexity, whereas for
the ear the piece unfolds naturally and homogeneously. There are,
to be sure, longueurs. But there are also extraordinary passages,
including nearly all the electronic music, Orpheus's aria with
fierce, congealed piccolos in the first act, the serene flow of
wind chords at the first mention of the arches of the underworld,
and the new vivacity when the orchestra starts to play in the third
act, which was written several years after the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Davis leads the BBC Symphony in a superb orchestral
performance, and the cast includes two important survivors from the
premiere, given 10 years before: Jean Rigby, dark and strong as one
of the Eurydices (the main roles are each sung at different times
or simultaneously by two singers), and Marie Angel, suitably
disturbing in the shrieks of the Oracle of the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Garrison is a bit talky as the principal Orpheus, but it is
perhaps a fault of the work that it does not sufficiently use
opera's chief resource: song.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, neither work quite measures up to its composer's
other achievements: Berio's ``Formazioni'' or Birtwistle's ``Earth
Dances,'' just to choose from orchestral works of the same period.
(``Earth Dances'' is available on Argo in a tremendous performance
by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi,
along with an equally tremendous account of the later ``Panic,''
featuring Ms. Davis and the BBC Symphony again.)
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be that both ``Un Re in Ascolto'' and ``The Mask of
Orpheus'' are real theater music, demanding to be seen as well as
heard. Birtwistle's opera won the most prestigious composition
prize in the United States, the Grawemeyer Award, more than a
decade ago. When will we see it staged?

OUT IN THE SUNLIGHT, THE PARANOIA PALES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are two things the ``X-Files'' film has brought us that the
television show had not: the Barbie-as-Scully and Ken-as-Mulder
collectible dolls, each with its own little FBI badge.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandising has nothing to do with the film's many convoluted
plots, but money has everything to do with what happened to ``The
X-Files'' in its leap from television to the movies. One of
television's most inventive and creatively successful shows has
become just another enjoyable summer action movie.
</P>
<P>
   A victim of its inflated Hollywood budget and the big-bang
theory of filmmaking, the ``X-Files'' movie goes to the heart of
how television and film try to set themselves apart from each other
today.
</P>
<P>
   During its five seasons on television, ``The X-Files'' has
become a pop-cultural touchstone because it instills a vague,
insidious paranoia into every bit of daily life. At 40, the series'
creator, Chris Carter, is part of a generation that came of age
with Watergate and Vietnam, a generation that takes as a tenet that
anyone can be lying at any minute, especially the government.
Intentionally or not, that sense pervades ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is the rational scientist,
skeptical of the paranormal, and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) the
intuitive believer in all things weird and wondrous, the viewers'
essential connection to them lies elswhere: in the heroes'
positions as FBI agents trying to get the goods on government
deception from the inside. Working for the government, they are at
the epicenter of cover-ups. This season Mulder even thought that
his evidence of alien life was itself a wily government conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the show's tight focus, shadowy look and small scale
perfectly convey the insinuating tone and paranoia of the subject.
Creeping directly into our homes via television, ``The X-Files''
has found its ideal genre.
</P>
<P>
   On the big screen, that symmetry between subject and form is
exploded to bits with the first noisy blast, a terrorist bomb that
goes off in Dallas. Scully and Mulder have been temporarily
reassigned to the FBI's anti-terrorist squad, but they might as
well have been sent into a ``Die Hard'' sequel. When the film loses
its invasive tone and intimacy, it loses what makes ``The X-Files''
work.
</P>
<P>
   The film's extravagant landscapes, aerial shots and special
effects are definitely big-screen big (though in a summer when a
tidal wave has already wiped out New York City in ``Deep Impact,''
these effects are not exceptional).
</P>
<P>
   After a prelude set in 35,000 B.C., which establishes that a
sinister alien virus lived among us even then, the film moves on to
the Dallas bombing, meant to cover up the virus' existence. As the
heroes search for the truth, there is a large-scale homage to
``North by Northwest,'' in which helicopters chase Scully and
Mulder across a cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   There is the vast empty snowscape of Antarctica, where Mulder
goes to rescue a kidnapped Scully. There are stops at an English
country estate and eventually a sweeping Tunisian desert, where
evil humans are in cahoots with the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The diffusion that destroys the creepy ``X-Files'' feeling
didn't have to happen. Film can obviously be as intimate as any
genre in the world. (Think of Bergman's ``Persona'' or classic
moments of Hollywood romance, like Sam singing ``As Time Goes By''
in ``Casablanca.'')
</P>
<P>
   But in the era of video and of actors crossing over more freely
from television to movies, a big-budget Hollywood film is intimate
at its peril. Explosive special effects offer audiences one of the
few things television cannot, and commercial filmmakers rarely
overlook that advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a matter of whether television is better than film
or vice versa, a question that leads nowhere. Rather, the blithe
assumption that ``The X-Files'' needed to turn itself into a
high-action film reveals the rigidity and wrongheadedness of so
much Hollywood movie making.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly possible for a television series to leap to the
movie screen successfully. From the start of its television days,
``Star Trek'' was broadly conceived, almost begging for a bigger,
more colorful cartoon canvas. ``The X-Files'' wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Though film viewers who haven't watched the television show may
wonder what the fuss is about, the movie is stocked with glimpses
of the creativity that makes the series work. When Mulder finds
Scully in Antarctica, she is in a state of suspended animation
inside a glass case, bringing to mind Snow White in her glass
coffin. It is an eerily effective image.
</P>
<P>
   So is the sight of the deadly black ooze (familiar to television
fans) that invades the body, crawling under the skin and into the
eyeballs like a horde of oily black worms. As for the
much-publicized question of whether Scully and Mulder kiss, the
film sets up a frisson that can run through the next television
season: are these two repressed enough to ignore a near-kiss
interrupted by a killer bee?
</P>
<P>
   And there is a priceless episode in which Mulder walks into a
bar, has too much to drink and spills his secrets to the bartender
(Glenne Headly). ``I'm the key figure in an ongoing government
charade, a plot to conceal the truth about the existence of
extraterrestrials. It's a global conspiracy, actually. ... So of
course no one believes me. I'm an annoyance to my superiors and a
joke to my peers; they call me Spooky, Spooky Mulder, whose sister
was abducted by aliens when he was just a kid and who now chases
after little green men with a badge and a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would say that about does it, Spooky,'' the bartender
tells him as she takes away his glass. This small-scale early scene
deftly brings the audience up to speed. More important, it is a
witty piece of writing. It is a reminder that at its best, ``The
X-Files'' is a chamber piece, peering intimately into its heroes'
claustrophobic, misunderstood souls.

A STEADY EYE ON FILM'S SHIFTING CURRENTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen years into his marathon run as the film critic for The
New Republic, Stanley Kauffmann sat down in 1974 to write an essay
to answer the two questions he was most often asked: How many films
do you see in a week? And don't you get bored?
</P>
<P>
   Zero to 12 and no, Kauffmann answered in that essay, ``Why I'm
Not Bored.'' A film may be boring, but the idea of going never is.
Boredom is incompatible with hope, Kauffmann wrote, and hope is
more of a constant in film than in virtually any other art in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much I know about a film's makers or its subject
before I go, I never (italics)really(end italics) know what it's
going to do to me,'' he wrote. ``Depress me with its vileness, or
just roll past, or change my life in some degree, or some
combination of all three, or affect me in some new way that I
cannot imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, Kauffmann is still at it. At age 82, he
is celebrating his 40th anniversary at The New Republic this month,
still trotting off to screenings and filing his literate,
independent-minded, intelligent if not entertaining, very grown-up
brand of reviews almost weekly.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened in film during Kauffmann's time as a critic _
the advent of the French New Wave and the rise of the great
Italian, Scandinavian and Japanese directors, the flourishing of
American movie-making in the late 1960s and 1970s, the onset of the
blockbuster, the dying of cinephilia.
</P>
<P>
   Film criticism, too, has been transformed. Andrew Sarris
imported the auteur theory from France, Pauline Kael emerged as the
first critic-celebrity. Wars between critics broke out. Broadcast
film reviewers entered the game and changed it. Now, in the
``Armageddon'' age, gloom engulfs the field.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, like David Denby of New York magazine, feeling
drowned out by the din of the Hollywood marketing machine, seem
despondent to a degree verging on despair. Column inches dwindle
while movies multiply. Worthwhile films cannot get distributed.
What can be worth saying, some critics wonder, about ``Lethal
Weapon 4?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kauffmann carries on, seemingly unfazed, immune to both
pessimism and hype. In an era of ``blurb whores,'' his
hyperbole-resistant style is rarely quoted in movie ads (a point of
perverse pride for his editor). He remains afloat, buoyed by an
old-fashioned commitment to the art, not the business, of film.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago he chose to review a film he figured almost no one
would see _ ``Chronicle of a Disappearance'' by a Palestinian
director, Elia Suleiman. It appeared fleetingly in a small film
museum in lower Manhattan. It reminded Kauffmann of Ionesco. He
thought it was one of the best films in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'm derelict in my function if I don't record that
that film passed through,'' he said in an interview in the
penthouse apartment in lower Manhattan where he has lived with his
wife, Laura, for 31 years. ``Utility is not the only criterion.
Otherwise, I'd be writing about `Deep Impact.'
</P>
<P>
   ``High-falutin' as it sounds, there's a point at which your
obligation to the art must come into play, or else you're just a
reporter,'' he said. (Then he added gently, apparently in deference
to the delusions of the reporter in his living room, ``Forgive
me.'')
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of today's film critics, who started young,
Kauffmann began reviewing movies in middle age. Born and raised in
Manhattan, he had majored in dramatic arts at New York University
and had spent 10 years as an actor and stage manager with a
repertory company that specialized in Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   He had published extensively _ 40 one-act plays, seven novels,
articles for magazines. And he had worked as a book editor; he
discovered and edited ``The Moviegoer'' by Walker Percy while
working at Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, a friend moving out of the country handed over to
Kauffmann an opportunity to write film reviews for a magazine
called The Reporter. Thus Kauffmann became a film critic.
</P>
<P>
   One day early on, he sent off a review to The New Republic. Two
weeks later, a check and a copy of the magazine with his review in
it arrived in the mail (followed, two days after that, by a letter
from the editorial secretary: Thanks for the offer but we cannot
use your review).
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This is for me!' '' Kauffmann recalled gleefully. Six
months later, he was the magazine's regular film critic.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was excellent. American movies were uninspired in
those days, but European cinema in particular had entered a period
of brilliance. Kauffmann became one of a handful of critics in the
early 1960s who helped convince educated Americans that they could
take film seriously as art again.
</P>
<P>
   He especially admired the Italian directors. He championed
Michaelangelo Antonioni for ``making a new art form.'' He called
Federico Fellini ``incapable of committing a stale or careless shot
to film'' and Vittorio De Sica ``perhaps the outstanding example of
the wedding of theatrical and cinematic mastery.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote about the likes of Akira Kurosawa in Japan and
Satyajit Ray in India; he described Ingmar Bergman's films as
ambitious, stimulating failures. ``The Swedish director is now
established as a Divine Amateur: enormously gifted, often
technically dazzling, essentially undisciplined,'' Kauffmann wrote
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He mocked the French New Wave. In a review of Agnes Varda's
``Cleo from 5 to 7,'' he parodied the New Wave style: ``Use
freakish faces for minor characters (this is candor). Use a little
nudeness (this is maturity). Include long walks through a city,
preferably Paris; just long, pointless walks.''
</P>
<P>
   After admiring ``Breathless,'' he turned against Jean-Luc
Godard's later films. He made fun of Godard's admirers (who
happened to include Sarris and Ms. Kael), calling Godard ``a
magician who makes elaborate uninspired gestures and then pulls out
of the hat precisely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann's strengths as a critic are said by both admirers and
detractors to consist of a literate, cultivated approach; a deep
knowledge of theater and strong feeling for acting; an economical
writing style, and a refusal to conform to anyone else's doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   He never subscribed to the auteur theory promoted by Sarris, who
many now credit with changing the way Americans think about film,
emphasizing the role of the director above all. (Kauffmann
nevertheless says he learned from it.) Nor did he ever admire film
as popular culture, as opposed to art, to the extent that Ms. Kael
and her followers did.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greg Taylor, who teaches film studies at Purchase College, SUNY
and is writing a book on postwar film criticism, calls Kauffmann
``one of a group of stalwarts whose heyday was the 60s,'' critics
like Dwight Macdonald and John Simon, who concerned themselves with
the esthetics of film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their work was not strictly directed at highbrows but at a
broader middle-brow audience,'' Taylor said. ``And they really
explicitly tried to educate and elevate taste in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they and others did. By the late 1960s, American
movie-making had begun to change. Beginning around the time of
``Bonnie and Clyde,'' in 1968, a group of artistically ambitious
directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese
and Brian DePalma began making movies that not only were
profounding popular and entertaining but are also widely seen as
more stylish and complex than what had come before.
</P>
<P>
   The climate of filmgoing had changed, too. Richard T. Jameson,
the editor of Film Comment, calls the period ``an era of
enlightened filmgoership.'' Americans were eager to read in depth
about film. Critics became important cultural figures, speaking on
college campuses, their work widely discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody feuds broke out in print. Ms. Kael took on Sarris and the
auteur theory; there were viciously argued differences over New
Wave directors like Godard. Later, John Simon attacked Ms. Kael and
Sarris. Sarris, given an opportunity to respond in the pages of The
New York Times, fought back, calling Simon ``the Count Dracula of
critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kael also took occasional swipes at Kauffmann (``the
UnKael,'' as Louis Menand called him in a 1995 article about Ms.
Kael in The New York Review of Books). In reviews of films like
Truffaut's ``Jules and Jim,'' she would quote Kauffmann's opinions,
then witheringly dismiss them.
</P>
<P>
   (When asked recently about each other, neither Kauffmann nor Ms.
Kael would comment. ``I think I'd rather not,'' Ms. Kael said.
Looking suddenly distraught, the avuncular Kauffmann said: ``I
don't want to go into it. It's the sort of thing I disliked so much
in the 1960s.'')
</P>
<P>
   Out of that period Ms. Kael emerged as the dominant critic,
arguing that many American movies of the 70s were art as much or
more than those of the European model that audiences had been
taught to respect.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Rainer, the film critic for New Times Los Angeles, puts
it, there was value in the subversiveness of those American movies,
``not just to thrill us but to take us to a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann, by contrast, was less than swept away. He was
unimpressed by ``The Godfather'' and ``The Godfather Part II.'' He
compared ``Nashville'' to ``a superior book-club novel.'' If
``Chinatown'' were shorter and less paradigmatic, he wrote in 1974,
``it would be a good sinister thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   The late 1970s and 80s brought another revolution, this time in
movie marketing, with the rise of saturation distribution and a
growing reliance by studios on television publicity. That, in turn,
transformed the experience of being a critic, not to mention the
movies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The industry needed blockbusters that could open in thousands of
theaters at once. Studios turned increasingly to television talk
shows and other venues to promote them. These days, by the time a
movie opens and a print critic weighs in, the studios have already
been spreading the word for months.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics feel that good movies are still being made but that
it's harder for the films to get the public's attention. Foreign
and independent films disappear for lack of publicity or
distribution. To write only about small masterpieces that few
readers will see strikes some critics as courting irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about movies as an art, you're just out of
it,'' complained Denby, who recently wrote an article in The New
Yorker bemoaning the dying of the film culture. ``The business
conversation is the hip conversation, the knowing conversation, the
dinner-table conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have changed their focus. J. Hoberman, the senior
critic for The Village Voice, said that he had started out in film
criticism much more interested in the esthetics of film but that
like others, he had shifted his attention to the sociological,
political and historical implications of movies.
</P>
<P>
   But that approach, too, had its drawbacks, said Rainer, who had
tried it. ``It's just that if that's the only way that you can
really sink your teeth into movies time and time again, you become
famished,'' he said. ``Because so much of what brought us into
movies as budding critics was the wonderfulness of movies, not the
social context.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann, meanwhile, has no plans to retire. (He stopped just
once, in the late 1960s, to spend eight months as the theater
critic for The New York Times.) Some fellow critics say his tastes
have grown stuffier over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Jameson, the editor of Film Comment, said Kauffman represented
``comparatively speaking, a kind of fuddy-duddyism.'' But Roger
Ebert calls him the best critic working, the only one who makes
Ebert reconsider his own view.
</P>
<P>
   And Jon Wilkman, 55, a documentary filmmaker in Los Angeles who
first read Kauffmann in the early 1960s at Oberlin College, credits
Kauffmann with inspiring Wilkman's own filmmaking, in part by
introducing him to the work of the Italian neo-realist director
Ermanno Olmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go to a movie knowing nothing except that Stanley liked
it,'' said Wilkman, who has never met Kauffmann. ``I would say to
my wife, `Stanley likes this, we should go.' And she would laugh at
me for my excessive dependence.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's history at a glance:
</P>
<P>
   400,000 B.C. _ Precursors. Present-day northern China is
inhabited by some of the world's earliest humans. Peking Man and
Peking woman are cave-dwelling hunters standing about half a head
shorter than today's Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   About 2200 B.C. _ Seeds. The first Chinese king _ Yu the Great,
tamer of floods _ founds China's first dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   221 B.C. _ Birth. The Qin Dynasty conquers warring neighbors to
unite the first single, centralized state that would become known
as China. Qin rulers built an early version of the Great Wall and a
multi-tentacled bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   960 AD-1278 A.D. _ Renaissance. Under China's ``golden age'' in
the Song Dynasty, China invents gunpowder, prints books with
movable type, introduces the magnetic compass and the civil service
examination.
</P>
<P>
   1278-1368 A.D. _ Occupation. Genghis Khan's grandson Kublai Khan
completes brutal Mongolian invasion of China, and Mongols choose
Beijing as Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   1368-1911 A.D. _ Empire. The Chinese empire flourishes in
isolation from the rest of the world, but ultimately weakens and
collapses.
</P>
<P>
   1911-1949 _ Interregnum. The Qing Dynasty is succeeded by weak
parliamentary republic led by reformer Sun Yat-sen. Northern China
breaks off into warlord territories, which are finally conquered by
Sun's successor and brother-in-law Gen. Chiang Kai-shek. His
Nationalist Chinese regime proves too weak to deal with civil war,
endemic poverty and Japanese invasion.
</P>
<P>
   1934 - Communism. Communist guerrilla Mao Tse-tung leads a
5,500-mile ``Long March'' of 100,000 followers across 18 mountain
ranges to escape from Nationalist troops. The mythic retreat is the
prelude to Mao's takeover of China.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 13, 1937 - Massacre. Japanese troops storm into Nanjing and
begin a reign of terror in which at least 20,000 Chinese women are
raped and 30,000 fleeing Chinese soldiers are massacred.
</P>
<P>
   June 1949 - Redoubt. Chiang Kai-shek, having given up the
presidency of China, retreats to the island province of Taiwan.
Chiang asserts control over the island's population and digs in for
a communist cross-channel invasion that never comes.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1949 - Takeover. Communist leader Mao Tse-tung stands
atop the gate to the former Imperial City in Beijing and announces
the founding of the People's Republic of China. Mao promises
dictatorial treatment for ``running dogs of imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   1950-53 - War. Americans and Chinese troops fight on opposite
sides in a bloody stalemate in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   May-July 1957 - Flowers. Mao Tse-tung tells communist
bureaucrats to ``let 100 flowers bloom,'' signaling a reform
period. Chinese intellectuals respond with a burst of grievances.
In July, Mao shifts direction. Tens of thousands are sent to labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
   1958 - Leap. Mao Tse-tung launches a ``Great Leap Forward''
scheme to multiply China's industrial and moral strength by
spreading small-scale mines, mills and factories throughout the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   1959-60 - Famine. Peasants, caught up in ``Great Leap''
hysteria, fail to harvest crops. Food production falls
disastrously, leading to a famine in which 20 million Chinese die.
</P>
<P>
   1960 - Split. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev orders thousands
of Soviet technicians out of China, as China and the U.S.S.R. break
apart over Khrushchev's criticisms of the ``Great Leap.''
</P>
<P>
   1966-1976 - Radicalism. Mao unleashes a more radical stage
called the ``Cultural Revolution,'' spearheaded by some 10 million
teenage ``Red Guards.'' Millions of intellectuals are ``sent down''
to the countryside for ``re-education.'' Mao's death in 1976 causes
a letup in repression.
</P>
<P>
   1978 - Modernization. New Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping launches
China's two-decade spurt of economic growth by loosening
communist-style controls and encouraging Western investment.
</P>
<P>
   1980 - Population. China adopts ``one-child policy,'' under
which women need permission from their work units to have children.
Some with unsanctioned pregnancies are pressured to abort, others
fined if they deliver an unapproved child.
</P>
<P>
   June 4, 1989 - Crackdown. About 500 to 1,000 pro-democracy
supporters are killed in Beijing when student protests in Tiananmen
Square are crushed by Chinese tanks.
</P>
<P>
   July 1, 1997 - Sovereignty. After a century and a half of
British colonial rule, China regains sovereignty of Hong Kong,
under assurances of semi-autonomous status for the port city.

 &HT;    MAINSTREAM CHINA IS NO MAIN STREET USA
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON-0625; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV25.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A typical Chinese urbanite bicycles down a frenetic
rush hour street -- small daughter tucked into a backseat and
packages filling the basket in front. Ignoring the chaos, he chats
into the cell phone clamped to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is among the legion of arresting oddities that will
punctuate the trip through China of President Bill Clinton and his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Such culture clashes are no more unusual than those presented to
Chinese visiting America -- for example, when they hunt vainly
through hotel rooms for the terry cloth slippers and thermos of hot
water that are ever -present in Chinese hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, visitors have been coming to China to absorb the
brilliant colors, pungent scents and tinkling sounds of a land that
many in the West expected to find ``backward.'' But even in the
13th Century Marco Polo found China filled with marvels, much as
travelers do today.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones, for example, seem to be more pervasive in Chinese
cities than in most any sophisticated American metropolis. People
in taxis, on bicycles, walking down the street, riding a bus,
sitting in restaurants or shopping in book stores, food stores or
shoe stores can be found engaged in intense conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phones are so popular because they are both cheaper and
more accessible than permanent telephone connections in the home.
Regular phone service reaches a mere 8 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Another peculiarity to visiting Americans may be the white
cotton gloves worn by many taxi drivers, elevator attendants,
cyclists and street sweepers worried about soiling their hands.
Some women wear gloves when simply walking down the street. In the
extremely health-conscious Chinese society such attention to dust
and baebe seen sprinting down the aisle, baby at arms' length,
heading toward the restroom (commonly known as the water closet, or
``WC'') at the end of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Queries about this habit have produced the explanation that,
yes, Chinese do use diapers, both disposable and cloth. But some
parents sometimes prefer to let their babies experience the natural
freedom of diaperless days, and no one seems to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that helps explain the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   A pervasive and vibrant aspect of Chinese culture is the color
red. It is thought to be lucky, so spices up the scenery
everywhere. Red lanterns big and small hang outside restaurants and
shops. Brides who wear the same billowy white dresses seen
everywhere from Macon to Moscow traditionally have a bit of red
tucked away somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton goes ahead with his planned visit to the Shanghai
Stock Exchange, he even will find the big board listing stocks on
the rise in red, while those declining are lit in green -- exactly
the opposite of Western exchanges. An official explained that the
first Shanghai exchange followed the Western color pattern, but it
made no sense to the clientele. When the new exchange opened last
year the board was made right, Chinese-style.
</P>
<P>
   Americans dining in China also will encounter some opposites. In
a typical Chinese restaurant in China, the soup will come at the
end of the meal and the rice will be the penultimate arrival --
served after the last hot dish has been placed on the table (but
before the soup).
</P>
<P>
   Here the rice and soup are considered filler food, traditionally
served toward the end so as not to detract from the more important
meat or fish dishes. Back when meat was scarce and expensive, the
rice and soup were backups to fill the stomach after the good stuff
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Rice also is seen as counteracting the buzz that a diner
drinking beer or wine is expecting from the alcohol, thus
compounding the reasons for serving it toward the end of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim. Story can end here.)
</P>
<P>
   So much for phenomena of sight and taste. There is also an
unusual sound sensation that can be found at least in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down the street around dusk, the stroller may hear a
rippling, calliope melody quite distinct from the pop music blaring
from open-front stores to attract young customers. It may take a
while to find the source of the flute-like music, but perhaps
following the nose will help.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant tune can be traced to a big white truck temporarily
double-parked in the street while workers fan out to commercial
establishments to pick up the results of the day's work. Much
preferable to the horn-honking that Beijing's drivers lavishly
utilize to announce their presence, it is the municipality's most
civilized effort to alert pedestrians and drivers that the garbage
truck is coming.

50 YEARS AGO, OPERATION VITTLES SAVED A CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Operation Restore Hope or Operation Deny Flight, there
was Operation Vittles.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tongue-in-cheek name for a deadly serious mission that
came together 50 years ago this week: to supply 2.5 million
war-weary Berlin residents with enough food, supplies and heat to
outlast a Soviet blockade imposed June 24, 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-month Operation Vittles, better known as the Berlin
Airlift, also provided the infant Air Force with its first real
test. More significant, it helped establish the tradition of U.S.
involvement in humanitarian missions, a tradition that continues in
operations such as Restore Hope in Somalia and Deny Flight in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who took part in the ]airlift, such as Fort Worth
residents Richard A. Campbell and John Kenderdine, it became a
defining moment in their lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing something for people that they couldn't do
themselves,'' said Campbell, who remembers being handed flowers by
Berlin schoolchildren after one mission. ``We were helping
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Missile Crisis remains the most sobering example of
Cold War brinkmanship, and rightly so, given its nuclear threat,
said Air Force Col. John Brower, a professor at the Air War College
at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Soviets closed land access to West Berlin in a
dispute with their former allies over control of the city, the
risks for more bloodshed in Europe seemed very real as the
airlift's first planes took off June 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first skirmish of the Cold War,'' Brower said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenderdine is 85, a widower and retired brigadier general living
in a condominium in southwest Fort Worth. But he remembers the
tension of those days well, including seeing his wife qualify with
a rifle in preparation for war.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1948, Kenderdine was a lieutenant colonel in the Army
and the director of supply at a depot in Giessen, Germany, just
north of Frankfurt. He remembers a phone call summoning him to
Rhein Main Air Base for a meeting with Air Force brass.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that legendary Gen. Curtis LeMay asked Kenderdine
to come up with 500 tons of supplies for the first shipments into
Berlin in only a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Kenderdine chose the ingredients to make bread. Neither coal nor
gasoline nor ammunition, but flour, milk and raisins were the first
cargoes delivered in an operation that would eventually fly about
2.3 million tons of supplies into Berlin on about 278,000 flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anybody would criticize that,'' he said. ``It
was also the easiest thing to pull out of stock and load on short
notice, so that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first pilots was Campbell, a young lieutenant who
piloted a C-54 cargo plane. He was yanked from his assignment in
Japan and sent to Germany, where he was briefed on the still-new
radar approaches and told, ``Good luck.'' He flew five missions
into Berlin's Tempelhof airfield his first day there and hundreds
more during his six months of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tempelhof was the hairiest of them all,'' recalled Campbell,
75, who retired as an Air Force colonel. ``The final approach
called for a letdown between the rubble of these huge apartment
houses, and it always looked like you were going to hit them with a
wing tip.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlift soon became an impressively fine-tuned operation,
given Germany's rain and fog and the complexities of air traffic
control. The planes followed concise schedules and flight paths,
touching down every three minutes during the height of the airlift.
</P>
<P>
   On average, about 5,000 tons a day were delivered to Berlin on
American and British aircraft. Unlike today's Air Force, however,
which can deliver as much as 100 tons at a time on cargo planes,
the Air Force of that time had planes that mostly could only carry
10 tons or less.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, about 180,000 tons of humanitarian supplies were
flown into war-ravaged Sarajevo from July 1992 to January 1996,
less than the Berlin Airlift transported in March 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Losing an engine on takeoff or landing was not uncommon, nor was
getting buzzed by Soviet fighters, who usually declined more
confrontational approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had three MiGs fly right across my nose as I made one
approach,'' Campbell said. ``They were close enough for me to
clearly see the pilots' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after it began, on May 12, 1949, the Soviets
lifted their land blockade around Berlin, though the airlift
continued until Sept. 30 to create a stockpile in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Five decades later, the Berlin Airlift is still studied by
officers and enlisted personnel as one of the Air Force's finest
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep a city alive for that period of time purely by air was
really a Herculean effort,'' Brower said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenderdine's involvement with the airlift ended after only a few
days, though he has never forgotten how Germans would pull over and
watch the endless convoys of supplies or how grateful they seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the proudest moments of my Army career,'' he
said. &QL;

     NAACP GIVE CONGRESS FAILING GRADE ON
CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION
 &HT;     By KIMBERLY MARSELAS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress have voted against civil rights
legislation 49 percent of the time during the 1997-98 session,
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said Wednesday as he released the
group's 1998 legislative report card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have followed the voting records of members of this
Congress and find that both the House and Senate have failed the
American people as it relates to civil rights issues,'' Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
plans to distribute the report card to all its 1,700 local
branches, hoping to increase voter awareness and turnout in
November and to defeat members who didn't vote for civil rights
legislation often enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to use this information as a sword to defeat
delinquent legislators of both parties and to bolster those of both
parties who care about and vote for equal protection under the law
for Americans,'' Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   The group listed 50 ``zeros,'' or senators and representatives
who voted against the NAACP's stance on every key vote. This list
includes Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C. and
Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP gave ``hero'' status to 137 legislators, meaning they
voted with the NAACP at least 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings were based on 10 key votes in the Senate and 12 key
votes in the House. Issues included affirmative action, juvenile
justice, voter empowerment, the budget, the census and the Senate
confirmations of Surgeon General David Satcher and Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The report card found that Republicans were far less likely to
support civil rights legislation. Eighty-seven percent of all
Democrats had a passing grade on the 1998 report card, while only
18 percent of Republicans passed. But Mfume insisted that the NAACP
would target members of both parties for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Southern delegations were the worst when
it came to supporting NAACP stances this year. Every Southern
delegation received an F for their lack of pro-civil rights votes.
</P>
<P>
   Only three states _ Massachusetts, North Dakota and West
Virginia _ received an A for their delegations' voting records this
session.
</P>
<P>
   In order to elect legislators who better represent the ideas of
the NAACP and its 1 million members, the group will spend ``every
dime that we can afford'' on grassroots activities and media
campaigns, Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said many of the low grades could be attributed to the
lawmakers' unwillingness to work together on effective legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The members ``would prefer not to compromise,'' he said. ``But
that does not help our government or our people. ''

CHINESE AMERICANS TAKE PRIDE IN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While politicians and pundits debate President
Clinton's historic trip to China, some Chinese Americans view the
visit as a matter of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're proud because China is growing stronger and stronger,
so the United States has to pay attention to China,'' said Joseph
Leung, host of a daily Cantonese-language radio talk show that has
received numerous calls about Clinton's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists and Tibetans, however, hope Clinton can
make progress on a variety of substantive issues. But for Chinese
immigrants interviewed for this story, the president has achieved
something just by going.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's Chinatown, many of the Chinese residents left
their homeland decades ago. They've married, worked, retired and
had children and grandchildren in the United States, but the
emotional bonds to the country of their birth are still strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bottom of their hearts, anything that's good for
China, they agree with,'' said Frank Lee, a World War II veteran
who has lived in San Francisco for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chang-Lin Tien, the former chancellor of the University of
California at Berkeley, saw the trip as an opportunity to boost the
image of Chinese Americans, tarnished by reports of Chinese
contributions to U.S. political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the American public understands China, the more it
will help to defuse some of the negative publicity generated on
Asian Americans,'' Tien said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin have a full plate of
topics to discuss in their summit meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Tsai, a senior partner with Oakland, Calif.-based Wang &AMP;
Li Asia Resources, said the trip was getting lost in the media
chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's not very significant because it's being
detracted from by all the other garbage going on, from Donorgate to
Lewinsky,'' she said. ``I find that tragic because we really need a
really good and solid China policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai was born and raised in the San Francisco area but recently
lived in Taiwan for six years. While there, she said, she was able
to observe U.S. foreign policy as a foreigner might view it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching from an outsider's perspective, you realize American
policy is not really coherent,'' she said. ``It seems to be very
reactive; it's not very proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese journalist Zhang Weiguo said Clinton should take
advantage of Jiang's low domestic popularity to push for democratic
reforms. He said a popular saying in China goes, ``Mao Zedong was
like a tiger, Deng Xiaoping like a cat, and Jiang like a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang Zemin may be willing to listen a little more,'' said
Zhang, who was imprisoned for 20 months after the 1989 student
movement in China. ``For Clinton, this is an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   One sensitive area for some Chinese Americans is the official
welcoming ceremony adjacent to Tiananmen Square, site of the bloody
crackdown on student protesters in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Clinton joins with communist leaders at Tiananmen
Square, he will go into the wrong side of history,'' said human
rights activist Harry Wu, echoing the phrase used recently by
Clinton to chide China on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to participate in the formal welcoming
ceremony Friday at a building overlooking Beijing's central square.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wu acknowledges the need for dialogue with China, he
has long been critical of Clinton's policy of engaging China, which
he sees as appeasing China for mutually beneficial financial
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to sacrifice some short-term interests for our
long-term future,'' he said. ``Otherwise, the economic development
and prosperity we have today can be lost.''

   HAND-PAINTED-WALLPAPER (New York) _ It took 12 years for
Elizabeth Dow to perfect a method of hand-painting wallpapers so
subtly they appear to glow from within, like a letter held up to a
lamp. But don't ask her how she did it. Everything about the
process _ from the recipe cards for the pigments of her imagination
to her glues and the shape of the fans for drying the paper _ is a
secret guarded as zealously as the formula for Chanel No. 5. By
Julie Iovine.

<P>
   DOGS-AND-PEOPLE (New York) _ ``Don't eat the eyes.'' Now there's
a sentence to consider. You could either be having dinner in
Chinatown _ or talking to a dog. In this case, Caroline Knapp, the
author of the best-selling memoir, ``Drinking: A Love Story'' (Dial
Press, 1996) is addressing Lucille, her 3-year-old German shepherd
mix, who has been systematically gutting a stuffed animal _ a
lemming, to be exact. Ms. Knapp remains calm in the face of
annihilation. She has written a new book, ``Pack of Two: The
Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs'' (Dial Press), a
thoughtful, sensitive analysis of the all-out love affair she
unexpectedly found in her relationship with Lucille and that other
people, especially women, find with their own dogs. By Alex
Witchel.

   NY-REAL-ESTATE (New York) _ There's a kind of hush, all over New
York _ New York's residential real estate market, that is. Whether
hush or hiccup or breathing spell _ all terms used by brokers to
describe the market since the beginning of June _ the city's
biggest companies agree on one thing: the frenzy has abated, at
least for now. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   HOLOGRAMS (Undated) _ Crossing the swimming pool with the
relentlessness of a Stephen Spielberg tracking shot, the twin shark
mouths on the kid's goggles splash bits of green and orange and
purple: they are the holographic images of hungry shark faces on
the lenses of Speedo's new hologram goggles. The wearer can look
through the goggles, but the viewer sees the shark faces or,
alternately, shark eyes. Holograms are shimmering across placemats,
mugs, summer toys and movie tie-ins.

   NY-HARLEM-SHOWHOUSSE (New York) _ It ain't just paint. It's
wallcoverings: marble dust, Butcher's Wax, Formica laminate and

   CALIF-MERCHANT-STREET (Los Angeles) _ Merchant Street is a
tattered row of produce warehouses and auto body shops, its
littered sidewalk and cracked street home to the poor and drug
addicts. This is not a pretty part of town, but here in the heart
of Los Angeles' Skid Row is a jewel. At the back of an asphalt
parking lot, in a wall decorated with dancing colored letters, a
door gives a view into a charming urban courtyard. A cheerful
ceramic fountain surrounded by ripening orange trees is covered in
hand-painted hearts, fruits, flowers and birds. Youngsters are
cleaning their paintbrushes under the spray. A circle of six year
olds sits inside the building, absorbed in painting self-portraits.

THE GOOD DOCTOR COOLS HIS HEELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ever-edgy Eddie Murphy, known for slick suits
and cool shades, had to tone it down for his role as the doctor in
20th Century Fox's ``Dr. Dolittle,'' which opens citywide Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to costume designer Sharon Davis, who purchased some
of the actor's wardrobe at Macy's in the Fashion Square mall in
Sherman Oaks, Murphy wasn't allowed to upstage the animals. In
spite of his top billing, the animals steal the show with some
colorful costumes in the film version of the classic children's
story about a doctor who talks to the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Murphy's wardrobe to be very realistic and
understated, which is a lot more difficult than dressing someone to
stand out. You have to rely on quality of fabric and cut to give an
actor star quality instead of using color or some sort of novelty
(like ``Men in Black'') ... so I chose elegant Zegna suits as well
as fashions by Donna Karan and Calvin Klein. And unlike TV, where
clothes are allowed to look brand new, feature films like the
clothes to look like they've been worn a few times,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   As she shopped, the designer confided that Murphy, like Denzel
Washington in ``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' is a clothes horse. ``He's
a dream to dress. He's a 40 regular with perfect proportions and
simply walks into the clothes ... unlike other actors who need
extensive alterations,'' she said.

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Kennedy proved it with her matching dress-and-coat
ensembles and those little pill box hats. Grace Kelly had so much
fashion clout that the style of her Hermes handbag is now referred
to as the ``Kelly bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Princess Diana had the same power. Everything she wore,
from her wedding gown to her frisky haircut to her Christian Dior
purse, made fashion headlines. In honor of her birthday on July 1,
we asked a few fashion mavens to tell us what they liked best about
the royal fashion icon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mr. Blackwell, fashion arbiter &LR;  _ &UR;  &LR; ``She was a great fashion
independent. It wasn't only her sense of style, but her ability to
carry the style with grace and elegance, and project true royalty,
that made her an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Anne Cole, L.A. swimwear designer _ &LR;  ``She was the very
portrait of ladylike sensibility ... and I was honored to know she
once ordered a swimsuit from my Anne Cole Collection. It was a
classic plaid high-neck maillot.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frederic Fekkai, hairdresser &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; stars _  &LR; ``She'll be
best-remembered for her striking suits, and, of course, her
always-modern hairstyles. I think her last style was perhaps her
most flattering. It was certainly sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milinda Martin &LR; , &UR; Robinsons-May spokeswoman _  &LR; ``Unlike the
other members of the royal family, she broke fashion rules ... like
wearing a necklace as a headband.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Judy Rabineau, designer for Mica fashions _  &LR; ``The
off-the-shoulder dress with the brooch _ the one like Celine Dion
wore to the Oscars _ and that purse with the charms on it by
Christian Dior ... wow. She now marches with the likes of Jackie
Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Denise Filchner,  &LR; a &UR; ccessories fashion director for Macy's _
 &LR; ``Princess Diana did more for the world of fine jewelry than
anyone has for a long time. She brought public awareness to
sapphires, starting from her wedding day. And her signature
diamond-and-sapphire necklace was copied by numerous costume
jewelry designers such as Carolee so we all could have that royal
look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alanna Chaffin, spokeswoman for the CaliforniaMart _
 &LR; ``Princess Diana was a contemporary thinker who wasn't afraid to
wear red or bold patterns, even though they probably weren't in the
royal dress code.''

   CIR-WINDOWS95 (Undated) _ What a difference three years make!
When Windows 95 finally made its way out the door, Microsoft Corp.
promoted it to the cheeky beat of the Rolling Stones' ``Start Me
Up.'' Windows 98? Dullsville. Thursday's official release flaunts
the bland slogan, ``Works Better, Plays Better.'' The CD? It comes
with a Microsoft commercial appropriately set to a pop adaptation
of a theme from Beethoven's Piano Sonata (Op. 13), the
``Pathetique.'' For all its failings, Windows 95 was in many ways,
big and small, a significant improvement over its predecessor,
Windows 3.1, particularly in its ability to run multiple programs
at once. But when it arrived, one reviewer (this one) described it
as ``an edifice built of baling wire, chewing gum and prayer.''

LEWINSKY MAY BE MORE CALCULATING THAN WE THINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look at Monica. See Monica smile. See Monica pose for the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   See Monica mock the independent counsel and the horse he rode in
on.
</P>
<P>
   Just perusing the pictures of Monica Lewinsky in the July issue
of Vanity Fair magazine, you might never guess that she's in a
truckload of trouble. You might never guess that she could end up
going to jail for her role in a White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky looks happy and carefree as she poses in the grass,
wearing a red-and-white checked blouse and blue jeans. She looks
happy and carefree on the beach, wearing a black dress and using a
mock flag as a backdrop. She even looks happy and carefree wearing
a cloak of pink feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Monica is wearing something in every photograph,
which sets her apart from alleged Bill Clinton paramours Elizabeth
Gracen and Gennifer Flowers, who posed nude in men's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair is no Playboy or Penthouse, although the same issue
that features Lewinsky with clothing features a rear view of a
model without clothing in an ad for ``firm lift'' body lotion.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and the folks who helped her dress up for the photo shoot
did their best to make her look glamorous, but she hardly looks
like the sort of femme fatale whose charms could wreck a White
House. She definitely doesn't look like a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's crime? The former White House intern stands suspected
of perjury, suborning perjury and conspiring to destroy America's
trust in its president.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that last one isn't a violation of the law, but it is
clearly the transgression that has placed Lewinsky in the path of
the legal bulldozer known as independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told a friend that she had an affair with President
Clinton, and the friend told Starr. If sex was perpetrated in the
White House, Starr knew, those involved would eventually lie about
it. He also knew that a prosecutor who could document a sworn lie
about White House sex would be well on his way toward turning a
moral deficiency into a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's photo shoot, needless to say, was analyzed, dissected
and second-guessed even before the pictures hit the newsstands. The
consensus criticism: She should have amused herself by reading a
magazine rather than posing for one.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking seems to be that the photographs damaged Lewinsky's
credibility, that they made her seem frivolous, impulsive and
perhaps overly enthralled with the notoriety she has achieved in
recent months. The problem with this criticism is that the critics
are presuming that Lewinksy wants to be credible, that she wants to
be a star witness in the Starr investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lewinsky might be on a carefully contrived mission to
damage her credibility. She might be deliberately going about the
business of making herself absolutely irrelevant in Starr's pursuit
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that Lewinsky continues to be madly in
love with Clinton and that she wants no part of implicating him in
a crime. If it is well-established that nobody can believe a word
she says, Monica might figure, perhaps Starr won't be able to use
her testimony against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewinsky is useless as a witness, of course, Starr might
decide to turn her into a defendant. Starr is apparently convinced
that Lewinsky lied under oath about her relationship with Clinton;
the independent counsel might be inclined to prosecute her on
grounds of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But would the public tolerate the prosecution of a youthful
ex-intern who was supposedly seduced by her boss, the president of
the United States? Starr might be seen as prosecuting a victim
while failing to hold the perpetrator accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's former lawyer, William Ginsburg, has always seemed to
believe that Starr would never do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ginsburg, by the way, who encouraged Monica to pose for
Vanity Fair. If the pictures destroyed Lewinsky's credibility, they
may have accomplished exactly what she and Ginsburg hoped they
would.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Don't eat the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a sentence to consider. You could either be having
dinner in Chinatown _ or talking to a dog.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Caroline Knapp, the author of the best-selling
memoir, ``Drinking: A Love Story'' (Dial Press, 1996), is
addressing Lucille, her 3-year-old German shepherd mix, who has
been systematically gutting a stuffed animal _ a lemming, to be
exact. Surrounded by piles of white fluff from its insides, she has
started on the outside, and the eyes are the first to go, followed
quickly by the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knapp remains calm in the face of annihilation. She has
written a new book, ``Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between
People and Dogs'' (Dial Press), a thoughtful, sensitive analysis of
the all-out love affair she unexpectedly found in her relationship
with Lucille and that other people, especially women, find with
their own dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knapp is certainly not unique. In ``Pack of Two,'' she cites
various studies on the subject, including one from the American
Animal Hospital Association in which 48 percent of female
respondents reported they relied more heavily on their pets than on
their partners or family members for affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of roles dogs fill can be hard to come by in human
relationships,'' Ms. Knapp said. ``We touch the dog or the pet at
whim. There is a lack of self-consciousness and a fluidity to it
that is absent from most human relationships. If someone acted that
way to you, you'd feel claustrophobic pretty quickly. It's a
boundary violation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Pack of Two'' came to Ms. Knapp, 38, shortly
after she found Lucille at a shelter, during a period she calls
``the aftermath of enormous upheaval.'' After 20 years of drinking,
during which time she graduated from Brown University and worked as
the life-style editor for The Boston Phoenix (where she still
writes a column) she entered a rehabilitation program and
celebrated 18 months of sobriety on the day she brought the dog
home. Toward the end of her drinking, both her parents died; her
father of a brain tumor in 1992, her mother, one year and 11 days
later, of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ms. Knapp was also ending a long-term relationship
with her boyfriend, and left her editing job at The Phoenix to
write her first book. ``I was really adrift, and on top of that I
had a sense of decimated family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which meant she was ripe for the unwavering loyalty and
affection of a dog. Though her family had dogs while she was
growing up, she had never had one of her own. She began pondering
life with man's best friend, but what she quickly discovered after
Lucille joined her was that the rest of the world perceived her
best friend to be a substitute for either a baby or a husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see a guy with his German shepherd and say he really
wants a baby,'' Ms. Knapp said, sipping her coffee and smoking one
of many cigarettes. ``People suspect there's some sort of twisted
sublimation going on. You somehow just don't measure up if you are
deeply attached to an animal instead of a husband or child. I think
there must be some sense of an animal as just a lesser being and
therefore the feelings should be less. `It's  &UR; just &LR;  a dog,' people
say.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked down at Lucille, who returned her gaze adoringly.
Lucille is a sweet dog, good natured and obedient, who has been
trained to stay in the living room of Ms. Knapp's half of a
two-family house whenever her owner goes into the kitchen. No
matter what the dog is doing _ ripping apart the lemming,
stretching or sighing _ the minute Ms. Knapp disappears from view,
Lucille stops, her ears go up, she looks toward the kitchen and
waits, vigilant, to find out what happens next. Only when Ms. Knapp
returns does she pick up where she left off.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decimated lemming was removed, Lucille heaved a sigh
and lay down on her L.L. Bean bed. All she had left was a chew toy
that was not nearly as exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a big sigh,'' Ms. Knapp said fondly, leaning over to
stroke Lucille's head as she fell asleep. ``She has to be the
center of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Lucille was out of the conversational loop, Ms. Knapp no
longer seemed as sure of what to say. She is a soft-spoken woman
with a pronounced sense of stillness about her. Her home is
comfortable yet spare, with its bare pine floors, big chairs and
exposed brick columns. The only dashes of humor come from dogs: a
Buddha dog sculpture and German shepherd angel Christmas ornaments
on the kitchen table, a towel that says ``Lucille,'' decorated with
paw prints.
</P>
<P>
   When she does speak, Ms. Knapp chooses her words deliberately
and tends to ask ``Does that make sense?'' at the end of her
sentences. That unnecessary question seems to underscore the
tentativeness she feels about the world around her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like her owner, Lucille is rather reserved. She echoes Ms.
Knapp's stillness almost eerily, holding back her more doglike
moments for the three walks the duo take each day. Yes, three.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a lucky girl, she has a compulsive owner,'' Ms. Knapp
said, smiling. ``But we have a nice working routine. It provides
the structured breaks for me in my work. Without her, the only
thing I might ever say is `Large coffee with milk, please,' and
that might be it for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In her relationship with Lucille, Ms. Knapp says, she has
discovered that two unexpected needs of her own have been filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I gave her the childhood I never got, the
attention,'' she said. ``I came from an undemonstrative family. We
were loving in our ways, but we were not a very tactile group and I
find it deeply satisfying to be so. Dogs have such short life
spans, it's like a concentrated version of a human life. When they
get older they become much more like our mothers. They wait for us,
watch out for us, are completely fascinated by everything we do.
So, with her, she's the kid I never got to be and the mother I
never quite had. It's really quite remarkable how much they can
provide without any prompting. It's just built into the species.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Dickinson, Ms. Knapp notes in ``Pack of Two,'' wrote a
letter to a friend in 1862 in which she said of dogs, hers in
particular, ``They are better than human beings because they know
but do not tell.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Ms. Knapp think Lucille knows about her?
</P>
<P>
   ``That she's the one with the biscuits,'' she said without
hesitation. ``Dogs are so immediate. I think she has a good grasp
of my moods, moment to moment. She's good at reading anger,
happiness, sadness and anxiety. I don't know how much further than
that it goes. It's the immediacy of the connection that's paramount
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is paramount for Ms. Knapp? She lit another cigarette.
``I would like a degree of serenity and emotional freedom that
still eludes me somewhat. I am a fairly intense, which is a
euphemism for compulsive and rigid, person. It would be nice to
feel a little easier in the world. It's been six years since my
father died, five since my mother died, and there's a way in which
I'm still sort of reeling from it. I have been sober for almost
four and a half years, and it still feels like I'm reinventing my
life. Living alone, you're the architect of your life in a solitary
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And staying solitary remains her choice. Since ending her
relationship with her boyfriend, she has not started another. She
writes and lives here in this small house on a narrow road. Besides
walking Lucille, she sculls on the Charles River and attends
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up assuming I would get married and have children,''
she said. ``But years pass and you find yourself not doing it and
not doing it, and sometimes you begin to think you may be not doing
it for a reason. I have never felt that deep longing to be pregnant
that I hear other women describe. I melt at puppies, never at
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille started to wake from her nap. Ms. Knapp leaned over to
touch her. ``I guess I resent the idea that nurturing and loving
has to be in human form or childlike form,'' she said. ``It's just
dismissive to suggest it is an inferior set of feelings because
it's directed toward the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``I feel the defensiveness in my voice that this is
`okay' because the `not okay' message is so strong. We live in a
culture that doesn't deal with difficult feelings very well. And
when you're talking about what a solace the dog is in the midst of
painful feelings, people get uneasy. Does that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Once Lucille stretched, she joined Ms. Knapp in
giving her high-10s, touching her paws to Ms. Knapp's palms.
``Excellent,'' Ms. Knapp crooned. ``You're a good girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident called to mind something Ms. Knapp writes about in
her book: the moment at the end of the day when she and Lucille
come home and shut the door behind them. ``It's solitude without
the loneliness,'' Ms. Knapp said. ``I'm shy. I'm still a fearful
person. I've always walked around with the sense that the world is
not a safe place. I didn't get the spontaneous gene or the
adventure one, really. After going through the day with its
stresses, when I shut that door at night, I don't have to deal with
anything but dinner, `E.R.' and my bathrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked lovingly at Lucille, who presented herself to be
petted. ``I get the biggest charge out of ending the day with our
ritual of going up the stairs, and getting into bed,'' Ms. Knapp
said. ``I read, she has her head on my leg or my lap. And I'm in
dog heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Her smile was blissful. Lucille returned her gaze, panting
happily. She seemed to smile, too.

   Ya gotta love a cookbook that has a big beefy firefighter on the
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph T. Bonanno Jr.'s first recipe fest, ``The Healthy
Firehouse Cookbook,'' is a collection of low-fat recipes from
firehouses around the country. His new effort, ``The Firehouse
Grilling Cookbook'' (Broadway, $23), takes the cooking outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   A nice touch in this no-nonsense book is the safety chapter,
something too rarely seen in barbecue books. But Bonanno is not a
preacher, either with the safety business, or with his other
sideline, fitness. (Check out the biceps on the guy.)
</P>
<P>
   RED DEVIL CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   4-pound chicken, rinsed and patted dry
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed through a press
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Using a cleaver or heavy knife, cut down one side of the
backbone to cut the chicken in half. Cut down the other side and
discard the backbone. Place chicken on a work surface, skin side
up. Press hard on breastbone with the heel of your hand to flatten
the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, whisk together the wine, oil, lemon juice,
garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes and salt. Place chicken and
marinade in a zippered plastic bag. Close bag and refrigerate for
at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Build a charcoal fire in one side of an outdoor grill and let
burn until covered with white ash. Place a large disposable
aluminum foil pan on the empty side of the grill and fill halfway
with water. In a gas grill: Preheat on high. Turn one burner off,
and keep the other burner(s) on high. Place the foil pan on the off
burner and fill halfway with water.
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken from marinade. Lightly oil cooking grate. Place,
skin side down, over the pan. Weight the chicken with an aluminum
foil-wrapped brick. Cover and cook for 25 minutes. Remove brick and
turn chicken. Cover and continue cooking (without the brick) until
chicken shows no sign of pink when pierced at the thigh bone, about
25 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Using a cleaver or heavy knife, chop chicken into quarters and
serve hot.

   WINE-SMOKED SALMON FILLETS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   2 cups oak, alder or hickory wood chips
</P>
<P>
   3 cups inexpensive, but tasty, dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup grainy ``country-style'' French mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
</P>
<P>
   Four 7-ounce salmon fillets, with skin
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   In medium bowl, soak hickory chips in the wine for at least 30
minutes. Drain chips, reserving wine. Set chips and wine aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, using 2 1/2 pounds of briquettes, build a charcoal
fire on one side of an outdoor grill. Let the fire burn until
medium-hot _ you should be able to hold your hand at grate level to
a count of three _ and the coals are covered with white ash. Place
an empty aluminum foil pan on the empty side of the grill. Pour
wine into the pan. Sprinkle a handful of chips over the coals and
cover.
</P>
<P>
   In a gas grill: Preheat on high. Turn one burner off and the
other burners to medium. Place an empty aluminum foil pan over the
off burner. Pour wine into the pan. Place drained chips in a metal
chip box. Or, wrap the drained chips in aluminum foil, pierce a few
holes in foil and place foil packet on the heat source. Cover and
allow a few minutes for the chips to build up a head of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, mix the mustard, brown sugar and dill,
dissolving the sugar. Brush the salmon skin with the oil. Spread
mustard mixture on the flesh side of the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil the cooking grate. Place the fish fillets, skin side
down, over the pan. Cover and smoke until salmon looks opaque when
prodded in the center with the tip of a knife, 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a wide spatula, transfer the fillets to dinner plates. If
the salmon skin sticks to the grate, slide the spatula between the
skin and flesh and lift off the salmon, leaving the skin on the
grill. Serve immediately.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, I just entered my sightings from my last trip, and Avisys
says I hit 100 birds for the year from the train,'' Mike Savage
recently announced to members of his online bird-watching
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stopped at a red signal along the Great Salt Lake,''
continued Savage, a train engineer in the West for Union Pacific
who spots birds from the cabs of the 400,000-pound, yellow-and-gray
locomotives he drives. ``I raised my binos to scan the shore, where
I had willet, lesser yellowlegs and greater yellowlegs (No. 99)
together in one view. The greater was a new train bird for me and
was quickly followed by No. 100, a black-bellied plover, also a new
train bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Train birds? For the uninitiated, bird-watchers (or ``birders''
as the serious ones call themselves) tend to be compulsive
list-keepers. They keep lists of bird species seen in places like
their yards, counties, states. They keep trip lists, seasonal
lists, annual lists and life lists, which are all the birds seen in
one's lifetime. And Savage keeps what has to be the most unusual
list of all.
</P>
<P>
   As a bird-watcher in the 1990s, he also keeps his birding lists
on a Hewlett-Packard palmtop computer loaded with Avisys software,
which was written for birders by a birder. Other bird-watchers
frequently use other aids, like a global positioning system device
to help them know where they are _ not to mention such
sophisticated devices as a high-end Sony cassette tape deck with a
parabolic microphone for recording and playing back songs to lure
recalcitrant birds out of vegetation and into the open.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when a life list was kept with penciled check marks
next to columns of bird names arranged in taxonomic order _ loons
first, sparrows last _ in the front of a field guide by Roger Tory
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   There were pocket checklists on folded cardboard, not pocket
computers, for recording the species seen on special trips to
national parks or wildlife refuges. And notes about observations in
the field were kept in a notebook of the paper-carrying variety,
not one with an Intel chip aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when binoculars were the only hardware a birder
carried. They were bulky, heavy and costly field glasses, often
military surplus. If you were in a group birding from the edge of a
marsh, someone probably had a spotting scope that provided a fuzzy
view of ducks in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Times certainly have changed in the world of bird-watching, a
pursuit that red-blooded outdoorsmen once derided as a hobby for
little old ladies in tennis shoes. One company alone, Bushnell,
markets more than 80 models of binoculars in a wide price range,
while Carl Zeiss offers a technological breakthrough: a 20-power
spotting scope that weighs only 42 ounces and can be held and
focused with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   The scope's optical components are mounted on a mechanical
suspension system that eliminates a shaky image from hand movement
(although the suggested price tag, $2,995, might cause a quiver or
two). There is also a large choice of night vision binoculars and
scopes for watching the nocturnal activities of whippoorwills and
owls.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a start. ``There's a real need for birding
Sherpas,'' Dr. Arie Gilbert said as he hefted an enormous duffle
bag into the back of a friend's mini-van one day not long ago for a
morning of birding along the Housatonic River near Kent, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, a New York chiropractor and hard-core birder since his
high school days, totes a load of equipment: Leica 10x42
rubber-armored binoculars, among the ne plus ultra of birding
optics; a Minolta 35-millimeter autofocus camera with a 500-mm
telephoto lens for documenting unusual sightings; a Kowa zoom
spotting scope and a heavy Bogen tripod to support it; a Sony tape
deck with parabolic microphone, and often a laptop computer with a
Global Positioning System receiver and DeLorme's Street Atlas
program for navigating to and around unfamiliar areas. Oh, and yes,
somewhere in the bag there's a Peterson field guide.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-tech birder is Savage, 42, a Union Pacific engineer
from West Jordan, Utah, who hauls a hundred or more freight cars on
a 264-mile run between Salt Lake City and Elko, Nev. The tracks
cross the Great Salt Lake Desert, climb the Pequop Mountains and
descend into the Humboldt River Valley _ a spectacular range of
wildlife habitats where the train passes through just two towns and
there are very few cars for the driver to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   So Savage never leaves for work without binoculars and his
computer. ``It's a good thing I don't have to steer,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Other birders carry handheld GPS receivers like Garmin's GPS
III, which is marketed for hikers. They track unmarked trails and
update printouts from Toposcout CD-ROMs that contain all of the
United States Geological Survey topographic maps for their
particular state.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop computers plugged into their car-lighter sockets are
likely to be loaded with an audio CD with the vocalizations of
nearly every North American bird species, along with a program
called Avisys Song that enables a fast comparison of similar songs
by very different birds, like the worm-eating warbler and the
chipping sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   What Gilbert didn't bring along was a cellular phone, which Ann
Johnson, vice president of the Iowa Ornithologists' Union and Web
master of the Iowa Birding site on the Internet, considers
essential for live updates to and from friends as she runs around
the countryside near Des Moines on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson, a management analyst for the Iowa Department of
Human Services, picked up the bird-watching bug from a genuine
little old lady in tennis shoes, her grandmother. ``I attribute my
real start to the day when I was 7 and told Granny there was a
parrot on the corncrib,'' she said. ``That bird, a pileated
woodpecker, holds the place of honor on my life list.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phones also let birders quickly report sightings to any
of the dozens of Rare Bird Alert telephone hot lines around the
country, including several in the New York metropolitan area. These
bird-alert reports are also available on the Internet, but they are
usually updated on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly fanatical, the Houston Audubon Society offers a
subscription reporting service on rare birds in the United States
and Canada. In addition to Internet access to sightings and
directions, it offers a ``We Call You'' service; birders who need
certain species for their North American lists get a call if one of
them _ or a bird completely new to the continent _ is reported.
</P>
<P>
   There are quite a few takers. A study on the economic impact of
wildlife watching, released this month by the Federal Fish and
Wildlife Service, said 17.7 million Americans took bird-watching
trips in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A subset of those binocular-wielding millions are the men and
women who aspire to the exclusive 700 Club and 800 Club, limited to
birders who have seen more than 700 or 800 of the 914 bird species
north of the Mexican border. They keep bags packed for sudden trips
to places like Cape May, N.J., where a brown-chested martin, a
South American swallow, turned up last December.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, birders in dire need of ``twitches,'' sightings of
rare species, may rely on pagers for breaking news. ``A typical
twitcher will be searching around when a message like `great auk on
Outer Hebrides' comes on,'' said John Farrar, a British trade union
official in South Yorkshire. ``The twitcher will drop everything,
apart from his or her scope and credit card, and charge off
north.'' Of course, the great auk, a giant penguinlike ocean bird,
was last seen in 1844. But that's the general idea.
</P>
<P>
   Like his American counterparts, Farrar carries a handheld
computer to record sightings on Avisys, a Windows database system
devised by Jerry Blinn, who was a programmer turned manager before
he retired from International Business Machines and wrote Avisys.
</P>
<P>
   Blinn, definitely a serious birder, markets the software and its
companion, Avisys Song, through his company, Perceptive Systems in
Silverdale, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birders have an insatiable appetite for data on what they've
seen, where they saw it and why,'' Blinn said. ``They want a
program where they record the habitat, the weather, the bird's
behavior, even unbelievable stuff like cloacal swelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many birders' databases can be viewed on personal pages on the
Web. That's a new way to brag about one's life list _ but the sites
are also a useful place to find information if you need to know the
arrival dates of spring migrants, for instance, in a particular
area.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Internet, there is enough information about birds to
keep a watcher indoors for a month, including the huge Breeding
Bird Survey database at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in
Maryland. Other pages offer mnemonics to help birders remember
songs and calls, like ``look-up, over-here, see-me, up-here'' for
the red-eyed vireo; sound files for 51 Brazilian birds, and the
insane song of the laughing kookaburra, an Australian kingfisher.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Web, through satellite tracking, it is possible
to follow a Laysan albatross' 90-day, 25,000-mile round trip over
the North Pacific to find food for its chick. Web cameras focus on
nesting peregrine falcons in Seattle, white storks in Germany and
tree swallows at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In partnership with the National Audubon Society, the Lab (as
birders know it) offers nonscientists the opportunity to ``bird
with a purpose'' by participating in online projects like Warbler
Watch. The Web page of the Gay Birders Club in England ``enables
contact between gay and lesbian bird-watchers worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   And if your e-mail box isn't full, you can subscribe to any of
some 60 specialized mailing lists on subjects like seabirds,
cavity-nesting birds, hummingbirds or Turkey's birds. The Web
supersite that has Internet links galore is (what else?) called
Birding (birding.miningco.com).
</P>
<P>
   Or you can grab a beat-up Peterson guide and binoculars worn to
the bare metal by years of heavy use, leave all the high-tech
gizmos at home and go on what Gilbert calls ``a treasure hunt,''
watching the activities of the most common birds, like the American
robin, for half an hour without worrying about peer pressure to run
up the day's score. Gilbert said, ``That's the fun part of
birding.''

<P>
   All I want is a beach boy to fan me. Oh, OK, he could spoon-feed
me, as well. This year's heat has been so debilitating that it saps
any energy you might want to expend in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait. Here are two very cooling recipes that require no
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The first was sent in by Tweazer Shewmake. ``My wonderful
mother-in-law, Vivian Elder, gave me a recipe for frozen passion
that sounds like the pineapple sherbet Karen Davis requested.''
</P>
<P>
   FROZEN PASSION
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1/2 gallon
</P>
<P>
   15-ounce can Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce can crushed pineapple (with juice)
</P>
<P>
   2-liter bottle cream soda (all of which won't be used)
</P>
<P>
   Mix milk and fruit together, pour into freezing container, then
stir in the cream soda to fill container to proper level for
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Other fruits and flavors of soda can be substituted, such
as raspberries (frozen are fine) and raspberry soda.

<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   In food processor, place all of the ingredients (except the
olive oil) and blend them. With food processor still running,
slowly dribble in the oil.

   Now here's one that's a reach. Lou Ann Morey, Burleson, has lost
a recipe devoured by a new family member _ a puppy named Sugar.
It's Dinah Shore's recipe for cioppino, that wonderful San
Francisco fish stew. Lou Ann says it's great for entertaining
because it can be made ahead and needs only mounds of sliced,
buttered sourdough bread to make a meal.

   CIR-WINDOWS98 (Undated) _ What a difference three years make!
When Windows 95 finally made its way out the door, Microsoft Corp.
promoted it to the cheeky beat of the Rolling Stones' ``Start Me
Up.'' Windows 98? Dullsville. Thursday's official release flaunts
the bland slogan, ``Works Better, Plays Better.'' The CD? It comes
with a Microsoft commercial appropriately set to a pop adaptation
of a theme from Beethoven's Piano Sonata (Op. 13), the
``Pathetique.'' For all its failings, Windows 95 was in many ways,
big and small, a significant improvement over its predecessor,
Windows 3.1, particularly in its ability to run multiple programs
at once. But when it arrived, one reviewer (this one) described it
as ``an edifice built of baling wire, chewing gum and prayer.''

of Los Angeles' Skid Row is a jewel. At the back of an asphalt
parking lot, in a wall decorated with dancing colored letters, a
door gives a view into a charming urban courtyard. A cheerful
ceramic fountain surrounded by ripening orange trees is covered in
hand-painted hearts, fruits, flowers and birds. Youngsters are
cleaning their paintbrushes under the spray. A circle of six year
olds sits inside the building, absorbed in painting self-portraits.

LITERARY SITES OFFER MORE THAN WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (jt)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away,'' Emily
Dickinson wrote. Of course, she died in 1886, decades before anyone
conceived of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sympathizes with Dickinson and has access to the Web
should set aside a hefty block of time and hie to a site called
Literary Locales. It is listed on a page maintained by the English
department at San Jose State University
 &UR; (www.sjsu.edu/depts/english) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   With a click, you can visit 122 places that figure in the lives
or the works of nearly as many writers (some have more than one
site). There are, of course, links to Shakespeare and the Globe
Theater, Proust's Combray, the West Yorkshire hills that the
Brontes called home, Dickens' Kent and many more places that
undeniably figure in the literary canon. There are also links to
such lesser-known authors as Flannery O'Connor, Anais Nin, Raymond
Chandler and Langston Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   With so many options, it was hard to choose where to go first.
That decision grew harder, not easier, because each site turned out
to be totally different from the others, which only heightened the
sense of exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer's Canterbury seemed intriguing _ and it was. Up popped a
map of the town today, with several roads highlighted in yellow.
You decide where you want to go, what you want to look at, from a
fish-and-chips shop to the Norman castle. After this introduction,
look above the map and click on the box marked ``Canterbury Web.''
Find and click on ``Canterbury Tales,'' then on ``The Chaucer
Pages.'' The scene-setting music you hear is ``Bring a Torch,
Jeannette Isabella,'' and you can now choose among quotes from
Chaucer, a list of his works, a biography, essays on him and
additional sources and books.
</P>
<P>
   But tarry on this page a little longer: at the bottom is a link
to the ``Anthology of Middle English Literature,'' which takes you
to similar offerings on Sir Gawain, Everyman and other medieval
plays and lyrics, each with an early music accompaniment (``Sumer
Is Icumen In'' for Gawain).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Canterbury Web'' page has many more options, including a
list of local hotels, restaurants and other tourist information for
those who want to make a real visit (which turned out to be not
untypical for these sites).
</P>
<P>
   For a total change of mood and sound, go back to the main list
and try ``Edgar Allen Poe's Favorite Haunts,'' which lists links to
Poe's cottage in the Bronx, his house in Baltimore and his national
historic site in Philadelphia. The best is the Poe museum in
Richmond, where your arrival is met with crashing thunder. You can
tour the museum's rooms, and you can access (under ``A Poe
Pourri'') samples of his works, a biography and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Poe enthusiasts will then want to move to ``Poe's Virtual
Library'' back on the main page, which lists links to
bibliographies, biographies, clothing, courses, movies, comics,
plays, family ties and you-name-it about Poe.
</P>
<P>
   A.A. Milne has two sites. ``Cotchford Farm'' in East Sussex,
where Milne vacationed and which he used as a setting for
``Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ``The House at Pooh Corner,'' offers
background and a nice picture of Poohsticks Bridge, but its real
value is as a link to other Pooh sites. Back on the Literary
Locales menu, the site called ``A.A. Milne's Ashdown Forest''
covers that ground and more, with more pictures of the bridge, the
surrounding area and scenes from the books, like Roo's sandpit.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for something more exotic: Palermo, Argentina, known
here as ``Jorge Luis Borges' Childhood Home.'' Almost a homage,
this site begins with a gallery of photographs of Borges. Then it
moves on to a serious examination of him, with a biography, a
compendium of critics' views of his works, an outline of his
influence on other authors and a collection of quotations,
including ``I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of
library.'' This site, by the way, also has a section in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   And so to the Middle East. For many people, Naguib Mahfouz _ his
Nobel Prize notwithstanding _ does require an introduction.
``Naguib Mahfouz's Cairo'' provides one, Cliff Notes-style: a
biography, an analysis of his development as a novelist, the
beginning and ending passages of ``Palace of Desire'' and ``Adrift
on the Nile,'' a few one-liners lifted from reviews and an
anthology of his works, with brief synopses of 8 of his more than
30 novels.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, there is ``Yukio Mishima's Home,'' a
Victorian house in Tokyo that requires only a brief stop. Click on
his name to call up an illustrated page giving a little summary of
his life and listing the works of Mishima, thought by some to be
one of Japan's postwar literary stars. Mishima committed suicide in
1970 and will soon be honored with a museum near Mount Fuji;
construction is to begin in the fall. For a preview, click on
``Mishima Cyber Museum.'' One listing, the history of his life, is
available only in Japanese, but others are in English.
</P>
<P>
   If you click on Proust's Combray, you will land in the village
in central France once called Illiers, but renamed Illiers-Combray
after Proust used it as the setting for the vacation home in
``Remembrance of Things Past.'' The page offers a description and a
few pictures, but scroll to the bottom for the best part: icons
depicting Proust himself. Click and you are in the realm of a
newsletter called ``Proust Said That,'' in which you will find that
Proust ``ate little, surviving on a diet of cafe au lait toward the
end of his life, and that, when he was 13, in response to a party
question `Who would you have liked to be?' he answered, `Since the
question does not arise, I prefer not to answer it. All the same, I
should very much have liked to be Pliny the Younger.''' There's
more, of course, including a recipe for bouillabaisse.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the sites offer more in the way of scene setting than
they do about an author. ``Langston Hughes' Lawrence,'' for
example, provides the basics of his life, illustrated by
photographs of his home and schools in Lawrence, Kan. But the site,
including links, tells more about local history and about Kansas
than about Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Others are simple and simply literary. ``Dylan Thomas' Fern
Hill'' provides just the text of that poem, pictures of the Welsh
farmhouse in question and a nearby creek, and a brief recounting of
a local tale about the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Tours are popular. ``D.H. Lawrence's Eastwood,'' which follows
the blue-line trail through Nottinghamshire, past homes he lived
in, is typical.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites proved disappointing. ``Bronte Country'' seemed all
too commercial, designed to lure tourists and sell merchandise more
than to slake the thirst of devoted readers. And ``Samuel Beckett's
Fermanagh'' is a link to the official site of the Northern Ireland
Tourist Board, which doesn't even mention Beckett. Likewise for
``James Herriot's Yorkshire,'' which gets you to the Yorkshire
Tourist Board.
</P>
<P>
   Only trial and error will tell you which Literary Locale is
evocative and which is perfunctory, which site to bookmark and
which to dismiss.

 TRANSFER OF LPs TO CDs CAN BE A LABOR AS LOVE

 (af)  
 By CHARLES BERMANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Rosenquist of Saratoga, Calif., has unusual musical tastes,
ranging from Maori sounds from New Zealand to the more obscure John
Philip Sousa tunes, but many are unavailable on compact disks. So
rather than listen to his old LP records, he is developing his own
series of custom disks.
</P>
<P>
   It took a CD-rewritable drive, custom software and much
patience. ``I was amazed at what I could do,'' he said. ``I was
able to put several old custom-made records on CD and enjoy them
for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   A day's drive north, in Silverton, Ore., a music collector, Gus
Frederick, is seeking to transfer portions of approximately 7,000
old 78-rpm jazz records to CDs. ``I really like this music,'' he
said. ``And it is extremely unlikely that any of it will ever be
reissued on CD.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology for recording CDs is another step toward allowing
people to have the music they want, when and where they want it.
For instance, when Beatles albums were released on CDs, they
followed the British song sequences, which confused many American
listeners. As a result, the only way to enjoy a CD copy of
``Yesterday and Today'' or ``Beatles '65'' is to make it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The gear is available. The drives cost as little as $300 each
and are starting to appear in some personal computers as standard
equipment. External drives are compatible with either PCs or Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Software like Adaptec's Easy CD Creator Deluxe (www.adaptec.com)
or CeQuadrat's Just Audio (www.cequadrat.com) allows users to
record from a variety of sources and create a custom CD. Users can
also develop their own sequences, eliminate surface noise and even
design custom labels or jewel box inserts.
</P>
<P>
   A homemade CD sounds better and lasts longer than the average
homemade tape, but a CD is harder to make. A tape can be easily
started, stopped, rewound and reused, while the CD recording and
noise reduction process for an album can take several hours. The
user may need to spend three or four times as much time as the
length of the music being recorded to make a successful CD. And
that does not take into account planning and learning time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something for your average weekend PC user,'' said
Frederick, who works as an instructional specialist and Web
designer for the Oregon Public Education Network, which provides
Internet resources to state schools. ``People have the conception
that it is like a cassette deck, but it's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the process takes so long, you wouldn't want to tackle a
large record collection. Even if one could spend the hours it took
to complete a disk each day, it could still take more than three
years to convert a collection of 1,000 LP records to CDs (one CD
can contain several albums).
</P>
<P>
   Creating your own CDs can also cross a legal line. Certain
Pioneer and Philips drives designed for recording music comply with
the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 because they are not able to
make a copy of a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The drive manufacturers also pay a royalty to music publishers.
But drives that are predominantly designed for data storage on CDs
do not have this restriction (and do not pay the royalty). So the
duplication of copyrighted music on such drives is technically
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the record companies have never gone after consumers,''
said Cory Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry
Association of America, ``and it is unlikely that they will in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Another use for this process is the personal adaptation of rare
recordings. For instance, one music enthusiast in the Minneapolis
area, Paul Packard, has several recordings by a local band called
Chameleon, which featured Yanni, then unknown. And Frederick
converted a one-shot record of comedian Stan Freberg made in 1959
in honor of the Oregon Centennial. (It was played in his household
when he was growing up, so Frederick made a CD of the rare
recording and presented it to his mother as a gift.)
</P>
<P>
   If either Packard or Frederick sold these rare disks, they would
owe Yanni and Freberg a percentage. But as long as a disk is
intended for home use, it seems unlikely that any artist would deny
a fan the privilege to enjoy rare music or comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Recording CDs takes a state-of-the-art computer, as it requires
a hefty hard disk and a large chunk of RAM, so you can't press an
old, power-anemic PC that was sitting around unused into service
and install it next to the tape deck and CD player.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, an external recordable drive is attached to the
computer, while a sound source _ turntable or tape _ plugs directly
into the computer's sound card. (The best way to copy music from an
existing CD is to use the installed CD-ROM drive for playback.)
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the stereo amplifier is not as important as the
quality of the installed sound card, Packard said. He recommends
that anyone who wants to make good recordings upgrade to a 64-bit
sound card, which generally costs less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who want a custom CD and can't buy or install all that
troublesome gear can order from services such as Custom Revolutions
(www.customdisc.com). You can create a custom sequence of available
songs and don't need to worry about copyright, but the selection is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The average PC user would probably be happy with Packard's
machine: a 200-megahertz Pentium equipped with 32 megabytes of RAM,
but he uses words like ``slow'' and ``taxed to the nth degree''
when describing its performance when he is making a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick makes do with a 110-megahertz processor, but he has
added a 2-gigabyte hard drive dedicated to the recording (in the
processing phase, each minute of sound requires 11 megabytes of
temporary storage). He emphasizes the importance of regular disk
optimization for the process to work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   (During regular use, data from the same file may be scattered
throughout the disk. So disk optimization, part of the Windows
system, rearranges the data contiguously, allowing the computer to
find the information faster.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You are dealing with some massive files here,'' Frederick
said. ``So it's very important that they are not fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Tape is still more convenient, but recording a CD is becoming
easier to do. The newer software allows real-time correction of
surface noise, eliminating the lengthy clean-up process, which can
tie up your machine for hours. Manufacturers say that users can
operate other applications while a recording is being cleaned up,
but Packard disagrees. ``If it crashes, you need to start all over
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are unexpected pitfalls in recording CDs at home. You
may inspect what was once a grand LP collection only to find items
that you were once unwilling to sell at garage-sale prices but
haven't really missed.
</P>
<P>
   The albums left standing may include some work by obscure
artists who have yet to make it to CD (e.g., T-Bone Burnett and
Charlie Dore), custom records by friends or relatives (Tru Fax and
the Insaniacs or Coco and the Lonesome Road Band) and some bootlegs
(for shame!) or autographed items. You don't want to throw them
away but don't want to listen to them with any frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fact that a full album from the pre-CD days may still
have some standout tracks but that those in between _ which you
learned to like because you were too lazy to get up and skip ahead
_ sound impossibly dated. It then seems like a good idea to sample
one or two choice cuts from each relic for an archival disk, in a
``Best of the Rest'' sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that you can change the running order and print
cool labels. But the result will still hardly become part of your
primary playlist. It becomes akin to a novelty anthology, to be
listened to occasionally. The result might be the same if the
records were left in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the danger that once you get around to converting
various oddities to CD, some other media platform will emerge down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``No technology will last forever,'' Rosenquist said. ``But CDs
provide archival capability in a convenient package. You can't
guarantee that it will always be around, but if something better
comes along, then we'll have the opportunity to transfer it to the
new medium.''

OPENING AN E-MAIL TIME CAPSULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last July 1, Peter Crabb, a psychology professor at Pennsylvania
State University at Abington, Pa., announced that he would turn off
his e-mail for the foreseeable future. His department had switched
to a Web-based system, and he had no interest in following. ``I
don't do the Web,'' he said archly. ``It's against my religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, out of curiosity, he read through the 200 e-mail
messages his server had saved since September.
</P>
<P>
   The techno time capsule yielded ``mostly junk,'' he said, as
well as a missed opportunity for a $2,000 consulting job. But there
was no irreparable damage to his professional or social life.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking his messages down into categories, he found that 44
percent were from an electronic mailing list that someone had put
him on, that 26 percent were from college administrators and that
20 percent were from colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The rest included four requests from students and four requests
from reporters for interviews, the latter causing him some regret.
He learned of one administrative mix-up that would have made him
furious at the time, but that message was sent in October.
</P>
<P>
   Crabb loved e-mail until a year or so ago, when he started to
see it as a form of control by administrators. ``It's a great tool
for telling people what to do and for monitoring people's work
behavior,'' he said.

<P>
   Now he is going back on line, at his department's request _ a
prospect sweetened slightly by the new $3,000 laptop he was issued.
But Crabb still isn't happy about the prospect of spending time on
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sit in front of a computer more,'' he said.
``I want to do that less.''

HARING SITE BLENDS THE SERIOUS AND THE QUIRKY

<P>
   Even those who are not familiar with the late artist Keith
Haring may get a kick out mf a Web site dedigated to his work.
</P>
<P>
   Landing upon www.haring.com can leave a visitor as gleeful as a
child racing down a slide or as thoughtful as an adult
contemplating$the AIDS slogan ``Silence (equal) Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Haring-drawn pyramid Art icon to find Exhibits and
Activities and relish Haring's range as an artist, from the somber
AIDS posters in Activism to the innocent Flipbooks.
</P>
<P>
   There, two Men With Holes, one red and one aquamarine, begin an
</P>
<P>
   animated routine. They move up and down. Aquamarine sticks a hand
through the large hole in red's chest; then red pokes a leg through
aquamarine; next, both cartwheel through each other, and finally
there's a twirl.
</P>
<P>
   Internet novices may be attracted to the splashy, colorful
presentation of Haring's widely recognized art icons, like crawling
babies, barking dogs and break dancers. And Web aficionados may
find the use of three-dimensional spaces and characters that
``morph'' into different figures compelling.
</P>
<P>
   In Haring World, visitors are taken to Haring Garden, a
three-dimensional landscape of shadowy green grass and blue skies
that never end. In this world, you control the movements of a
Haring figure, who, at the mouse's urging, flies through the
garden. Ahead are Haring sculptures and if you move the man just
right he will climb up on some of the appendages and fly off the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Haring, who died of AIDS in 1990, was an internationally
acclaimed artist who was influenced by urban street culture and
children. Inspired by graffiti artists, Haring turned New York City
subway stations into his studio in the 1980s. He used white chalk
on the black paper in unused advertising spaces to draw hundreds of
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Haring was asked to do artwork on computers, said Julia Gruen,
executive director of the Keith Haring Foundation in Manhattan,
which owns the rights to his artwork and paid for the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so thrilling for him to think that his images could be
sent out over the airways,'' she said. ``He thought that would be
the most amazing thing. Were Keith alive today, we can assume he
would be very involved in current Internet developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kaiser, director of the Riverbed Group in Manhattan, which
created the Web site, said, ``The great blessing about Haring's
work is it adapts itself to almost any medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua M. Briggs, who works at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in
Manhattan, which has had Haring shows, agreed. ``It's pretty well
suited to be reproduced in any form, on T-shirts, on the
sidewalk,'' he said. ``It works well on screen, with clear, simple
images.''

ROSENBLATT PROFITS FROM TRAVAILS

<P>
   Lessons, like opportunities, can come from unexpected places in
life. But boxing is a difficult life, and the lessons most often
come at difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, though, nothing about boxing seemed difficult
for Dana Rosenblatt, the Malden middleweight who returns to the
ring Thursday night at Foxwoods against a tall, wily veteran named
Arthur Allen on the undercard of the Buster Douglas-Lou Savarese
pay-per-view show.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt had had 28 straight victories and a promotional deal
with Bob Arum that earned him escalating paydays of $25,000, then
$85,000, and finally $350,000 for a pay-per-view show against a
shopworn local hero named Vinny Pazienza whom Rosenblatt didn't
think much of.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the night he fought Pazienza went just as his career
had. It was a straight line toward the top as he pounded Pazienza
half-blind with his jab, doing terrible damage to an old warrior.
But the old warrior had learned lessons long ago that he was about
to teach young Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Pazienza had learned how dangeorus boxing is not from seeing
others in such danger but by being there himself and surviving.
Whether that is what led to what followed is hard to know, but
suddenly, Rosenblatt was down minutes before his moment of sure
victory, down from an unseen but crushing right hand to the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt lost bitterly just seconds later, with Pazienza
having to be pried off him while he lay trapped and in a fog along
the ropes. It was the kind of deep shock that has ended many young
fighters' careers, but Rosenblatt was stronger than that.
</P>
<P>
   He's had to be, because it has taken him nearly two years to get
up from that punch and what followed it.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt won a comeback fight for chump change against veteran
Glenwood Brown in which he broke his right hand with the third
punch he landed. After six months off, he came back to the gym
renewed and ready and stayed that way for all of five minutes
before he broke the hand again. When that bone snapped, Rosenblatt
didn't, but it was a struggle not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That totally let the wind out of my sails,'' Rosenblatt said.
``Forget about boxing? What about my life? It was dead stopped for
14 months. I didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got pretty depressed sitting around, getting fat. I didn't
know if I should go back to college or look for a job. I didn't
want to do any of that stuff. I wanted to fight, but after the
second injury, I started to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was all in my favor, and then it seemed like
everything was all against me and piling up. I was dumbfounded. How
could this possibly happen? That was the low, low point for me. It
was as low as I've ever been. I started to wonder, `Will I ever be
healthy?' Thoughts come into your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Rosenblatt remembered something he'd heard his
old rival say during one of their overheated press conferences
before Pazienza taught him about defeat. He remembered how the guy
had struggled to make weight so often but always seemed to and
struggled to come back from terrible losses and always seemed to
and struggled to come back from something worse after he broke his
neck in a car accident and was told he'd never fight again but
seemed to do even that.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered not what he found distasteful about Pazienza, who
is loud and brash. What he remembered was the day he heard him say,
``You're only a loser when you quit. And I don't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quoting a guy I wouldn't quote too often, but what he said
was so suitable for this sport,'' said Rosenblatt. ``He showed me a
philosophy that applies to this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting where you learn things sometimes. I have more
respect now for a guy like Vinny, who hit rock bottom and came
back, because now I know what it's like to come back in this game.
I know how humbling it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt has fought twice since his second hand injury,
winning in March and again in April against nonentities for short
money in bouts designed merely to get him comfortable. Allen is a
bit more difficult, although his lack of punching power gives
Rosenblatt the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rosenblatt (30-1, 22 KOs) agrees he has an advantage,
he does not see it as one based on his power. His edge is simply
that he has learned things that only pain and disappointment can
teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a much better fighter,'' Rosenblatt said. ``I'm 20 percent
better because all the time I was hurt, I kept going to the gym and
just working with my left hand. I'd been a one-handed fighter
before but I didn't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need a 14-month layoff, though. It was miserable. It
killed me to see a guy like Keith Holmes win and lose the
middleweight title while I was out. To see guys like Holmes and
(World Boxing Association champion William) Joppy, guys who were
well behind me, go by me hurt, because that should have been my
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But setbacks make you a more hardened, experienced person. I
know if I'd beaten Vinny and got the fight with Ray Leonard that
Bob was talking about and stopped him like (Hector) Camacho did,
I'd be a millionaire today, but I'm not in this game to make a
quick hit. It's my career. That's why I'm still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 26 and coming into my best fights and my physical prime
and I feel ready. I know now that some hardships should come to you
along the way. There was a time when everything was moving fast and
I started getting ahead of myself and my plan. The road to the top
seemed shorter than I thought. Then after what happened the last 14
months, the road seems like it's gotten longer just when I thought
it would get shorter. So I guess everything's probably about where
it should be, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night it will be for Rosenblatt because he'll be where
he should be. He'll be in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   A smarter guy in a fight.

FOR PILOT FANS, LOTS OF BELLS AND WHISTLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real life is starting to look a lot like science fiction. With
its flip top and handy size, the new Palm III personal organizer by
3Com/Palm Computing has been frequently likened to the flip-top
``communicator'' used on the original ``Star Trek'' television
show.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm III may look like a television prop on the outside, but
the adaptable little electronic organizer has lots of computing
muscle on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Pilots, the Palm Pilot and now the Palm III have won
the hearts of consumers, corporate folks and programmers since the
first one was introduced in 1996. More than a million of the
devices have been sold, and Palm Computing says more than 7,000
developers are working on applications for its palmtops.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these developers, the Palm Pilot can now function as a
loan calculator, a computerized chess game, a scrollable copy of
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' and a miniature movie viewer, all
rolled into one convenient shirt-pocket package.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these programs can be downloaded from Palm Pilot Web
sites (America Online even maintains a healthy amount of Pilot
programs in its software libraries (AOL keyword: PalmPilot), and
many are now sold on CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   If you have recently purchased a Palm III, chances are it came
with the Bonus Pack CD from Macmillan Digital Publishing USA that
Palm Computing is shipping with the new model
(www.macmillansoftware. com). Although the CD does not contain an
extensive amount of material _ much of it consists of ``lite''
versions of commercial programs _ it serves as a basic software
sampler.
</P>
<P>
   The disk might also help newcomers see how easy it is to load
third-party programs onto their Pilots. A financial calculator, a
traveler's almanac and an organizer that downloads favorite Web
pages from a personal computer to the Pilot are some of the
programs included on the Bonus CD.
</P>
<P>
   Several games are also included, perhaps as an incentive to
entice new owners to explore the CD. The rudimentary graphics are
far from 64-bit but the Bonus Pack's handheld arcade offers Sub
Hunt and Mine Hunt, proving that no video-game suite is complete
without a couple of contests featuring bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Macmillan Digital Publishing also offers the Business Plus Pack
for Palm Pilot. As the name implies, the applications included on
the CD, like money management and productivity programs, are aimed
specifically at business and financial professionals. It can be
found on the company's Web site or in software retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Web sites go, the one from Palm Computing (www.palm.
com) contains a wealth of information and links to other resources.
Featuring news about Pilot products, the site is also home to an
online catalog of accessories and software. You can also find
information on hardware, like an attachable modem or the add-in
card that turns the Pilot into a pager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a thousand programs written just for the
Palm Pilot, and a good sampling of them can be found on two
programs on CDs: Everything for Palm Pilot (www.pilotmall.com) and
Pilot Island's Goodies (www.pilotisland. com). The Web is a
bountiful provider as well, as one finds when entering The Pilot
Zone (www.pilotzone.com).
</P>
<P>
   Testing was done on a first-generation Pilot 5000 synced to a
Power Macintosh 7500 and a Palm III hooked up to a Compaq Deskpro
PC running Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Pilot's functions is its ability to Hot Sync _ when
the Pilot is put into a special ``cradle,'' a one-button operation
and a special cable and connector that hooks into the back of the
desktop machine makes it exchange information with a desktop
computer, so things like appointment schedules are up to date in
both places. Once the Pilot is hooked up to the desktop computer,
software can be uploaded from the desktop to the Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the Pilot's popularity is that it is one of the
only palmtops that is compatible with Macintosh computers as well
as PCs, although the software for the Macintosh has not had as many
functions as that available for the PC.
</P>
<P>
   A long-awaited upgrade to the Macintosh desktop software is due
in August, and Palm Computing reports that third-party developers
are already working on software that will allow Mac users to
realize the Pilot's potential for fax, e-mail and expense
reporting, plus Internet and office-network connectivity.
</P>
<P>
   A caveat: before going hog-wild at the software buffet, you
might want to make sure that vital data is backed up on a desktop.
With the copious amount of code out there, there is always the
chance of loading a program that has more bugs in it than the
rainforest, inadvertently crashing your Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Upon seeing what is out there for the Palm Pilot, the ``Star
Trek'' link doesn't seem to be solely one of physical resemblance.
Three of the four collections offered a program called Tricorder
written by Jeff Jetton. This nifty little application lets your
Pilot mimic a 1980s ``Star Trek'' tricorder, complete with graphics
and computerized burps, chirps and beeps.
</P>
<P>
   It is also available (along with several other pleasant Pilot
diversions) at Jetton's Web site at
www.mindspring.com/jetton/pilot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   EVERYTHING FOR PALMPILOT, VOLUME I &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ISO Productions; $14.95; Windows 95 and NT, and Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything'' is a serious boast in any context, but this
collection seems to come close. There are 763 applications listed
on the CD-ROM, with directions to a Web site for Pilot software
released after the disk was pressed (www.pilotmall.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Pilot programs in this collection are far-ranging and span
the usual array of graphics, financial and communications options.
There are a number of automotive-maintenance reminder programs,
several specialized clocks, calendars and calculators and an
application called Multimedia Player, by Daniel Springwald, that
lets you watch movies on the Pilot's tiny screen (although the
index notes that ``you probably won't be watching `The Godfather'
anytime soon'').
</P>
<P>
   For musicians, there are 13 applications in the Music/Sound
category. Fretboard, a free program written by Dave MacLeod,
displays the finger positions for chords on a range of stringed
instruments, like guitar, banjo, violin and mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   Fretboard will also beep the notes for you, but only people with
perfect pitch will probably be able to glean much from the tones
coming from the Pilot's speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The disk also contains digitized subway maps for New York,
Boston, Washington and London and tiny Pilot-ized versions of the
video-game relics Pong and Missile Command. The supporting software
needed for some of the more elaborate programs is usually included
on the disk.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of these applications can be found on the Web, the
creators have designed an excellent interactive index for efficient
browsing of the contents. The index file lets the user search for a
particular program or category of programs.
</P>
<P>
   It displays an information card for each application, with a
description, price, memory requirements and the name and e-mail
address of the programmer. The index is a good search tool, but it
could use a copy editor, as typos were found in several entries.
</P>
<P>
   The index also shows a screen shot (if available) of what a
particular program looks like on a simulated Pilot screen. There is
an Install button at the top of the Index window so you can mark a
program for loading onto your Pilot during the next Hot Sync
session.
</P>
<P>
   The on-screen experience with the Everything for Palm Pilot's
graphical database gives new meaning to the term ``window
shopping'' and brings to mind online catalog surfing (without tying
up the telephone line for hours).
</P>
<P>
   Many programs here are free, but many are shareware. So in
addition to the cost of the CD, you may have to shell out an
additional fee ($10 to $20 on average) if you like a program enough
to buy it from its creator. The disk also includes commercial demo
versions of some applications, plus other Pilot information and
resources.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much software readily available here that the
biggest problem is deciding what to load, and how much, onto your
trusty Pilot. Space, as they say, (italics)is(end italics) the
final frontier. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PILOT GOODIES, VOLUME 1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pilot Island Publishing; $34.95; Windows 95, 98 and NT.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of the Pilot Goodies CD-ROM is the Pilot Island
company's Breeze interface for the desktop computer. The interface
is far more intuitive than the native Palm Pilot installer program
and is a visually elegant way to select third-party applications to
install on your Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful graphics and sound make the Breeze interface playful.
The program categories on the main screen are represented by icons
floating on a tropical island. As you pass the cursor over an icon,
the sound of steel drums echoes, and clicking the icon calls up all
the programs in the category.
</P>
<P>
   A button bar, called the Breeze Command Center, leads you from
step to step in a few quick clicks, from choosing the programs to
doing a Hot Sync. You can see a list of the programs (and the total
file size) for everything you have chosen to upload.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeze also allows a user to put several programs into a
specific group that can be regularly loaded all at once _ like a
selection of different games and time-killer programs you can load
for whichever fidgety kid you're taking to the orthodontist this
week. Best of all, you can use the Breeze to install Pilot software
you find on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With such an easy way to choose and upload files, you will want
to look immediately for some programs to install. The Goodies disk
contains more than 300 pieces of shareware and freeware.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most popular programs in the Pilot universe show up
on the disk, including Launchpad, a small utility that lets you
separate the icons for your Pilot applications into tabbed layers
for easy access and organization.
</P>
<P>
   The applications run the gamut, from serious techie staples like
Web browsers and a tracker program to work with a GPS receiver to
more down-to-earth offerings, like something similar to an
Etch-A-Sketch game. There is a Hot Stuff area that holds some of
the most useful programs, including a Pilot defragmentation utility
(for standard maintenance) and a document file containing a list of
United States telephone area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The educational offerings on Goodies are particularly strong.
Budding scientists can load up the Periodic Table of the Elements,
a metric converter and a guide to patent law. Linguists can fare
well, too, as several shareware foreign-language dictionaries,
including French, Spanish, German and Japanese, are available.
</P>
<P>
   With the Caribbean-inspired theme of the Breeze interface, you
might get a craving for a few drinks with paper umbrellas. The
Pilot Island folks seem to have anticipated that _ they included a
file with plenty of shrimp recipes.

 By STEPHEN MANES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference three years make! When Windows 95 finally made
its way out the door, the Microsoft Corp. promoted it to the cheeky
beat of the Rolling Stones' ``Start Me Up.'' The CD-ROM came with
hip videos of Edie Brickell and Weezer.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98? Dullsville. Today's official release flaunts the
bland slogan, ``Works Better, Plays Better.'' The CD? It comes with
a Microsoft commercial appropriately set to a pop adaptation of a
theme from Beethoven's Piano Sonata (Op. 13), the ``Pathetique.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its failings, Windows 95 was in many ways, big and
small, a significant improvement over its predecessor, Windows 3.1,
particularly in its ability to run multiple programs at once. But
when it arrived, one reviewer (this one) described it as ``an
edifice built of baling wire, chewing gum and prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 adds duct tape, caulk and pesticide. Think of it as a
minimal renovation that spruces up the place a bit, plugs some
leaks, exterminates some bugs and adds some new plumbing. The wire,
gum and prayer remain.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a new machine, you will probably live in the
remodeled quarters. Corporate buyers will be able to get the older
version if they insist, but most computers will come with the 98
edition, and most customers will be happier with it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also offers the new version as an upgrade for older
machines. Is it worth $90 and the time it takes to install? In the
spirit of the maxim, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' switch
only if the upgrade offers something specific you need and only if
you have a machine that can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 demands an average of 195 megabytes (and as much as
295) for itself, and though it is supposed to run on machines with
486 processors and 16 megabytes of RAM, a Pentium with 32 megabytes
will be a much better fit.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, upgrading can be fairly straightforward. On
the fast machines I tested with the final version, the job took a
little more than a half-hour. After a few preliminary steps, like
deciding whether to save Windows 95 files for possible restoration
(a very good idea), everything proceeds automatically.
</P>
<P>
   But even when things go right, you must put up with
self-important, useless messages like ``Initializing your system's
registry database.'' And when things go wrong, you are faced with
stumpers: ``Setup detects that an earlier version of the Setupx.dll
or Netdi.dll file is in use.
</P>
<P>
   This may be because you have applications open on your
computer.'' (It wasn't.) ``If you want Setup to replace the
existing file and automatically restart your computer, click OK Or,
to keep your current version of Setupx.dll and Netdi.dll, click
Cancel to quit Setup, close any open applications and then run
Setup again.'' The latter choice kept producing the same message.
Picking OK got things moving and did no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 has version 4.01 of Internet Explorer and the
so-called Active Desktop built in. It seems a bit more stable than
the free version available for Windows 95, but at least that
version can be removed if you dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   The browser, which used to be removable, is now irrevocably
integrated into Windows 98, and that is part of what the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is all about.
</P>
<P>
   On new machines, the computer maker decides whether you see the
channel bar with Mickey Mouse and the Tasmanian Devil and whether
you start browsing files and folders the classic double-click way
or use the single-clicking made popular by the Web. Upgrades are
supposed to do their best to maintain the browser settings you
already have in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the installer can get too cute. On one machine, it caused
problems by installing the ``right'' software driver rather than
accepting the way I had ``fooled'' the system so I could get a more
flicker-free picture. It also installed a video driver that
rendered some of the video card's software useless.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out about some known incompatibilities in files
like ``hardware.txt'' that end up in the Windows directory of your
hard drive and explain problems with everything from device drivers
for removable hard disks to the Czech version of Excel.
Unfortunately, the files are readable only after you perform the
installation.
</P>
<P>
   On many machines, Windows 98 can reclaim wasted disk space,
perhaps its greatest benefit. Inherited from DOS, the so-called FAT
disk format used in older versions of Windows squanders space by
dividing big disks into what amount to pigeonholes as big as 32
kilobytes. If a file contains only a single character, the FAT
system wastes as many as 32,767 bytes to store it.
</P>
<P>
   A scheme called FAT32, which comes with Windows 98, can reduce
the pigeonholes to a mere 4 kilobytes each, wasting far less space.
But you may already have FAT32 on your Windows 95 machine,
particularly if you bought it at retail in the past year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   To check, open the My Computer icon from the desktop,
right-click the C: drive icon, choose Properties and look for a
description of the file system in the panel that appears. It may
not be there, but if it is and ``FAT32'' is, too, you have lost one
of the better reasons to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Though the FAT32 converter warned that it could take hours, it
took just seven minutes on the machine I tried, delivering some
scary but harmless error messages along the way and about 20
percent more space than I had before I installed Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   But once you convert, you cannot uninstall Windows 98 and
restore Windows 95. And on some portable machines, the conversion
may disable the hibernation feature that lets you shut the unit
down and resume where you left off.

   FAT32 can produce other surprises. Many computers today come
with a CD-ROM that, when all else is lost, can restore your hard
disk to its original state. Using one of these after a FAT32
conversion may not work without some serious tweaking with a
program called Fdisk, a DOS relic whose record-breaking
inscrutability has lasted since the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Macintoshes have been able to run more than one
monitor at once. Now Windows machines can, too, at least in
demonstrations, but the documentation in the manual and a file
called ``display.txt'' is inaccurate. Before you try hooking up
more than one monitor, equip yourself with a reservoir of patience,
a sturdy monitor stand and a money-back guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a very recent television card and a way to get a
signal into it, extra goodies are available. Web TV for Windows
lets you download an online programming guide, watch television
and, with a few rare programs, surround the picture with special
data, like golf course descriptions that go with the match.
</P>
<P>
   A separate program called Wavetop runs in the background and
downloads Web-like data from an unused portion of your local public
TV station's signal, complete with links to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements are welcome but hardly thrilling. The company
says it has slain more than 3,000 bugs, but there are clearly
plenty left. If you spend time running the system's Maintenance
Wizard, the programs you use most often may load faster, but you
may spend more time with the Wizard than you get back. Windows 98
can help computers start faster, but only if they are designed with
special Fast Boot capabilities that have not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Machines can be shut down faster, too, but the difference is
noticeable largely on networked units. A few Universal Serial Bus
devices can install themselves the moment you plug them in, and new
types of peripherals, like U.S.B. speakers, will be usable only
with Windows 98 machines.
</P>
<P>
   Performance enhancements in areas like memory management,
Internet connectivity and DVD playback are useful, as are attempts
at making terrible crashes less likely. But a lot of effort has
also been expended on troubleshooting tools, suggesting that
trouble goes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   A feature called Windows Update can analyze your system and
download updates from a special Web site. But it failed to put new
video drivers on my system, and a Microsoft executive admitted that
the new site did not yet include updated drivers from many
manufacturers. How well this system will work remains to be seen,
but if you lack Web access, you are out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to see what bugs turn up before you buy new software is
conventional wisdom, but in the Internet age you may have trouble
getting repairs unless you are connected. In a consumer practice
that in any other business would be considered unconscionable,
Microsoft sold retail copies of its Windows 95 Upgrade disks for
three years without revising them, even though there were many
known bugs, some of which compromised security.
</P>
<P>
   Free fixes were simply posted on the Web. ``There is no change
as yet'' in that policy, a spokeswoman said. ``But that doesn't
mean there won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of anomalies remain. When the Registration Wizard failed
to connect to Microsoft's site, it announced that the modem was
configured improperly. The problem was actually that the modem was
already connected, something a wizard should be smart enough to
detect.
</P>
<P>
   The help files are much improved, but they are still not
context-sensitive and do not change to reflect the browsing method
in effect. Their browser-like approach lets you click once to jump
to a link, except in the Index and Search windows, which require
double clicks.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you set up your machine for single-click access to
files from the desktop, double-clicking is needed when you deal
with files within applications.
</P>
<P>
   Could Microsoft please learn about long file names, one of the
major improvements introduced in Windows 95? A link to ``cool video
clips'' bears the modest subheading: ``Check out the awesome new
multimedia capabilities of Windows 98.''
</P>
<P>
   But clicking gets you a list of files with inscrutable names
like ``msbearth.'' They turn out to be awesome commercials for
Microsoft products, and they run just fine on my ancient Pentium 90
with good old Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   If you are considering an upgrade, note that you can get a
discount on Windows 98 or even a free copy by purchasing certain
peripheral products. And do not rush to buy the 1,766-page book
called Windows 98 Resource Kit, which Microsoft Press offers for
$70. Its entire text (though not all the software) is hidden on the
Windows 98 disk at /tools/reskit/help/rk98book.chm.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is the end of the DOS-based line. Microsoft says its
next operating system for consumers will be based on the more
stable but less generally compatible Windows NT system. But it is
likely to be a long time before we learn whether the theme song for
that one will be ``Ode to Joy'' or ``You Can't Always Get What You
Want.''

   UNDATED _ Before Operation Restore Hope or Operation Deny
Flight, there was Operation Vittles. It was a tongue-in-cheek name
for a deadly serious mission that came together 50 years ago this
week _ to supply 2.5 million war-weary Berlin residents with enough
food, supplies and heat to outlast a Soviet blockade imposed June
24, 1948. By CHRIS VAUGHN. Story has moved in ``a'' general news

   UNDATED _ Ya gotta love a cookbook that has a big beefy
firefighter on the cover. Joseph T. Bonanno Jr.'s first cookbook,
``The Healthy Firehouse Cookbook,'' was a collection of low-fat
recipes from firehouses around the country. His new book, ``The
Firehouse Grilling Cookbook'' (Broadway, $23), takes the cooking

   FILMS-RACIST 100 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ No one should be surprised that last week's special
honoring the 100 greatest movies as announced by the American Film
Institute turned out to be overtly middlebrow and sentimental. Burt
Reynolds wept when discussing ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' tears he
may have been saving up since losing the Best Supporting Actor
Oscar to Robin Williams. And poor Dustin Hoffman was so
narcissistic that he cried about ``Tootsie.'' (Apparently director
Sydney Pollack neglected to inform Hoffman that it was a comedy.)

as well. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment

<P>
   UNDATED _ George Stephanopoulos dishes dirt, Nicholas Evans
follows up ``The Horse Whisperer,'' and Danielle Steel takes a risk
by writing about the death of her 19-year-old son. What else is in
store for book lovers this fall? For starters, new works from
established authors Philip Roth, Ellen Gilchrist, Paul Theroux and
John Edgar Wideman. And, oh yeah. Dame Agatha Christie returns from

the camera. See Monica mock the independent counsel and the horse
he rode in on. Just perusing the pictures of Monica Lewinsky in the
July issue of Vanity Fair magazine, you might never guess that
she's in a truckload of trouble. You might never guess that she
could end up going to jail for her role in a White House sex
scandal. By BILL THOMPSON. Story has moved in ``k'' commentary

   DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE WITH MARSHMALLOW FROSTING
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   Solid vegetable shortening, for the pans
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sifted unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallow frosting, recipe follows
</P>
<P>
   2 cups coconut chips, optional
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees. Lightly coat two 8-inch round cake pans with shortening.
Line the pans with parchment or waxed paper.
</P>
<P>
   Into a large bowl, sift together twice the flour, sugar, cocoa,
baking powder, baking soda and salt. Gradually mix in the milk,
oil, eggs and vanilla. Stir until moistened. Do not over mix.
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until cakes are just pulling away from the sides of the
pans and their tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 30
minutes. Cool in the pans on the rack for 10 minutes. Remove from
the pans, peel off the parchment and cool on racks to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Set 1 layer on a cake plate. Spread about one-third of the
frosting over the layer. Scatter about 3/4 cup of the coconut chips
(if desired) over the frosting. Set the second layer in place.
Frost the cake all over with the remaining frosting. Scatter
remaining coconut chips over the cake (press some into the sides,
as well, if desired)
</P>
<P>
   The layers can be baked up to 1 day in advance (wrap the layer
separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate), but the cake should be
served within an hour of frosting.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cake into wedges for serving.
</P>
<P>
   Note: For cupcakes, divide the batter among 20 greased muffin
cups (fill each no more than two-thirds full). Bake until puffed
and just pulling away from the sides of the muffin tins, 12-15
minutes. Cool slightly, then remove from the pan and cool
completely. Frost with marshmallow frosting and top with coconut
chips, if desired, or use your favorite chocolate frosting and top
with coconut chips, if desired, or use your favorite chocolate
icing.
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallow frosting:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   2 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1 (7-ounce) jar marshmallow creme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon almond extract
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the double boiler set over simmering water, beat
together the sugar, water and egg whites until soft peaks form. Add
the marshmallow creme and heat until stiff peaks form. Remove from
heat and beat in the almond extract.
</P>
<P>
   Use immediately or cover and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per serving with coconut chips: 675
calories, 25 grams fat, 106 grams carbohydrates, 12 grams protein,
128 milligrams cholesterol, 531 milligrams sodium, 33 percent of
calories from fat.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Note to employers: Resumes can be deceiving. Take a look at this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Pamela Morgan
</P>
<P>
   Place of birth: Wichita Falls, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Education: University of Texas
</P>
<P>
   First job: Dancer with modern dance troupe, Austin
</P>
<P>
   Probable outcome: Ceramic artist with an organic garden in Round
Rock
</P>
<P>
   And the employer would be dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Morgan is one of New York City's hottest caterers,
creating events for President Bill Clinton, Martha Stewart and
Garth Brooks. Her takeout/dine-in shop, Flavors, gets rave reviews
from the likes of John Mariani, Daniel Boulud and Gael Greene. The
petite North Texas native is definitely swimming with the big fish.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan fell in love with New York City while visiting there with
her friend Dean Ornish (another Texan who's definitely in the big
pond). Nothing would do but that she would try her legs at hoofing
in the Big City. But on the way to stardom, she got sidetracked by
the food bazaar that is New York.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a job at the Silver Palate, the definitive takeout
store (and cookbook) that put chicken marbella into the culinary
vernacular. It was a time of American palates experimenting with
all sorts of things: balsamic vinegar, tapenade and aioli platters.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan learned her lessons well and went on to develop her own
style, a ``Texas meets Tuscany'' marriage of what she calls
``really flavorful food with bold tastes. Tuscan food is simple,
and our food is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Now her flavors have been published in ``Flavors,'' (Viking,
$29.95), a collection of dishes such as smoky chicken with herbed
goat cheese stuffing and crab and corn cakes with chipotle
remoulade. In Fort Worth last week to promote her book, she
marveled at how food has grown across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Eatzi's and was very impressed. There was so much
freshness and creativity, I felt like I was in New York. And I'm
glad they're going to open one in New York,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   But after dinner at cutting-edge AquaKnox, she was eager to move
on to Wichita Falls to eat barbecue and fried chicken prepared by
her family's longtime cook. It's a far cry from ``The Market
Table'' at Flavors, where about 20 dishes are presented daily,
along with an all-organic potato bar, an oatmeal bar and a lemonade
bar.
</P>
<P>
   But not so different, really, than Luby's. ``I just love their
banana cream pie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine Morgan catering to the rich and famous. The
dinner she prepared for President Clinton, a $25,000-a-person
fund-raiser in a private home, included butternut squash soup,
seared red snapper with white beans, and angel food cake _ because
the president doesn't eat chocolate. After dinner, she presented
Clinton with a bag of extra-spicy gingersnaps to take aboard Air
Force One.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Morgan met Hillary Clinton, who hadn't been
at the dinner. ``She said `Oh, I heard about those cookies,' '' and
Morgan gave her a copy of the cookbook, which includes the recipe.
Hillary asked: ``If I cook from the book, will I look like you?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance, darling. There are some Texanisms that just don't
translate.

   BLACK FOREST HAM SANDWICHES WITH DIJON-BRIE SPREAD
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 sandwiches
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ripe brie, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   1 large green onion, thinly sliced (tender top included)

<P>
   1 21-inch-long crusty baguette, split horizontally
</P>
<P>
   1 pound thinly sliced Black Forest ham, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Trim rind off chilled brie. Let the cheese come to room
temperature. In food processor, combine brie, mustard and Tabasco.
Process, stopping once or twice to scrape down sides of the work
bowl, until smooth. Transfer to a container and stir in green
onion. The spread can be used immediately or prepared several days
in advance. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Return to room
temperature if chilled.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the cut sides of the baguette with the brie mixture,
dividing it evenly and using it all. Ruffle the ham onto the
baguette bottom. Set the top section in place. Cut the baguette
crosswise diagonally into 4 equal sections. Serve within an hour or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This classic Flavors sandwich is a subtle twist on ham and
cheese. For so few ingredients, the sandwiches have great flavor if
you get the best ham and brie and a good gutsy bread.

HUGE MICROSOFT PHOTO FILE IS PART OF A BIGGER PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(ja) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Need an aerial picture of your house or your business or even
the Great Wall of China? There's no need to ask the government for
a satellite photo; just get on the Web and ask Microsoft Corp.,
which unveiled an online database this week granting access to
satellite and aerial pictures of nearly half of the United States
and some foreign sites.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft says that its database, called Terra Server
(www.terraserver.microsoft.com), is the largest database available
on line, there appears to be some dispute about that. In any case,
the project not only marks the creation of one whopper of a digital
scrapbook, it also says something very big about Microsoft's effort
to enter the database business, using as an opener a venture that
can capture the public imagination. Microsoft's strategy is to use
Terra Server to prove that its software and operating system are
suited to massive databases.
</P>
<P>
   Business strategy aside, the mechanics of the database are
impressive. A 45-foot-by-25-foot Compaq computer in Canyon Park,
Wash., holds satellite images of the United States and Europe and
aerial photographs of the United States. The aerial photographs
come from the U.S. Geological Survey; the satellite pictures are
distributed by Aerial Images, which in turn obtained them through a
branch of the Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Two years in the making, the project offers access to images
previously unavailable to the public _ at least not without much
more time, effort and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The images are useful, according to Microsoft, for farmers,
academics and businesses needing survey information, as well as for
ordinary Netizens who want to peruse their surroundings. There are
also pictures from on high of such landmarks as the Great Wall of
China and Central Park. The test site got 4 million hits on
Tuesday, the day after it was first publicized nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The USGS pictures can be downloaded for free. The photos from
Aerial Images cost $7.95 to $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the database contains 178 million photos covering 45
percent of the United States and portions of Europe. Within two
years, the creators hope to have images of the entire contiguous 48
states. ``We hope that you'll be able to start at Barstow, Calif.,
and move the cursor east until you get to the Atlantic Ocean,''
said John Hoffman, president of Aerial Images.
</P>
<P>
   There is a handful of publicly available databases offering even
more than Microsoft's one terabyte of data, which is enough
information to fill 2 million books taking up 15 miles of shelf
space. A site from Dialog Corp. offers about 2.5 terabytes listing
U.S. patents and images; an IBM site that also includes patents is
1.5 terabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, IBM _ a clear competitor for Microsoft in its
effort to collect database business _ has some opinions about the
Terra Server's size. ``It's not the world's largest database on
line,'' said Jeff Cross, an IBM spokesman. Cross added, ``We've
been at this for a while. It's good to see other companies learning
to put large databases on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's original goal was to create the database
not for consumers but as a showcase for technology. It considered
creating a database of major league baseball statistics, or of
every trade in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, but
neither project provided enough data to suit its goals.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Microsoft wants to play in this
industry, known as enterprise computing. The database software
business is a $10 billion market, according to Richard Winter,
president of Winter Corp., a Boston consulting firm that
specializes in large databases. The industry is dominated by names
like IBM, Oracle, Sybase and Informix. Microsoft is not a player at
the very high end.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's multiterabyte databases are used inside
companies. By making Terra Server accessible over the Internet,
Microsoft is trying to show that its software can also be used
inside companies, where storage and retrieval demands are less
severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting statement from Microsoft,'' Winter said.
``It says, `Sit up and take notice. We're going after the big
database market.'''

A HANDFUL OF VIEWING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LES LINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For bird-watchers, power means power. Higher-powered optics make
birds appear closer so they can be identified through the field
marks that, for example, distinguish a lesser yellowlegs from a
greater yellowlegs.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences are often subtle: The greater yellowlegs has a
long, slightly upturned bill and thicker leg joints, while the
lesser yellowlegs has a straight bill. If you see the two
shorebirds side by side, the lesser is noticeably smaller, but
otherwise it's a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-power binoculars deliver the highest magnification that is
practical for handheld viewing _ if you have steady hands _ but
many bird-watchers, especially women, prefer 7X or 8X models. If
you want to view an oriole in the top of a shade tree in your yard,
binoculars are all you will need for a good look and a confident
check mark on your list.
</P>
<P>
   But wetlands birds, like loons, ducks, gulls, sandpipers and
herons, as well as birds of prey, are typically seen at a distance.
That is when a spotting scope is useful. Models that zoom from 15X
to 45X or from 20X to 60X are popular among birders, but a sturdy
tripod is needed to keep the image from jiggling.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, if there is a stiff wind, you can get queasy from a
tremor in the image that increases along with the magnification.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to hold a spotting scope in your hand, even at the lowest
magnification, is futile. Or at least it was until Carl Zeiss, the
famous German optical company, adapted 16th-century technology and
introduced a 20-power stabilized monocular/scope that can be
comfortably held and focused in one hand. With the press of a
button, the image becomes sharp and rock-steady.
</P>
<P>
   The military has used high-power gyro-stabilized binoculars for
decades, notably on ships at sea, but they are heavy and require a
power source. Further, the gyro takes time to spool up to speed,
and a power source, like a battery pack, is required. And the
gyro's whine, while inaudible to humans, spooks wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The stability of the Zeiss 20x60S depends on mechanical
ingenuity, not electronics. There isn't one circuit inside the
light, ergonomically contoured and water-resistant housing of the
scope, which weighs just 42 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the scope's prism, which is required for image reversal,
is mounted in a suspension system that moves left, right or down
with the user's hand so the incoming light rays always fall on the
same image plane. Any vibrations caused by hand tremors are
mechanically suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   For some bird-watchers, a drawback of the Zeiss stabilized
monocular is its suggested retail price: $2,999.95. If your pockets
are deep and you prefer a 20-power stabilized binocular, which is
heavier and not so slick to use in the field, Zeiss has that, too _
for $4,999.95.

   Crossing the swimming pool with the relentlessness of a Steven
Spielberg tracking shot, the boy's goggles splash bits of green and
orange and purple: they are the holographic images of hungry shark
mouths on the eyepieces of Speedo's new hologram goggles. The
wearer can look through the goggles, but the viewer sees the shark
faces or, alternately, shark eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Holograms are shimmering across the land on summer toys and
movie tie-ins. Last year, they starred in a pop watch for ``The
Lost World'' with a dinosaur's eye holographed on the face. This
year, they glimmer on baseball cards, T-shirts and tennis shoes.
The Air Jordan Jumpman logo on basketball shoes has been turned
into a hologram.
</P>
<P>
   Once holography was the photography of the future. Once, when
the very word ``laser'' was full of magic and promise, National
Geographic put a hologram on its cover to astonish its readers. Now
the hologram is disposable glitter. Coming home to the world of
placemats and mugs, it has entered the realm of the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Subliminally, holograms still say high tech, but they are found
more and more in low-tech applications. Inexpensive holograms and
holographic foils have their serious moments, to be sure: they are
used as seals to authenticate boxes of videotapes or software, or
they appear on credit cards or even currency to insure,
theoretically, against counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   But holograms are now routinely faked by clever counterfeiters,
and one for the new euro banknotes was stolen a few weeks ago. Like
mere humans, they are no longer invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, holograms will seem as corny as 3-D. I have a 1950s
Xograph 3-D postcard of the Empire State Building; the card is
thick, and the clouds seem layered an inch behind the building.
There also used to be flicker disks given as prizes in boxes of
Cracker Jack: the batter hit the ball as you turned the disk in the
light. Another classic was the 1964 campaign button that turned
from ``L.B.J.'' to ``For the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1992, the Museum of Holography in the Soho section of New
York City had as much artistic ambition as the Minimalist works on
show at the Leo Castelli or John Weber galleries. The holograms
seemed as fragile as the first daguerreotypes, which also looked
different from different angles. One star item at the museum showed
a woman blowing a kiss as the viewer walked around the image; it
was as titillating in its own small way as Edison's scandalous
early film, ``The Kiss.'' Holograms were so space-agey that they
turned up in ``Star Wars,'' with the fuzzy, low-resolution figure
of the pleading Princess Leia.
</P>
<P>
   But some people take holograms much more seriously. In ``The
Holographic Universe'' (HarperCollins, 1991), Michale Talbot argues
nothing less than that the universe is itself one giant hologram.
In this combination of pop science and parapsychology, Talbot thus
explains out-of-body experiences, quantum theory problems, the
paranormal and other ``unsolved riddles of brain and body.''
One-upping Descartes, he writes that ``our world and everything in
it . . . are only ghostly images, projections from a level of
reality so beyond our own that it is literally beyond both space
and time.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a belief seems holographic in itself _ hyped up with trompe
l'oeil; false like the melodramatic hues of the holographic image,
somewhere between opal and oil slick. Those colors shimmer
nervously, as if the stationary image was no longer enough and, in
the multimedia world, must be in motion.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, holograms seem right for the time; the sometimes
dizzying depth of their space represents easy truths and cheap
profundities. Hollow and show-offy, holograms are the tie-dye of
the '90s.

     `NATION OF SPECTATORS' A THREAT TO
DEMOCRACY, PANEL REPORTS
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning that democracy is threatened as America
becomes ``a nation of spectators,'' a national commission urged
Americans on Wednesday to take active roles in their communities
and the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in America feel powerless'' and have grown
``passive and disengaged'' when it comes to fulfilling their civic
duties, former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said at a news conference to
release a report by the National Commission on Civic Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But most citizens have only themselves to blame, said William
Bennett, a Republican who served as education secretary under
President Reagan and was commission co-chairman along with Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fret about the weakness of our families, but will not make
the personal commitments needed to preserve them. We worry about
the consequences of out-of-wedlock births, but refuse to condemn
them. We deplore the performance of our public schools, but somehow
we can't find the time to join parents' associations, attend school
board meetings or even help our children with their homework.''
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn also called on Americans to stop waiting for others to do
the work for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we place adult gratification over the well-being of our
children?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's 18-month study was summarized in a 67-page
report that Bennett called ``tough on Americans.'' It found
troubling signs of the breakdown of civil society. Neighborhood and
community ties have frayed, public schools are often unsafe and
popular culture is vulgar, and political participation is at
depressed levels, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Among dozens of recommendations, the commission urged Americans
to join a school, church or community association, pitch in to
improve his or her neighborhood, and try to raise each child in
two-parent family whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett also said Americans need to take personal responsibility
by cultivating partnerships with faith-based institutions, raising
standards in civic education and encouraging journalists to promote
public awareness of civic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``A free society depends on the standards and behavior not just
of our leaders but average citizens as well,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Nunn said, was not inventing civic activity from
scratch but finding ways to build on the work quietly being carried
out by thousands of community groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many organizations have been ignored,'' Nunn said. ``They need
volunteers and publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to spark a national discussion on the issue, the
commission will form four task forces that will address family,
neighborhood, school and entertainment industry issues.
</P>
<P>
   One task force will update an index unveiled Wednesday that
gauges the country's civic health.
</P>
<P>
   The index, which measures trends over the past quarter-century
in such indicators as voter turnout and membership in
organizations, ``indicates a significant overall decline in the
quality of civic life in America over the last 25 years,'' Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Rimel, president of The Pew Charitable Trusts, which
funded the commission's project, attributed the decline in part to
Americans taking their voting privileges for granted. They would be
``outraged,'' she said, if ``their voice didn't count in
determining their future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why its so ironic to me that cynicism is spreading
across the land,'' she said. ``It will cost America and it will
cost big.''

CLINTON TO PAY HOMAGE TO CHINA'S PAST IN HIS NINE-DAY VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ President Clinton's carefully scripted itinerary
in China underscores his emphasis on visiting benign tourist stops
designed to generate favorable media coverage across the country
rather than making tough negotiations the centerpiece of his trip.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he will view legions of 2,200-year-old, life-size terra
cotta warriors buried to protect an ancient Chinese emperor before
he begins his summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, arriving here Thursday for the first visit to China by
an American president since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989,
will spend more time in the country _ nine days _ than any of the
four previous American presidents who have visited this vast nation
since Richard Nixon cracked open the door in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's schedule sets aside fewer than 11 hours for
private meetings and social occasions with the Chinese president or
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton, accompanied by First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and their daughter Chelsea, will honor China's 5,000-year
history by visiting popular sites and reaching out to the nation's
people with roundtable discussions and stops at out-of-the-way
villages.
</P>
<P>
   American and Chinese officials hope that the first family's
travels will also broaden Americans' understanding of this country
of 1.2 billion people, which hopes to become the largest economy in
the world early in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Col. P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the White House
National Security Council who is accompanying the president, said
Clinton's history-laden itinerary is deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summits are not just about how much time presidents spend
together,'' Crowley said. ``The Chinese people understandably want
respect for their country as a great power. We expect they will
welcome the president's visit as that kind of recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The cities that Clinton will visit span the breadth of Chinese
history. He opens his journey in Xian, a former imperial capital
that was thriving 1,100 years before the birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then visits Beijing to hold official meetings, Shanghai
to rendezvous with successful entrepreneurs; Guilin to stress
environmental concerns; and Hong Kong, Asia's cosmopolitan
financial hub that reverted to Chinese control last June after 156
years as a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving here in Xian Thursday morning (EDT)
following an 18-hour flight, the president will visit the restored
ancient stone wall that girds this one-time mercantile capital,
which served as the eastern terminus of the fabled Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   Xian, the capital of China for 1,100 years, once echoed with the
sounds of Chinese traders and the camel caravans that they used to
transport perfumes, jewels and horses from the eastern frontiers of
the Roman Empire along the Mediterranean in exchange for Chinese
silks, porcelain and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his family will also visit the famed terra cotta
warriors that lie buried within sight of the tomb of Qin
Shihuangdi, the ruthless emperor who forged a united nation in 221
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Beijing, Clinton will stand in the West Plaza in
front of the Great Hall of the People gazing across Tiananmen
Square during an official arrival ceremony. The 98-acre square in
the heart of Beijing has served as the setting for political tumult
throughout Chinese history, including the bloody 1989 crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators that left hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton will visit the medieval Forbidden City that
housed 24 isolated Chinese emperors from the 14th century until the
demise of the last emperor in 1911. Clinton also will visit the
Great Wall, remnants of which wind at least 2,000 miles from the
west to the outskirts of Beijing in the east.
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday, en route from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Clinton will
see the round-topped limestone Guilin Peaks in southern China that
have inspired generations of poets and painters. The setting along
the Li River draws more than 6 million Chinese tourists and 500,000
foreigners each year, who gaze at the fairytale landscape of
limestone mountains soaring up to 600 feet above tangerine orchards
and fields of rice, taro and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a master of hand-to-hand politics at home, also plans
to visit three Chinese villages, including one that is more than
400 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred to his goals as First Salesman for the
American way of life in an address at the National Geographic
Society on June 11. ``The more we share our ideas with the world,
the more the world will come to share the ideals that animate
America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials welcomed Clinton's mission as evidence that
U.S.-Chinese relations have recovered from the chill that followed
the 1989 violence in and near Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that Clinton will travel all the way across the
ocean to China to pay respect to this great nation will be
appreciated as a sign of friendship and goodwill,'' said a senior
Chinese official, speaking on condition of anonymity before
Clinton's arrival.

A 3-FOOT EXCUSE FOR BEING LATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ever run out of excuses for why you were late for work,
I've got a brand new one. Tell them, ``There was a snake in the
garage and I couldn't get to my car!'' It happened to me, and I'm
still shaking in my pumps.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last week I was getting dressed for work and I told
my son to go ahead and put his golf clubs in the trunk so I could
drop him off for lessons on my way to the office. Two minutes
later, he came running in, screaming and dancing like James Brown:
``Snake in the garage! There's a snake in the garage! Mom, there's
a huge snake in the garage! I think it's a python!''
</P>
<P>
   As he is prone to exaggeration (can't imagine where he got that
from), I went ahead and finished applying my lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, son,'' I said. ``I do believe there's a snake in the
garage but I doubt it's a python. Pythons don't live in this part
of the country, and they're really huge. It's probably just a
garden snake. He's as frightened as you. If he's still there, we'll
just toss him into the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed a broom on my way to the garage and boldly stepped
onto the oily concrete. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw
something move by the trash can. I turned and saw the longest,
fattest, scariest snake that I have ever seen outside of a zoo. I
screamed, ran back into the house, and slammed the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez! Did you see that thing? I think it's a boa constrictor.
I'm glad I didn't leave the keys in there. He's big enough to
drive!''
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I told you. What are we gonna do? He's right by the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   I took deep breaths and tried to think. I spent much of my youth
in the woods of East Texas and am no stranger to snakes. I pride
myself on my courage and resourcefulness. So I did what any 90s
kind of girl would do. I called my husband at work and yelled:
``There's a snake in the garage! There's a snake in the garage!''
</P>
<P>
   My knight rushed home to save me; admittedly, a little smug at
first. He reached for a hoe and started poking around for the
``little earthworm.'' All of a sudden, this huge, hissing head
emerged from behind the lawn mower. That sucker was a good 3 feet
long! Husband did a jump Carl Lewis would envy while my son and I
wasted no time chiming, ``Told you so!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the battle between man and nature began. My husband chased
the snake all over the garage. I begged him to let the police
handle it but he wouldn't. ``He came into my garage and scared my
family,'' he said. ``Call whoever you want, but he's mine!'' But I
was so afraid that the snake would bite him, or vice versa, that I
called 911 anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When I went back outside, my husband had cornered the snake in
the branches of a red-tip photinia and was trying to spear it with
the hoe. My son was yelling, ``Get him, Dad!'' from 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the animal control people arrived and snared what
they said was some kind of ``bull'' snake. I imagine they took it
to safety and freedom far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one believed me when I told them why I arrived at
work an hour late. And I haven't parked in the garage since. Did I
mention that I usually stayed inside the house in the woods of East
Texas?

FRANCE COMPLETES UNDEFEATED FIRST-ROUND; DENMARK ADVANCES DESPITE
LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ The Tour de France continues for the host nation,
and so far it has won every stage in style.
</P>
<P>
   In an anxious fortnight for France, which has seen its bright
and shiny World Cup tarnished by strikes in the air and ticket
scandals and rioting and neo-Nazi salutes on the ground. But the
French team has yet to be troubled on the field.
</P>
<P>
   It won its three first-round games by a combined score of nine
goals to one, and its 2-1 victory over Denmark on Wednesday made it
the first team in this World Cup to head into the second round with
a perfect record.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other host nations have started as well: Uruguay in
1930 and Italy in 1990. The coming weeks will tell if the French
will follow on the heels of Uruguay, which won, or Italy, which
lost before even reaching the final. What is clear after
Wednesday's match is that France has no shortage of players capable
of contributing.
</P>
<P>
   The French national team has long had a nickname for its
reserves. They are called ``les coiffeurs'', or the hairstylists: a
reference to the fact that reserves in the World Cup are able to
keep their locks dry and in place as they observe the real players
from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But after three games in these finals, the only French players
who have yet to perspire for their nation are backup goalkeepers
Bernard Lama and Lionel Charbonnier. Against the Danes, who also
qualified for the second round despite their loss, Jacquet started
seven different players than he did in the opener against South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The French coach with the first-communion haircut did it for
some good reasons. Star playmaker Zinedine Zidane is out for two
games, including the much more important second-round match on
Sunday, after thoughtlessly raking his cleats on the leg of a Saudi
player.
</P>
<P>
   Three other regulars _ captain Didier Deschamps, Bixente
Lizarazu and Laurent Blanc _ were rested to avoid the risk of
picking up second yellow cards that would have knocked them out of
the second-round match along with Zidane.
</P>
<P>
   It was a calculated risk: France still needed a draw to clinch
first place in Group C. But France has the players to gamble and
win, although France doesn't get the chance to see them on its own
soil very often.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, France's defensive midfield composed of Patrick
Vieira and Emmanuel Petit certainly looked more familiar to Arsenal
fans, who watch Vieira and Petit play together every week in
England, than to the Lyonnais.
</P>
<P>
   France's central defense composed of Marcel Desailly, who is
having a magnificent tournament, and Frank Leboeuf will play
side-by-side for the trendy English club, Chelsea, next season.
France's outside fullbacks on Wednesday, Vincent Candela and
Christian Karembeu, play for clubs in Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But dispersion does not seem to equate with confusion in this
era. Brazil won the last World Cup with a largely expatriate
lineup; the Danes won the 1992 European Championship with an even
higher percentage of players making fine livings abroad. The Danes
have yet to come close to duplicating that performance.
</P>
<P>
   Their midfield has looked shaky here; they also appear to lack
speed defensively, which is one thing it is increasingly hazardous
to lack in this era where the only breathing room seems to come
down the wings. But in one of the weaker groups in this World Cup,
the Laudrup brothers, Michael and Brian, and their Swedish coach,
Bo Johansson, still had enough savvy to earn a date with Nigeria in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes came into Wednesday's match with four points to South
Africa's one. They also came in a with a four-goal edge in goal
differential, which meant that even if Denmark lost by a goal to
the French, South Africa would have to outscore Saudi Arabia by
three goals.
</P>
<P>
   For a short while, it appeared Denmark might have reason to feel
apprehensive. That was after Youri Djorkaeff converted a penalty
kick in the 12th minute, and South Africa took a 1-0 lead against
the Saudis. But in the 42nd minute in Lyon, after Vieira fouled
Michael Laudrup slightly outside the penalty box, Italian referee
Pierluigi Collina signaled for a direct free kick.
</P>
<P>
   Before the French team had time to set up its wall, Laudrup
placed the ball on the ground and quick-kicked it to teammate
Martin Jorgensen, who was already streaking toward the French goal.
Jorgensen was quickly yanked down from behind by Candela, and
Laudrup was soon equalizing with a penalty kick in the same stadium
where he played in 1984 in the European Championships.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delightfully opportunistic play and the first
embarrassing moment for the French team in this tournament. After
the Saudis erased the South African lead by converting a penalty
kick of their own late in the first half, it was time for the Danes
to start preparing for Jay-Jay Okocha and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But first they would have to surrender the game-winner in the
56th minute to Petit, who slammed home a 22-yard shot after Robert
Pires' and Desailly's shots were blocked.
</P>
<P>
   It was another joyful moment for the 27-year-old Petit, who
played his first Division I match at age 18 in France but seriously
considered quitting soccer three years ago because of personal
problems and creeping ennui.
</P>
<P>
   He has found harmony in England, winning the title last spring
with Arsenal and its French coach Arsene Wenger. This summer, he
wants another title with another French coach, and though Group C
was hardly the Group of Death, it is clear that Petit and his
president Jacques Chirac, who was in attendance in Lyon, have no
reason to think small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be at the final on July 12 in St. Denis,'' Chirac said.
``Hopefully, I will be able to watch France again.'' &QL;

   Each summer, Batya Friedman and her husband, Peter Kahn Jr.,
both professors at Colby College in Waterville, Me., take their
daughter Zoe and move to a 670-acre outpost without electricity
five hours northeast of San Francisco. They use solar power to use
their computers to write, but they can get no e-mail. They can use
a phone only twice a month, on trips to town.
</P>
<P>
   If people who are used to reaching her regularly become
frustrated with her absence from the Net, Friedman advises them to
write her an e-mail, print it out, put it in an envelope and put a
stamp on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, each communication I get I do really read,
while the rest of the year I'm overwhelmed by the amount of e-mail
messages I get,'' said Friedman, who teaches computer science, as
she sat in an Oakland, Calif., coffee shop before the family headed
for the woods. ``It's an opportunity for focus, and that's harder
to achieve when you are so accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, America, it is possible to be too plugged in. Studies show
that e-mail is slowing down the workplace, and cellular phones
outnumber across the country. Weren't most people secretly pleased
last month when the malfunctioning Galaxy 4 satellite stifled 50
million pagers, with all the serendipity of a snow day? Just look
for ``information overload'' on your basic Web search engine: one
search turned up 16,590 matches. Even though some technology
advances, like slicker upgrades and faster modems, are welcome, the
acceleration in the rate of information flow has become troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering what the saturation point is of this constant
connectivity,'' said Robert McArthur, vice president for academic
affairs at Colby College. ``There's a great line from John le
Carre, `They're fed up and asking for more.' People are
complaining, but they are putting themselves in the way of more
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   While some chronicle the ill effects of high technology, others
turn their backs on electronic communication _ for a week, a month,
a season _ and reap the benefits. Even Bill Gates, chairman of
Microsoft Corp., regularly takes a ``think week'' off line, coming
back with fresh ideas garnered from reading and discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to synthesize and focus on priorities _ go up to
the 15,000-foot level and really think about directions,'' said a
Microsoft spokeswoman, Mariann Allison. He lets people know he will
not be spending much time on e-mail that week, then reads, talks
and plays with programs and Web site ideas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others set aside periods to ignore e-mail and turn off their
cellular phones in the hope of becoming more creative and
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Call it soaring without a Net.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Life Unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   During summers off line, Friedman has edited a book, and Kahn,
who teaches human development, has written one. Also, Friedman
completed a good bit of a successful proposal for a National
Science Foundation grant. The collaborative projects she worked on
while in California were a bit more streamlined, she said, because
they did not go through a huge number of drafts via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are harder to reach, people solve their problems on
their own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that some of her acquaintances had picked up on her
idea by turning off the ringers on their phones, finding offices
without phone lines or simply slowing the pace at which they reply
to e-mail. The couple have started the Mina Institute in their
summer destination, Covelo, Calif., for the study of technology and
the human relationship with nature.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``People on cell phones are now reachable in their cars on their
commute, and time that used to be down time or transition time is
time used by employers,'' said Gerry Sussman, a professor at the
School of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University.
``Electronic communications makes possible a much deeper
penetration for the commercial use of anything,'' he added, citing
unwanted e-mail, phone solicitations made from computer-generated
lists and television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Crabb, a psychology professor at Penn State University,
has studied the effects of technology on personality, particularly
through a phenomenon he calls ``de-skilling,'' the loss of
competencies like using an abacus, slide rule or paper, long ago
replaced by a calculator, or a dictionary, replaced by a spell
checker. He said the problem can seep over to some children who
lose their social skills when they watch video screens for too
long.
</P>
<P>
   He also has pondered how new technology causes people to do odd
things like using Web cameras that allow exhibitionists to
broadcast performances of their bodily functions on the Internet,
to the delight of voyeurs. The potential for electronically induced
soul sickness alarms him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from lots of research that when human beings _ and it
doesn't matter from what culture _ don't get enough time to
themselves, they become stressed, sick and they can't function as
well,'' he said. ``There are clear benefits to having private times
and spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   A southern California philosopher, Michael Heim, worries that
the recent mania for information erodes the human capacity for
significance. ``With a mind-set fixed on information, our attention
span shortens,'' he wrote in ``The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality''
(Oxford University Press, 1993). ``We collect fragments. We become
mentally poorer in overall meaning.'' Communication technology has
benefited from that old American maxim: If it's new and hot, it
must be worth having (which goes a long way toward explaining the
success of network television and the sport utility vehicle).
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is you need to be connected the way technology
allows you to be connected, 24 hours a day, wherever you are,''
said Friedman. ``But it's not clear that that enhances the quality
of our lives or the productivity of our work lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft, no enemy of connectivity, encourages some of its
managers to unplug _ temporarily. Andrea Tevlin, an internal
leadership consultant at the huge software company, based in
Redmond, Wash., said she and some of her senior co-workers are
better managers for logging off e-mail occasionally, for four or
five days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm telling people I am going to be off-line for a week,
I'm saying, `I delegate the responsibility to you to do this,' and
they are empowered,'' she said. ``In a work context when you pull
yourself off-line, you have more time to converse with people,
think conceptually and think about how to make the human system I'm
operating in operate differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning off the technology is also an issue in the realm of
recreation. Nothing beats a toy with lots of buttons to push.
McArthur from Colby College is amused by the gizmos he sees boaters
and sailors buying, such as phones and high-frequency radios that
e-mail transmissions to the middle of the ocean. ``This stuff
coming in seems to be defeating the whole point of going out on
your boat and getting away,'' he said. ``People don't want to get
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Spring, a Seattle-area author of more than 50 guidebooks on
hiking in the Northwest, sees the disadvantages of carrying
cellular phones or global positioning systems into the wilderness _
they too often lose their signals, and hikers may not have the
skills to read a map or compass and find their way out of the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend your time on a phone when you're out in wild
areas, you're not enjoying the wild areas,'' said Spring, who
doesn't miss his e-mail when he's out of town, and whose co-author,
Harvey Manning, graduated to an electric typewriter from a manual
one just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Heim, who has written about information fixation, said
humans must do more than unplug, and what they do while unplugged
is more important than the length of time they spend away from
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without rebooting our awareness, it doesn't matter whether we
unplug or not. Technology re-trains our nervous system. It gives us
a pace and tempo,'' he said via e-mail, his preferred medium. ``We
need to actively plug ourselves into the operating system of earth
and sky, mountain and river, inhale and exhale.''

ULTIMATE PRODUCT PLACEMENT: YOUR FACE BEHIND THE RAY-BANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Risky Business.'' ``The Blues Brothers.'' ``Top Gun.'' ``Men in
Black.'' What these movies have in common _ other than making
enormous amounts of money _ is that they all featured characters
who wore Ray-Bans, sunglasses made by the eyewear division of the
optical products giant Bausch &AMP; Lomb.
</P>
<P>
   From the Wayfarers made famous by Tom Cruise to the Predators
donned by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, Ray-Ban has been one of
the shrewdest practitioners of product placement, the insertion of
consumer goods into Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Ray-Ban have taken product placement to its next
level: your face. In April, Ray-Ban introduced a feature on its Web
site (www.rayban.com) called the Virtual Preview, which allows you
to superimpose images of more than 60 Ray-Ban models _ from the
Outdoorsman to the Daddy-O _ over your image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Wouldn't it be great if consumers could see how
they looked in Ray-Bans while they sit at home in their pajamas?'
'' said Kristi Hughes, Ray-Ban's manager of online marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Preview isn't quite that easy. You must first send a
front-facing photograph of yourself, which the company will scan
and put on the site for a $3 fee. (If you own a scanner, you can
upload your own image and save the $3.) Once your face is loaded
onto the site, Ray-Ban will send you a password, which you can use
to call up your image after you have downloaded both Shockwave and
Alpha Mania plug-ins. Only then (by this point, you could have
visited every Sunglass Hut in the state) can you use Virtual
Preview.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is routine: Click on the style of sunglasses and
it appears on the bridge of your virtual nose or, if you prefer, on
the nose of one of the models Ray-Ban has provided. You can use the
controls to move the sunglasses up and down _ or from side to side,
if you want to know how your Ray-Bans might look if you fell asleep
wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was always trying to get me in those wraparound
shades,'' said Pat D'Antonio, a corporate events producer in New
York who tried the site. ``I wanted to say to her, `There, I'd look
like an idiot.' '' While he enjoyed seeing his face on line, he
said, the experience hasn't changed his preference for Wayfarers.
</P>
<P>
   What does Virtual Preview mean for shopping on line? Ray-Ban
says it's the first service of its kind in eyewear. In its first
full month, Virtual Preview attracted almost 17,000 visitors; 8,000
of those downloaded the plug-ins but only a few dozen sent photos.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, even if you send in your image, you can't order
sunglasses through the site: Ray-Ban is interested only in driving
traffic to retail outlets. ``Anything that can identify a site or
improve traffic adds some value,'' said Shanta Puchtler, an analyst
with the commerce technology strategies group at Forrester
Research. ``Whether it's really a selling tool, that's another
question.''
</P>
<P>
   What Virtual Preview could be is the first wave of
personalization _ a popular Internet buzzword _ of the online
shopping experience. ``You might see it in soft goods like
clothing,'' Puchtler said. ``There is talk of people entering their
color-me-beautiful palette and having an entire outfit dynamically
displayed.'' If that happens, get the wide-angle camera ready.
After all, can Virtual Khakis be far behind?

HOME CLINIC: PROPER STORAGE AND REPAIR OF HOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204 or 1927.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few homeowners give thought to their garden hose until it is
needed to water the lawn and garden. Then leaks and cracks will
show up when water is forced through the hose. Most likely, the
damage developed because the hose was not stored properly during
the winter months. For example, a hose can deteriorate if it is
left outside during the winter. Water remaining in the coils is apt
to freeze, expand and crack the hose.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the hose is brought indoors, it can still be damaged if
it was left to hang on a nail. A nail puts creases in the hose that
eventually dry and crack. Ideally, a hose should be drained and
wrapped around a reel, or at least placed on the floor in a neat
coil.
</P>
<P>
   A rubber hose can also deteriorate if it is stored in the same
room with an electrical appliance. The electric motor in the
appliance generates ozone (an allotropic form of oxygen) that can
attack the rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is too late to worry about storing the garden hose
now, but keep these tips in mind for the end of the season. Now the
problem is what to do about a hose that leaks whenever you use it.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks around connections, where the hose is joined to a faucet
or a spray nozzle, are easy to correct. They occur because the
washer in the coupling has deteriorated. Pry out the old washer and
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks in the body of the hose are more difficult to repair.
Before making any repairs, carefully examine the entire hose. One
or two cracks can be fixed, but several indicate that the hose is
badly deteriorated and probably not worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to repair a damaged section in a hose. A
temporary fix can be made with electrical tape. First, clean and
dry the hose. Wrap the tape around the damaged section, stretching
the tape as you wrap. Do not stretch the first or the last few
turns of the tape, otherwise the tape will eventually unravel.
</P>
<P>
   A more permanent repair can be made by replacing the damaged
section with a metal hose mender. Hardware stores and home centers
stock different types of hose menders. There are three basic types:
crimp menders, saddle menders and bushing-coupler menders. All
these work well, but before you buy one, measure the inside
diameter of the hose. It will be either 1/2-, 5/8-, or 3/4-inch
wide. Purchase a mender that fits this diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in installing a mender is to cut out the damaged
section of the hose with a utility knife. Make sure the cut ends
are perpendicular to the length of the hose. The mender will
replace this section and join the two lengths together.
</P>
<P>
   With the crimp-type hose mender, the hose lengths are joined by
a corrugated tube that fits between them. The mender has metal
fingers that grip the hose ends and keep them from pulling apart.
To install the crimp mender, insert one end of the corrugated tube
into the hose, then place it on an anvil or wooden block. Hammer
down the metal fingers so they grip the hose. Rotate the piece to
tap all the fingers into place. Push the other length of hose onto
opposite end of the tube and repeat the crimping procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Collar menders also have a corrugated tube to join the hose
together. The pieces are held together with a saddle, two pieces of
molded plastic that are screwed in place over the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The bushing mender consists of two couplings, each with its own
metal bushing. One coupling is attached to each end of the hose.
First the bushing, a tapered metal tube, is inserted in the end of
the hose. The hose coupling fits over this and the two are locked
together by twisting the bushing in place. You must use a special
key (this is included in the mending kit) to turn the bushing.
</P>
<P>
   This installation procedure is repeated on the other section of
hose. The two sections are then joined by screwing the couplings
together. In essence this mender makes one long hose into two
shorter hoses that are joined by mating the couplers.
</P>
<P>
   These repairs are easy to make on rubber hoses because the
rubber is soft and relatively flexible. Plastic hoses, on the other
hand, are often stiff and difficult to work with. Try dipping the
hose end into hot water for a few minutes. This should soften it
and make it more pliable.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the hose is repaired, keep it in good condition by
draining and coiling it each time you use it. Straighten out any
kinks immediately, otherwise they will crease the hose and cause it
to crack.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dying Dill
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am embarrassed to write this letter, but my frustration has
overcome my embarrassment. Running an active kitchen, I always look
forward to the summer with my window boxes full of herbs _ basil,
parsleys, chives and dill. All of the herbs thrive with the notable
exception of dill. I cannot keep it alive and my salmon suffers. If
you can solve this problem, the level of my cooking will improve
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   A. Make your salmon before the hot weather hits, then switch to
lobster. The true destiny of dill is to produce seed, not sauce.
Were we more classically educated, we would take a clue from its
botanical name, Anethum, derived from the Greek words ano (upward)
and theo (I run). As the cool weather and lengthening days of
spring give way to the heat of summer, dill, along with cilantro
and chervil, suddenly hear their biological clocks ticking loud and
clear. Time to grow tall and reproduce, then die.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur O. Tucker, a research professor specializing in herbs
at Delaware State University in Dover, said you can lengthen your
season by planting early, as soon as the night temperatures stay
above 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Seed directly in the ground or
transplant young potted plants, keeping as much growing medium
around the roots as possible because dill resents being
transplanted bare root. Seed again in the early fall for a few more
weeks of fresh dill; it will even withstand light frost. The
compact selections Fernleaf and Bouquet are ideal for pot or window
box culture.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged Hemlock
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have four 10-foot hemlocks in my backyard, and they
developed small clumps of white dots along their branches. I was
told by a local nursery that this is a type of insect egg, and they
recommended I spray with an oil-base solution. I was told the oil
would suffocate the eggs and kill them.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for a couple of weeks, and then the dots reappeared.
Another nursery told me that it was a fungus, and that an Ivory
soap solution would cure the problem. Again, it worked for only a
couple of weeks. Any idea what this could be and how I can get rid
of it permanently? I don't want to lose the hemlocks, and I notice
their growth stops when these white dots are present.
</P>
<P>
   A. Hemlock wooly adelgid is a voracious pest that can kill
hemlocks in a few years if not treated. Those white dots are a
protective waxy substance the insect uses to protect itself and its
eggs. If you were thorough in your spraying, the eggs and insects
are most likely dead, but the waxy mass can persist for months.
</P>
<P>
   There are two generations each year, so even though you should
spray all parts of the tree with horticultural oil or insecticidal
soap as soon as you see them, get into a regular schedule of
spraying once sometime between April and late June and again in
September to catch both generations when they are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling Peaches
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year my 5-year-old peach tree produced scads of peaches
only to lose them all. I blamed the squirrels at the time. This
spring the tree again produced scads of baby peaches, and when I
saw some of them on the ground I placed netting around the tree. I
am now left with about four or five peaches that still seem to be
growing. What is going on here? Am I lacking something, like
fertilizers? Or is this the nature of the beast? I would like a few
suggestions on how I can raise my peach production.
</P>
<P>
   A. I hope you have apologized to the squirrels. This is the
nature of the beast, although your harvest can be improved.
</P>
<P>
   A mature tree will produce about 500 peaches from its 30,000
blossoms, a ratio of about 1 to 60. That sounds as if there is a
natural conspiracy, and there is, sort of. Fruit may fail to mature
for several reasons. If pollination isn't complete, the seed inside
may not be viable, and the fruit is aborted early.
</P>
<P>
   Win Cowgill, an agricultural agent with Rutgers Cooperative
Extension in Hunterdon County in New Jersey, said cloudy weather
like this spring's forces fruit trees to make a choice: use the
limited sunlight to produce more leaves for photosynthesis, or
produce fruit. Leaves win. And finally, there's the phenomenon
called June drop. From late May into early July, fruit trees
self-thin, dropping enough fruit that the tree can support the
rest, both nutritionally and literally _ overloaded branches can
break.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most from your tree, don't overfeed it (nitrogen
promotes foliage growth, not fruit), keep the ground below the tree
free of weeds, thin the small peaches so there is six to eight
inches between fruit, and prune every March or early April, while
the tree is still dormant, to promote vigorous new growth. Prune
older branches, since peaches fruit on wood that is a year old. Of
course, the easiest way to increase your production is to buy more
trees. &QL;

AN ENGLISH GARDEN LEARNS TO RELAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAC GRISWOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNE, Pa. _ Chris Woods, 45, strode through the entrance court
at Chanticleer, the public garden here, where he has worked since
1983, the last nine years as executive director and chief
horticulturist. ``It's a dream job,'' he said. ``Thirty-one acres,
10 gardens, 10 expert gardeners and an annual maintenance budget of
a million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Chanticleer, on the Main Line outside Philadelphia, and open to
the public since 1990, was endowed by its own private foundation to
preserve suburban green space. Since 1912, the compound has been
the property of the Rosengartens, philanthropists and
pharmaceutical manufacturers, whose company was eventually acquired
by Merck.
</P>
<P>
   A sensory overload of tender and hardy plants surrounded Woods:
blue agaves and fescues, bananas, striped cannas, rare euphorbias
and the four-foot-wide white-splashed green leaves of variegated
petasites. More down-to-earth than they looked were beautiful
overflowing pots of fleshy tropicals _ Woods' selections from Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the No. 1 retailer of plants in America, I believe,''
he said. ``They call everything `foliage plants' and the price is
$2.99.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was wearing khaki bush shorts, a Hawaiian shirt and a full
head of brilliant yellow hair _ made blonder, he said, by the
strong American sun. Born in England, Woods is now a U.S. citizen.
Like Auden or Isherwood or Hockney, he is an expatriate who has
flourished flamboyantly in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a degree of optimism here that only people from
large countries can feel, no matter how illusory their sense of
infinite space is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has awesome gardening credentials. He started at Britain's
Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and later worked at the fantasy
village of Portmeirion, in Wales; Bateman's (Rudyard Kipling's
garden), and Cliveden, the three-centuries-old British estate near
London.
</P>
<P>
   But if Chanticleer is English, ``it's an English garden on
hormones,'' Woods said. His aggressive form of gardening is, he
says, more American than anything else, but he makes good use of
his English training.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a rectangle of flower beds at Chanticleer looks the
way Americans think an English garden SHOULD look: delicate,
evanescent _ a mass of silvery soft pastels. An Arts-and-Craftsy
wooden pergola foams with blush-colored Dr. W. Van Fleet roses. But
delicacy is deceiving here: the cloudlike look will continue
through Philadelphia's muggy summer and bounce back floriferously
in September, since Woods has selected heat- and humidity-resistant
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Totally different is the formal garden surrounding Chanticleer's
main house, whose broad terrace design displays the influence of
Thomas Sears, an early 20th-century Philadelphia landscape
architect. Near the blue swimming pool, twin changing pavilions _
in an arch 1930s style with trelliswork and peaked copper roofs _
look as if Katharine Hepburn might walk out of them straight into
``The Philadelphia Story.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was an opportunity for understated conventional
planting, it is here, given all the architectural hoo-ha going on.
Sears' eyebrows would go through his hairline at the sight of
Woods' magnificent all-chartreuse planting along one retaining
wall, which includes yellow dwarf bamboo and mother-in-law's
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Serious horticulture underpins every one of Woods' 10 gardens _
the fabulous ponds rimmed with plantings; the witty Italian Garden,
which Woods calls ``postcard Tuscany'' (a scroll of wheat
punctuated with red cedars posing as cypresses, stretched across a
lawn); the native meadow. His craft is best seen in the Asian Wood.
The magically shadowed understory of a grove of 80-foot-tall native
tulip poplars, sycamores and maples, it may look like an American
woodland to a nongardener, and that is fine with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a large number of the 618 species and hybrids here were
grown from seed collected by today's consummate plant hunters in
Korea, China and Japan. Many of them are Woods' friends, who send
their rarest discoveries to Chanticleer knowing they will be well
cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Plant lists are stuck unobtrusively, English-style, into a small
stand at the entrance to this garden. There are no plant labels, no
directional signs, no design-oriented or scientific descriptions
mounted on plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately, there is no effort at Chanticleer to educate
visitors about history, culture or cultivation requirements.
``Chanticleer is a pleasure garden,'' Woods said, ``and my sole
esthetic responsibility is to make people feel good. My experience
with visitors is that they don't come to a garden to learn stuff,
they come to enjoy. You are supposed to feel it is OK just to
admire the plants here, which is somewhat of a radical thing.
Walking is what you do. And sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   He proudly pointed out that Chanticleer offers no regularly
scheduled educational activities, and added, ``We don't have a gift
shop, weddings, concerts, theater, dogs, smoking, sports, a
restaurant, picnic tables or picnics.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods walked around the gardens , he said: ``I think American
and English public horticulture is meant to be intimidating. I'm
trying to create an intimate institution, one small enough for
visitors to be able to ask questions of our gardeners, who are
always available on open days. I don't want a visitor to feel
processed. It shouldn't be like peristalsis.''
</P>
<P>
   His determination to make visitors at Chanticleer relax and use
their eyes underscores how most public horticulture emphasizes
education over experience. Like art museums that must mount
blockbuster shows, public gardens are in a jam: attendance figures
and programs meant to appeal to every demographic sector help bring
in the money that keeps them afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chanticleer doesn't rely on admissions for maintenance,
Woods is free to be a maverick. ``Why must we call something `The
Romantic Garden?''' he asked. ``Why `The Garden of Tranquillity?'
Why not a `Divorce Garden,' or a `Garden for the Grumpy?'''
</P>
<P>
   All around him there was romance and tranquillity that needed no
label: sheets of yellow foxgloves cascading down an embankment; the
half-closed eyelids and sleeping smile of a stone face, the work of
Marcia Donahue, a sculptor in Berkeley, Calif., dreaming at the
foot of a pyramid carved from a living false cypress. It was enough
to make the thirstiest horticultural self-improver just give up and
enjoy it all.
</P>
<P>
   Chanticleer is open Wednesday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
from April 1 to Oct. 31. There is a $5 admission for adults; free
for those 16 and under.

   The outer layer of our skin is normally impermeable, keeping
body fluids in and everything else out. Now researchers have found
that acoustic waves can make the skin temporarily permeable, so
doctors can sample body fluids or inject medication without
piercing the skin. They can generate these acoustic waves using
ultrasound or a shockwave from a pulsed laser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials are already under way on an ultrasonic system
for measuring glucose levels in diabetics, developed at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And just a
short distance away, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston is
testing a drug delivery system that uses laser technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sound waves temporarily change the structure of the impermeable
outer layer of skin, which consists of dead skin cells encased in
layers of fat molecules and is between 10 micrometers and 15
micrometres thick. A few minutes of low-frequency ultrasound _
sound greater in frequency than 20 kilohertz at the threshold of
human hearing _ creates tiny cavities.
</P>
<P>
   These holes allow large molecules to pass through the fat layer
for several hours, says Joseph Kost, a professor of chemical
engineering from Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheeva,
Israel, who is on sabbatical at MIT. At a meeting of the Acoustical
Society of America in Seattle next week, he will reveal how the
technique can deliver drugs and perform tests.
</P>
<P>
   With MIT's Bob Langer and Samir Mitragotri, Kost is focusing
initially on glucose testing.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians recommend that diabetics test blood glucose at least
three times a day, but few jab their fingers that often to draw
blood. The noninvasive acoustic technique makes it much easier _
all patients have to do is place a glucose-monitoring patch over
the permeable spot.
</P>
<P>
   Initial tests used a desktop device, but Kost and Langer have
formed a company to develop a hand-held, battery-powered ultrasound
generator for use at home. They plan clinical tests of a similar
system to deliver insulin or other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Apostolos Doukas at Massachusetts General is using
laser pulses to generate the acoustic waves that make the skin
permeable. He fires a short laser pulse at a plastic disc laid on
the skin, producing a stress wave that lasts 0.2 microseconds to
create the temporary pores. Drugs applied between the disc and the
skin can then diffuse through the pores while the barrier remains
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``For large molecules the barrier recovers in a couple of
minutes, for small molecules it can be 15 minutes to half an
hour,'' Doukas says. As with the ultrasonic technique, patients in
the trials said they felt no pain.
</P>
<P>
   Small pulsed lasers can also penetrate the skin, but they drill
holes which, like needle pricks, can cause pain and take time to
heal. &QL;

   CHINA-SUMMIT (Xian, China) _ President Clinton's aerial caravan
arrives Thursday for a visit eagerly sought by his Chinese hosts as
long-overdue recognition of China's status as a major global power.
The success of the visit will be measured not in the number of
agreements reached or documents signed but in whether Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin can subtly redefine the relationship between
the two nations and show a dynamic and diverse China to an America
deeply uneasy about the conduct and intentions of that rising
nation. By John M. Broder. (With map/graphic, showing Clinton's
itinerary.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-GOALS (Beijing) _ China would love President Clinton to
announce this week that Taiwan, which China considers a renegade
province, will get no more American weapons or that the economic
and military sanctions the United States imposed after the bloody
1989 crackdown on student-led demonstration in Tiananmen Square
will be lifted. In truth, as the leaders here already know, China
will get few if any of the policy changes it wants during the state
visit that begins on Thursday. But China's leaders and people are
ecstatic about the visit, which is already being hailed here as a
great step forward in diplomatic relations. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ZHAO (Shanghai) _ In a striking act of political defiance,
Zhao Ziyang, China's former Communist Party chief, challenged the
nation's leaders to use President Clinton's visit as an opportunity
to admit that the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 was an immense
political blunder. Zhao, the silvery-haired ex-leader who has been
under house arrest since May, 1989, made his case in a letter to
the Party's Central Committee by arguing that only in a reversal of
the official verdict on the crushing of 1989's student movement
will the government be able to retain any legitimacy with its
people. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Junik, Yugoslvia) _ Richard Holbrooke met with
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army on Wednesday, calling the
Kosovo crisis ``explosive,'' and comparing it to the early stages
of the Bosnian and Vietnam conflicts, after the rebel commander
dismissed his calls for a cease-fire and a return to the province's
former autonomous status. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   SALVADOR-NUNS (Miami) _ Newly released State Department
documents dealing with the killing of four American churchwomen in
El Salvador in 1980 indicate that members of the Salvadoran
military high command suspected that one of their number ordered
the killings and informed American diplomats of that belief,
casting doubt on years of official assertions by both governments
that no senior officers were involved in the slayings. By Larry

nationwide standards for health insurance, especially health
maintenance organizations. The health insurance industry
immediately denounced the proposal, saying it would increase costs

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-AFFIRM (Washington) _ The White House announced a new
affirmative action policy under which minority-owned businesses
will be given an advantage when they compete for government
contracts in industries where surveys show they are
underrepresented but not in industries where they seem to have a
fair share of the market. The policy was devised to meet the terms
of a Supreme Court decision in 1995 that strictly limited the
justification and scope of government programs that grant
preferences based on race or sex. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ In an amendment offered to the
spending bill for the Agriculture Department, the House of
Representatives on Wednesday voted 223-202 to effectively bar the
Food and Drug Administration from approving an abortion pill. The
amendment, offered by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., would ban the FDA
from using federal money to regulate or approve a drug that
chemically induces abortion. It would apply to the drug known as RU
486, the French abortion pill also known as mifepristone. By

   MICROSOFT-SUIT _ To Microsoft Corp., a federal appeals court
ruling in the company's favor on Tuesday was a gratifying triumph
of sweeping import for its long-running antitrust battle with the
government. To the Justice Department and 20 states pitted against
Microsoft, it was merely a bump in the road as they head to court
again in September with a broader antitrust case against the
company. Yet antitrust experts said Wednesday that the
split-decision by the three-judge panel _ a majority opinion
written by a conservative and partial dissent opinion from a
liberal _ was both a big win for Microsoft and a reflection of
wider debate over how antitrust doctrine should apply to
high-technology industries. By Steve Lohr.

COMPUTER AND ME, AND BABY MAKES 3 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, 11:41 p.m.: At this moment, the baby officially turns 9
months old, ready to take advantage of a new trend: software for
the exceedingly young.
</P>
<P>
   My husband examines the packaging on the Jump Start Baby CD-ROM
(ages 9 to 24 months), which I dismiss as a marketing gimmick to
entrap overzealous, achievement-driven parents.
</P>
<P>
   How, after all, can a baby use a computer? By Tuesday morning,
my husband agrees that no ``average'' baby can use a computer. But
what if Clementine isn't just average? What if she is one of those
prodigies? There must be plenty of genius infants and toddlers out
there. Otherwise, why introduce products like this into the
marketplace? We can't afford not to know.
</P>
<P>
   I phone Amy Bruckman, an assistant professor of computing at the
Georgia Institute of Technology who studies how children interact
with computers. While she is unwilling to comment on Clementine's
IQ, Ms. Bruckman confirms that products aimed at encouraging young
children to use computers are a new and growing segment of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend is not just about software,'' Ms. Bruckman says.
``I am starting to see specialized hardware for very young
children. I saw something a few weeks ago that looks like a plastic
toolbox and fits over a keyboard. A child uses it to interact with
the computer.'' She is referring to Hasbro Interactive's Tonka
Workshop CD-ROM Playset, still in development.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that if I do not introduce infant-enhancing software
now to Clementine, she could be totally unprepared in a few months
to graduate to toddler-facilitating hardware. My husband and I
agree that the only sensible thing to do is to conduct a controlled
experiment to see how well the baby tolerates exposure to software.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 8 a.m.: Seated on my lap facing the computer, the
subject appears relaxed and interested as my husband installs Jump
Start Baby. He coos, ``Look, Clembo, Daddy has a CD-ROM. Can you
say C-D-ROM?''
</P>
<P>
   The subject grins toothily. On screen, an animated, cuddly brown
teddy bear appears, crooning: ``Say hello to the sun! It's time to
have some fun.'' The subject laughs aloud (good), lunges for the
keyboard and strikes it with her left fist (good!), an action that
somehow transports the bear to a farm scene, where it stands in
front of a red barn (slightly confusing). The bear is now wearing a
floppy hat similar to those that have proved so flattering to an
aging Walter Matthau.
</P>
<P>
   The subject laughs. ``She likes it,'' my husband says, relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 8:01 a.m.: The subject appears to be losing interest in
Jump Start Baby. She arches her back, bucks wildly while rolling
her eyes and accidentally strikes the keyboard with a tiny (but
meaty) foot, an action that prompts the bear to say, ruefully,
``Good night.'' Eventually, the screen goes black. Infant attempts
to suck on mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 8:04 a.m.: My husband looks up from the instructional
pamphlet that accompanied the software (``Very young children can
create and control the fun themselves!'') to announce worriedly,
``It says here that even an infant as young as 9 months old may
remain engaged for as long as 10 minutes before losing interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In horror, we stare at the subject, who lasted a mere 60
seconds. Does she have an unusually short attention span? The
subject inserts her left foot into her mouth and blows spit bubbles
onto her big toe. She appears unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   The program we glimpsed so briefly has eight different games,
each aimed at promoting a specific kind of development. For
instance, Down on the Farm is supposed to develop listening skills
and music appreciation through its songs and rhymes about farm
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the games we never actually got to see. Puzzle
Time, for instance, ``helps children make sense of their perceptual
world.'' And Dress Teddy ``builds vocabulary of body parts, clothes
and environmental conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to build her vocabulary of body parts,'' I say. I
want it badly.
</P>
<P>
   I phone Knowledge Adventure, the company that manufactures Jump
Start Baby, and am given the phone number of a psychologist,
Corinne Rupert, who has reviewed and critiqued the new product.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, noon: Dr. Rupert, a specialist in child development,
tries to reassure me by pointing out that children as young as
Clementine can vary widely in their rates of development. The
important thing, Dr. Rupert says, is not to measure your baby's
technological prowess against some mythical ideal. The important
thing is to relax.
</P>
<P>
   I'm losing patience. ``Just tell me how to lengthen her
attention span,'' I snap.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rupert considers that. ``Does she grab for the keyboard?''
she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes! She grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she watch the monitor?'' Dr. Rupert says. ``Yes? Then I
would start with something more simple. Maybe a screen saver
activity, like dancing balls or squiggly lines, to start helping
her be able to watch and follow shapes.''
</P>
<P>
   I say thank you, but I feel torn almost as soon as I hang up. My
current determination to subject the baby to a software encounter
is contradictory to a belief I held just as firmly in the days when
my oldest daughter was an infant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, I tried to shield my first baby from the influences of
most technology _ TVs, computers, her father's Water Pik _ on the
theory that__ Well, I cannot remember the reason. I believe _
firmly _ that it had something to do with the dehumanizing effects
of technology. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know this to be false. Technology has given us wireless
baby monitors and microwave ovens to warm bottles and the odorless
diaper pail. ``No studies have been done, but I certainly don't see
any harm in having very young children play at the computer,''
agrees Ms. Bruckman, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ``On
the other side of the coin, I don't see any harm in not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more important question is this: Is it fun? The answer, for
Clementine right now, is yes, absolutely. For about 60 seconds.

to Quake. But on a 200-megahertz machine with a 3Dfx Voodoo 2
board? Cue the choir. The tornado has plucked you out of Kansas and
you have crash-landed in Oz.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, according to Unreal's back story, you are a prisoner
whose spaceship has crashed on a mysterious planet en route to a
penal colony. After exiting the wreckage, you emerge into a world
filled with rippling waters, breathtaking architecture, cavernous
mines and a menagerie of gothic beasts. Ninety percent of the fauna
are trying to kill you. But that seems a small price to pay for
such breathtaking beauty. Overhead, cirrus clouds race across the
sky, casting shadows on the ground. A bird of prey circles in the
distance. An alien rabbit (one of the few nonhomicidal creatures on
this planet) scampers on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge world. If you fire your gun across a chasm, the
bullet takes a long time to hit the other side. If you drop
something off a cliff, it takes a long time to smash on the ground.
And you hear it a split second after you see it _ light travels
faster than sound. Sound acts the way it should in this world. It
bounces differently indoors and outdoors, in tunnels, over water
and off stone walls, taking into account the number of obstructions
in a room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what it says on the box, this world isn't unreal. It's
hyperreal. Everything you see and hear has been sharpened.
Crystallized. Heightened. Torch flickers seem more flamelike than
real fire. Water is more watery. Footsteps are crisper. Large
exhaust fans are backlighted with just the right amount of dust in
the room so the blades cast perfect cinematic shadows.
</P>
<P>
   And every so often, even though this is supposed to be virtual
reality, you'll see an artifact of film. A lens flare. Coronas
around the lamps. The ghosts of another medium. When the action
changes, the lighting changes the way it would in a film, and the
soundtrack changes. If you're walking down a corridor and the music
suddenly stops, you know something really bad is about to happen.
That's the difference between real and Unreal: great
postproduction. If you could hire Industrial Light and Magic to
render your perceptions, that is how you would see the world.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to play with reality in film, you have to be a
director. If you want to tinker with it in Unreal, all you have to
do is hit the Options menu. You control the horizontal. You control
the vertical. You control most aspects of the space-time continuum,
as well as the number and relative intelligence of your enemies.
The most interesting thing to toggle is game speed, which you can
set anywhere from turbo (for the die-hard twitch fiends) to slow
motion (for people whose reflexes are less than razor sharp). If
you slow the action, the software automatically adds frames to
smooth the animation. If you play in extremely slow motion with
tons of monsters, the whole game plays out like a John Woo movie.
</P>
<P>
   When you are through playing in this world, you can build your
own. The people who programmed this game left all their
construction tools on the disk in a kit called Unreal Ed, the
Unreal level editor. It used to be that if you wanted to build your
own levels of a PC game, you had to be a programmer. Now all you
have to do is point and click.
</P>
<P>
   It's the holodeck, more or less. You start with a
three-dimensional grid. You import geometric shapes and give them
properties _ height, radius, translucency and reflectiveness _ then
make them solid or not, visible or not. You have more than 3,000
textures to choose from as you cast texture onto the surfaces, or
you can use your own. Stone. Water. Lava. Sky. Add light, in any
permutation of color, saturation and brightness. All of it is
rendered on the fly. If you move a torch around in a room, you will
see the light on the walls change in real time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of heart-pounding action in Unreal. But making
the sky is what really leaves you breathless. You turn on the
stars, put the planets in place, set the clouds in motion. You hang
the moon (A little to the right. . . . No, that's too far. . . .
Just a bit higher. . . . There. . . . Perfect).
</P>
<P>
   Cue the sun.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you have two options. You can populate your
planet with artificially intelligent monsters. Or you can invite
your friends and associates over for a multiplayer online death
match. Judging from the proliferating number of Unreal Web sites,
the latter appears to be a more popular option. Because the only
thing more fun than wreaking havoc on a gorgeous alien planet is
wreaking havoc on your friends on a planet that you have personally
built.
</P>
<P>
   At unreal.org, unrealnation.com or any of the big online game
servers, new pieces of this world are being uploaded, downloaded
and swapped daily. Players are pulling together Unreal instant
messaging lists. New monsters are being born (in one home-brewed
version of the game, the alien bunnies have become deadly
attackers, a la Monty Python).
</P>
<P>
   People are giving one another construction tips, renovation
advice and suggestions about the feng shui of virtual buildings.
It's like a cyberpunk version of ``This Old House.'' You can pick
up new objects for your game space or see how other people are
using texture and lighting effects. In 10 years, Martha Stewart
will be selling wallpaper this way. We will all be able to fly
through her well-pruned gardens. With automatic weapons. Death
match at the Stewart manse.
</P>
<P>
   We have the technology. Dare to dream.

MILD CLEANERS ARE BEST FOR A COMPUTER SCREEN

   Q. I've been reluctant to wipe off my computer screen when it
gets dusty, fearing that I might damage sensitive equipment. What
can I use to clean it? A. Many computer monitors have an antiglare
coating on the glass surface of the screen. Strong cleaning fluids,
mildly abrasive cloths or excessive rubbing _ while great for
removing sticky fingerprints _ can scratch or dissolve the
protective coating.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer stores sell pads, sprays and fluids designed for
use on video-display screens. Some products, while a little
pricier, include both a prepackaged wet pad (soaked in a
combination cleaning and antistatic solution) and a lint-free dry
pad (to remove stubborn spots and leave the screen free of
streaks).
</P>
<P>
   In a pinch (financial or otherwise), you can clean your
monitor's screen with a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with water
or a mild glass cleaner. Paper towels may leave lint all over the
glass, so avoid using them. If you use a spray bottle, spray the
liquid onto the cloth, not directly onto the screen. Gently wipe
the screen until it is dry and then enjoy the view.

SOME OF THE ANTICIPATED BIG BOOKS OF FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos dishes dirt, Nicholas Evans follows up
``The Horse Whisperer,'' and Danielle Steel takes a risk by writing
about the death of her 19-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   What else is in store for book lovers this fall? For starters,
new works from established authors Philip Roth, Ellen Gilchrist,
Paul Theroux and John Edgar Wideman.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah. Dame Agatha Christie returns from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE QUALITY BOOKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Philip Roth's ``American Pastoral'' won the lion's share of last
year's fiction awards. He returns in October with ``I Married a
Communist,'' (Houghton Mifflin, $26), the wrenching tale of a
decent man whose past political life returns to haunt him during
the McCarthy witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Gilchrist's ``Flight of Angels'' (Little, Brown, $24,
September) is a collection of finely crafted short stories that
ought to put her in the hunt for Pulitzer consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Theroux's apparent equal love of travel and himself has
rendered some of his recent work unpalatable, though never
unreadable. ``Sir Vidia's Shadow'' (Houghton Mifflin, $24, October)
recounts the author's long friendship with fellow scribe V.S.
Naipaul. If Theroux is on his game, this could be the winter's best
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because his writing is so dense, multifaceted and apparently
convoluted, John Edgar Wideman is not destined for the upper
reaches of any bestseller lists. But the man is a literary master.
``Two Cities'' (Houghton Mifflin, $24, September) tracks a woman's
life through tragedy and subsequent emotional rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST SELLERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Three years after ``The Horse Whisperer,'' Nicholas Evans is
``ba-a-ack'' with ``The Loop'' (Delacorte, $25.95, September),
another modern-day Western yarn about a seemingly unsuited man and
woman finding each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter in Arcadia'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.95, October) is
more heartwarming (or stomach-turning, depending on your
disposition) short fiction from Richard Paul Evans, the fella who
wrote ``The Christmas Box'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   The most curious publishing event is a doubleheader from
Danielle Steel. In November, fans can savor ``Mirror Image''
(Delacorte, $26.95), a typical Steel potboiler about two sisters
who are ... guess-whats of each other. But first, Steel offers
``His Bright Light'' (Delacorte, $25, September), a painfully
personal account of the life and death of Nick Traina, her
19-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG NAMES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Cornwell has sold gazillions of her noirish Kay
Scarpetta mysteries. For Christmas she offers ``Scarpetta's Winter
Table'' (Putnam, $18.95), an 80-page novella about one Dec. 25th in
the lives of Scarpetta, niece Lucy and pal/sparring partner Pete
Marino. No case to solve as such, just a brief look at the three
chugging eggnog.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Parker's back, but not with old reliable Spenser.
``Trouble in Paradise'' (Putnam, $22.95, September) is the second
time around for new lead character Jesse Stone. Spenser could whip
this guy with both hands tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   The newest by James Patterson is ``When the Wind Blows''
(Little, Brown, $25, November), action-packed enough to please his
most ardent fans.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Francis takes us back to the racetrack with ``Field of
Thirteen'' (Putnam, $24.95, September), a short-story collection.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter-century, gonzo journalist Hunter S.
Thompson has been working ``The Rum Diaries'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$25, October), purportedly based on his early experiences as a
free-lance writer based in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SLEEPERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen Schine's ``The Evolution of Jane'' (Houghton Mifflin,
$24, October) describes the estrangement between cousins. ``The
Love Letters'' gained Schine some attention; perhaps ``Evolution''
will be her breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Life for a Life'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23, August) may
introduce lots more readers to Ernest Hill. It's the story of an
inner-city father who ends up befriending the teen-aged murderer of
his son.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FICTION &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Dame Agatha Christie departed this mortal coil in 1976, but she
has a ``new'' book coming out in September anyway. ``Black Coffee''
(St. Martin's Press, $22.95) was originally presented 58 years ago
as a three-act play featuring Hercule Poirot. London-based theater
critic Charles Osborne has adapted the stage drama for book format.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mosley made his mark with the Easy Rawlins mystery
series. Now he offers ``Blue Light'' (Little, Brown, $23, October),
drama-cum-sci fi about a mysterious cosmic beam that ``quickens''
DNA for some California residents in the mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hill Country'' (Longstreet, $25, October) is the sequel to
Janice Woods Windle's unexpected bestseller ``True Women.'' Meet
Laura Hoge Woods, who, in her 90s, advises LBJ on how to end the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' own Kinky Friedman weighs in with ``Blast From the Past''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23, September), with the semifictional lead
character Kinky hitting his head and reliving previous escapades.
</P>
<P>
   James D. Hall introduces us to forensic photographer Alexandra
Rafferty in ``Body Language'' (St. Martin's, $24, September). Hall
has never quite reached the upper sales echelon. Maybe his new lead
character will get him there.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith's ``The Long, Sandy Hair of Neftoon
Zamora'' (St. Martin's, $24.95, November) is not expected to rival
last year's ``Cold Mountain'' as a critically acclaimed first
novel. Plus, Davy and Mickey and Peter aren't in it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NONFICTION &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some of us thought we already knew more about Cher than we
really wanted or needed to, but the venerable chanteuse wants to
bare all in print, not just in skimpy dresses. ``The First Time''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) hits bookstores in November, one month
after Little, Brown publishes ``Family Outing'' ($24), the memoir
of Chastity Bono, a lesbian who works for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   A. Scott Berg's ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius'' was wonderful.
In ``Lindbergh'' (Putnam, $30, September), he turns his attention
to one of America's most troubled, yet revered, heroes.
</P>
<P>
   James Chase profiles ``Acheson: The Secretary of State Who
Created the American World'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $30, August). Dean
Acheson's world stage machinations still affect us, and Chase
reminds us why and how.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guralnick's ``Last Train to Memphis'' is considered the
definitive portrait of Elvis Presley's early years. Now he's back
with ``Careless Love'' (Little, Brown, $27.95, December),
delineating The King's sad middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to dish dirt than former Clinton adviser George
Stephanopoulos? His ``All Too Human'' (Little, Brown, $27.95,
November) promises ``sharp portraits'' of Bill and Hill, VP Al Gore
and Gen. Colin Powell, among soon-to-be-offended others.

FOR LOS ANGELES YOUTHS, LESSONS IN ARCHITECTURE AND LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Merchant Street is a tattered row of produce
warehouses and auto body shops, its littered sidewalks and cracked
street home to the poor and to drug addicts. This is not a pretty
part of town, but here in the heart of what is known as skid row is
a jewel.
</P>
<P>
   At the back of an asphalt parking lot, in a wall decorated with
dancing colored letters, a door gives a view into a charming urban
courtyard. A cheerful ceramic fountain amid ripening orange trees
and palm trees is covered in hand-painted hearts, fruits, flowers
and birds. Youngsters often clean their paintbrushes under the
spray. Running almost the length of the courtyard is the glass
front facade of a large, bow-trussed building. On any given day, a
circle of children sits inside, absorbed in painting
self-portraits.
</P>
<P>
   This is Inner City Arts, a nonprofit arts school that is both an
enlightened model for arts education and a design landmark where
education is embellished by architectural example. Inner City Arts,
founded in 1989, provides visual and performing arts classes and
English language instruction to students from public elementary
schools _ largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and
Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The school was founded by Bob Bates, an artist and teacher, and
Irwin Jaeger, a Beverly Hills real estate investor who decided
there had to be more to life, as he put it, ``than working, taking
vacations and going to charity dinners.'' Their aim was to fill a
void in arts education created by Proposition 13, a property tax
cut initiative approved 20 years ago this month by California
voters that slashed financing for public services and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following the passage, said Beth Tishler, the
school's executive director, virtually ``all arts curriculum was
eliminated from the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 200 nonprofit arts programs in Los
Angeles, many considered excellent, but Inner City Arts is rare in
that it boasts, in its converted 8,000-square-foot auto body shop,
an inspiring home, where the architecture elevates the social and
arts-education experiences. The building, officially called the
Mark Taper Center/Inner City Arts, was designed by Michael Maltzan
Architecture, in collaboration with Marmol &AMP; Radziner Architecture
and Construction.
</P>
<P>
   Maltzan, a protege of Frank Gehry and the project architect on
the Disney Concert Hall planned for downtown Los Angeles, said that
he felt compelled ``to do something'' after the city's 1992 riots
and that he did the work pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. was my adopted city,'' he said. ``To see it rip itself
apart was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   At the school, what the architects accomplished is a building
that is expansive, airy _ with light pouring in through its vast
window wall _ and bold in its sculptural forms. The plan, described
by Maltzan as ``a village of objects'' around a central courtyard,
affords views from one area to another _ ``limitless horizons,''
Maltzan says _ as well as flexibility: spaces are constantly used
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The design is also an object lesson in construction. Children
study the raw surfaces _ the unadorned brick walls, the timber
frame partly clad in plasterboard, the exposed trusses, the
industrial roll-up garage doors. They draw inspiration for their
own drawings and paintings from the strong, simple shapes. ``Kids
use the building as material for some of their art projects,'' Ms.
Tishler said. ``They talk about how the building was put together,
the ways in which they contribute to the changing and molding of
the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children live in lamentable conditions in apartments for
transients or in housing projects. ``I love it _ it's big''; ``it's
fun''; ``it has pictures all around,'' were some reactions of a
group of 7-year-olds on a recent visit. Nick Estrada, 18, a former
pupil and now a volunteer there, said, ``Inner City Arts is my
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner City
Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools
who attend classes twice a week for six weeks. More schools are
clamoring to be included. In 1994, the school moved from two
temporary bungalows to its current premises, at 720 South Kohler
Street (one entrance is off Merchant Street). It has bought two
adjacent industrial buildings and intends to triple in size, with
plans that include animation studios.
</P>
<P>
   The school _ now backed by an impressive list of donors, like
the National Endowment for the Arts and the Mark Taper Foundation,
which supports, among other things, social services and the arts _
has a unique relationship with the Los Angeles Unified School
District. The district provides transportation and security and has
helped the school create a program for teaching English through
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This private-public partnership is a national model,'' said
Leticia Quezada, a past president of the Los Angeles Board of
Education. ``The quality of the arts experience the children are
receiving is phenomenal, 400 percent better than it would be in the
school classroom. There's a sense of confidence in the arts
experience those children are getting, and we want to see it
extended to other schools.''

 LOS ANGELES: other schools.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks in part to programs like this, attitudes toward arts
education have begun to change. Buoyed by a revived economy,
California politicians have, like their national counterparts, put
education on the front burner. And arts education has crept back
onto the agenda in part because of lobbying from the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great demand for talented visual artists, but
unfortunately we have to get people from outside California and the
U.S.,'' said Scott Ross, a co-founder, with the director James
Cameron, of Digital Domain, a visual effects studio in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction,
has called for the restoration of arts education in California
public schools. And last March the Los Angeles school district
passed stringent graduation requirements citywide in visual arts,
music, theater and dance, for kindergarten through grade 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part now is the implementation,'' said Don Dustin,
the district's director of visual and performing arts. ``We do not
have the resources, the background, the personnel.'' Inner City
Arts, only nine years ago a modest alternative, does.
</P>
<P>
   After the construction of Inner City Arts, Maltzan designed a
new arts complex, completed in March, at Harvard/Westlake School, a
private, affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood. It
is an equally forceful architectural composition of art rooms and
art gallery. Perhaps most important, the buildings surround a
much-used communal plaza. Enrollment in art classes has increased
since the recent opening.
</P>
<P>
   While Inner City Arts may be a curricular model, it is less
likely to be an architectural one. Because many public schools are
struggling simply to keep roofs from leaking and bathrooms cleaned,
concern for the surroundings as an educational asset is not a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Inner City Arts and Harvard-Westlake, Maltzan initially
faced resistance to lavishing effort on the architecture. At Inner
City Arts, he said, ``they were used to living off donated paper.''
At Harvard-Westlake, the school deemed teachers and computers
paramount and architecture as enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In lay people's minds and the minds of most trustees,'' said
Thomas Hudnut, Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, ``architecture
implies added expense. It's not until someone catches the contagion
of creativity and inspiration of architecture that one appreciates
what it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   At present the challenge is to get art back into the schools.
Perhaps architecture will follow.

 &HT;    INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS: U.S. EXPOSED TO DIGITAL 'PEARL HARBOR'
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two top U.S. intelligence officials warned
Wednesday that the nation faces grave danger of ``an electronic
Pearl Harbor'' _ a surprise attack launched in cyberspace by an
enemy state or terrorist band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information warfare has the potential to deal a crippling blow
to our national security if we do not take strong measures to
counter it,'' CIA Director George Tenet told a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   With computer networks running much of the U.S. economy, ``our
electric power grids and our telecommunications networks will be
targets of the first order'' in an Information Age war, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An adversary capable of implanting the right virus, or
accessing the right terminal, can cause massive damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Tenet said, the United States lacks any adequate
means to protect the integrity of vital public and private
databases, such as those that record billions of dollars in
financial transactions every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such system in place, and the private sector and
the government have the responsibility to work towards this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's fears were echoed by Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan,
director of the supersecret National Security Agency, who noted
that today's heavy reliance on linked computer systems continues to
grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these advantages of electronic commerce are growing, our
technical ability to network has outpaced our ability to protect
those networks,'' Minihan said. This, he said, presents ``our
adversaries (with) a window of opportunity for an electronic Pearl
Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply hoping that someday we can add the needed security
before it's too late is not a strategy,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan said the nation needed a ``national information
assurance strategy'' that is far from being in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these things have been said (before),'' Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, told the witnesses. ``But ... when the head of the CIA
and the NSA come in and use terms such as 'urgent' and use the
Pearl Harbor analogy and so forth, I think that that speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet told the committee that two other major cyberspace issues
_ encryption policies and the so-called ``millennium bug'' were
linked to the dangers of electronic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged standoff between the FBI and the software industry
over whether to grant the government a digital ``back door'' to
``recover'' encoded Internet communications was harming national
security, Tenet charged.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the feuding parties cut a deal, he predicted, ``we're
going to get a major terrorist event and we're going to mandate''
encryption controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a train wreck ready to happen unless we deal with the
recovery piece of this encryption debate. It sure is going to
happen,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``millennium bug,'' which could lead some older
computers to malfunction when they try to process dates beyond
2000, also raises concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign specialists hired to fix the bug could use their
access to implant coding that could be triggered in a future
conflict to destroy or provide access to vital information, Tenet
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan agreed ``that there's no question that there's a
national security relevance'' to the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Sen. Joseph Lieberman. D-Conn., who received
classified briefings from Tenet and Minihan on Tuesday, trod
delicately into an area rarely discussed in open hearings: the
Pentagon's own ability to wage an offensive cyberwar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Lieberman whether they could ``assure people of the
country'' that ``we have a developed information warfare offensive
capacity,'' Tenet replied: ``Well, we're the wrong people to ask,
but we can assure them that we're not asleep at the switch in this
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman saw a potential cyberspace parallel to the ``mutual
assured destruction'' doctrine of the Cold War era in which neither
the United States nor the Soviet Union ever could risk a first
strike for fear of being destroyed in a retaliatory hail of nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to panic people,'' Lieberman concluded. ``But
this is ... a whole new order of security threat, and we ought to
be able to figure out how to get together and defend against it.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: But it isn't cola that has had caffeine added to it,
and then has been processsed again to take the caffine back out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the recent meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, a
statement was adopted stating that wives should submit graciously
to their husbands, and the husbands would provide for, protect and
lead their families. How many of those voting were female?
</P>
<P>
   A: An exact breakdown isn't available. The total number of
``messengers,'' as those attending conventions are called, was
8,586. No roll call was taken at the time of the vote on the
marriage and family statement, said Art Tolston of Baptist Press in
Nashville. So it isn't known precisely how many people were in the
hall at that time, ``let alone how many were men or women,'' he
told Q&AMP;A. The vote was taken by a show of hands, and was described
as being ``overwhelming'' in favor of the statement's adoption,
Tolston added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have dual questions dealing with the NBA. What team did
Phil Jackson, coach of the Chicago Bulls, play for in his pro
career? Also, during the Indiana Pacers series, why were the Pacers
wearing black armbands?
</P>
<P>
   A: The son of a minister, Jackson studied religion at the
University of North Dakota, where he also was a two-time
All-American. He spent 11 years with the New York Knicks, where he
was a member of the 1970 and 1973 championship teams as a backup to
center Willis Reed, and two years as an assistant coach/player with
the New Jersey Nets. The Pacers' armbands were worn in memory of
Bill Hart, longtime team employee and, most recently, its equipment
manager. Hart died of cancer April 14 at age 73.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was announced recently that a Swiss and American venture
was planning to finance and build a full-size replica of the
Titanic. Any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there are two competing plans for a new Titanic.
White Star Line Ltd., a company set up by a consultancy firm based
on Basle, Switzerland, and Las Vegas financiers, says it wants to
build such a ship and launch it on a maiden voyage from
Southampton, England, to New York in April 2002. That would be
exactly 90 years after the original set sail. The firm has held
talks with Northern Ireland's Harland and Wolff, builders of the
original Titanic, and said in May it was hoping to sign a deal
within several months on a preplanning phase for the project. The
replica's exterior would look like the original Titanic, but it
would have modern engines, instrumentation and safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a company based in South Africa, RMS Titanic Shipping
Holdings, also has announced plans for a Titanic replica. It would
be built in Durban, South Africa, to the ``exact specifications''
of the original, but with high-tech engines, navigation and global
communications facilities. The vessel would make its initial voyage
Dec. 29, 1999, a date the company called ``the eve of the new
millennium.'' The South Africa company said Harland and Wolff would
be consultants on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies admit that their interest in constructing a new
Titanic was fueled by the phenomenal success of the blockbuster
Oscar-winning movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article listed 29 winners of MacArthur Foundation
``genius grants.'' I've also heard the MacArthurs mentioned
frequently as contributors to National Public Radio. Who are or
were they?
</P>
<P>
   A: John D. MacArthur (1897-1978) developed and owned Bankers
Life and Casualty Co. When he died, he was one of the three
wealthiest men in the United States and was sole owner of the
nation's largest privately held insurance company. In the 1960s,
MacArthur branched out into real estate and development. Over the
years, his holdings have included 100,000 acres in Florida,
primarily in the Palm Beach and Sarasota areas; several development
companies and shopping centers; paper and pulp companies; 19
commercial, office and apartment buildings in New York City;
several publishing enterprises; radio and TV stations; banks and 12
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Catherine T. MacArthur (1909-81), was intimately
involved in her husband's business, starting by keeping the books.
When he bought Bankers Life and Casualty Co. of Chicago in 1935,
she created the business procedures that would be used until
tremendous growth finally made them obsolete. In the records of the
various companies, she appears almost anonymously under her maiden
name (C.T. Hyland) in the positions of corporate secretary,
director or both.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the world population now? I keep seeing and hearing
varying numbers, some as high as 100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's International Programs
Center, the total population of the world, projected to 18:28:47
GMT (2:28:47 p.m. EDT) June 16, was 5,923,383,463. They figure that
every second, five people are born and two people die, a net gain
of three people. If you have Internet access, you can keep up with
the World Population Clock at this site:
www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/popclockw
</P>
<P>
   Q: A radio commentator said June 16 is ``Soweto Day,'' but
didn't explain what it was all about. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Also known as International Day of Solidarity With the
Struggling People of South Africa, Soweto Day is sponsored by the
United Nations. It commemorates the start of the uprising in the
huge South African township of Soweto in 1976, when a student
protest led to clashes with police in which hundreds of people were
killed. When it was begun, Soweto Day's aim was to protest outrage
at South Africa's apartheid policies.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (Eds: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I never miss a Rita Hayworth or Betty Grable movie on TV, but
I seem to have missed the announcement of a new postmaster general.
Do you have any information about this person?
</P>
<P>
   A: William J. Henderson, 50, was named the 71st postmaster
general of the United States effective May 12. Henderson is the
first postal employee to have the top U.S. Postal Service position
in 12 years. A graduate of the University of North Carolina, he
began his postal career as a management trainee in 1972. Over the
years, he has been a postmaster in Memphis and Stockton, Calif.;
field division manager/postmaster of the USPS's Greensboro, N.C.,
division; Southern Region director of employee and labor relations;
and chief marketing officer and senior vice president. Henderson
replaced Marvin Runyon, who resigned after six years to return to
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the saying ``Here's mud in your eye!''
when toasting someone?
</P>
<P>
   A: The toast originally was made in the muddy trenches of World
War I, or in the cafes where English and American soldiers spent
their furloughs trying to forget them, according to the Facts on
File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 5-year-old grandson and I were wondering: When was the
first cartoon series shown on TV, and what was it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Telecomics originated as a syndicated series in 1949.
Picked up by NBC and renamed The NBC Comics, it made its network
debut Sept. 18, 1950. Featured characters included Brother Goose,
Joey and Jug, Johnny and Mr. Do-Right, Kid Champion and Space
Barton. The series was canceled March 30, 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please settle a minor skirmish in my family. Are the people
who broadcast the weather onThe Weather Channel all meteorologists,
or are they simply paid announcers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps you could say they're hybrids. When The Weather
Channel first started, it used ``degreed meteorologists'' almost
exclusively, said spokeswoman Kathy Lane. Now, however, other
people also are hired. ``They have to have a passion for weather,
and be good communicators,'' she said. A lot of the people you see
have degrees in science, journalism or broadcasting, and some come
from the armed forces ``where meteorology plays a big role,'' Lane
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why were the ``doughboys'' of World War I called that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although the nickname doughboy for U.S. infantrymen was
popularized in World War I, it was part of Army slang for many
years before that, according to the Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins. Elizabeth Custer, widow of Gen. George (``Custer's
Last Stand'') Custer, explained it this way in her memoirs of the
general: ``A doughboy was a small, round doughnut. Early in the
Civil War, the term was applied to the large, globular brass
buttons on the infantry uniform, from which it passed by natural
transition to the soldiers themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is Ted Turner's ranch in New Mexico? How does it
compare in size to the entire state? And how does it compare to
something most of us would be familiar with, such as the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park?
</P>
<P>
   A: Turner has several ranches in New Mexico: Vermejo, 578,000
acres; Ladder, 155,000; and Armendaris, 350,000. Total, 1,083,000
acres. The state covers 77,672,960 acres (121,364 square miles).
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park covers 520,269 acres.
Turner also owns ranches in Montana and Nebraska. The total acreage
of all eight ranches in the West, according to the New York Times,
is 1.29 million. That would be about 2,015 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The shroud of Turin is back in the news because of its last
public showing until 2000. Have any miracles ever been attributed
to it?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean ``miracles'' in the sense of sick or injured
people being cured by viewing or touching the shroud, which many
believe is Christ's burial cloth, Q&AMP;A found no documented evidence.
But the very fact that the shroud was saved in April 1997 from
flames that heavily damaged the 15th century San Giovanni Cathedral
in Turin, Italy, was considered miraculous by no less than Pope
John Paul II. After the fire, in which a Turin firefighter salvaged
a silver box containing the shroud, the pope was quoted as saying:
``A miracle. A holy icon venerated by so many over the centuries
has again been saved from the flames.'' The firefighter who smashed
through four layers of bulletproof glass protecting the shroud also
claimed something miraculous had happened by saying God gave him
the strength to wield his sledgehammer. The shroud _ which some
experts, using carbon dating, have declared isn't old enough to
have been woven at the time of Jesus' death _ also survived at
least two other attempts to set fire to the Turin cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some utility companies ask for customers' Social Security
numbers when they apply for service. When I first got my Social
Security number in 1959, the card had this statement printed on it:
Not to be used for identification purposes. What's the position
now?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the Social Security Administration is aware of concerns
about the increasing uses of Social Security numbers for client
identification and recordkeeping purposes, it still warns people
not to use their Social Security card as an identification card.
And while several other government agencies are permitted by law to
use Social Security numbers _ such as banks and other financial
institutions using the numbers to report interest earned to the
Internal Revenue Service _ there's no law either authorizing or
prohibiting their use, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you feel better, Social Security insists that
providing numbers to private companies, government agencies or
anyone else who asks for them doesnot give them access to your
Social Security records. The privacy of an individual's records is
guaranteed, the agency says, unless disclosure to another
government agency is required by law, or the information is needed
to conduct Social Security or other government health or welfare
programs. And you always have the option of refusing to provide the
number to a business or other enterprise. However, that may mean
doing without the purchase or service for which your number was
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Vice President Al Gore referred to Michael
Jordan as Michael Jackson, but I didn't see anything about it in
the papers. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: The verbal air ball indeed did happen. And no, we won't
mention any similar Dan Quayle-isms. Here's how Gore's remarks went
when he was speaking at a Washington function, as reported by CNN's
``Inside Politics'':
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite a win. I tell you, that Michael Jackson is
unbelievable. Isn't he _ just unbelievable. Three plays in 20
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Commentator Judy Woodruff followed a video clip of the incident
by saying, ``Well, that probably was just a slip of the tongue, but
it is doubtful that Al Gore impressed anybody, at an event
promoting the importance of fathers, with his knowledge of
basketball's greatest star. The vice president apparently confused
Michael Jordan with another M.J. known for songs, not slam dunks.''
And no word about whether Gore ever apologized to anybody about the
miscue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read an explanation about how coffee is decaffeinated. What
is the process for taking caffeine out of cola?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no such thing as ``decaffeinated cola,'' said Chris
Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a
nutritionist and professor at Georgia State University. When colas
(soft drinks) are first produced, they are virtually
``caffeine-free.'' Caffeine is added later ``as part of the flavor
profile,'' in the words of the National Soft Drink Association. Of
course there is such a thing as ``caffine-free'' cola for people
who wish to restrict their caffeine intake. But it isn't cola that
has had caffeine added to it, and then has been processsed again to
take the caffine back out.

 &UR; (1,600 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By RAQUEL E. PELZEL
 &UR; From Consumers Digest magazine &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Summer pleasures can easily turn into summer pain for the
unwary. Pelzel discusses how to avoid and treat the many

 &UR; By PETER F. STEVENS &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, Shahin would like to provide summer
vacationers with sage advice on how to pack. But the truth is,
Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't
pack his bags. His wife does. This arrangement, he believes, is
quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   While family reunions offer a unique opportunity to reconnect
with one's kin, they also can bring to the fore all the simmering
tensions in a family. Do you invite the black sheep? Should you
finally unveil the big family secret? Crichton addresses these
issues, and offers a hilarious bonus in collaboration with Miss

<P>
   Family reunions often spark curiosity about one's ancestors.
With a bit of detective work, using oral interviews, government
records, genealogical associations, libraries and the Internet, the
family tree can be pieced together. Tannenbaum provides an

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

ART SCHOOL GRADUATE RE-INVENTS THE LOOK OF WALLPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took 12 years for Elizabeth Dow to perfect a
method of hand-painting wallpapers so subtly that they appear to
glow from within, like a letter held up to a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask her how she did it. Everything about the process _
from the recipe cards for the pigments of her imagination to her
glues and the shape of the drying fans _ is a secret guarded as
zealously as the formula for Chanel No. 5. Employees, even summer
interns, are required to sign nondisclosure agreements; patents are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you find something that works using materials that anyone
can buy, you have an edge that's proprietary,'' said Ms. Dow, 40,
(Hint: she uses a squeegee.) Ms. Dow trained as an artist but fell
in love with the business of making wallpaper when she was in her
20s. Ms. Dow has a knack for perfecting the way things get done;
she says she inherited it from her grandfather, an inventor of
conveyor belts for eggs, among other creations.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she's protective: Ms. Dow is re-inventing the look of
wallpaper. Hers are a far cry from the lilac bouquets running up
and down grandma's walls. Whether it's a sage parchment, a
pewter-colored paint that's hand-rubbed into rice paper or a
collage of translucent squares each dyed individually and arrayed
on a field of muted green, Ms. Dow's papers have a modern integrity
that's anything but mechanistic. Irregularities, the slight
slippages of paper on paper and the uneven edges showing a human
hand at work bestow a sensual minimalism perfectly in tune with
today's more-of-less interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dow is riding the crest of wallpaper's bouyant new appeal.
While the industry overall has remained steady at $2 billion in
sales a year, the boutique end of the wallpaper business _ where
most of the papers are screened, printed, blocked or painted by
hand _ is expanding rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the increased interest in fashion for the home,''
said Marita Thomas, the editor of The Wallpaper, the trade
newsletter. The Imperial Home Decor Group, the Ohio company that
says it's the largest wallcovering business in the world, reported
a 200 percent increase in the sale of some papers in its top-end
Van Luit line ($55 to $90 a roll), with overall sales jumping from
$200 million to $400 million between 1996 and 1998. Stark Carpets,
a premier rug manufacturer, just introduced its first line of
wallpapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an `old lady' thing anymore,'' said Ms. Dow, whose
hand-painted wallpapers hang in the homes of such un-grandmotherly
types as Michael Ovitz, Steve Winn, Calvin Klein and Paul Simon, as
well as in the boardroom of the Andy Warhol Foundation and a
high-roller suite at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The translucency of color she achieves has a hand-washed
effect that's especially beautiful,'' said Jamie Drake, the
interior designer who is now working on Madonna's Manhattan
apartment. ``There aren't many choices when it comes to the luxury
end of modern wallpapers. The texture and geometric patterning
really set hers apart.''
</P>
<P>
   High-end often means high-priced, comparable to buying art for
the walls. Ms. Dow's labor-intensive papers, made at her workshop
in SoHo and sold in showrooms across the country, are priced from
$29 to $80 a yard. To paper the walls of an 18-by-20-foot room with
a $48-a-yard paper would cost about $4,500, even before the
installers arrive. ``This is the couture end of wallpapers, said
Robert Bitter, the co-president of Scalamandre, who added that
handmade wallpapers provide a measure of instant gratification for
those who are enthusiastic about custom painting but have a hard
time envisioning what a mural will look like. ``Most people want to
see exactly what they're going to get ahead of time,'' Bitter said.
``It's easier to choose a wallpaper pattern from a sample book and
get it installed without all the mess and the fumes of a major
paint job.''
</P>
<P>
   There's high-end wallpaper, and then there's extreme wallpaper.
Sanderson sells William Morris' ``Acanthus'' pattern, at $2,300 per
roll, using the original handblocks used by Morris, the founding
father of the Arts and Crafts Movement in England. Each panel
requires 20 blocks and 20 days to print.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper has a long history of ups and downs in popularity. In
the 1880s, wallpapers were all the rage. Morris created
hand-blocked prints with dense foliage patterns that are still
favorites for stairways and powder rooms. Edith Wharton loathed
wallpaper. ``It was well for the future of house decoration when
medical science declared itself against the use of wallpaper,''
Miss Wharton wrote in ``The Decoration of Houses.'' Ever the
aristocrat, she favored frescoes or tapestries interspersed between
bois de Versailles paneling.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, wallpapers had been relegated to kitchens and
bathrooms, where anti-ornamental modernists allowed themselves to
indulge in a few loopy atomic-style patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional interiors have always laid on the chintz patterns,
especially when papering second and third bedrooms. Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis coveted exquisitely expensive scenic papers by
Zuber from France and caused an uproar when she had a rare example
removed from an historic house in Maryland and installed in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of Ms. Dow's SoHo factory-atelier, some 30 employees _
many of them recent art-school graduates _ can be seen bent over
long tables, elbows high as they rub in the paint on hundreds of
rolls of wallpaper a week. Ms. Dow herself has traded in her
painter's overalls for a black-and-white working artist look.
</P>
<P>
   From an office cluttered with sample rolls, cartons of ferns
from Nepal (used in a collage paper) and cold cups of coffee, she
contemplated luxury wallpaper's recent comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you paint directly onto the wall, it looks hard,'' she
said. ``Something is lacking in terms of depth and warmth of color,
and people feel that.'' In keeping with the ``last gasp of the
millennium'' penchant for authenticity (or its appearance), she
said, ``no one wants an effect that's heavy-handed anymore or that
looks like it was trowled on,'' adding, ``It's too theatrical.'' At
the same time, thanks to the influence of globally focused
interior-design magazines and style books, people are ready and
eager to explore beyond the all-white wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dow's own distinctive sense of color is as strong and clear
as a signature on a will. She developed it over five neck-breaking
years as a restoration painter, working on Victorian museum houses.
``It was extremely challenging,'' Ms. Dow said, recalling her
immersion course in complementary shades. ``I was constantly mixing
colors, sometimes 50 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   At her own weekend house, built last year in East Hampton, N.Y.,
Ms. Dow has used her favorite palette of muted colors _ saturated
dusky shades of blue, green and clay gray that one might imagine
existing at the edge of a desert in spring bloom. Surprisingly, the
single-story house is not plastered room after room with wallpaper.
First, there aren't really any rooms, apart from two bedrooms at
each end of a long rectangular central block that houses the living
room, dining space, kitchen and library alcove. It has 12-foot
ceilings and French doors instead of windows making it feel more
like an Austrian villa than a weekend house.
</P>
<P>
   The mottled blue, green and concrete-colored hues of the Italian
floor tiles used throughout the house (and flowing outside to the
courtyard) bring to mind handfuls of dried pigment scattered on the
ground. ``There's a dusty quality to them that's very soft and
natural-looking,'' Ms. Dow said, comparing their random colorations
to her own collage papers.
</P>
<P>
   For the living room walls, she chose art works, like Ellen
Carey's Polaroid print negative that's over six feet tall and
colorless. ``I deal with wallpaper 48 hours a day,'' Ms. Dow said.
``I wanted to give myself a break, a creative respite. Art is my
first love.''
</P>
<P>
   The bedrooms are different. Her own is papered in Champagne
Truffle ($48 per yard), a paper with a slight glimmer, a
sophisticated update on gold-leaf. How it's made is typical of a
Dow wallpaper: a copper-colored base coat is hand-rubbed into rice
paper, followed with a second layer of tinted pearlized paint
applied with a squeegee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is spontaneity to get the effect of a colorfield
painting,'' said Ms. Dow, who advises her staff ``to go rough with
the squeegee.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest bedroom features one of Ms. Dow's signature collage
papers, called Stone's Throw ($52 a yard). The base paint is the
same sail-cloth white, an exterior paint from Benjamin Moore, used
on the walls of the main space. Ms. Dow then layered on a grid of
squares, each one hand-torn and tinted, then glued to the wall and
spaced an eighth of an inch apart. ``People try to make
associations: `It's like stone, it's like tile,''' she said. ``But
it's really just all about paper and the unique way that paper
absorbs light and color. It creates feelings. It's enveloping. It
has an almost structural strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper has been good to Ms. Dow, who has seen her business
double every year for the past five. For her 40th birthday last
year she bought herself a 1970 Mercedes 280SL convertible. She
chose it for its color, naturally, a shimmering agate green.
Perhaps you'll see it next year _ on Madonna's walls.

<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right

</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

TRYING TO GIVE OPERA A FESTIVAL LIKE NO OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 28)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING

<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ Amid Europe's ever more crowded
calendar of summer musical happenings, the slow demise of the opera
festival in this bucolic southern French city went largely
unnoticed. In its heyday, in the 1950s and '60s, when it
reintroduced Mozart to France, le tout Paris would flock here every
July. But in recent years, even for dedicated opera lovers, Aix was
increasingly overshadowed by Salzburg, Bayreuth, Glyndebourne and
other festivals more offbeat, glitzy or crowd-pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   France being France, of course, once officialdom in Paris
belatedly realized that the country could no longer boast a quality
opera festival, appropriate action followed. And this year, flush
with new government subsidies, the Festival International d'Art
Lyrique et de Musique is returning with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it is celebrating its 50th anniversary. In reality,
it is proclaiming its rebirth with a dazzling program of five new
productions and the creation of a European Music Academy, designed
to find and nurture the next generation of opera talent.
</P>
<P>
   The man picked to orchestrate this renaissance is Stephane
Lissner, a chubby-cheeked 45-year-old theater manager who made his
name over the last decade by turning the Theatre du Chatelet in
Paris into France's most innovative center of opera production.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wise choice. Having accumulated huge reserves of good
will during his years at the Chatelet, Lissner has been able to
call on big-name conductors and directors to help him reinvigorate
Aix. And because he has convinced them that this festival will be
different, they have come on board.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the festival, which opens July 6 and runs
through July 31, is a new production of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,''
conducted by Claudio Abbado and directed by Peter Brook, who has
not worked in mainstream opera for more than 30 years. Pierre
Boulez, France's best-known composer and conductor, and Pina
Bausch, the German dance-theater director, are teaming up for the
first time, in a new staging of Bartok's ``Bluebeard's Castle.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteverdi's ``Orfeo'' will be conducted by Rene Jacobs and
directed by the American choreographer Trisha Brown. Finally, the
young singers and musicians of the nascent European Music Academy
will present two short English operas, Purcell's ``Dido and
Aeneas'' and Britten's ``Curlew River,'' on separate evenings.
</P>
<P>
   The program reflects Lissner's eclectic approach at the
Chatelet, where, he proudly recalls, more than half of his 50 or so
productions involved 20th-century operas. But this year's fare also
points to what lies ahead. Tradition requires that Mozart always be
present, and Lissner does not object to that.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, he plans to reprise ``Don Giovanni'' and add a
new production of ``Die Zauberfloete,'' which academy students are
working on this summer with the veteran soprano Regine Crespin, the
young French director Stephane Braunschweig and the conductor David
Stern, who is the academy's music director. And for 2000, Lissner
has scheduled ``Idomeneo.''
</P>
<P>
   The variety of other operas being planned is impressive. Along
with Mozart, the 1999 program will include Monteverdi's masterpiece
``L'Incoronazione di Poppea,'' conducted by the rising French star
Marc Minkowski and directed by Klaus-Michael Grueber, as well as
``La Belle Helene'' by Offenbach, directed by Herbert Wernicke.
(The conductor has not yet been named.) For 2000, Lissner has
contracted Simon Rattle to conduct Janacek's ``Makropulos Case'' in
a production directed by Braunschweig.
</P>
<P>
   And for 2001, he has commissioned the Finnish conductor and
composer Esa-Pekka Salonen to write his first opera, which will be
directed by Peter Sellars.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy in all of this is the absence of well-known singers,
who are often the main draw in European opera festivals. This is no
accident. Top-ranked singers are often booked several years ahead;
Lissner was appointed director of the Aix festival in late 1995,
and he turned his attention to programming only after overhauling
the entire festival structure. As it happens, however, he is
looking beyond the divas of today. By giving carefully selected
young singers the chance to work with the world's best conductors
and directors, he is banking on creating the stars of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not interested in taking over the Aix festival simply to
put on three operas a year in the court of the Archbishop's
Palace,'' he said in his office overlooking that 18th-century
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``More or less anyone could do that. But that would not be a
festival. It would be three productions. You could see them in Aix,
but you could also see them in Paris or anywhere else. You could
almost say jokingly that the productions are the cherry on the
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly behind the banquet of next month's festival lies a
great deal of kitchen work. In the past, the festival's main backer
was the city of Aix-en-Provence itself. As the festival lost its
prominence, notably in the 1990s, the city lost enthusiasm. One of
Lissner's conditions for succeeding Louis Erlo, who until recently
was also co-director of the Lyons Opera, was that the central
government in Paris become the main shareholder of a new festival
company. It was, quite simply, a way of putting French honor on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to pay off debts, last year's festival was reduced to just
two operas in concert, thus permitting a fresh start this year.
Now, under a six-year agreement to be signed next month, subsidies
from the government, city and region will cover just over half the
festival's $10 million annual budget, with the balance coming from
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lissner also set about giving the festival its own production
center. In the nearby village of Venelles, he found an abandoned
warehouse, which, at a cost of $800,000, was converted into the
festival's engine room. In three different ateliers, sets are being
built and painted, and costumes are being made. In another area,
there are two large rehearsal rooms, each with a stage of the same
dimensions as the one in the court of the Archbishop's Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the festival is created,'' Lissner said, showing
a visitor around the installations one afternoon as Brook and
Abbado rehearsed ``Don Giovanni'' behind closed doors. ``We can do
everything here from A to Z. All the artists, workers, costume
makers, directors and conductors can work in the same building.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lissner began improving the performance sites. At a
cost of $11.8 million, he rebuilt the open-air theater at the
Archbishop's Palace, installing new stage machinery, eliminating a
second balcony, reducing the number of seats from 1,650 to 1,300
and insuring an unprecedented degree of comfort. There is even room
for audiences to find shelter in case of a sudden downpour. It is
here that ``Don Giovanni,'' ``Bluebeard's Castle'' and ``Orfeo''
will be performed this year; ``Dido and Aeneas'' and ``Curlew
River'' will be presented in another 18th-century courtyard, a
stone's throw away.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, more space will be available. Aix's 600-seat
Theatre du Jeu de Paume, soon to close for renovation, will be
available to the festival again in 2000. And by 2003, the city
should have a new $80 million multipurpose theater.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Lissner looks ahead, it is the European Music Academy
that lights up his eyes. His idea is not to compete with existing
conservatories. Rather, it is to help talented young singers,
instrumentalists and composers take their first steps toward a
professional career during two months of intensive workshops and
tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   For this first season, auditions were held in several European
cities and New York for musicians under the age of 35. Fifty-four
candidates were invited to join the academy, representing 16
different nationalities (including five Americans). To give them a
place to work, a wing of a local high school, the College Mignet,
has been converted into a score of studios and rehearsal rooms. The
approach, though, is anything but academic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What is special is not that students can go home after a few
weeks and say they had master classes with Claudio Abbado or Pierre
Boulez, which is great for them,'' Lissner explained. ``It is that
they perform their music in front of the public. That is what's
important for me. The first stage is education; the second stage is
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a good many of the musicians will already be part of
this year's festival: notably, the 15 instrumentalists and 13
singers who are presenting ``Dido and Aeneas'' and ``Curlew
River,'' and the 10 singers who form the chorus of ``Don
Giovanni.'' (The lead roles in ``Don Giovanni'' are filled by other
young singers who are already established on the international
opera circuit.)
</P>
<P>
   Another 10 academy singers, who are preparing ``Die
Zauberfloete,'' will perform extracts from the opera in concert at
the Theatre du Jeu de Paume in late July. Most of the musicians
will also be heard in recitals and public rehearsals, and new works
written by the academy's five young composers, including Jonathan
Golove from the United States, will be performed for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The events accompanying the opera productions have an additional
purpose. Lissner believes that the people of Aix have become
estranged from the festival but that their involvement is
essential. With local residents in mind, he has arranged four
preview performances of ``Don Giovanni''; 5,200 tickets at
half-price were quickly snapped up. He has also created a
``passport'' costing just $17, which enables holders to attend any
of 70 recitals and selected rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme seems popular. One after noon in June, at least 80
people, many of them elderly, attended a public rehearsal at the
College Mignet, where the Chinese cellist Jian Wang coached string
players in a Brahms sextet. The nervousness of some of the
instrumentalists suggested that they were unaccustomed to playing
before an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Once the festival ends, many of the musicians will accompany
three of the opera productions on tour. Between August and January,
there will be 48 more performances of ``Don Giovanni,'' in
Stockholm, Lyons, Milan, Brussels and Tokyo, with the newly formed
Mahler Chamber Orchestra, consisting of musicians from Abbado's
Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, led by Daniel Harding, a 22-year-old
English conductor. ( Harding has been working here with Abbado and
Brook and will also conduct 7 of the 14 performances of ``Don
Giovanni'' at the Aix festival.)
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentalists and singers who double up for ``Dido and
Aeneas'' and ``Curlew River'' will be on the road through next May,
giving 72 performances in 14 French cities plus Brussels, Lausanne
and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a permanent festival that drops its suitcases in Aix for
two months of the year,'' Lissner said cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   That the good-natured Parisian should be resuscitating the Aix
festival with such panache comes as little surprise to those who
have followed his career. At the Chatelet, which is owned by the
city of Paris, he benefited from the mayor's interest in competing
with the government-owned Paris National Opera. As a result, he had
a $20 million subsidy to play with each year.
</P>
<P>
   And since that mayor, Jacques Chirac, is now the president of
France, the association assured him solid backing when he took over
the Aix festival.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the Chatelet Lissner made his name not for spending a
lot but for presenting different and daring operas and concert
programs. His selection to run the festival, therefore, was itself
evidence that the government wanted something new. And he has a
reputation for delivering what he promises _ or resigning.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, while still at the Chatelet, he took over
management of the Orchestre de Paris, but he left in frustration
after the board blocked his effort to recruit a new permanent
conductor from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after taking over as artistic director of the Teatro
Real in Madrid in 1996 with a mandate to reopen that long-silent
opera house, he resigned 15 months later, when Spain's new
conservative government vetoed his plan to create a new orchestra
and chorus and imposed what he called ``extremely mediocre
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Lissner handed over the reins of the Chatelet to
Jean-Pierre Brossmann, the former director of the Lyons Opera, an
occasion marked by an outpouring of tributes to him from leading
conductors: among them, Daniel Barenboim, Christoph von Dohnanyi
and Boulez.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, Lissner had taken on a new challenge, as
manager of Brook's International Center of Theater Research at the
Theatre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. The stage director invited
Lissner to succeed his founding partner, Micheline Rozan, for
essentially the same reason Brook had earlier agreed to participate
in this year's Aix festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephane belongs to a new generation that is able to aspire to
things that were inconceivable in an opera administrator when I
started at Covent Garden in the late 1940s,'' Brook said. ``He
wants to bring a new spirit to the festival.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that particularly appeals to Brook is the lengthy
creative process that has preceded the festival. He began
rehearsals for ``Don Giovanni'' in late April in Paris and
transferred here on June 1. Similarly, Boulez and Ms. Bausch will
rehearse here for five weeks before ``Bluebeard's Castle'' opens on
July 25. And all the academy students have been in Aix since May
25.
</P>
<P>
   So while Lissner refuses to allow that he is competing with,
say, Salzburg or Bayreuth, the Aix festival already seems to be
different. But he acknowledges that he has much to do before his
current contract expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   It took time to build an audience at the Chatelet for
untraditional operas and orchestral music, notably 20th-century
works by the likes of Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Ligeti, he said.
``My hope is that, as at the Chatelet, a new public will grow up
here, more curious than than the traditional conservative
operagoing public, and that will enable us to strike a balance
between the well known and the less known. But you also have to be
realistic. If it's `Carmen,' people come. If it's `Jenufa' or
`Moses and Aaron,' they come less.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his need to present festival productions that are both
popular and critically acclaimed, Lissner's long-term plans remain
focused on the European Music Academy. Indeed, he imagines the
academy gradually taking over the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to place Aix at the level of the great
European festivals not through its opera program but as a veritable
European center of music,'' he said, puffing on an ever-present
small cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be the future of the festival: an extraordinary
academy where singers, musicians and composers come to work and
make music together during Christmas, Easter and the summer, almost
throughout the year. In five years' time, I'll have 25 productions,
so we can even do winter reprises. That, in a sense, is the
Utopia.''

   BEIJING _ A typical Chinese urbanite bicycles down a frenetic
rush hour street -- small daughter tucked into a backseat and
packages filling the basket in front. Ignoring the chaos, he chats
into the cell phone clamped to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is among the legion of arresting oddities that will
punctuate the trip through China of President Bill Clinton and his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Such culture clashes are no more unusual than those presented to
Chinese visiting America -- for example, when they hunt vainly
through hotel rooms for the terry cloth slippers and thermos of hot
water that are ever -present in Chinese hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, visitors have been coming to China to absorb the
brilliant colors, pungent scents and tinkling sounds of a land that
many in the West expected to find ``backward.'' But even in the
13th Century Marco Polo found China filled with marvels, much as
travelers do today.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones, for example, seem to be more pervasive in Chinese
cities than in most any sophisticated American metropolis. People
in taxis, on bicycles, walking down the street, riding a bus,
sitting in restaurants or shopping in book stores, food stores or
shoe stores can be found engaged in intense conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phones are so popular because they are both cheaper and
more accessible than permanent telephone connections in the home.
Regular phone service reaches a mere 8 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Another peculiarity to visiting Americans may be the white
cotton gloves worn by many taxi drivers, elevator attendants,
cyclists and street sweepers worried about soiling their hands.
Some women wear gloves when simply walking down the street. In the
extremely health-conscious Chinese society such attention to dust
and bacteria makes perfectly good sense. (The elbow-length gloves
some women cyclists wear, however, are a defense against the sun,
not dirt.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Clinton group well may sight any number
of bare baby bottoms in wandering town and country. Little ones at
the wobbly-toddling stage often are dressed for outings sans
diaper, in pants that are slit up the back. Parents carry a cloth
to catch the leakage if necessary, but often don't bother if a
semi-discreet corner or open space presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   The practice may get complicated, for example on a train. A
mother occasionally can be seen sprinting down the aisle, baby at
arms' length, heading toward the restroom (commonly known as the
water closet, or ``WC'') at the end of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Queries about this habit have produced the explanation that,
yes, Chinese do use diapers, both disposable and cloth. But some
parents sometimes prefer to let their babies experience the natural
freedom of diaperless days, and no one seems to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that helps explain the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   A pervasive and vibrant aspect of Chinese culture is the color
red. It is thought to be lucky, so spices up the scenery
everywhere. Red lanterns big and small hang outside restaurants and
shops. Brides who wear the same billowy white dresses seen
everywhere from Macon to Moscow traditionally have a bit of red
tucked away somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton goes ahead with his planned visit to the Shanghai
Stock Exchange, he even will find the big board listing stocks on
the rise in red, while those declining are lit in green -- exactly
the opposite of Western exchanges. An official explained that the
first Shanghai exchange followed the Western color pattern, but it
made no sense to the clientele. When the new exchange opened last
year the board was made right, Chinese-style.
</P>
<P>
   Americans dining in China also will encounter some opposites. In
a typical Chinese restaurant in China, the soup will come at the
end of the meal and the rice will be the penultimate arrival --
served after the last hot dish has been placed on the table (but
before the soup).
</P>
<P>
   Here the rice and soup are considered filler food, traditionally
served toward the end so as not to detract from the more important
meat or fish dishes. Back when meat was scarce and expensive, the
rice and soup were backups to fill the stomach after the good stuff
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Rice also is seen as counteracting the buzz that a diner
drinking beer or wine is expecting from the alcohol, thus
compounding the reasons for serving it toward the end of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim. Story can end here.)
</P>
<P>
   So much for phenomena of sight and taste. There is also an
unusual sound sensation that can be found at least in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down the street around dusk, the stroller may hear a
rippling, calliope melody quite distinct from the pop music blaring
from open-front stores to attract young customers. It may take a
while to find the source of the flute-like music, but perhaps
following the nose will help.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant tune can be traced to a big white truck temporarily
double-parked in the street while workers fan out to commercial
establishments to pick up the results of the day's work. Much
preferable to the horn-honking that Beijing's drivers lavishly
utilize to announce their presence, it is the municipality's most
civilized effort to alert pedestrians and drivers that the garbage
truck is coming.

A TIMEOUT FOR HOME SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a kind of hush all over New York _ New York's
residential real-estate market, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Whether hush or hiccup or breathing spell _ all terms used by
brokers to describe the market since the beginning of June _ the
city's biggest companies agree on one thing: The frenzy has abated,
at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   While the market usually loses momentum in summer, many real
estate brokers and agents say that this June is different from last
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no lull last year,'' said Peter Marra, president of
William B. May Real Estate, a company with 135 agents in Manhattan
and Brooklyn. ``There is a lull right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Halstead, managing partner at Halstead Property Co., said
accepted offers for this month are 10 percent below last June's,
following a steady rise in the last five months. He called the
current market ``a kind of correction, like the stock market
makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rogers, managing director at Douglas Elliman, the city's
largest residential firm, said he felt the market was at a plateau,
calling that ``a healthier thing, when things sell in six months
rather than six days.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Wild West atmosphere of the first quarter of
this year _ when bidding wars were common, and so were broken deals
_ he said: ``The quantum leap has happened; the catching-up from
the recession has happened. My sense is we're going to enter a
pretty stable market.''
</P>
<P>
   The brokers say the slowdown _ whether permanent or temporary _
is caused by several things, including the overpricing of
apartments (and a dearth of good ones), a reluctance among banks to
affirm the high prices with their appraisals, and a nervousness
among buyers about the stock market and the economic troubles in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that the main reason is a lack of appealing
apartments in all price ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great spring market _ many more listings than last
year _ and everything got cleaned out,'' said Barbara Corcoran,
chairman of Corcoran Group. ``And there is definitely buyer
resistance. The high prices scare the hell out of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, the city's
largest mortgage brokerage company, said the residential
real-estate market was ``stagnating'' _ but not for lack of buyers,
the usual reason for a summertime lull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got mortgage preapproval applications stacked up like
cordwood on our desks,'' he said. ``People are panting to buy
something, but they say they can't find anything. They may have
sold their own apartment, but they can't find something to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common complaint. Brokers interviewed this week said
that many sellers, reacting to reports about the frenzy, have
overpriced their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   As Kay Brover, head of Douglas Elliman's West Side office,
explained it: ``An apartment sells in a building for $750,000. The
next apartment would normally come on for $775,000. But now the
seller wants to price it for $895,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even realistically priced condos and co-ops can linger, agents
say. Apartments that a few months ago would have sold in a day or
two, with multiple bids, have not yet been sold, or are being sold
with normal bargaining. Ms. Brover said she also knew of several
buyers who were backing out of deals. One who had already signed a
contract forfeited his $175,000 down payment on a $1.75 million
condominium on the West Side last week. Brokers blamed cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate,
said his sales staff met Monday to discuss the current market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agents seemed to be equally divided between those who
believe the market is just taking a breath and those who say
everywhere they go, the brokers are worrying that prices may have
peaked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some brokers said they would not have complete statistics
until the end of June _ and others said they compiled them only by
quarter _ Halstead said he keeps ``elaborate records from the time
there is an accepted offer on a property.'' And the number of
accepted offers for the first two weeks of June was ``about 10
percent off the same time last year.'' (He said bids were off more
on the West Side than the East Side.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Halstead described the slowdown as a hiccup, agents at
his company said they had been advised to counsel sellers to reduce
the prices of exclusive listings that don't sell within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the brokers interviewed also said that banks seem to
have decided that the market is overheated and are therefore more
reluctant to make loans. ``The banks are tightening their belts,''
Ms. Corcoran wrote last week in a memo to her 300 agents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although an apartment at 222 Riverside Drive went to contract
for $950,000, the bank's appraiser valued it at only $900,000, said
Pam Tomlin, a Corcoran agent. The deal might have fallen through,
she said, if the buyer hadn't agreed to cover half the purchase
price with his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Fitting, another agent, said Chase Manhattan Bank had
refused to give a mortgage for a $575,000 apartment in Trump
Palace. Ms. Fitting said on Tuesday that her customers were
applying to another bank.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Satkiewicz, an executive vice president of Mitchell,
Maxwell &AMP; Jackson, the city's largest real-estate appraiser, said
that despite efforts to ``give the banks four, five and six
comparable sales _ rather than the standard three _ we're still
getting twice as many of our appraisals kicked back by the banks
for more justification than we did even a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither the Douglas Elliman agency nor the Corcoran
Group keeps statistics on accepted offers _ the first commitment by
buyer and seller on a piece of real estate _ Corcoran produced
statistics on the number of responses to real-estate advertisements
that it placed in the Sunday classified section of The New York
Times. Although 35 percent more ads were placed during the first
two weeks of June, 33 percent fewer people called about them than
in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these bidding wars have frightened not only the
million-dollar investor but the studio and one-bedroom buyers,
too,'' Ms. Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the other brokers interviewed, she was quick to point
out that the events that have made would-be buyers nervous _ things
like bidding wars and the troubles in Asia _ have only slowed the
market, not crippled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still signing lots of contracts,'' she said, ``so
certainly not all of them are scared off. But there's no longer the
fever pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Guerrieri, president of Vandenberg Real Estate, a small
Upper West Side company that specializes in town houses, said that
his company's real-estate advertisements ``don't pull in as many
customers'' as they did in the spring and that the company
``doesn't have as many buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still making deals at full asking prices,'' he said,
reeling off a handful of accepted offers. ``I'm not a bit
worried.''

SCARLETT, RHETT AND THE OLD SOUTH AT THEIR MOST COLORFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ ``Gone With the Wind'' has been released in theaters
eight times since 1939, has been shown numerous times on television
and has been a top rental at video stores for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   So why spend $10 million to $12 million to painstakingly restore
and reissue the Civil War drama, which opens Friday in 200 theaters
around the nation?
</P>
<P>
   The restoration project is largely the result of Ted Turner's
passion for the classic. ``Ted just loves this movie,'' said Turner
Entertainment Co. president Roger Mayer. ``He's the force behind
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What spurred its restoration was not just Turner's affection for
``Gone With the Wind,'' which the Atlanta-based media mogul
acquired when Turner Broadcasting purchased the rights to the MGM
film library in 1986, but more important, the huge successes of
James Cameron's ``Titanic'' and the re-released ``Star Wars''
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It motivated us to consider another theatrical release of
`Gone With the Wind,''' said Mayer. Another motive was, quite
simply, to one-up ``Titanic.'' Mayer said: ``There was all this
talk about `Titanic' being the most successful picture of all time.
We knew if you updated the grosses to today's dollar, then `Gone
With the Wind' would have, in fact, grossed more and been seen by
more people than `Titanic.' We wanted to point that out. It was
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, ``Gone With the Wind,'' at 3 hours and 40 minutes, was
the longest movie ever made, and the most expensive, costing $4.25
million. An adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's saga about the old
South, it starred Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard and
Olivia de Havilland and was produced by David O. Selznick and
directed by Victor Fleming from a screenplay by Sidney Howard. The
score was by Max Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   The film went through four directors, two cinematographers and
11 writers and, like ``Titanic,'' was initially derided in
Hollywood as a disaster. The costs and various crises on the set
stirred rival executives and others to call it ``David's Folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the staying power of the film, which won 10 Oscars, is
underscored by the fact that nearly 60 years after it was first
released, the movie's ticket sales, if adjusted for inflation,
would make it the all-time box office champion.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, the American Film Institute placed it fourth
on its list of the 100 best American films.
</P>
<P>
   Filmgoers have not seen anything quite like the restored ``Gone
With the Wind'' in nearly 30 years, the industry executives and
experts who worked on the project said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way the picture was photographed and originally
printed _ this is the way the picture was intended to be
seen,''said Mayer, who is also a specialist in preservation and
restoration. ``Add to that we have a new remastered digital
soundtrack, which makes it sound like the picture was made
recently. For many people this will be an entirely new way of
looking at and hearing `Gone With the Wind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Jarvis, the president of Technicolor, which provided the
nascent film-processing technology for Selznick's production and
revived the dye-transfer process to restore the film, said: ``The
images are sharper than they've ever been. The colors are more
true. These prints are better than what people saw in 1939. In
fact, look at it _ it looks as good or better than most of the
stuff that we see today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jarvis spoke, he sat in a screening room at his offices in
Universal City watching a dual screen that depicted scenes from an
older version of the movie, a classic Civil War drama and love
story, and from the new version.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were pronounced. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) and
Rhett (Clark Gable) _ as well as hundreds of Civil War soldiers _
are simply more vivid, almost three-dimensional, and far less
grainy. The colors _ especially reds, greens and blues _ are sharp,
almost brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Turner Broadcasting, which included New Line
Cinema, merged with Time Warner. More recently, Turner met with
Robert Daly and Terry Semel, the co-chairmen of Warner Brothers,
and they agreed to restore ``Gone With the Wind,'' and asked New
Line to distribute it. By all accounts, the three men believed that
moviegoers, especially in the summer, might crave a lavish,
escapist saga.
</P>
<P>
   The making of ``Gone With the Wind'' nearly 60 years ago was a
saga in itself for Selznick and his production team, a complex film
process involving special cameras fitted with mirrors and prisms
and the synchronized exposure of three strips of film. It wasn't
even color film. Three rolls of black and white film rolled through
the camera, each registering cyan, magenta or yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of the film, which had not been reprinted using
Technicolor since 1961, meant the revival of the three-strip
dye-transfer process. Computer technology allowed technicians and
graphic artists to examine the negative frame by frame and repair
about 12{ minutes of footage by removing scratches and
photochemical imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   The dye-transfer method transfers dyes directly to the film
itself in a photomechanical process similar to printing, as opposed
to the conventional photochemical process that has been in use
since 1974. That method involved a two-step printing and developing
process in which the color dyes are chemically formed in the film
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, dye-transfer technology results in vivid contrasts
between white and black, and clear separation of colors, especially
reds, greens and blues. (The last time it was used in Hollywood was
for ``The Godfather Part II'' in 1974).
</P>
<P>
   The film will also be seen in its original aspect ratio (a term
used to define the relationship between a film's projected height
and width) instead of the wide-screen display that cuts off the top
of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Goldman, New Line's president of marketing and
distribution, said the new release involved an overture in movie
theaters of the famed Max Steiner score as well as an intermission.
``Most people have not seen this in theaters, which is the way it's
supposed to be seen,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ticket sales for the film have reached an
extraordinary $192 million: it is in 25th place in domestic
revenues. But none of the 24 films that preceded it were made
earlier than 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The video, which came out in 1985, has also been successful.
More than 1.5 million copies s have been sold at a hefty price,
generally $88.98. The television rights to ``Gone With the Wind,''
were sold to NBC in 1976 for what was then the record price of $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, CBS signed a 20-year licensing agreement for
the movie. But less than 10 years after that, Turner Broadcasting
bought the television rights, and the film has since aired on
Turner Classic Movies, the Turner Broadcasting System and Turner
Network Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only movie that seems to work in all media, but
particularly in theatrical release,'' said Mayer, the Turner
executive. ``It's a romantic, historical drama, based on a best
seller that has continued to be a best seller for 60 years. There
are very few pieces of material that can make that claim.''

HERE LIZARD, LIZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday June 26)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As if the prospect of coexisting with tens of millions of pink,
sterile medflies were not daunting enough, we Floridians are now
being threatened by mobs of six-foot, tail-whipping iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case, this particular problem originated in
California. Back in the late '80s and early '90s, South American
green iguanas were considered trendy pets and were being imported
to this country by the tens of thousands. What people didn't
realize - and weren't told - was that the cute little lizards
quickly grow into dragon-size creatures that carry disease, tear up
the house and wield their heavy tails like broadswords
</P>
<P>
   Life is unpleasant enough in California what with earthquakes
and Starbucks and everything, so people began abandoning their pets
faster than you can say, ``Run for your life! Another bad Godzilla
movie!''
</P>
<P>
   Animal shelters were soon up to here with the little darlings
and stopped accepting castaways. Finding foster homes for
columnist-size creatures that run like a deer and have an annoying
habit of leaping through your screen door or pool cage has been no
easy matter, either.
</P>
<P>
   All of which would be nothing more than another good reason not
to visit Los Angeles were it not for the fact that iguanas are now
becoming a problem in Phoenix and, yes, Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who only ventures outside long
enough to hose the malathion off your car, then chances are good
that you will escape being impaled on the sharp tail of an angry
six-foot iguana, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida is nothing if not conducive to biodiversity, so I
predict it will not be long before iguanas are thicker than love
bugs here, and considerably more trouble to scrape off your
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we need some sort of long-term strategy, something more
clever and cunning than a bumper sticker campaign urging iguanas to
go back where they came from. (This didn't work with people from Up
North, so I see no reason why it would work on iguanas, which, from
what I've read, are even more cantankerous than New Yorkers, if you
can imagine such a thing.)
</P>
<P>
   One possible strategy - and it is not an appealing one, I admit
- is to simply learn to get along with the iguanas. According to
the Reuters story I read, iguanas get jumpy when they do not get
enough affection, and a jumpy iguana is the kind of iguana that
turns its owner into shish kebab. The story recommends that you
take your iguana into the shower with you as the mist is good for
the lizard's skin. The story did not say anything about bubble
baths, but I presume iguanas would like that, too, though you
probably ought to take care where you sit.
</P>
<P>
   While you are bathing with your iguana, you might want to engage
it in conversation, as that would help relax it, and a relaxed
iguana is less likely to poke a hole in your liver with its tail.
One thing you definitely want to avoid discussing is that iguanas
carry salmonella bacteria on their skin and are sometimes infested
with ticks. Iguanas do not respond well to having their personal
hygiene called into question, so you probably ought to talk about
something more innocuous, like the weather, unless you want to end
up like that unfortunate housewife in ``Terminator 2.''
</P>
<P>
   If possible, you might want to chat with your iguana about how
nice Central America is this time of year, as there is a chance
that will make it homesick for the jungles of its native Guatemala
or El Salvador or wherever it came from. Do not discuss any
political unrest that might be occurring in that region as iguanas
get fidgety when the talk turns to politics and a fidgety iguana is
an iguana that skewers your pancreas as if it were a martini olive.
</P>
<P>
   While you want to be affectionate with your iguana, you do not
want to be too affectionate because then the iguana will have no
reason to leave. For that reason, candlelight dinners are out, as
are foot rubs and back rubs.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hazy, hot and humid weather will dominate the southern
two-thirds of the country from the western Plains to the Atlantic
Seaboard. High pressure over the Southeast will promote sunshine
and record heat in Georgia and the Carolinas while a wedge of very
hot air pushes northward into the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between a more comfortable air mass over central
and eastern Canada and the steamy air over much of the nation will
stretch from Maine to South Dakota. Showers and clusters of
thunderstorms will dampen many sections from Minnesota to western
New England.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest rain is likely around the northern Great Lakes
where a jet-stream disturbance passes overhead. A few
thundershowers are expected to form in the Appalachians because of
the uneven heating of the terrain. A narrow line of thunderstorms
should also develop between Chicago and Kansas City during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A disorganized disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico will
contribute more clouds to the western Gulf Coast along with bands
of thundershowers that will move slowly toward the northwest. The
hot, dry weather will persist in northern Florida, though isolated
afternoon thunderstorms will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool air will cover the Northwest as brisk onshore
winds push chilly, moist air inland from the North Pacific. Showers
will be common from Washington and Oregon to Montana and Wyoming.
Snow levels in the northern Cascades will drop to near 5,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will be sunny and seasonable. Morning low clouds
will continue to obscure much of the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Heat Index
</P>
<P>
   Warnings for heat-index values between 100 and 110 degrees were
issued in parts of the Southeast on Tuesday. Also called the
apparent temperature, the heat index is the warm-season analog to
the wind-chill index. When the air has a high moisture content,
cooling by evaporation from the skin is reduced and the stress on
the human body is increased. Therefore, when the humidity is above
normal for a given temperature, the heat index is higher than the
actual air temperature. However, the heat index does not take into
account variables such as wind or sunshine, which also can
contribute to heat stress.

BILLBOARD SLEUTHS THINK DIFFERENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One day, the Joe Camel billboard advertised
``genuine taste.'' The next day it read ``Am I Dead Yet?''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlboro man's billboard turned into a real sleeper,
changing from Marlboro to Marlbore overnight, with the word
``yawn'' added near his mouth for effect.
</P>
<P>
   And just last weekend, Apple Computer Corp.'s Amelia Earhart
billboard was changed from ``Think Different'' to ``Think Doomed,''
a reference to the legendary pilot's fatal attempt to fly around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Billboard Liberation Front is back, bringing its own twist
on advertising and social commentary to Apple's billboards in the
San Francisco area, the latest in a 21-year history of ad
alterations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder for people to speak their minds
_ that's what we're doing,'' said Jack Napier, an original founder
of the group. His ``name'' is also that of the Joker's alter ego.
``Having a diversity of opinions out there is better.''
</P>
<P>
   No billboard is safe. And the activity, which can cost billboard
companies thousands of dollars, is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 or so members of the top-secret organization are
professionals at what they do, capable of scaling tall buildings
with a single ladder or hanging from a billboard in a harness while
they do their dirty work. Some of the members even have jobs in the
advertising industry, Napier said, participating in the alterations
because ``it's a way to have a creative outlet that's not business
or work.''
</P>
<P>
   The group really doesn't have any particular political or social
beliefs, Napier said. Some billboards just present better
opportunity for manipulation because of design, while others are
chosen because they are at the center of controversy. The group
isn't even opposed to billboards themselves _ they just don't like
that only corporations can afford to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Once an ad is selected for alteration, it can take months for
the actual face lift. The group likes to be as professional and
covert as possible, so the culprits take plenty of time to monitor
motor and police traffic patterns at different times of the night.
They go through painstaking attempts at creating imitations of the
typeface they want to change.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new ``Think Different`' ads, pairing the simple slogan
with images of world-famous innovators, world leaders and artists,
were ripe for the illegal alterations, Napier said.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they're grammatically incorrect. Add to that the
fact that Earhart, Ansel Adams and Miles Davis obviously didn't
grant the technology giant permission to use their images to hawk
computers. And perhaps the best and most ironic reason of all:
Altering the ads would in fact get people to think differently
about the company's ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The group targeted several different Apple ads over the last few
months, replacing the word ``different`' with ``doomed'' on the
Earhart ad, ``dividends'' on an ad with media titan Ted Turner and
``disillusioned'' on an ad featuring the Dalai Lama, spiritual
leader of Tibet. And just for effect, they replaced the
rainbow-colored Apple symbol with a rainbow-colored skull.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the billboard
alterations.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is the latest of a string of companies that have been
targeted by the group.
</P>
<P>
   The organization got its start in 1977 when members of the San
Francisco Suicide Club _ a group devoted to pulling pranks _
altered two Max Factor billboards to protest the use of makeup to
create a ``pretty face.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of that alteration, coupled with the brouhaha
of being arrested by the police, convinced Napier, Irving Glikk and
Simon Wagstaff to form the new group. Others tried to imitate them
and similar groups have formed around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most inconvenienced by the alterations are the companies that
sell the billboard space to companies. Steve Shinn, the spokesman
for Outdoor Systems in Berkeley, Calif., said it can cost his
company thousands of dollars to restore ads to their original
message.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing Shinn can say about the group is that they
actually go to great lengths to not damage the actual billboards
and leave behind consolation gifts for the billboard artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do it in such a manner that they can be fixed easily and
we appreciate that,'' Shinn said. ``Sometimes they leave a six-pack
of beer up there for our workers to say sorry they had to come out.
It makes it a little more palatable, I guess.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT RULING COULD AFFECT LARGER CASE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that an
appeals court setback would not derail the Justice Department's
landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we can proceed, and we'll do so,'' Reno told
reporters the day after an appeals court panel's ruling in a
related case undermined a key government position in its broad
lawsuit charging the software giant with illegal monopolistic
practices.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia struck down a temporary injunction that
had stopped Microsoft from requiring manufacturers to include its
Internet Explorer browsing software on computers that operate on
Microsoft's Windows 95 system.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal analysts called that ruling a major blow to the
Justice Department's broader charges that Microsoft abuses its
market dominance to stifle competition. The major antitrust case,
set for trial in September, focuses on Microsoft's ``bundling'' of
the upgraded Windows 98 operating system and Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling could ``cut the legs out from under the
Justice Department'' on a key part of the major case, said Robert
Litan, director of economic studies for the Brookings Institution
and a former deputy attorney general in the antitrust division of
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be very discouraging from their point of view,'' he
said, adding that it appeared that the government was ``slam-dunked
by the court.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling was on a narrow issue, the language of the
three-judge panel was ``very broad,'' Litan said. ``They
essentially said that judges shouldn't be in the business of
designing software.''
</P>
<P>
   Litan said the message is unlikely to be missed by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued the injunction that was
overturned and who is scheduled to preside over the antitrust
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The ``government has to put a brave face on this,'' but the
decision does ``cast a large shadow on the upcoming case,'' said
William Kovacic, a former Federal Trade Commission official who
teaches antitrust law at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``three legs'' to the Justice Department lawsuit, he
said. One contention is that Microsoft has entered restrictive
contracts with computer makers. That is not affected by the appeals
decision. The second allegation is that Microsoft tried to entice
its browser rival, Netscape, into a market division. That leg is
also not crippled by the decision, said Kovacic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the third leg is that Microsoft tried to use
``bundling'' of technology to extend its monopoly to other segments
of the market. ``This third leg is the most important part of the
case,'' said Kovacic. And this is the part that the appeals panel
dealt with specifically and sweepingly.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Justice Department vowed Wednesday to press ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in the case we have filed,'' Assistant
Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the antitrust division, told
reporters after testifying in a congressional hearing on telephone
company mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the Justice Department is considering its legal
options, which include an appeal of the panel's ruling, and is not
negotiating a settlement with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday's decision involves the consent decree,'' Klein
said. ``The case we have filed in federal court is under the
Sherman Act. We think that the case is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft general counsel William Neukom said the
appeals court ruling has ``important consequences'' and is ``very
much a vindication of our business practices and our legal
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could use the ruling as the basis to file a motion
seeking a dismissal or summary judgment in the broader antitrust
lawsuit _ especially of the portions dealing with the browser
bundling, said Litan. If that happened, the Justice Department
would almost certainly appeal the panel's ruling to protect against
the possiblity of the case being thrown out, he said.

`FAMILY MAN': GRACEFUL, FUNNY ESSAYS ON THE USUAL TOPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here, in the 16 funny essays composing ``Family Man,'' is Calvin
Trillin, the humorist, on the subjects of raising children and
staying married. His advice is succinct. On children: ``Try to get
one that doesn't spit up. Otherwise you're on your own.'' On
finding a long-term wife: ``Wander into the right party.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``Handing out advice on family matters is not my
game,'' he writes. ``For most people, the process of rearing
children is so all-encompassing that there isn't any way to adhere
to any policy that doesn't coincide with their natural way of doing
things. Getting advice on the best way to bring up children is like
getting advice on the best way to breathe; sooner or later, you're
probably going to forget it and go back to your regular old
in-and-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving advice, Trillin uses these essays to knit
together his many anecdotes and routines on the subject of family,
some of which have appeared in different form in The New Yorker and
other magazines. These subjects touch on, for instance, using your
family as material for your writing. His rules here are: not during
the sensitive teen-age years and no embarrassing stuff unless
you're sure you're Dostoyevsky. Otherwise, as he puts it to his
wife: ``I hope you're not under the impression that what you just
said was off the record, Alice. Nobody mentioned anything about
deep background or not for attribution or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or his subject might be the genetic differences between men and
women, which occasions him to write about roller coasters,
asparagus, movies, eating alone, ``what's au courant in clothes,''
lobsters, James Carville and Mary Matalin, cooking, scenery, day
people and night people and his belief ``that in the spring female
human beings get a deep biological urge to replace the living-room
slipcovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Or he will write about pets. It's not that he hates cats. That
would be prejudice. ``What might be fair to say is that I have
never met a cat I liked.'' It seems to him ``that many of the
attributes cat fanciers apply to cats _ independence, the ability
to care for themselves, an admirable absence of obsequiousness
toward human beings _ can be claimed for periwinkles as well, and
in a much more manageable package.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what his topic, the boundaries between them are
seamless. Some of his most graceful writing is in his transitions.
His timing and delivery are perfect. He doesn't ring an off-key
note. In ``Nuptials du Jour,'' he will be pondering the subject of
gay marriages, his only problem with them being, ``At the end of a
gay Jewish wedding ceremony, how would you decide who stomps on the
glass?''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly you find yourself attending the birth of the Trillins'
first child, Abigail, prepared for by the Lamaze method. The author
has accepted the obstetrician's invitation to change into scrubs
and join him for delivery. ``Having heeded his warning not to leave
my wallet in the locker with the rest of my clothing, I was holding
it in my hand as we entered the delivery room; scrubs have no
pockets. Then I realized that the elastic in the pants I'd been
provided had about given out _ I suppose it makes sense to use the
older outfits for new fathers for a while, before throwing them
away _ so I had to hold up my pants with the other hand. As I
neared the delivery table, Alice reached out to take my hand, as we
had seen so many women do in the movies shown in natural childbirth
classes. I had no hand available.''
</P>
<P>
   Trillin's secret, besides his command of prose, is that he knows
exactly who he is. The family joke may be, as Abigail puts it, that
he's ``a simple lad from the Midwest'' married to ``a fancy Eastern
girl.'' But he comes from Kansas City in the ``show me'' state.
He's a thoroughly urban person with insatiable curiosity and
contempt for pretense, especially in himself. He writes for The
Nation only because it's ``the closest magazine to my house.'' He
summers in Nova Scotia, where neighbors speak a distinctive, not
particularly grammatical form of English. He plans to hold his
daughters' wedding receptions in the Triple Eight Palace, ``a huge
dim sum parlor on the second floor of a Chinese shopping mall under
the Manhattan Bridge.''

   Of course the mask of humor Trillin wears also serves as his
armor, which bars us from seeing any sadness in his life.
Occasional bad news does get out: Alice's bout with lung cancer,
his own heart bypass surgery. But the visor quickly slams shut. He
writes that after his operation, the surgeon advised him and his
family how often he was to nap and how he was to avoid long periods
at his desk. ``We all nodded soberly. When he had finished, I tried
to look both brave and prudent. Then Abigail said, `I hate to say
it, Daddy, but it's hard to see just how that differs from your
regular routine.'''
</P>
<P>
   One is left to wonder if the mask ever slips, if he's ever
caught off guard, if he ever blunders clumsily. But it's no use. On
a first-grade outing when a boy who is holding his hand suddenly
asks him, ``Are you divorced yet?'' he shoots right back, ``Not
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a less than entertaining moment reading these essays? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.

   Web Surf With Disney  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disney Online, a three-year-old unit intent on bringing all the
fluff and pink that is Disney to cyberspace, Wednesday opened
Disney's Internet Guide, a Web search and directory site for
children and families.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Dig (www.dig.com), the new site is designed to compete
with Yahooligans, Yahoo's popular kids' directory. And in a sign
that the company is wasting no time capitalizing on its new
partnership with Infoseek, the site will also soon serve as the
kids' directory on Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Like Yahooligans, Dig contains eight wholesome categories, like
Animals and the Outdoors, Stories and Comics, Games and Toys, and
Arts and Entertainment. Each of the Dig categories, which,
according to the company, ``collectively represent what Disney
Online considers to be the best of the Web for kids and families,''
have been picked by Dig team members and will be reviewed every few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes back to our overall Disney Online mission, to
provide a gateway to the Internet,'' said the president of Disney
Online, Richard Wolpert. Wolpert said Disney Online had been
working on development of the new site for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Online has lagged behind its competition. According to a
rankings list maintained by Media Metrix, Disney Online barely
registers among the top 20 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new partnership with Infoseek, in which Disney acquired a 43
percent stake in Infoseek, is expected to help, but analysts are
skeptical of Disney's overall prospects of displacing others as a
so-called portal site _ the Web site Internet users see when they
first log on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're using Yahoo now, particularly if you're an adult,
there's no way you're going to switch to Infoseek and Disney, not
in this life,'' said Keith Benjamin, an Internet analyst with
BancAmerica Robertson Stephens. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A link to the new site will also be available on the Disney home
page (www.disney.com). Dig is Disney's fourth Web site. In addition
to Disney.com, the company maintains Family.com and Disney's Blast
Online, a paid subscription service for children. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-Line Medical Aid for China &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Timed to coincide with President Clinton's visit to China this
week, American and Chinese doctors plan to perform a live
consultation over the Internet Thursday night to discuss two
severely ill children in China. It will be the first real-time
medical consultation between China and the United States over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The event is less a practical medical move than a show of
diplomacy. Members of the Clinton Cabinet are expected to be on
hand with doctors at the Medical University in Xian, a city in
central China, as they consult pediatricians at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital at Stanford University about a 12-year-old girl
with inflammation of the heart and a newborn with brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   The consultation will take place using standard Internet tools
for audio and video, as well as a ``white board'' feature that
enables participants to share text, images and sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's direct interplay, you get more from it,'' said
Dr. David Teitel, chief of pediatric cardiology at the University
of California at San Francisco, who will be participating. ``They
can respond, and you can respond more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other experiments with telemedicine in China,
relying mainly on e-mail among doctors. Several hospitals in China,
including Peking Union Medical College Hospital, have acquired
sophisticated video-based teleconferencing systems, but such
systems are not available for the rest of China's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the world has satellite links to Beijing, which is
not a very real test of medicine to China,'' said John Reuling,
director of information technologies at Stanford University's
School of Medicine. Reuling said the group had chosen to use widely
available Internet tools rather than state-of-the-art
video-conferencing systems because they wanted to focus on what was
actually available to doctors in Chinese cities outside the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   High-performance computers provided by Sun Microsystems will be
left in Xian so further exchanges between doctors from both
countries can take place. The consultation was organized by Bridge
to Asia, a nonprofit group. &QL;

   Popular Target: Family Trees
</P>
<P>
   The Web is an obvious destination for the genealogically
inclined, and its popularity among family tree makers was
underscored earlier this week when AT&AMP;T released the results of a
survey: nearly one-third of those responding said they had used the
Internet to seek family roots.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of more than 5,400 AT&AMP;T Worldnet Service
subscribers, one out of every 12 respondents said they had a
family-tree Web page. Of those who did not, nearly 70 percent said
they would like to create one.
</P>
<P>
   April Helm of Savoy, Ill., a professional genealogist who, with
her husband, Matthew, maintains several Web sites on genealogy,
pointed to the convenience of the Web as the principal reason for
the explosion in interest in genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding the Internet is a good tool for researching
their family because it saves them from having to leave their house
to find records,'' Ms. Helm said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that AT&AMP;T released its survey, it announced a
genealogy page on the AT&AMP;T Worldnet Service Web site
(www.att.net/find/ genealogy). The AT&AMP;T Genealogy Page features
links to genealogy resources and family-tree software. The company
has hired the Helmses as its resident genealogy experts. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   New Crackdown on Piracy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To fight software piracy, long the bane of the industry, the
Software Publishers Association plans to get tough by pressing
charges more often and publicizing a rogues' gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A report released last week by the association and the Business
Software Alliance showed that in 1997, the industry lost $11.4
billion worldwide to producers of illegal copies of business
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   Four in every 10 copies of business applications are bootlegged
versions, according to the report. The number does not include
software for general consumer use.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the association has settled about 90 percent of cases
with fines and confidentiality agreements. But leniency apparently
hasn't worked. ``There has to be zero tolerance when it comes to
software piracy,'' said David Phelps, an association spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have improved, the report says. Five years ago in
Europe, 9 out of 10 software programs were pirated, but that number
has dropped to 5 out of 10. Piracy is worst in Bulgaria, China,
Indonesia and Vietnam. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SELECTIVE SCREEN Just what the Web needs _ another filtering
program. But this two-in-one product looks like a good one. SOS
Kidproof, from Sterling Strategic Solutions, filters inappropriate
Web sites and protects PCs from accidental or intentional
tampering. And the company says it can distinguish between a Web
site containing ``breast of duck'' and one with questionable
pictures. The $29.95 package is expected to be in retail stores
next month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAKING ROOM ON LINE According to a report issued jointly earlier
this week by two research outfits, International Data Corp. and
Relevant Knowledge, the number of home Web users in the United
States will increase to nearly 102 million by 2002 from roughly 30
million.
</P>
<P>
   IDC reports that the percentage of those users who purchase
items on line will grow to almost 50 percent from 36 percent, with
overall spending increasing to more than $54 billion in 2002 from
$4.3 billion in 1997. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHOP TALK Speaking of shopping, Compare.net (www.compare.net),
the online shopping guide, announced deals with Classifieds 2000
and Deja News, the Internet discussion group search and archive
service, to allow its shoppers to search classified ads and get
access to discussion groups for peer opinions on products like
washing machines and used Corvettes. &QL;

RACE: WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston juvenile public defender Bill Talley was irked as he read
and watched the news of six fatal schoolyard shootings over eight
months by white youths in American hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   In news reports in the nation's top newspapers and magazines,
including The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Boston
Globe, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, and Newsweek,
Kip Kinkel, 15, the boy who allegedly killed his parents and two
classmates in a gun rampage in Oregon last month, was ``skinny,''
``slight,'' ``diminutive,'' or ``freckle-faced'' with an
``innocent'' look. Other white school assailants received the same
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Woodham, convicted last week in Mississippi of killing two
students, was described by print and broadcast reporters as ``the
chubby, poor kid at Pearl High School who always seemed to get
picked on,'' a ``nerd,'' and ``intelligent but isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carneal, who allegedly killed three students in West
Paducah, Ky., was ``thin'' and ``a solid B student.'' Mitchell
Johnson and Andrew Golden, who allegedly killed four girls and a
teacher in Jonesboro, Ark., were ``little boys.'' Andrew Wurst, who
allegedly killed a teacher in Edinboro, Pa., was a ``shy and quirky
eighth-grader with an offbeat sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   These descriptions, Talley says, contrast markedly with those
used in reports on young African-American and Latino killers in big
cities like Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's calling'' these white youths ``maggots or animals,''
said Talley, who defends many African-American and Latino youth in
court. ``Not that this coverage'' of Kinkel ``is bad, but the
question is: Why isn't the same type of language used when there
are black and Latino defendants?'' Roxbury District Court Judge
Milton Wright also saw sharp differences in the news coverage. For
example, a story on the Kinkel shooting in Newsweek began this way:
``With his shy smile and slight build, 15-year-old Kip Kinkel has
an innocent look that is part Huck Finn and part Alfred E. Neuman
-- boyish and quintessentially American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintessentially American?'' Wright said. ``That always means
white.''
</P>
<P>
   Several media analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never is an African-American kid or a Latino kid described as
being an all-American kid,'' said Darnell Hawkins, a professor of
African-American studies and sociology at the University of
Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the references are symptomatic of how the news
media create vastly different images for young white criminals and
for youths of color.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts say the huge coverage of the school shootings,
which violate a place considered safe and almost sacred, is
appropriate. But they say the media often dress up violent white
youth even in cases where they were known for violent or cultish
behavior. Analysts say such coverage widens the racial divide by
depicting black and Latino youth murderers as inhuman while making
young white killers seem too small, too smart, or too
innocent-looking to have committed their acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thinly veiled racial coding,'' said Franklin Gilliam,
a political scientist at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``They might have said this is a normal kid, but to say
he's Huck Finn is a little much.''
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on the coverage of the schoolyard attacks, Julian
Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, recently told the National Press Club: ``If this
were black kids doing this, you'd see op-ed pieces . . . talking
about a pathology of violence loose in the community, about some
dangerous elements being unleashed, about the breakdown in family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   When violent crime in urban communities reached alarming peaks,
a 1992 Washington Post article referred to it as ``the pathology of
random violence that is decimating black youth across the
country.'' A 1991 article in The Atlantic Monthly said, ``The
emergence of predominantly black underclass neighborhoods rife with
the worse symptoms of social pathology has proved to be one of the
most disturbing developments in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Many news stories since then have discussed whether black
teenage killers are ``superpredators.'' News accounts of young
black murder suspects culled from a Nexis-Lexis search of youth
killing often describe them in court as ``blank-faced,'' ``dazed,''
or ``showing no emotion.'' Unlike the more human terms given the
white school killers, young black suspects often are not described
physically at all. Often, the first description of them is whether
the youth was in a gang.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph Martin said many young
black suspects are ``seemingly sweet of countenance, and lacking in
obvious bravado.'' But Martin said he rarely sees black youth
described that way when their names make the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ray Hammond, chairman of the Ten-Point Coalition, known
nationally for its work against juvenile crime, said the media do
not ``relate to Raheem,'' choosing a synonym for black youth. ``To
them, he's from another culture, another world . . . someone who
slides down an inevitable path, one from which he cannot be
saved,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others said race is not a factor in the differing
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Polsby, a Northwestern University Law School professor who
comments on the media, Washington Post columnist James Glassman,
and Bill Kovach, director of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University, said the school shootings have a special shock value
because the crimes brutally revealed rural adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a kid has taken weapons and slaughtered numbers
of people, that mass-murder aspect to it, is what takes everybody's
breath away,'' Kovach said.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvin Poussaint, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist, and
Deborah Prothrow-Stith, a Harvard School of Public Health authority
on juvenile violence, have noticed big differences.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint notes that while there is wide media discussion of
mood disorders and depression for the white teenage killers, he
said there is little of that for low-income African-American and
Latino youth killers who suffer at higher levels of the kind of
depression that precedes violence.
</P>
<P>
   Prothrow-Stith said that when journalists ask her about the
school shootings, they are more inclined to probe for context than
when the killers are African-American and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that as the violence gets closer and closer to
home, we as a society become less likely to talk about demons and
superpredators, like we did with the kids in urban communities,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no race-based studies on word descriptions of
youthful criminals, several studies have shown how the media
stereotypes black and white people.
</P>
<P>
   -- Professor Robert Entman of North Carolina State University
found in a 1994 study of Chicago television news that blacks
suspected of violent crime are shown twice as much in the physical
grasp of police as whites suspected of violent crime. He also found
that white people, in a city that is half black, are portrayed as
good Samaritans 13 times more often than black people.
</P>
<P>
   -- In a 1997 study, Gilliam found that viewers of television
news often think criminals are black or Latino even when broadcasts
show no faces and make no mention of race.
</P>
<P>
   -- In a 1997 study of 214 hours of local television news in
California by the Berkeley Media Studies Group, 55 percent of
stories on youth involved violence, though less than 1 percent of
youths are arrested for violent crimes. Black and Latino youths
were more than twice as likely as white youths to be interviewed
for stories on violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's in contrast to Caucasian kids in news stories, who
appear in a variety of roles,'' said Lori Dorfman, codirector of
the Studies Group.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Gilliam, is that the image of a white teenage
killer often does not register in the newsroom. Gilliam perceives
that even when young suspects of color have no prior record of
trouble, they are still described in less sympathetic terms. ``If
my predisposition is that white kids are good, and one goes bad, I
don't blame all whites or all kids,'' Gilliam said. ``But an act by
a black kid is perceived as having implications for the entire
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Entman and Daniel Romer of the University of Pennsylvania say
the media need to examine how it describes youth. They say that
using Huck Finn or Alfred E. Neuman to describe violent white youth
is questionable, since there are no black icons of lovable rascals
seared into the nation's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A black kid wouldn't get that kind of language,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam said reporters should also avoid racial coding. In a
national Nexis-Lexis search of news stories, no school shootings
were associated with any ``pathology.'' Despite the horror of their
crimes, no story linked Kinkel, Woodham, Carneal, Johnson, Golden,
or Wurst with the term ``superpredator.''
</P>
<P>
   In his National Press Club speech, Bond said it is time that
America recognized factors behind youth violence that cut across
race and class. ``It seems to me there's kind of a pathology out
there, some kind of love of guns, a gun culture out there that's
dangerous and insidious,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, people like Hammond are waiting to see if the
coverage will result in the Kip Kinkels and Luke Woodhams being
seen as individual problems that white America can separate itself
from, or if it helps to ring a national alarm over how too many
youth of all colors use guns to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see where it goes from here,''
Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black kids have long been canaries in the coal mine, but no
one wanted to look down where the black canaries were. We were
invisible. Now that the canaries are visible, and next door, they
are not so easy to ignore.''

GM STRIKE A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do the autoworkers on strike against General Motors Corp.
understand that Americans aren't compelled to buy GM's cars and
trucks? Do they care? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the grievances that sparked the strike, the United Auto
Workers leadership must be aware that it is risking significant
long-term damage to GM's much-needed customer loyalty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Union members and UAW executives say the strike is about saving
jobs, but such logic is difficult to follow. While it's true that
UAW membership has shrunk substantially over the past quarter of a
century, it's also true that this is a result of rising production
efficiency throughout the industry forced by mounting competitive
pressures globally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the industry today is much different than it was a
generation ago, the GM arm of the UAW insists on pretending the
world is as it was in 1950s and 1960s. That was before the advent
of global competition, an era when Detroit's Big 3 could give labor
whatever it wanted and pass the increased labor costs along to the
buyer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In today's car-buying world there are no doubt still some
die-hard GM loyalists who will purchase nothing but GM products.
There aren't enough of them, however, to carry the day. GM's
viability depends on offering better vehicles at competitive
prices, which won't be possible without labor and management
working in harmony to achieve that goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given GM's labor relations record in recent years, it would be
easy to blame management's apparent inability to reach a happy
middle-ground with the UAW. Neither side should get hung up on who
is right and wrong, though. They should focus instead on what's
realistically possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most average car buyers, it's safe to say, don't have an
emotional stake in a labor dispute involving some of the highest
paid blue-collar workers in American society. They just want to be
able to purchase the best quality vehicle at the lowest possible
price. If they can't get it from GM, there are a dozen or so other
producers willing to fill their needs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't the many GM workers idled unwillingly putting more
pressure on the striking few to do whatever it takes to get
everyone back to work? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One theory emerging among labor economists following the auto
industry is that labor's intransigence is a demographic thing. This
line of thinking holds that since the average age of GM workers is
close to 50, UAW members aren't all that worried about the
company's long-term prospects. If things go sour, the old-timers
can grab their ``30-and-out'' retirement package and live off the
fat of their pension plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the younger union members are left holding the bag, well,
that's just tough luck, according to those leaning toward the
cynical view. It's never a good idea to generalize, but it's an
easy theory to buy into. Ford and Chrysler are getting stronger,
while GM's generation-long erosion of its market share is
undoubtedly a continuing sign of weakness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, union members and their negotiators seem
determined in this instance to pursue tactics designed to further
weaken their company. The only winners will be the older GM
production workers. The losers will be the younger union members,
the white-collar workforce, the shareholders and management. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's as though UAW generals are fighting the last war and the
troops are more than willing to sacrifice themselves in battles
that can't be won. &QL;

`MONTY' ROLE GIVES `RIDE' ACTOR A TASTE OF STARDOM AFTER THREE
DECADES OF WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Wilkinson can divide his life into P.M. and A.M.
</P>
<P>
   That's short for ``pre `Monty' '' and ``after `Monty.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the role of Gerald, the unemployed foundry manager who
teaches his former employees how to disrobe for fun, profit and
self-respect, Wilkinson was a major factor in the success of ``The
Full Monty,'' the little British film that has earned almost $250
million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ``Monty'' also has wrought some changes in the
life of this journeyman English actor, who has been in town filming
Ang Lee's Civil War film, ``Ride With the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly made a difference,'' Wilkinson, 50, said of
``Monty'' during a recent interview at a local hotel. ``Oddly
enough, it was brought home to me right here in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Westport the other night having dinner, and a glass
of wine appeared on my table. I told the waiter I hadn't ordered
it, and he pointed to a group of people at another table and said
they had ordered it for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's one thing to be recognized in London, where I've
been doing television and theater for years. But here in the
American Midwest?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, who in person looks 10 years younger and 20 pounds
lighter than the characters he portrays on film, has wasted little
time in capitalizing on his ``Monty'' fame by taking roles in
American movies. He recently completed a film with martial-arts
star Jackie Chan shot in Los Angeles, and after ``Ride'' he'll be
doing a movie in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me says I could have used this 15 years ago,'' he
said. ``But you go with what you have. That's just the way it
panned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Though born in England, Wilkinson spent much of his childhood in
Canada, where his parents hoped to buy a farm but ended up working
in an aluminum foundry in British Columbia. The family returned to
England when Tom was 11.
</P>
<P>
   Though he describes his mother as ``a gifted amateur actress,''
Wilkinson wasn't exposed to his future profession until his last
year of secondary school. ``I was inveigled into directing a play _
Ionesco's `The Bald Soprano' _ and immediately I knew what to do,
how it all worked. I suddenly realized this was my metier.''
</P>
<P>
   He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and then launched
a stage career that saw him working all over Britain. Gradually he
began getting roles in British television shows, many of which have
been broadcast in the United States by PBS. In one of the popular
``Prime Suspect'' entries, for example, Wilkinson played a police
bureaucrat who made life difficult for the show's heroine, played
by Helen Mirren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s were a really wonderful time,'' Wilkinson said of his
early years as an actor. ``It marked the emergence of the Beatles
and Bob Dylan, who were poets as well as musicians, and I realized
that a life in the performing arts was not just something done by
other people. We were all radicals in those days, earning 6 pounds
a week and squatting in vacant buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drift. I could always get work. I only needed enough
for a bottle of wine and a pack of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage and two children, now ages 6 and 10, put a crimp in
that lifestyle. Four years ago Wilkinson decided to concentrate on
feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant turning down lots of theater and TV work in
Britain. It was almost like starting over again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it paid off. He appeared in ``Priest,'' ``Smilla's Sense of
Snow,'' ``The Ghost and the Darkness,'' ``Oscar &AMP; Lucinda'' and Ang
Lee's ``Sense and Sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he will be seen in ``Wilde,'' portraying the real-life
Marquess of Queensberry, the certifiable sadist (and boxing
enthusiast) largely responsible for the imprisonment of gay
playwright Oscar Wilde on morals charges. That film is to open July
3 at the Fine Arts Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grasp on sanity was not as firm as it could have been,''
Wilkinson said of the marquess, ``which is a characteristic of
inbred nobility. And the purest-bred people in the world are the
British aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find the point of view of your character, no
matter how repellent he may seem. You can't act a bad guy. You
can't portray him as simply horrible. What he does may be horrible,
but as an actor you've got to see things through his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Iago in `Othello,' whom I've never played but always
wanted to. His motives are never really explained, and as an actor
you have to decide just what those motives are. You must justify
his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks Wilkinson can be seen in ``The Governess,''
playing an early 18th-century gentleman inventor who falls in love
with his children's governess (played by ``Good Will Hunting'' star
Minnie Driver).
</P>
<P>
   He also has a featured role in the upcoming ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the young woman who inspires
Shakespeare's sonnets.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ride With the Devil'' Wilkinson plays Orton Brown, a
Missouri farmer who allows wounded Confederate guerrillas to
recuperate in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's actually a very simple man,'' Wilkinson said. ``His Bible
dominates the front room. He's a straight arrow in the same way
that many farmers still are.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 30 years, one might expect a bit of weariness to
creep into Wilkinson's work. But just the opposite seems true. He
says he's more in love with acting than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's childish really. It's all about that childlike quality
you have to keep hold of. It's a big game of pretend. I watch my
kids play, and that's what I do. I play. I pretend. And after all
this time, I'm still addicted to it.''

CONFUSED CAST PRODUCES A MISGUIDED `COUSIN BETTE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cousin Bette,'' a drama, is rated R for sexuality. Running
time is 1 hour 52 minutes. Two out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   With her last gasp, the dying woman (Geraldine Chaplin) begs a
spinster cousin to look after her surviving husband and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise,'' says drab, colorless Cousin Bette (Jessica
Lange). ``I'll take care of all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a selfless pledge; actually it's a deadly
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The plain, impoverished Bette is sick of being a
maid-without-pay for her hoity-toity Paris relations. Years of
cruel indifference, if not outright abuse, have steeled her against
the family's womanizing, spendthrift patriarch, Hector (Hugh
Laurie); his icky daughter Hortense (Kelly Macdonald); and his
selfish son (Toby Stephens).
</P>
<P>
   Now it's payback time.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted by Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr from a 1845 novel by
Balzac and helmed by famed stage director Des McAnuff in his film
debut, ``Cousin Bette'' has the makings of a fiercely black comedy.
Only nobody seems to have told the actors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's running jokes is Bette's miserable luck. Even
when she plans a terrible revenge on Hector or a member of his
brood, blind luck steps in to deflect the blow. As often as not,
the scheme backfires on Bette _ like she's some sort of Wile E.
Coyote in a hoop skirt.
</P>
<P>
   This could be amusing. But the film is painfully
straightforward, played like a ``Masterpiece Theatre'' melodrama
rather than a sly wink at familial dysfunction. Every time there's
a choice between clever and dull, this movie opts for dull.
</P>
<P>
   Bette adopts a starving artist, Wenceslas (Aden Young), and
orchestrates for him a career-making commission. How is the
lovesick old maid rewarded? By seeing Hortense snatch the young man
right out from under her nose.
</P>
<P>
   Bette then takes another tack, attempting to ruin Hortense and
Wenceslas' marriage by urging a coquettish burlesque star
(Elisabeth Shue) to seduce Wenceslas. Of course, the trollop falls
for the young man in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Bette finally does get even, but by then few in the
audience will care.
</P>
<P>
   Lange, usually a terrific actress, plays Bette absolutely
straight. But at least she seems at home in the 1840s Paris
setting. Almost everyone else in this movie hasn't a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie seems to think he's doing a brief comedy sketch on one of
his old British TV shows. Quinn is an utterly bland,
one-dimensional young hunk. And Shue is a 20th-century girl, no
matter how frilly her costumes. Playing a period character
apparently is beyond her.
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff, whose stage triumphs include the musicals ``Big River''
and ``The Who's Tommy,'' delivers a first film that looks good but
plays like bad community theater.

SEATTLE WINS TOP PRIZE IN BIRDING COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seattle aced out Chicago, San Francisco and
Washington, D.C., for the title of America's Birding Capital.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiercely competitive 24-hour bird-watching spring marathon,
Seattle's crack team found the greatest number of species out of
the number expected in its region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phooey. It's very annoying,'' said Arthur Feinstein, director
of the National Audubon Society's Golden Gate chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' said birder Debbie Fisher, Ranier Audubon head,
who sent her teams to the Pacific Coast, Puget Sound, Cascade
Mountain foothills, Kings County and eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so close. Take a breath. I was really surprised. I just
found out this morning,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, the first of its kind for the National Audubon
Society, that raised more than $1 million for state and local
conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate's Feinstein congratulated Seattle, but he's still
assessing the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw 191 bird species. That's a heck of a lot of species,''
Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds like kvetching and sour grapes, but it's that
damn handicapping system. We're going to have to look at it more
closely next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Audubon Society asked each metropolitan area to
submit a list of birds that it might possibly see. The prize went
to the chapter that found the highest percentage of birds on its
list.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Murray, Audubon's National Birdathon manager, explained:
``Golden Gate Audubon had 259 species that they could have seen.
That includes all the species that are likely to be seen at this
time of year, migrating through or indigenous to the San Francisco
area. They saw 191 species, or 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle had a possible number of 225 species, essentially less
than the San Francisco Bay area because they don't have as many
diverse habitats. They saw 192, which is 85 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington D.C. found 84 percent; Chicago found 82 percent.

LOW SUBSTANCE MAKES `HIGH ART' A MEDIUM PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``High Art,'' a drama, is rated R for strong sexuality,
pervasive drug use and language. Running time is 1 hour 36 minutes.
Two out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the characters in ``High Art'' work for a
cutting-edge photography magazine and pepper their conversation
with critical cant. It's the kind of language that's indecipherable
on the printed page (try reading just about any art publication)
and sounds laughably pretentious actually coming out of someone's
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a way of speaking that imparts upon the user
a certain patina of high style while making little sense.
</P>
<P>
   Writer//director Lisa Cholodenko's debut film operates in much
the same manner. It's got style out the wazoo: drug-drenched
languid pacing, a heady undercurrent of eroticism, even some
knowing satire about the art scene.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end all that chic tends to keep us distanced from the
characters. It's like watching fish in a bowl; they look pretty
swimming in circles, but it's darn difficult to care what happens
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Syd (Radha Mitchell) is a young woman who has just been promoted
at Frame magazine. But basically she's just a glorified go-fer, and
she's desperate to climb into a position of real authority.
</P>
<P>
   When Syd discovers a once-trendy photographer _ Lucy Berliner
(Ally Sheedy) _ living in an apartment above hers, she envisions a
comeback by Lucy as her own ticket to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy, though, hasn't picked up a camera in years. Dropping out
of the art scene, she says, was ``a mental health decision.'' And
while she's gratified by Syd's interest (``I haven't been
deconstructed in a long time''), she's not sure she wants to break
out of the cozy cocoon of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll she has
built with her lesbian girlfriend, a perpetually zonked-out German
actress named Greta (Patricia Clarkson).
</P>
<P>
   So begins a slow seduction of feints and jabs. Syd (who has an
ineffectual live-in boyfriend) tries to maneuver Lucy onto the
pages of her magazine. Lucy tries to maneuver Syd into bed.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the seducer and who's the seduced? Hard to say, for both
women keep their motives to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``High Art'' is Sheedy's performance. One
of the queens of the '80s Brat Pack, Sheedy has undergone a
startling transformation. Her Lucy is an emaciated heroin user,
beset by lethargy and reluctant even to leave her apartment.
Despite her inability to function any longer in the cutthroat art
world, she's intrigued by this young woman who's come a-courting.
Could Syd represent a new start, both personally and
professionally?
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's Syd is an ambitious, mercenary soul hiding behind a
baby face. The strength of her performance, though, is that Syd
never seems ruthless. It's easy to see why Lucy succumbs.
</P>
<P>
   For pure, unadulterated scene-stealing, look to Clarkson (of
TV's ``Murder One''), who is both funny and harrowing as the
drug-soaked Greta. Speaking in a husky growl like Dietrich on
downers, moving in slow motion, wobbling about the room and boring
everyone with memories of her one movie with Fassbinder, Clarkson's
Greta provides ``High Art'' with desperately needed comic relief.

 ACTOR BURNS FAILS DIRECTOR BURNS in `NO LOOKING BACK'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No Looking Back,'' a romantic drama, is rated R for language.
Running time is 1 hour 36 minutes. Two and a half out of four
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Burns the filmmaker is turning out to be a pretty interesting
fellow. A lot more interesting, actually, than Ed Burns the actor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``No Looking Back'' the maker of the male-oriented ``The
Brothers McMullen'' and ``She's the One'' pulls an unexpected
switch by giving us a story from a woman's point of view. And a
serious story at that.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia (Lauren Holly) has her future all laid out for her _
whether she likes it or not. A lifelong resident of blue-collar Far
Rockaway, N.Y., she's a waitress in a diner and is living with an
old high school classmate, Michael (Jon Bon Jovi), who wants to
marry her though she hasn't agreed to a date. Her mom (Blythe
Danner) and sister (Connie Britton) live just around the corner;
her dad skipped out on the family years before, leaving Mom an
emotional wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Then into Claudia's too-predictable life steps the
unpredictable: her high-school flame Charlie (Burns), who abandoned
her several years before to indulge his wanderlust. Now he cruises
back into town, vaguely sheepish about his long absence but cockily
assuming that he and Claudia will pick up where they left off. He's
an unstoppable romantic force.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, his smugness infuriates Claudia. On the other,
Charlie was once the love of her life, and now he's offering escape
from a stifling existence.
</P>
<P>
   This is Holly's meatiest part to date, and despite the
character's slightly generic aspects she does a fine job of
inhabiting the role and capturing Claudia's yearning and
frustration. Bon Jovi is good as a loyal stiff who can't help it if
he doesn't exactly light her fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns' Charlie is a problem, an obvious loser whose
self-confidence is largely unjustified and whose allegedly
irresistible charm we must take on faith. Indeed, the character is
virtually the same one Burns has played twice before. He's starting
to look like a one-note wonder who's just a bit too taken with
himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, ``No Looking Back'' absolutely nails its
working-class milieu, from the wind-battered streets of this
seashore town and the Budweiser//Rolling Rock ambience of its bars
and restaurants to the Bruce Springsteen ``Tunnel of Love'' era
songs on the soundtrack. Burns has captured the angst of lives
spent waiting for something _ anything _ to happen.

HEAVY RAINS GOOD FOR KC GARDENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Knee-high, the Swiss chard seems to be
exploding out of the ground like a green-bubbly monster. Red veins
as bright as blood run down the center of each dinner-plate sized
leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these,'' says Kathy Marchant, as she stoops down to
touch one leaf. Her garden, a quarter-acre plot at 17th and Summit
streets, sits across from her natural foods store, The City Garden,
and her restaurant, The Bluebird Cafe. Visitors are encouraged to
walk the garden's mulch-lined paths and take in the sights and
fragrances of hundreds of spicy-sweet smelling herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty good year for our plants...because there's
been enough water,'' she says. ``In spite of everything, it's
really been a very good year, so far.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's strong storms, recent blasts of heat, and those 17-
and 13-year cicadas swarming over everything that doesn't move make
for just another typical growing season in Missouri. Taking on
challenges almost equal to a Biblical plague, gardening around
these parts requires not only a green thumb but also guts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I couldn't be a farmer and deal with all this,'' says
Fred Pereira, horticulturist and Master Garden volunteer at the
Missouri University Extension Service. ``They have to be stoic
about these things. But living in this growing zone, a lot of
Missourians have learned how to cope with the changes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants may look poorly after a strong storm, but it's amazing
how quickly they snap back by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many gardeners are enjoying the fruits of not only this
season, but last season's as well.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the borders of a picket fence at Marchant's garden,
sunflowers form a 20-foot canopy, and tower almost 7 feet high.
``These are just volunteers, a weed bed really,'' Marchant says.
``We never planted them. They just grew up this year, survivors of
the mild winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is doing well. The plants love the rain. But it's
the heat that kills off the lettuces.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Natural Weather Service predicting cooler than average
summer temperatures, gardeners who grow lettuce may be in luck. But
meteorologist Dan Virgillito stresses the key word in this
prediction is ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flat-out averages can be deceptive,'' he warns. ``In June,
we've been all over the map temperature-wise. But the average so
far says that we're below temperatures for this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Averages ignore the fact that you can have long stretches of
heat waves. All it takes is a few cooler days to bring down the
average temp for that month. But it will still feel like a heat
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain that has already drenched gardens has pushed 2 inches
above the rainfall average for June. Normally, precipitation hovers
around 3 inches; as of Monday, the total rain for the month dripped
in at 5.43 inches. And more rain is predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But rain doesn't hurt a garden unless the garden was placed in a
poor drainage site, says Bruce Chladny, a horticulturist and
extension agent at the K-State Research and Extension in Wyandotte
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the rain, people are also finding branches and twigs
littering their yards,'' he says. ``They think it's from the wind,
but it's really the cicadas.''
</P>
<P>
   Female cicadas lay their eggs by drilling a hole inside of a
tree branch. ``It looks like a pin-prick,'' Chladny explains. ``She
drills a hole, then puts a series of lines all along a branch.
What's happening is these strong winds are then making the branches
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do to stop it. I tell people, clean up
the branches and smooth out any rough breaks to help the tree heal
faster. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of these challenges, there is one thing gardeners can
do to help their gardens grow:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulch,'' Chladny says. ``But stay away from mulches with weed
seeds or those that have not yet gone through heat. If the mulch
hasn't heated up yet, it will, right on your garden, and kill
everything you've got out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute best mulch is...well, take The Kansas City Star,
open it flat, and put two sheets on top of each other. Place it
around your plants then pile any organic mulch on top of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty is at the end of the season all you need to do is
rototill everything under and you're ready for the next growing
season.''  &LR; brk:Great growing advice
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to help your garden grow:
</P>
<P>
   - Look at your garden everyday. ``Monitoring is the key,'' says
Fred Pereira, Missouri Master Gardener and horticulturist. ``If you
see something has wilted, give it a good soaking. Don't spray water
into the air but get it down near the plants roots. Water is a
precious resource and you're wasting it if you spray it into the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   - Mulch. ``Mulching keeps the moisture in the ground,'' Pereira
says. ``Mulch not only keeps plants from drying out, but it keeps
weeds down and prevents fungus from growing on the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   - Fertilize. ``I encourage people to use the everyday, common
fertilizer,'' he says. ``Anything that reads 5-10-5, or 10-10-10,
even 13-13-13, are good additions to the garden. But don't add too
much. I put half the specified amount on my garden. And I put
compost around the plants too.''
</P>
<P>
   - Call an expert if you can't identify what's wrong with your
plants. The Master Garden Volunteer Hotline is at 833-8733; the
K-State Research and Extension in Wyandotte County is at 299-9300.
</P>
<P>
   - Do all of the above and your plants will avoid stress _ and
bugs. ``Stressed plants attract bugs like a magnet,'' Pereira says.
``A healthy plant repels bugs. It's simple to have a green garden;
just keep your plants happy.''

   Author Colette Dowling no longer charges $3,000 a month on her
credit cards _ she doesn't have credit anymore. She is no longer a
homeowner _ her homes were sold and all profits went to the United
States government. At 60, she no longer has a retirement account _
she spent it renovating one of those houses she had to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Although she earned more than $1 million in the '80s on her
best-selling book The Cinderella Complex, within five years she had
spent it all. She sabotaged herself financially, amassing a $70,000
tax debt that is still not paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Today Dowling watches how she spends her cash as closely as a
dieter writing down every morsel. In trying to understand her
behavior she discovered something that surprised her: She wasn't
alone in her struggles with money.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling began documenting a trend about women and money, which
launched work on her seventh book, Maxing Out: Why Women Sabotage
Their Financial Security (LittleBrown, $23.95). Dowling shares not
only her story but those of other women who have floated
obliviously into a sea of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me could happen to anyone,'' she said, in a
telephone interview from Minneapolis during her book tour. ``Mine
is just more dramatic because of the sum involved. But I found that
women are especially vulnerable. We have been trained early on that
the entire sense of ourselves as female has been tied to not having
money, not managing it and not being financially independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowling, a divorced mother of three, had no problem handling
money as long as her children lived at home or as long as there was
a significant other in her life looking over her shoulder, keeping
her in check.
</P>
<P>
   But the kids grew up and left. Then she left her relationship.
When the money from her book began rolling in, Dowling lost control
of her finances. Her life became a fog of spending. In renovating a
home that she called her ``little fairy tale house,'' Dowling
dipped into her retirement account, promising herself to replace
the funds she borrowed. Each dip brought more penalties in taxes
against her. As the house became more beautiful, her retirement
account disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   She never knew exactly how much money was in either her checking
or saving accounts. She didn't want to know. Spending gave her a
sense of power _ until the day her money ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the date,'' she said. ``April 15, 1994. I
opened the bill from my accountant for my taxes and it said I owed
$50,000.'' (Eventually, that sum grew to $70,000 when the next
year's taxes came due.)
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Dowling learned she was broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women have good abilities to deal with financial
situations,'' she said. ``But the equation changes when they're on
their own. When the restraints were gone in my life, spending money
gave me a thrill. It was at times, almost intoxicating....
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear afterward was that I wouldn't understand why
it happened, therefore dooming myself for it to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowling began hearing of other women who fell into financial
problems. Heiress Gloria Vanderbilt had to sell off two luxury
homes to pay her tax debt. A newly divorced Duchess of York spent
her way into thousands of dollars of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never paid attention to those stories before, but now I was
riveted by them,'' Dowling said. ``When I looked deeper into our
society, I saw this happening over and over again, mostly to
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sheets, of Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Kansas
City, said it is common for both men and women to spend money when
they've gone through a life change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are transitional points where a kind of
unleashing happens,'' he said. ``I've seen many go off the deep-end
spending. When they're free of a burden, or something that caused
them a lot of pain and suffering, they want to experience joy
again. So they spend. So many also forget to watch the repayment
side. Sixty percent of the people we help are women.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because women learn early that creating a home is their
job, Dowling said. Dealing with money isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a lot of women aren't going to want to hear this,
there are still those of us who are waiting for someone to rescue
them from working full time their entire life, or from having to
worry about finances,'' she said. ``Many women equate
self-sufficiency with ending up isolated, alone and uncared for....
Money is the final frontier of feminism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowling found her way out of her financial abyss by joining
Debtor's Anonymous. Leery of its 12-step program at first, she
found that the 12 steps taught her valuable tools in managing
money. One step was to write down every cent she spent. She also
joined several women's groups to develop new friendships, and she
began a women's investment group to learn the stock market from
square one.
</P>
<P>
   She rents a small house from a friend in upstate New York and
has almost paid off her tax debt to the government, but an illness
last year set her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no retirement and no disability insurance,'' she said.
``I am rebuilding it all. But I know I can do it. I'm in such a
different place than I was four years ago. Now watching my finances
grow feels pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women sabotage their finances because they're afraid of
money's power. But I'm not afraid of it anymore.''  &LR; brk:SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   Dowling has these suggestions to help women avoid maxing out
financially:
</P>
<P>
   - Have only one credit card.
</P>
<P>
   - Pay off that credit card debt every month.
</P>
<P>
   - If you have debt you're overwhelmed with, join a support group
to help you through it. ``I recommend Debtor's Anonymous highly,''
she said. ``Their 12-step program really works.'' Debtor's
Anonymous' Web site includes its 12 steps. That address is
www.debtorsanonymous.org.
</P>
<P>
   - If you don't have any debt, seek out information on investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC) puts
out a monthly magazine filled with great tips,'' Dowling said.
``Women will spend hours shopping for the best deal. Just think if
they spent that time investing in the stock market?'' NAIC can be
reached at (248) 583-6242.
</P>
<P>
   - Join an investment club or begin your own. ``Learning about
the stock market with a group of women is really inspiring,'' she
said. ``By pooling your resources you learn without a lot of risk.
You'd be surprised how little time it takes to make an investment
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   - Begin saving 10 percent of every check that comes your way and
put it aside for your retirement before you pay any other bill.
``Pay yourself first,'' Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   - Keep a journal of every cent you spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``By keeping a journal I learned I was spending $30 a month on a
lousy cup of coffee every morning when I bought my paper,'' she
said. ``It was just a habit. Now I wait and make a delicious cup at
home.''

AMERICAN HUMANICS REAPS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LAURA R. HOCKADAY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A national but virtually unknown
organization, based in Kansas City for half a century, observed its
50th anniversary with a dinner Thursday (June 18) at the
Marriott-Muehlebach Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders and staff members of nonprofit agencies from Kansas City
and throughout the United States attended the event for American
Humanics. Many guests, representing Boy Scouts of America, the
American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity International and other
national human service organizations, had studied American Humanics
as college undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   They had learned how to earn a living in the nonprofit world:
How to budget, raise funds, work with volunteers. Armed with an
American Humanics certificate, they had moved immediately into
management positions with nonprofit agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For David J. Ross II, scout executive of the Heart of America
Council of Boy Scouts, his American Humanics classes led to a
lifetime career and marriage. He and his wife, Jane Fey Ross, met
in classes at Missouri Valley College in Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ross is responsible for a $6 million annual budget for the
Heart of America Council that serves 51,000 youths from 7 to 21
years old in 19 counties in Missouri and Kansas, has 38 full-time
staff members and 16,000 adult volunteer mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven of our staff members have American Humanics
certificates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a virtual cocoon for most of its life, American
Humanics, with headquarters at 4601 Madison Ave., is now coming
into its own. It is called on for young talent by human service
organizations across the country, offering assistance in everything
from housing to recreation. Backed by corporate foundations instead
of federal dollars, nonprofit agencies are mushrooming and the
demand for qualified staff to run them is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program is currently taught on 54 campuses, but by 2001 we
hope to be on 100 campuses,'' said American Humanics President Kirk
Alliman. ``The unique thing about the program is that it is the
only one of its kind offered to undergraduates. Nearly 70
universities offer nonprofit management education for graduate
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Father of American Humanics
</P>
<P>
   The late H. Roe Bartle, best remembered as Kansas City's mayor
from 1955 to 1963, is the father of American Humanics. In Kansas
City to represent him at the anniversary was his daughter,
``Jimmy'' Bartle Taylor of Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years Bartle led the Greater Kansas City Area (now the
Heart of America) Council of Boy Scouts. As executive director, he
was responsible for hiring qualified staff members. He had no
trouble finding people with good hearts and intentions, but many
knew nothing about running an organization.
</P>
<P>
   What they had was ``consecrated ignorance,'' said Bartle, known
for his way with words. A big man with a big voice to back his
ideas, he came up with a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of longtime civic leader Jerry Cohen and others,
Bartle founded American Humanics Inc. in Kansas City in 1948. His
idea was to teach college undergraduates the business side of
running nonprofit agencies. Courses would be conducted on campus,
and experienced agency executives would present classroom lectures
and workshops. Students would volunteer in community agencies,
learning from on-the-job experience. At graduation, they would have
the management skills to run nonprofit agencies from the top.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle's idea _ in force since its inception _ was ahead of its
time. Fifty years ago, most college campuses were not interested in
adding American Humanics courses to their curriculums. Veterans
returning from World War II were completing their education on the
GI Bill and considering careers in the for-profit, not the
nonprofit, field. So American Humanics began and grew within a
small network of colleges. That picture has changed dramatically in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program may be the least known of the legacy of H. Roe
Bartle but the most far-reaching, with 2,700 alumni today,'' said
Norman E. Swails of Lee's Summit, retired presiding bishop of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with
headquarters in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Swails took advantage of the American Humanics courses taught at
Missouri Valley College. After his graduation in 1952, he went to
work for the Boy Scouts. When he retired 31 years later, he was
assistant chief scout executive//national director of finance. One
of his last duties was to successfully complete a $56 million
fund-raising campaign. In 1985 he came to Independence to direct a
$60 million building campaign for the new RLDS temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my careers in scouting and in the church to American
Humanics,'' he said. ``The program taught me the principles of
working with volunteers and raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   Spreading the word
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Alliman was president of Hesston College, north of Wichita,
Kan., when he was tapped to be president of American Humanics in
1992. His mission: To spread American Humanics to college campuses
across the country. The program had managed to infiltrate only 12
colleges since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Alliman hired a dynamic director of campus expansion. Phyllis A.
Wallace had been national associate director for the YMCA in
Chicago for 10 years. Since joining American Humanics in 1995,
Wallace has expanded the program from 12 to 54 campuses. About 900
students are enrolled today, but Alliman and Wallace want to have
5,000 enrolled on 100 campuses by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the expansion has come from a $2.4 million grant
from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, based in Battle Creek, Mich., and
a $250,000 gift from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have focused on minority college campuses,'' Wallace said,
``because nonprofits are crying out for minority staff _ for
African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and Native Americans.
And they are desperately wanting men. Traditionally more women have
gone into the nonprofit field. It is possible now to enter the
nonprofit sector with the idea of not only doing good for others,
but earning a starting salary of $25,000 to $30,000. In Kansas
City, there are more than 200 job opportunities available
annually.''
</P>
<P>
   American Humanics courses are offered only on four-year college
campuses, Wallace said, because a bachelor's degree is required for
anyone receiving a humanics certificate. The latter represents 180
hours of course work and 300 hours of internship _ on-site
volunteer work with a community agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst College is the only area metropolitan campus offering
American Humanics courses. Jenny Rinella, a 1993 graduate with a
humanics certificate, is executive director of the program there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I majored in sociology, but I am particularly talking to
business students about American Humanics because the combination
is a good one for starting a career,'' Rinella said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lozares, a Rockhurst senior majoring in economics, is
taking humanics courses with the hope of someday making life better
on the reservation he knew as a child in Meridian, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and
spent my early childhood on the reservation,'' he said. ``People
there are poverty-stricken and in poor health. I hope to work with
the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of American Humanics graduates working in management
roles in the Kansas City area include:
</P>
<P>
   - Liz Russell Willman: The first person to serve as executive
director of the 9-year-old Shawnee Mission Education Foundation,
which provides grant money for teachers and principals to fund
innovative projects.
</P>
<P>
   - Marshall Hollingsworth: Director of finance, National Center
on Fathering, based in Merriam.
</P>
<P>
   - Phil Hanson: Executive vice president, financial resource
development, Heart of America United Way.
</P>
<P>
   - Cyndi Roth Campbell: Director of volunteer recruitment for the
Greater Kansas City chapter, American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to night school to get my American Humanics
certificate,'' said Campbell, who handles the records for nearly
800 volunteers. ``During my internship I volunteered at the Red
Cross. I think one of the great assets of the humanics program is
that your instructors are brought into the classroom from the
not-for-profit field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional educational experience tries to simulate the
real world. But American Humanics brings the real world into the
classroom. When you are turned out into the world, you are ready.''

   Kate's weight a plus
</P>
<P>
   For plus-sized women who have been made to feel lesser for it,
the times have definitely started to change. Among their ranks,
Emme, the model, is hosting cable channel E!'s ``Fashion
Emergency.'' Rosie O'Donnell is the toast of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most recent role model for young large women is
``Titanic'' romantic lead, Kate Winslet. After an apparent bout
with yo-yo weight swings, the actress recently told a British
magazine she has decided to accept herself (and weight) as she is.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant, the national plus-size retail chain, cheerfully
delivers the news along with the announcement that the 17- to
25-year-old category is the fastest growing segment of the
plus-size market.
</P>
<P>
   The accept-yourself battle may not be totally won. Some
psychologists maintain emotional angst over body size is still a
major complaint among their young patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a Lane Bryant survey of 500 women between ages 17
and 25 indicated 91 percent believe a woman doesn't have to be
skinny to be sexy, and 99 percent wanted the same fashion choices
as thin women ... meaning body-conscious silhouettes, shapely
T-shirts and bare summer dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The company will shift some gears to reach out especially to the
young customer this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer rising
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez, who appears with George Clooney in the film
``Out of Sight,'' has a new contract as exclusive model for the
L'Oreal company. You'll see her in advertising for VIVE hair care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez also portrayed the title character in the film ``Selena.''
 &LR; hed:And the bride wore, uh,...
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the new world is a press release advising
brides on how to deal with a tattoo for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   From David's Bridal, a chain of retail stores, comes some
valuable tips such as: Long gloves cover a tattoo design on the
upper arm. A scoop neck enhances a butterfly on the chest. And
opaque body makeup patted on from the outer edges, dried and
repeated will camouflage the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone for how-to's on camouflaging pierced parts?
</P>
<P>
   Dress for the picnic?
</P>
<P>
   Flags apparently still have fashion appeal, at least among some
of the 2- to 10-year-old set. Heart's Designs, the Lenexa-based
children's wear company, says its patriotic flag motif clothes _
featured in Children's Wear Digest and area stores _ are runaway
best sellers for the third straight year.

 &HT;    TED TURNER THE FEMINIST IN THEIR MARRIAGE, JANE FONDA SAYS
 &HT;    Not for Atlanta
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pssst. Media mogul and Southern dawg Ted Turner is
a ... feminist!
</P>
<P>
   So says Jane Fonda, Turner's outspoken wife, who enlivened a
National Press Club luncheon Wednesday with tales of her
six-year-old marriage to Turner, personal anecdotes about her
struggles with self-esteem and serious talk about her favorite
subject, teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he's a Southern boy, and I've been married a few
other times, he is the feminist,'' Fonda said of Turner, CNN's
founder. ``And he allows me to be roughly equivalent. ... There are
some women who think that doesn't sound right, that's not
politically correct. But you know what? It's true. I am way
stronger than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, looking about half her age (she is 60), left virtually no
subject untouched in an hour-long speech to a packed house of the
capital's media brokers.
</P>
<P>
   She blasted the leadership of the Christian Coalition. ``They
don't care about children that are not white, middle-class
Christians,'' she said. ``As far as they're concerned, others can
be eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   She defended the Tomahawk chop, which fans use to cheer on the
Atlanta Braves. ``It's what the crowd likes to do,'' she said.
``There are more important issues for Native Americans to work on
than the tomahawk chop.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to slam the Chinese for their policy of forced
abortions. ``It's a very complicated issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She urged movie-goers to boycott movies containing sex and
violence _ especially the ones that ``put sex and violence
together.''
</P>
<P>
   And she pronounced feminism as decidedly Not Dead. ``Feminism
means that you ask of your partner to be given your space, to be
seen and to be heard and to be recognized, and to be put on a
pedestal when your turn comes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only question Fonda dodged was one about Monica
Lewinsky, the White House intern who is under investigation by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for reportedly lying about a
sexual relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda reserved her most passionate remarks for the subject of
teen pregnancy, a cause to which she has devoted herself to through
the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention. She
applauded recent figures showing teen pregnancy was down 12
percent, but said America's rates were still too high.
</P>
<P>
   She called on Congress to reverse current mandates that require
schools that accept federal sex education money to encourage
abstinence only in sex education curriculums. Sex education must
promote abstinence, but also teach children about contraception,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some children for whom the ``Just Say No'' message,
if started early enough, can be effective,'' she said. ``But I do
know that it doesn't work for all kids.''

ADULT CHILDREN GET HELP IN CELEBRATING PARENTS' GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's face it. Being married is hard work. Staying married is
even harder. But being married for 50 years?
</P>
<P>
   Yow! Now that deserves a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, wedding and party planners note, when it comes
to their parents, baby boomer children are happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are two reasons,'' said Michael Nolte, owner of
Nolte's Bridal Salon in Overland Park, Kan. ``For one, I think
there is better health care now, and as a result the honorees
physically feel more like having a party. And two, I think people
are turning more to their families as a source of happiness. As a
result, they're making the events in a family's life a
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after half a century of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   You know you should do something.
</P>
<P>
   But what?
</P>
<P>
   Is a simple reception with friends and family enough, or should
you send them on a cruise? What about a catered party with a band
and an elaborate spread of food? How much money should you spend?
How many people should you invite? And what if they insist they
want nothing at all?
</P>
<P>
   Beth Carver-Swain of Lenexa, Kan., has some advice on that last
point.
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents said they didn't want a formal celebration. So she
didn't give them one.
</P>
<P>
   She realized later that was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was a little sad about not having a formal
celebration,'' Carver-Swain said. ``She didn't say anything. But
she kept mentioning that they were going to another 50th
celebration, and another 50th and I think I got the message.''
</P>
<P>
   So on their parents' 52nd wedding anniversary, Carver-Swain and
her brother, Dale, organized a surprise open house featuring about
40 friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They walked in and it was decorated for their 50th,'' she
said. ``They were very happy, very excited. The hit of the party
was a cake with a computerized honeymoon picture of them on the top
that I got from a bakery. It was a picture of them on their
honeymoon at a resort in Ohio. They enlarged the picture of their
faces, and you could tell they were truly in love with each other.
They were embracing and smiling. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   They also showed a video of past memories, using images of
special pictures set to music .
</P>
<P>
   ``They were overwhelmed,'' Carver-Swain said. ``But it did a lot
for me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have planned 50th wedding anniversaries offer plenty
of advice.
</P>
<P>
   - Start early _ a year is not too far in advance, especially if
you're booking a place to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   - Have meetings with other siblings to decide what should be
done, how much should be spent, who will do the work and how to
split the cost.
</P>
<P>
   - Pattern the observance after the couple's personality. Are
they extravagant and fun-loving? A larger celebration is fine. More
conservative and quiet? Use restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Edwards of Kansas City, North, Mo., is getting good at
putting on 50th wedding anniversaries. She has done two of them in
the past year _ one for her parents, T.K. and Diana Leake, and one
for her in-laws, Harold and Bonnie Edwards, just last week.
</P>
<P>
   She prides herself on adding that ``special touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Bonnie and Harold didn't get a chance for a wedding
reception, we wanted them to get a chance to toast each other and
to cut the cake and feed each other,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also knew her in-laws had a favorite song _ Anne Murray's
``Could I Have This Dance.'' So she had their granddaughter, Meg,
sing it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Family members also collaborated to write the couple a poem, and
friends provided meaningful memorabilia, including a blue necklace
and earrings that Bonnie Edwards borrowed for her wedding day. A
friend with a photography program on her computer even agreed to
help make special thank you cards, complete with individualized
pictures taken at the party of the couple and guests that read
``thank you for celebrating with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as paying for the celebrations?
</P>
<P>
   Use common sense, Edwards said. Since she did the planning for
the celebration, her brother (who makes more money than she does)
paid for a larger share of their parents' celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Jones of Kansas City organized a 50th wedding anniversary
celebration last weekend for her parents _ Stanley and Dorothy Rank
of Kansas City, Kan. _ with the help of 10 brothers and sisters.
The elaborate celebration included a Mass, followed by a reception
with a large spread of food, a band and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   How'd they manage it all?
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with a meeting and tried to divvy up the chores,''
Edwards said. ``It helped to put one person in charge of food, then
one person in charge of the invitations, etc. ... Then we would
meet again a month or two later and each person would report what
they had done, or what they were planning to do, then that would be
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things they decided was that the children would all
contribute to a written tribute to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make my mother cry,'' she said. ``It's one of
those things where you didn't want to wait too long, and say `I
wish I had said ... ' You want to do it while they can comprehend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chi Chi Pellegrino Puhl, a Kansas City attorney, also put a lot
of planning into a recent celebration for her parents, Frank and
Helen Pellegrino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and forth on whether we would get all the kids to
meet on the beach and have a reunion or send them on a cruise or
throw a big party,'' she said. ``We ended up throwing a big
party.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like putting on a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Mass where the couple renewed their vows. The Mass
included an organist, a soloist, a flutist and many grandchildren
and great-grandchildren who took part. A reception followed with
more than 200 guests, dancing, a polka band and a smorgasbord of
ethnic food, including such Italian and Polish favorites as
(cabbage rolls stuffed with rice and ground beef), ]pierogi
(similar to steamed dumplings), rigatoni and red sauce with Italian
mixed vegetables along, with Italian tomatoes and Povitica bread.
</P>
<P>
   She kept family members updated with periodic memos and even
surveyed them on key issues such as how the celebration should be
structured, whether they wanted to go ahead with it after receiving
the estimated costs and how to split the costs if they did.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, said wedding planner Nolte, celebrations don't
have to be costly or complicated. You can have a backyard barbecue
if you want, Nolte said, and still have special touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nicest gift themes I have seen is when the children
send out a separate mailing requesting the guests write a letter
recalling a specific memory they shared with the couple,'' he said.
``Those memories are then compiled into a decorative scrapbook and
given to the couple. And on the page the memory was written, there
would be a photograph taken of every guest at the party, and then
that photo would be added to their page. It's a lot of trouble, but
it's very well-received.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever you decide to do, Nolte said, make sure it involves
some sort of presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives the celebration a focus,'' Nolte said. ``It could
be a toast, tributes from friends, the original bridal party could
share memories of the wedding day with everyone, or they could cut
a tiered wedding cake. But it doesn't have to be expensive.''

 &HT;    Georgia's baby CD program to last a year
 &HT;    By Alma Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Zell Miller's program to send newborns home with
an album of classical music will last 12 months, the governor said
Wednesday at a news conference in which he presented the first
babies with a copy of ``Build Your Baby's Brain Through the Power
of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The classical music album, a pet project of Miller's, will be
handed out to all new Georgia parents, starting in July. It's being
provided free to the state by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing albums for babies, Miller cited studies showing
classical music can stimulate babies' brain development and, as
children grow, help them excel in math. Classical music is also
considered soothing to fussy infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the children of Georgia were the smartest
anywhere. With this program, we can now give them an even greater
head start,'' Miller said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Liner notes on the album include a short note from the governor
urging parents to play the music for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh,
laughed when Miller announced his proposal in January. But Sony
Music Entertainment took him seriously and will produce 100,000
cassettes and compact discs to distribute to the 110,000 babies
born in Georgia each year. The company is providing the albums for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals throughout the state are already receiving shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will have left office when the yearlong effort expires.
It remains to be seen whether his successor, or someone else, will
try to keep the program going.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who already have children don't have to wait until they
have another baby to get a copy of the album. But it will cost
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sony will sell the cassettes and compact discs to the public. To
order call 1-800-356-1052. CDs cost $11.98, cassettes $6.98, plus
$3.95 for shipping and handling.

MISSOURI GOVERNOR SIGNS MEASURE THAT WILL HELP KANSAS CITY SCHOOL
DISTRICT AVOID BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY _ Calling it a ``monumental piece of
legislation,'' Gov. Mel Carnahan signed into law Tuesday a bill
that will help the Kansas City School District avoid bankruptcy
once state desegregation payments end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where very conflicting interests on this issue
all came together in a very splendid way,'' Carnahan told
reporters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly's approval of the bill in May ended years
of disputes over how to end court-ordered desegregation payments
without damaging the Kansas City and St. Louis school districts.
The state has paid about $3 billion since 1981 to help remedy
education inequities in the two districts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This really was a miracle of the session,'' said House Speaker
Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, even as the governor signed the measure, some school
district officials still said they think their students are being
treated unfairly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, for example, stands to get an extra $1.6 million a
year under the bill, but school leaders say they think Kansas City
and St. Louis still will get more than their fair share of state
money. The Springfield board has asked its attorney to determine
whether there are grounds for a lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City now gets $100 million a year to help desegregate
schools, but the funding is scheduled to end June 30, 1999. Under
the new bill, Kansas City will get $40 million, which school
officials said will help the district survive financially. To make
up the rest of the money, Kansas City will cut spending
dramatically. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City school board member Lance Loewenstein, who went to
Jefferson City several times to urge support for the legislation,
said it helps ensure the district's return to local control, to
neighborhood schools and to fiscal responsibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we don't have as much money floating around
makes us much more disciplined in everything we do,'' Loewenstein
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing money for Kansas City schools, the bill
earmarks money for basic state aid and for shoring up the St. Louis
School District. Other school districts around the state also will
benefit, with money being divided up among school districts based
on their tax levies and the proportion of students in poverty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill also legalizes charter schools in the Kansas City and
St. Louis school districts. Charter schools get taxpayer dollars
but are independently run, with the aim of giving families
alternatives to traditional public schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires settlement of the 26-year-old St. Louis
desegregation case before schools in the Kansas City district can
get the $40 million. Critics said that was unfair to Kansas City,
which has settled its desegregation lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan said he feels good about chances for just such a
settlement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there are no guarantees; but my assessment is very
optimistic,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides remedies that plaintiffs in the St. Louis
lawsuit said were needed for a settlement, said Mary Still,
spokeswoman for Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon. Still said
Tuesday that settlement talks continue among parties in the
lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Scott, executive director of the Civic Council of Greater
Kansas City, said after the ceremony she thinks the Kansas City
School District will get the $40 million provided by the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein also said that he has received assurances that the
General Assembly will provide some financial relief for Kansas City
if St. Louis doesn't settle its case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During days of legislative debate, critics of the bill,
including many rural lawmakers, alleged that Kansas City and St.
Louis district schools still get too much compared with other
school districts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ted Tabor, assistant superintendent for administration in
Springfield, noted Tuesday that Kansas City and St. Louis will get
more state aid for students in poverty than Springfield will. But
under the bill that aid depends on both the number of students in
poverty and the district's levy, which is a strong gauge of local
support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield the levy is $3.17 per $100 of assessed valuation
compared to $4.96 in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he was mystified by criticism of the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they want to continue court-ordered desegregation payments
forever?'' he asked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein shared the governor's attitude, noting that the
legislation actually helps free up more money for rural districts,
because it replaces the $100 million annual desegregation subsidy
to Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The rural districts need to understand that if we hadn't
settled with the state and pursued this legislation, they would be
paying into perpetuity,'' Loewenstein said. ``The state's
obligation would continue well beyond the year 2000 and well beyond
the amount of money we will now get on an annual basis...The rural
districts need to realize we did them a favor.'' &QL;

CIA CHIEF WARNS THAT AMERICA IS VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, the only superpower in the
world, is vulnerable to computer attacks that have the potential to
cripple the nation, CIA Director George J. Tenet said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said several nations are developing plans and training
personnel to sabotage military and civilian computer systems in the
United States in the event of a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries realize there's no way they could beat the
United States in a conventional war, so they're looking to level
the playing field by going after our dependence on computers,'' he
told the Senate Committee on Government Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., asked him to
identify the countries, but Tenet declined. However, later in the
hearing, he hinted that Iran, Iraq and Libya were among those
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq, Iran and Libya have all put in programs to increase
their information technology in relation to their military
capabilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Defense Department study showed that the Pentagon's
computer systems were attacked 250,000 times in 1995. Last year,
Defense Department computer engineers secretly tested their
computer defense system by launching 38,000 attacks of their own.
The engineers, using computers and software available to the
public, succeeded in breaking into the systems 65 percent of the
time. More troubling, according to Tenet, was that 63 percent of
the attacks went undetected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have staked our way of life on the use of information ...
but we are building this on an insecure foundation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth A. Minihan, director of the National
Security Agency, the government's electronic spying division, said
the growing interdependence of computer systems around the world
not only boosts America's vulnerability but also helps shield the
identity of computer attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than attacking a system directly from their own
computers, hackers often go first through other computers.
Investigators then must attempt to backtrack until they discover
the origin of the attack, although in most cases they fail, Minihan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a normal battle, in cyberspace we rarely know who is
hitting us and where they're hitting us from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan added that potential attacks may not always be aimed at
the military. Computer systems that are relied on by banks, public
utilities and transportation networks, such as trains, also are
considered primary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like in World War II when we tried to disrupt the enemy's
war machine by bombing factories and wreaking havoc on their
economies, our enemies will try to take out our main industries by
cutting off their computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all computer attacks committed in the United States
currently are done by hackers who have no political goals, he said.
But he added, ``We know of one (politically motivated hacker
attack) and we suspect others.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said the foreign governments that are developing their
computer attack capabilities are known to be studying the hackers'
methods and how the U.S. military is responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are working on programs to use this type of
attack, so we have a window of opportunity to get some defenses put
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan said the military is working on computer defense shields
that can detect and repel an attack but he said that a fail-proof
system has not yet been developed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Americans also face a serious security threat from the potential
problems stemming from the so-called Year 2000 computer bug, Tenet
and Minihan said. Because of a programing error in many older
computer chips, experts predict that many computers will shut down
or display incorrect information on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's defense systems run on computers that are
infected with the bug, some U.S. analysts fear that country's
missile defense systems could begin to malfunction or even break
down completely.
</P>
<P>
   The American analysts worry that the Russians could mistake a
shutdown of their missile defense systems as an attack, prompting
them to order a counter-assault, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   In one scenario in which Russia's missile systems continue to
work but show incorrect information, U.S. analysts fear the
Russians might order a counter-attack to an assault that, in
reality, is taking place only on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said U.S. military and civilian computer experts are
working with the Russians to ensure that no misunderstandings occur
on Jan. 1, 2000.

   &UR; HOSPITAL HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A husband was just coming out of anesthesia after a series of
test in the hospital, and his wife was sitting at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes fluttered open and he murmured, `You're beautiful.`
</P>
<P>
   Flattered, his wife continued her vigil while he drifted back to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Later he woke up and said, `You're cute.`
</P>
<P>
   `What happened to 'beautiful'?` she asked him.
</P>
<P>
   `The drugs are wearing off,` he replied.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EITHER WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An expectant mother was being rushed to the hospital, but didn't
quite make it. She gave birth to her baby on the hospital lawn.
Later the father received a bill, listing: `Delivery Room Fee:
$500`
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the hospital and reminded them that the baby was born
on the front lawn. A week passed, and a corrected bill arrived:
`Greens Fee: $200`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHAPTER 11 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man has been in business for many, many years and the business
is going down the drain. He is seriously contemplating suicide and
he doesn't know what to do. He goes to the Priest to seek his
advice. He tells the Priest about all of his problems in the
business and asks the Priest what he should do.
</P>
<P>
   The Priest says, `Take a beach chair and a Bible and put them in
your car and drive down to the edge of the ocean. Go to the water's
edge. Take the beach chair out of the car, sit on it and take the
Bible out and open it up. The wind will rifle the pages for a while
and eventually the Bible will stay open at a particular page. Read
the Bible and it will tell you what to do.`
</P>
<P>
   The man does as he is told. He places a beach chair and a Bible
in his car and drives down to the beach. He sits on the chair at
the water's edge and opens the Bible. The wind rifles the pages of
the Bible and then stops at a particular page. He looks down at the
Bible and sees what he has to do.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later the man and his family come back to see the
Priest. The man is wearing a $1,000 Italian suit. The wife is all
decked out with a full-length mink coat and the child is dressed in
beautiful silk. The man hands the Priest a thick envelope full of
money and tells him that he wants to donate this money to the
church in order to thank the Priest for his wonderful advice. The
Priest is delighted. He recognizes the man and asks him what advice
in the Bible brought this good fortune to him.
</P>
<P>
   The man replies: `Chapter 11.`

   Fred goes to a doctor and says, `Doc, I want to be castrated.`
The doctor says, `Look, I don't know what kind of cult you're into
or what your motives are, but I'm not going to do that sort of
operation.`
</P>
<P>
   Fred replies, `Doc, I just want to be castrated and I'm a little
embarrassed about talking about it, but I have $5,000 cash right
here. Will you do it?` The doctor says, `Well, okay, I guess I
could make this one exception. I don't understand it, but alright.`
</P>
<P>
   He puts Fred to sleep, does the operation and is waiting at the
bedside when Fred wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, Doc, how'd it go?` Fred asks.
</P>
<P>
   `It went fine, just fine. It's really not too difficult of an
operation. As a matter of fact, $5,000 is a lot to pay for such a
simple task and I felt a little guilty about taking that much. So,
while I was operating, I also noticed that you had never been
circumcised, so I went ahead and did that, too. I think, it's
really better for a man to be circumcised, and I hope you don't

   Representing Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the heavyweight
Hollywood lawyer Bert Fields says he is planning to sic federal and
state prosecutors on The Globe, a supermarket tabloid, for printing
what is said to be the contents of a private telephone conversation
between the couple.
</P>
<P>
   In an article with the headline ``Is Tom Cruise's Marriage
Hanging by a Thread?,'' published in The Globe's June 30 issue, the
newspaper says that in the taped conversation Ms. Kidman complains
to Cruise about their marriage, accuses him of shouting abuse at
her and calls him a bore who always tells her at night that he is
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   He, in turn, reminds her of a recent gift of jewelry and says
she didn't show up for a romantic evening he planned.
</P>
<P>
   Fields said it was a violation of federal and California law to
divulge the contents of a conversation that had been illegally
intercepted if it was known that it was illegally intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the tape as ``phony,'' said it was apparently
spliced together from several conversations and added that he had
put The Globe and similar newspapers on notice that the
conversations had been illegally intercepted. He said he intended
to file civil lawsuits as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Frost, editor of The Globe, said, ``The Globe does not
break the law, and we do not invade people's privacy.''

permanent interactive exhibition for young visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Kid City,'' it is intended to illuminate urban life and
its infrastructure. The centerpiece of ``Kid City'' is an
environment simulating the corner of Broadway and West 82nd Street
on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may open doors to learn about the residents, peer into
mailboxes to educate themselves about old-fashioned mail service
and handle items from store displays to learn about shopping long
ago.

   Season's Start
</P>
<P>
   Despite the calendar, summer arrives in different ways and at
different times. One is the opening of the Tanglewood season, on
Friday in Lenox, Mass., with the annual Chamber Music Weekend,
featuring the Boston Symphony Chamber Players and the Juilliard
String Quartet in three concerts in Seiji Ozawa Hall. Ozawa is to
lead the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra on five occasions this
summer, beginning on Tuesday with a performance of Brahms' Symphony
No. 2.

COMMENTARY: TOYING WITH THE CHARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The whole issue of dueling referendums sparked by a
feud over Yankee Stadium seemed silly at first, but relatively
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   A shootout with cap pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Council Speaker Peter Vallone wanted a referendum on this
November's ballot asking voters if the City Charter should be
amended to prevent the use of municipal funds to help finance a
stadium for the Yankees on Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, angered by that proposal, decided to
trump it with his own charter revision initiative. It would have
nothing to do with a stadium. But by law Giuliani's proposal would
take precedence, knocking Vallone's off the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Boys being boys. That's the way it looked at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that neither initiative was a good idea. Changing
the City Charter is the municipal equivalent of amending the
Constitution. It shouldn't be done lightly. But at least Vallone's
proposal was limited to the stadium question. Giuliani's is
something else again. He is not playing with a cap pistol. The
mayor has taken serious and bitter aim at his critics and political
enemies, is threatening to transform the way city elections are
held, and has gone out of his way to limit public participation in
the potentially historic changes.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the hit list are the Independent Budget Office,
which, among other things, had the temerity to do an honest review
of the West Side stadium proposal; and the office of the public
advocate, currently held by Mark Green, who has tried, so far
unsuccessfully, to get information on how the city handles certain
police brutality cases.
</P>
<P>
   Both offices were established during the last overhaul of city
government to protect the public's interests. In an astonishing
power grab that has gotten nothing like the attention it deserves,
the mayor, through his Charter Revision Commission, a collection of
his political cronies, is seeking to abolish them.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to do away with political labels _ Democrats,
Republicans, etc. _ in city elections. As this is a heavily
Democratic city, the change would heavily benefit Republican
candidates, under the guise of nonpartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Is all of this being clearly explained to the public? And will
everyone who is interested get a fair opportunity to comment and
make suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding? The motto of the Giuliani administration is
``conceal we must.'' The required public hearings for the charter
review process have been scheduled around the July 4 holiday, when
many New Yorkers are not even in town. The first hearing is in
Staten Island on the night of July 1. That's a great way to insure
a huge turnout. Those who want to speak will have to register at
the site at 6 p.m. When the hearing gets under way they will be
allowed a grand total of three minutes to address these and other
major changes in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Conn Nugent, the director of Citizens Union, a civic group that
supported Giuliani in the last election, joked about the process:
``Three minutes, Mr. Madison. Three minutes, Mr. Franklin.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``It's kind of funny, but it's also bordering on the
farcical, and that's the part we don't like.'' He criticized both
the mayor and Vallone and used the term ``wrong-headed'' to
describe ``this whole treatment of the Charter as a short-term
tactical instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff of the New York Public Interest Research Group
sent a letter earlier this month to Peter Powers, a former deputy
mayor who is chairman of the Charter Commission. The letter, which
was endorsed by Nugent and representatives of Common Cause, the
League of Women Voters and the City Club, said in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, ballot proposals for this year's general election
must be delivered to the City Clerk before Labor Day. This is not
enough time to conduct a responsible review of any serious changes
in New York City's governance.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a simple statement of fact. But if what you really want
to do is punish your political enemies and bolster your power at
the expense of truly representative government, then there is
plenty of time between now and Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you almost have to act fast. You have to get it done
before too many people catch on.

SUBWAY ART: SEEKING TO STRETCH BOUNDARIES OF PRINTMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHAWN G. KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up for a day in the studio behind his
Cleveland Park home one recent morning, Lou Stovall, a master
printmaker, plucked a jar of gray ink from a shelf where he keeps
custom-blended colors. Holding the jar up for closer inspection, he
gave it a gentle shake and said: ``Yes, this is it. This is a very
good color for our shark.''
</P>
<P>
   The shark in question swims through the design that the painter
Jacob Lawrence, 80, recently completed for a mosaic tile mural for
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City. The
subway art, which will grace the Times Square station at its
Broadway and 42nd Street entrance, is still months from
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Transportation Authority has allowed a limited
number of prints of the mural's design to be made to raise money
for a not-for-profit project to catalog all of Lawrence's works.
The silk-screen prints, a limited edition of 50 in a double set,
will come from Stovall's studio.
</P>
<P>
   Before printing that morning, Stovall consulted shorthand notes
penciled into the margins of the artist's color maquette. The notes
reflected guidelines Lawrence gave him during a telephone
conversation earlier: ``Dark tan stripe _ go for off black. Ear
out. Shirt blue. Shark gray.''
</P>
<P>
   Their partnership goes back to the mid-1980s, when Stovall
started making prints of one of the painter's earliest works, a
series of 41 gouaches (1937-38) on the life of Toussaint
L'Ouverture, the 18th-century Haitian revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Since setting up his studio, Workshop Inc., in 1968, Stovall has
made prints for more than 80 artists, including Alexander Calder,
Josef Albers, Sam Gilliam, Robert Mangold, Peter Blume, Elizabeth
Catlett and Lois Mailou Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important part of what I do is to give artists who
have ideas they want to express in a silk-screen print a way of
doing it,'' said Stovall, whose workshop also turns out handmade
furniture and fine-art frames. ``If they can explain it to me or
show me what they are looking for, I am willing to experiment until
I find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall's development of an intuitive understanding of
Lawrence's style and palette is essential to their collaboration
because face-to-face meetings between the artist and his printmaker
are infrequent. Lawrence lives and works in Seattle. They consult
by telephone on printing proofs that have been sent back and forth
by express mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake and I have the same sense of color,'' Stovall said,
offering one explanation for the success of their 14-year
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lawrence attributes Stovall's ability to translate
his art into fine prints to the printmaker's attention to detail
and to his artistic sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speak the same language,'' Lawrence said in a telephone
interview. ``When I tell him that certain lines need to be sharper,
that I want more depth or texture to the color, he knows exactly
what I'm talking about. He makes it happen because he is a
craftsman who is also an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few people, if any, I could work with cross-country
like that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gilliam, another longtime collaborator, who is known for the
textural quality of his hard-edged painting and collages, said that
what he appreciates most about the printmaker's technique is that
it is not formulaic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou is an innovator,'' said Gilliam, who also lives in
Washington, and has worked with the printmaker for 20 years. ``He
has taken printing well beyond what is standard for the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Gilliam recalled the day Stovall sent an
assistant out in search of castor oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was ill,'' Gilliam recalled. ``But he showed me
how he uses castor oil to break up the color so the white of the
paper shows through.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam and Stovall spend a good amount of time together when
they have a printing project going, Gilliam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is constant dialogue about the process, and at times it
can be quite dynamic,'' he said. ``We've had arguments about
printing that his wife, Di, has had to come in and settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall's wife, Di Bagley Stovall, is a painter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Stovall has manipulated the basic flat
silk-screen technique. Often forsaking the squeegee, a prime tool
used to transfer color through the silk-screen, he has experimented
with brushes, towels and hardwood scrapers and even his hands. To
achieve a softer, painterly effect in prints, he often uses
water-thin stains and glazes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was doing silk-screening because I discovered it as
a child and loved the medium,'' said Stovall, who studied at the
Rhode Island School of Design and then Howard University. ``When my
art teacher taught me that it could also be a fine-art medium, it
gave me something to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   While working toward his degree in fine arts at Howard, he took
a job in a commercial print shop. The owner, impressed with his
skill and devotion to the craft, let him make prints of his own
artwork after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a Stern Family Fund Grant provided the money for Stovall
to establish a fine-arts printmaking studio. The grant came with
the understanding that he would use the studio to teach printmaking
to others. He still does.
</P>
<P>
   A painter as well as a master printmaker, Stovall has had his
work exhibited in many museums and galleries, including the
Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington; the Bristol Museum in
Bristol, R.I.; the Bayly Art Museum in Charlottesville, Va., and
the Studio Museum in New York City's Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased demands of his frame making and his
struggle to find more time to paint and draw, Stovall has no plans
to cut back on printmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always trying to make the most beautiful print I can,''
he said, adding: ``I have more than one purpose. I want to make
art, through silk-screening, more accessible to more people, and to
make it a more honorable and appreciated medium.''

RHYTHM `N' BLUES, BUT NOT TOO BLUE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Dimitri Ehrlich, the music editor at MTV, is collaborating on a
book about hip-hop culture.  
 By DIMITRI EHRLICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine cruising along a coastal road at sunset in a cherry-red
sports car with the top down. Sure, the image is a cliche. But does
every experience have to be original to be fun?
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of ``Never Say Never,'' the second album by the
teen-age rhythm `n' blues singer Brandy, lies not in her inventing
anything new but in her delivering familiar pleasures with all the
accessories. And she can really sing.
</P>
<P>
   For a performer who just turned 19, Brandy seems to have a
grown-up control freak's attention to detail, and it has served her
career well. When she was 14, she recorded her debut album, an
innocuous but polished set of pop and rhythm `n' blues songs that
sold four million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Brandy has starred in the popular television series
``Moesha'' and landed her first major film role, acting opposite
Jennifer Love Hewitt in ``I Still Know,'' to be released this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The album's first single, ``This Boy Is Mine,'' a duet with
another teen-age singing star, Monica, continues Brandy's string of
successes. The song, which has topped both the pop and rhythm `n'
blues charts, concerns a typical adolescent drama: two girls lay
claim to the same boy.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing particularly surprising happens during the song;
instead, it gets its energy from Brandy's dynamic but controlled
vocal performance. Her voice is rawer than that of her mentor,
Whitney Houston; it has an appealing throaty quality that allows it
to cut through the soppy backing vocals and gossamer synthesizer
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy is far from being a risk taker, and every note on ``Never
Say Never'' (Atlantic), like every move in her career (including
being a prom date for Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers) is
carefully planned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her finesse, though, there is a vulnerability in her
voice that distinguishes her from her peers. Singers like Monica
and Aaliyah can infuse a song with gospel-inflected fervor equal to
Brandy's, but Brandy has an edge of authentic emotion that sets her
apart.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Top of the World,'' a head-bobbing duet with the rapper
Mase, Brandy answers critics who think her life is a fairy tale,
summoning a moaning, cigarette-burnt vocal that is as defiant as it
is slinky. Brandy plays the hip-hop ingenue, a sexy image far
removed from the squeaky-clean one she presents on her television
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The song's propulsive, syncopated cadence stands out on an album
otherwise mired in mid-tempo numbers, and the harder-hitting beat
highlights Brandy's sensuality and energy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the album's finest moments is ``One Voice,'' a gospel
ballad. With a choir behind her, it's easy to imagine Brandy back
in the Mississippi church where she got her start. Here she sounds
as if she were un-self-consciously exploring the gift of her voice
before millions had heard it.

MAKING BOOKS: WRITING'S DONE _ WHAT'S NEXT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a book fails, the author sometimes says it wasn't published
well. Often enough that's correct, although there is a lode of bad
books in the stores that no one could turn out successfully.
</P>
<P>
   So in this summer of consolidation in book publishing, there
remains little chivalric romance between authors and their
publishers. Whatever affair of the heart and mind is left in this
new conglomerate world is still between the writer and the editor
(or perhaps the author and the agent), not the publisher. The root
of the squalling is the question: What does it mean to be published
well?
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple, if pared-down, definition of what good
publishing means, said Phyllis Grann, president of Penguin Putnam
Inc. ``It means that the publisher has gotten the book to the
attention of all the potential buyers the book has.'' Not every
book publisher achieves this seemingly elementary goal.
</P>
<P>
   Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of Bantam Books, has
this corresponding thought. ``I want everyone'' at Bantam ``to
think of the full life of the book, from hardcover through
paperback,'' he said. ``Some publishers are content to have
different people responsible for different parts of the publishing,
but for me the advantage of being the publisher is getting everyone
thinking about the book; then you can set your priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds emulative, and there are indeed other publishing
houses that consistently publish well. Alfred E. Knopf, for
instance, is one, although it's hard to tell whether it is the
publisher or the house's long-standing mystique that seemingly
carries it as smoothly as a stone rolling down a hill. Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux is another.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the author the speeded-up world of book publishing
can appear to be full of transgressions that include slothful
publishing, slapdash editing and playing hide-and-seek with the
agent.
</P>
<P>
   What precisely do authors complain about, often with
justification? Poor distribution. There is nothing more
disheartening for a writer than to get good reviews and wangle some
radio and television interviews only to find that few, if any,
copies of the book have actually been shipped to booksellers to be
sold. Such horror stories are legion.
</P>
<P>
   Writers groan about publishers who don't send their work to
reviewers, at times just forgetting to do so, or don't even put
them in galley proofs for magazines to see early for possible
excerpting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these cases you need a miracle for anyone to know about a
book,'' one author said. ``If you don't have a sizable advance, you
are not only not getting a country house, you're not getting your
book out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which book selling is frequently about buzz _ and,
as Applebaum said, ``the best-seller lists are treated like other
entertainment guidelines such as Nielsen ratings or the weekly
box-office tallies of movies'' _ authors have had to become
students of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the minimum I expect organized professional marketing, not
unprofessionalism and disorder,'' said the writer of a favorably
reviewed book on a subject that one would suppose would have wide
appeal. The book didn't do well commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Another writer, speaking as the others did on the condition of
anonymity, said that her novel had received ``wonderful
prepublication blurbs, but the publisher said it was too late to
put them on the jacket even though they came back to the house very
quickly after the manuscript was sent out.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-published book is one for which the publisher has made
all the correct pre- and post-editorial decisions. Which means, for
example, that the product, the book, has the best possible jacket;
that its publication date is the moment it will sell best against
competition; that the right amount of marketing and advertising and
public relations has been done; that the publishing house's sales
force has been both led and listened to about the book's potential.
In short, that everything about the book's actual publication
crescendos together at the moment of highest impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all this is done, the book has been given every
opportunity to break out,'' said Ann Godoff, who is president and
editor in chief at Random House and is also a book editor. ``Every
project to a certain extent is different; its publicity and
marketing climate different,'' she said. Each book is in essence a
different product requiring disparate editors and publishing
campaigns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An editor, unlike a publisher _ unless one is both _ has the
hands-on relationship with the author, with line-by-line
responsibility for producing the most powerful manuscript. The
editor is rightly the cheerleader, sometimes with an almost
siblinglike relationship to the writer.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it's the publisher who decides, for instance, how
many copies of a book will be printed and distributed, and even
whether the publishing house's option for the writer's next book
should be exercised. Which is sometimes the riskiest decision a
publisher can make, with the potential for the most punishing
results to the publishing house, since the stakes can be so high.
</P>
<P>
   When an author writes a best-selling first novel, the agent
demands tons of money for the second. Recently, Random House, which
published Joe Klein's hugely successful ``Primary Colors,'' decided
that the asking price for his second novel was too steep, and
passed. Dial Press took the gamble that Klein, writing under his
own name, not as Anonymous, could do it a second time, and agreed
to the seven-figure advance demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Random House now faces a similar decision with the next book by
John Berendt, whose ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' has
been such a colossal success that when it appears on The New York
Times' nonfiction best-seller list as No. 12 on July 5, it will
have been on the list 207 weeks, one week short of four years.
</P>
<P>
   Starr Lawrence, editor in chief at W.W. Norton, who faces the
same ``should we or shouldn't we'' challenge over buying Sebastian
Junger's next book (``The Perfect Storm'' has been on the hardcover
best-seller list for a year), said that the very question of
whether a book is published well is ``a trigger phrase that usually
occurs in the negative, and means the publisher didn't spend as
much money advertising as the agent would have wished.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence doesn't deny that publishers fumble, but, he said,
``there are things that don't work, no matter what you do or
spend.'' He added: ``There are good books that don't work. That's
the fortunes of war.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Applebaum said on behalf of his publishing kin, a bit
caustically, ``There are no bad books, only bad publishers.''

   CHINA-ODDITIES _ BEIJING _ A typical Chinese urbanite bicycles
down a frenetic rush hour street -- small daughter tucked into a
backseat and packages filling the basket in front. Ignoring the
chaos, he chats into the cell phone clamped to his ear. The scene
is among the legion of arresting oddities that will punctuate the
trip through China of President Bill Clinton and his entourage.
Such culture clashes are no more unusual than those presented to
Chinese visiting America -- for example, when they hunt vainly
through hotel rooms for the terry cloth slippers and thermos of hot
water that are ever -present in Chinese hotels. For centuries,
visitors have been coming to China to absorb the brilliant colors,
pungent scents and tinkling sounds of a land that many in the West
expected to find ``backward.'' But even in the 13th Century Marco
Polo found China filled with marvels, much as travelers do today.
Cell phones, for example, seem to be more pervasive in Chinese
cities than in most any sophisticated American metropolis. People
in taxis, on bicycles, walking down the street, riding a bus,
sitting in restaurants or shopping in book stores, food stores or
shoe stores can be found engaged in intense conversations.

Water but any neighborhood or private pool? That's the question

with a review of pool regulations in Georgia, and reassurance that
chlorine kills most bacteria and other germs. Also asking CDC
whether the second known case of transmission of the deadly strain

   RESTUDY _ West Palm Beach, Fla. _ A half-century ago, weary from
an unending cycle of flood, drought and fire, South Florida
residents asked Washington to build them a barrier against the
extremes of nature. It worked. All too well. Federal engineers
constructed a 1,600-mile-long bulwark of canals, levees, pumps and
floodgates to ensure that people would always have enough water _
but never too much. Now the engineers say it's time to start over.
They want to redesign the entire drainage system. Environmentalists
call it the Everglades' last chance. It will mean transforming the
landscape once again, creating a network of reservoirs occupying
enough territory for a good-size city. Imagine water covering eight
Miamis or two Philadelphias. Water managers will use
so-far-untested methods to store hundreds of billions of gallons
more than 1,000 feet underground, hoping to retrieve the water
years later. (King, Palm Beach Post)

<P>
   w/URBAN _ West Palm Beach, Fla. _ A plan to assure a future

Beach Post) 20
</P>
<P>
   w/DEEP _ The federal plan to save the Everglades depends on the
untested practice of storing up to 1.7 billion gallons of water
underground every day during wet years and pulling it back up
during dry times. Never mind that it's never been done before on
such a massive scale. (Englehardt, Palm Beach Post) 16
</P>
<P>
   CRITTER _ West Palm Beach, Fla. _ While the rest of us swelter,
watch our gardens wilt and ask when the rain will return,
scientists are calling the dry spell a blessing for the Everglades.
After all, it was just a few months ago that El Nino-driven rain
was drowning marsh-dwelling trees and making life miserable for
wading birds. For them, the dry skies offer a chance to breathe _
and breed. ``We know with the lower water, the healing will
begin,'' said Herb Zebuth, a coordinator for the state Department
of Environmental Protection's West Palm Beach office. ``And for
that, we're grateful.'' (King, Palm Beach Post)

   WORKS _ West Palm Beach, Fla. _ The county has banned home

   OZONE _ The ``ozone action'' alert declared for Thursday, the
third one this week, highlights metro Atlanta's continuing air
pollution problem. And the problem could be even worse than we
think, because the state Environmental Protection Division issues
pollution forecasts based on an ozone standard now declared
out-of-date by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The
difference is stark: Under the new standard, based on levels
averaged over eight hours rather than one hour, metro Atlanta
actually had twice as many ``bad air'' days in May than the five
EPD reported. And if the new standard were applied here, EPD
officials say the region would register three times the average 11
violation days during the ozone season. (CAtlanta

CHINA CANCELS OPERA AT LINCOLN CENTER
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CHINA-PEONY-FRANCE) 
(bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ After a final round of negotiations failed to
yield a workable compromise, Shanghai's Bureau of Culture refused
Wednesday night to let a classic Chinese opera be staged as
scheduled next month at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Festival director Nigel Redden, director of the festival, said
late Wednesday night that Shanghai officials maintained that the
production of the opera, ``The Peony Pavilion,'' would have to be
extensively revised to better reflect Chinese tradition before it
would be allowed to travel to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although Redden was willing to accept a staging with minor
changes, the officials insisted on a new set of rehearsals that
would make it impossible for the opera, a 20-hour production that
was to have been presented in several segments, to open July 7 as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have effectively canceled the project,'' said Redden, who
flew to China on Monday to try to negotiate a way out of the
impasse. ``This is a tremendous loss for us, but it's even worse
for people in the company, who worked day and night for so long to
pull this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden said he planned to leave Shanghai on Thursday night. Yet
he still expressed the hope that President Clinton or Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who are to arrive in China that evening,
would intervene and persuade Shanghai officials to reverse their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Bomin, the director of Shanghai's Bureau of Culture, said she
blocked ``The Peony Pavilion'' because it was a national treasure
that needed to be protected from unorthodox interpretations like
the one Lincoln Center wanted to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precious piece of Chinese culture,'' Ms. Ma, a
former opera singer, said in an interview. ``If we are going to
show it to the world, it must be presented in line with Chinese
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly about ``The Peony Pavilion'' for the first
time since its staging was suddenly thrown into doubt last week,
Ms. Ma defended her bureau's right to be the arbiter of what is
consistent with Chinese tradition. Her comments reflected the
doggedness with which opera buffs in China can try to guard their
turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the power to decide how an opera is performed,'' Ms.
Ma said. ``You must understand, our standards for Kunqu Opera and
Peking Opera are not the same as for other arts. I am an artist,
and I have a responsibility to see it done properly.''
</P>
<P>
   (At Lincoln Center, Beverly Sills, the chairman, and Nathan
Leventhal, the president, issued a statement saying that the Bureau
of Culture's position ``makes it physically impossible for Lincoln
Center to receive the production in time to mount and present it as
scheduled.'' They praised ``the superb artistry of the Shanghai
Kunqu Opera Company,'' which was to have performed the work, and
congratulated the director of the production, Chen Shi-Zheng, ``for
his brilliant and evocative conception.''
</P>
<P>
   (Lincoln Center will explore legal steps, Leventhal said. ``We
own the production,'' he said, referring to Lincoln Center and its
partners in the commissioning consortium. ``They don't.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma brushed aside arguments that the opera be judged by
Lincoln Center, which is financing the production with co-producers
in France, Australia and Hong Kong, where the opera is also
scheduled to appear. She also discounted the importance of a
contract that she approved last year granting Chen full artistic
freedom in its staging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to the contract, and we thought the production was a
good idea,'' Ms. Ma said. ``But now we find that it includes
elements that cannot be allowed, unhealthy elements that violate
China's cultural exchange regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton arriving for a nine-day visit to China on Thursday,
Redden expressed hope that Chinese and U.S. officials would be
eager to resolve a dispute involving a cultural exchange,
especially since Shanghai is now trying to present itself as a
vibrant financial and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Unless some senior official intervenes, Ms. Ma is having her
way. ``I don't see what this has to do with President Clinton's
visit,'' she said. ``This is about art, and the debate should
remain about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma cites three artistic objections to the modern staging of
``The Peony Pavilion'': that the production violates the spirit of
the author Tang Xianzu, who wrote the opera in 1598; it violates
the specific rules of Kunqu Opera, one of China's most refined and
classic strands of traditional opera; and it introduces what she
called ``unhealthy elements,'' which she defines as ``feudal,''
``superstitious'' and ``pornographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Ms. Ma spoke, it became clear that her biggest problem
was with Chen, a native of China who moved to the United States in
1987 and became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's innovative staging of the opera uses an elaborate set _
complete with a duck pond, water wheel and singing birds _ in what
he described as an effort to recreate the atmosphere of daily life
in China for ordinary people in the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma and other elders of Shanghai's culture bureaucracy,
accustomed to simple staging and more stylized acting, are also
apparently accustomed to getting the changes they demand when they
preview a piece of theater. Ms. Ma expressed surprise and some
resentment when Chen resisted some changes she sought after seeing
a dress rehearsal this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the director has the right to interpret the
opera, but the spirit must be true to the original,'' Ms. Ma said.
``When we made suggestions, he said he would accept some, but not
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrinkling her nose in disgust, she delivered what seemed to be
the most serious criticism she could make about a fellow artist of
classic opera: ``He lacks knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   A director like Chen _ with new ideas, a healthy American budget
and a firm artistic vision _ is almost inevitably going to raise
hackles or induce professional jealousy in a country like China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has his own ideas and he is very stubborn,'' Ms. Ma said.
Asked why her bureau's objections to ``The Peony Pavilion'' were
raised only after the production had rehearsed in Shanghai for
eight months, she said concerns had been raised indirectly all year
long. Only after Chen staged the dress rehearsal, Ms. Ma said, did
she have a chance to fully explain what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When Chen wanted to go over the script with her, to ask which
points she specifically objected to, Ms. Ma seemed to rely on a
tactic common to Communist Party censors, insisting that he make
the changes himself and then let her judge the finished product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him: `You're the director,''' Ms. Ma said. ``You have
to make the changes, and then let us see the rehearsal as it will
be performed. Then we will decide.''

ALLOW `PEONY' TO TOUR, FRENCH URGE

   PARIS _ A French government-backed arts festival, which is
co-producing ``The Peony Pavilion'' with the Lincoln Center
Festival, expressed ``astonishment'' Wednesday that the Kunqu Opera
Company had been prevented by Shanghai officials from traveling to
New York, and it urged the Chinese authorities to intervene to
settle the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Markovits, artistic director of the Festival d'Automne
a Paris, which is scheduled to present Chen Shi-Zheng's production
of the classic Chinese opera in Paris in November, said she had
been working to reverse the Shanghai Bureau of Culture's decision
through diplomatic channels and in coordination with Nigel Redden,
director of the Lincoln Center Festival, who has been in Shanghai
seeking a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to keep a low profile in the hope that this would
help,'' she said, commenting on the absence of reports of the
incident in French newspapers. ``The French ambassador to Beijing
sent letters last weekend to the Chinese Ministry of Culture and to
the mayor of Shanghai expressing concern. Now we have decided to
issue a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, signed by Alain Crombecque, the Paris festival's
director general, and Ms. Markovits, recalled that the sets and
costumes for the opera belonged to its co-producers, who have
contributed $500,000 toward the production.
</P>
<P>
   After presentations in New York next month, and Paris in
November, the opera was due to be staged in the French city of Caen
in December and in Sydney, Australia, and Hong Kong in January
1999. Theaters and festivals in these cities are also co-producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Festival d'Automne a Paris will not resign itself to the
annulment, for obscure reasons, of so much Chinese and Western
effort and so much talent,'' the statement said. ``It hopes that,
in the interest of all, Chinese authorities will find a positive
outcome to what would simply become an unfortunate episode.''

CADILLAC NFL CLASSIC SHOWS OFF ANOTHER QUALITY COURSE IN NEW
JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ Whenever George Steinbrenner complains about
Yankee Stadium, the Yankees' principal owner hints at how New
Jersey will be the team's new home even though no plans exist for a
ball park in the Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Yankees were a golf team, they could move tomorrow.
Whenever a golf ``stadium,'' so to speak, is needed for a tour
event, New Jersey has more than enough quality courses.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cadillac NFL Classic that starts here Thursday at the
Upper Montclair Country Club, spectators not only will be in the
galleries on the course but also on the balconies of the adjacent
high-rise apartments just as they were 36 years ago. And the
primary object of their affection will be the same man.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer is his name. Then, as now, golf is his game.
</P>
<P>
   When he teed off here in the Thunderbird Classic in 1962, the
then 32-year-old touring pro out of Latrobe, Pa., was the golfer
who would be known as the King, the golfer everybody wanted to see.
Two months earlier he had won his third Masters and later that
summer he would win his second consecutive British Open.
</P>
<P>
   When he tees off in this weekend's Senior PGA Tour event at
Upper Montclair, he will still be the King, the golfer everybody
still wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   Now 68, Palmer is basically the same golfer he has always been.
He still lunges at the ball. He still hitches up his pants. After a
birdie, his smile is still brighter than the sunshine. In his way,
he is as enduring as any quality golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of quality golf courses, near Atlantic City, the
ShopRite Classic on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour
will begin Thursday on the Bay course at the Seaview Marriott
resort. Sam Snead won the Professional Golfers' Association
championship there in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Courses like this don't get older, they just get better.
Especially New Jersey's classic courses, where so many classic
golfers have won.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Baltusrol, in nearby Springfield, has been the
site of a record-sharing seven U.S. Open championships, two won by
Jack Nicklaus in 1967 and 1980. It twice was the host club for the
U.S. Women's Open, won by Mickey Wright in 1961 and Kathy Baker in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Valley, secluded in Clementon not too far from Atlantic
City, has been No. 1 in Golf Digest magazine's ranking of America's
100 Greatest Courses for more than a decade. Baltusrol's Lower
course is No. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Plainfield Country Club, where Laura Davies won the 1987 U.S.
Women's Open and John Cook won the 1978 U.S. Amateur, is ranked No.
39 in the nation. Somerset Hills C.C., in Bernardsville, where the
1990 Curtis Cup matches were held, is No. 43.
</P>
<P>
   In Golf Digest's state-by-state rankings, Pine Valley,
Baltusrol's Lower course, Plainfield and Somerset Hills were New
Jersey's top four, in that order. Baltusrol's Upper course was
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgewood Country Club, the site of the 1990 U.S. Senior Open
duel in which Lee Trevino edged Nicklaus, and the 1935 Ryder Cup
matches, was sixth on Golf Digest's state list. Galloway National
was seventh. Metedeconk was eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Upper Montclair, where the Garden State Parkway crosses Route 3,
has been the site of the most New Jersey events, 14, on the three
pro tours _ the PGA Tour, the Senior PGA Tour and the LPGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Murphy has won at Upper Montclar on two tours. He won the
1968 Thunderbird on the PGA Tour and the 1996 Cadillac NFL Classic
on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Upper Montclair's sixth Cadillac NFL Classic,
featuring a separate division for pro football players. It also has
had five PGA Tour events _ four Thunderbird Classics in 1962, 1966,
1967 (when Palmer won) and 1968, plus the 1970 Dow Jones Open (won
by Bobby Nichols).
</P>
<P>
   In the four LPGA events here, the Coca-Cola Classic was won by
Nancy Lopez in 1979 and Donna White in 1980; the Chrysler-Plymouth
Classic by Pat Bradley in 1983 and Barb Bunkowsky in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In the years to come, Upper Montclair, along with a few other
New Jersey courses such as Baltusrol and Ridgewood, will be able to
put up a sign that every golf fan will cherish. Quite simply, all
that sign needs to say is, ``Arnold Palmer played here.'' &QL;

DREAMWORKS' `ANTZ' JUMPS THE GUN ON DISNEY'S `BUG'S LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In an unexpected move, Dreamworks has advanced the
release of its new animated film, ``Antz,'' from next March to this
October to gain a foothold on the fall and early winter season.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile company, founded by David Geffen, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, had announced that its first
animated film would be ``Prince of Egypt,'' a retelling of the
Moses story, set to open Dec. 18. That film has stirred
extraordinary attention in Hollywood, partly because it is viewed
as Katzenberg's personal creation after making some hugely
successful animated movies at Walt Disney Co., where he was studio
chairman. Those films included ``Beauty and the Beast,''
``Aladdin'' and ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt,'' with voices by Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes,
Steve Martin, Helen Mirren, Michelle Pfeiffer and others, was
viewed as a challenge to Disney's hegemony in animation.
</P>
<P>
   But exhibitor sources said that the Dreamworks partners, after
strong positive test-audience reaction to ``Antz,'' had asked
Pacific Data Images, which is creating the film, to accelerate its
production and release the movie Oct. 2. The new opening date comes
at a relatively quiet time in movie theaters and beats by six weeks
the release of a Disney animated film, ``A Bug's Life,'' made by
Pixar, set to open Nov 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamworks film, about rebellious ants in New York's Central
Park, includes the voices of Danny Glover, Sylvester Stallone,
Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Jennifer Lopez, and of Woody Allen,
as a _ what else? _ very neurotic ant in therapy.

   THE PILOT ZONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.pilotzone.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AS with cult television shows, the Palm Pilot's increasing
popularity has proved to be fertile ground for a number of
unofficial Web sites offering scores of files for downloading. The
Pilot Zone, one of the larger and more elaborate of these sites, is
a well-organized archive that is updated regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The software is grouped into nine categories including Games,
Utilities, Graphics, Development and Productivity, and each
category contains at least four subcategories. There are six
subcategories in the Calculators group alone, featuring medical,
scientific and financial programs.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to do a little Palm reading, the site
contains a bulging library of classic literature in the form of
``etext'' files in the Docs category. To use many of these text
files on the Pilot, you need to install text-reader software like
Aportis Doc, a $39.95 piece of shareware.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have that, you can go to the Pilot Zone and get ``Les
Miserables'' (1,714,175 bytes). Many of the etexts in the Pilot
Zone are provided by the Macduff Lending Library (www.macduff.net),
a linked site that offers 298 great works, like Shakespeare and
Zane Grey's ``Riders of the Purple Sage.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious bibliophiles may find perusing lengthy manuscripts on
the Pilot's small screen akin to reading ``War and Peace'' _ which
you can actually download here _ on a digital watch. The tiny texts
do help to pass the time if you are trapped in a less-than-engaging
staff meeting or stuck at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of airports, there are many travel applications on this
site, accommodating users who need programs that can provide
exchange-rate information, unit converters and a handy way to track
frequent-flyer miles.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans might find something of interest in the Sports
section of the Docs category. The official rules for scoring are
posted here in Pilot form, and there are applications that will
install the 1998 American League or National League schedule onto
the Pilot, adding the season's games into the organizer's datebook
for you.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the stockpiled software, the Pilot Zone has a
Frequently Asked Questions section and a What's New page listing
recent updates, plus a list of the most popular recent downloads
and an area especially for Palm application developers to
contribute their own creations to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilot Zone is vast, and it takes some time to wade through
all the treats available, especially if you are not cruising with a
particularly zippy modem. If you just can't decide what you want
and need some divine guidance, try downloading one of the Pilot
applications here that recreates an all-knowing fortune-telling
ball and ask away.

SENATE PASSES EDUCATION SAVINGS BILL AMID THREAT OF PRESIDENTIAL
VETO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a bill
that would allow the creation of tax-free savings accounts to help
pay for elementary and secondary school costs. President Clinton,
who objects to tax writeoffs for private school tuition, promises a
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will veto it, and there are ample votes to
sustain. So that was an exercise in total futility,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., after the
Republican-controlled chamber passed the bill 59-36.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already given its approval to the bill, known as
the ``A-Plus'' education savings account measure.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing for China on Wednesday morning, Clinton
predicted that his differences over education matters with the
Republican-controlled Congress will likely be ``a major conflict''
during this election year. Clinton favors more federal funding to
help build new schools and hire more qualified teachers, but his
requests have been denied for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hope that I will not have to sign an education bill or
veto one that shortchanges the future of our children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief, but spirited debate on the legislation,
Republicans touted it as having bipartisan support. But only eight
Democrats joined with GOP members in passing the measure and two
Republicans sided with the 34 Democrats to reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill was authored primarily by Sen. Paul Coverdell,
R-Ga., it picked up several co-sponsors on the Democratic side who
were attracted to a provision that would also allow the savings
accounts to be used to pay for public school expenses, such as
transportation, computers and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow parents, relatives, guardians, benefactors
and even businesses to put aside up to $2,000 per child each year
into tax-free, interest-bearing accounts to be used for education
expenses. It also increases from $500 a year to $2,000 a year the
amount that can be put into tax-free savings accounts used for
college tuition and other higher education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said ``the point is'' that the
legislation would ``encourage America's families to save for
education'' whether they send the children to private or public
schools. She threw her support behind the savings accounts
provision because it includes language she authored to make it
easier to discipline students who bring firearms into the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that the bill is designed to help take care
of a student's most important needs no matter what the economic
status and give parents and local school officials more control
over how best to deal with education problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money will be guided almost like a missile system right
to the problem the child has,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic opponents called the Coverdell proposal
``misguided,'' contending that it would do nothing to solve the
existing problems of crumbling schools, overcrowded classrooms and
shortages of qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said that the savings accounts
would benefit mostly higher-income Americans who already have their
children in private schools. ``I don't want to squander money on
things that don't make a difference in the lives of people,'' she
said. ``We need to fix up our schools. ... Kids are learning about
gravity because the ceiling is falling down on their desks.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also decried the efforts by House Republicans to make
deeper cuts in long-established education and other programs
designed to help the nation's poor school children. Specifically,
they objected to a move in the House this week to eliminate federal
youth summer jobs programs and funding to help poor families with
home heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is an absolute sham,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said of the savings account legislation. ``On the one hand, we hear
the Republicans saying we are going to save our public education
children. But on the other they are gutting the very programs
...that do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the savings account bill, which
would cost about $1.5 billion over 10 years, would also perpetuate
``divisions in our country between those who have and those who
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill called the savings accounts the beginning
of a ``new approach'' that would ``enhance'' local efforts to
create better educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the president will see that the benefits are so great
that he couldn't possibly veto this opportunity for every child in
America to have more enhancements and more options so our public
school system will be the best that we can give,'' said Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was successful in getting an amendment attached to the
savings account bill that would allow federal funding of voluntary
single-sex classrooms and schools.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would give public schools the option of offering
voluntary single-sex classrooms, as long as they do it for both
sexes.
</P>

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in a crowded ballet season, one company remains
a must for any dance lover: the Virsky Ukrainian National Dance
Company.
</P>
<P>
   At root, most folk dances have something to do with making the
crops grow. But when theatricalized with a touch of genius and a
great deal of creativity, they become part of an international
dance repertory. To watch the fabulous virtuosity of this company's
young men and women in their vibrantly colored costumes on Tuesday
night at City Center was, as a cheering audience showed, to
appreciate great dancing by any definition.
</P>
<P>
   Like Igor Moiseyev, his contemporary in Moscow, Pavel Virsky
knew how to capture the essence of folk dances and recreate them
for spectators, not participants. The company he founded in Kiev in
1937 is made up of professional dancers with ballet training; hence
the larger-than-life plasticity of the men, whose deep plies, flips
and spins in the air and loose-hipped kicks are executed with a
lightness that makes their bravura all the more astonishing. Effort
is concealed; power is redefined.
</P>
<P>
   The women's lyricism does not preclude speed and precision while
moving with swivel-smooth grace into a mosaic of changing patterns.
There are enough ideas here to nourish any choreographer in search
of concepts and structure.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the troupe's season in the New York area is
brief. After a two-day hiatus, it will perform again Friday and
Saturday nights at City Center before appearing at 4 p.m. on Sunday
at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   Virsky himself died in 1975, a few years after his company made
its New York debut. There were those in the West who saw the
Moiseyev and Virsky troupes as instruments of Soviet propaganda
because they always showed smiling peasants. But this was to
overlook the artistry that made these companies what they were.
</P>
<P>
   Communism has crumbled since the Virsky troupe's last visit in
1988; Ukraine is now independent, and the performers onstage are
still smiling, simply because any folk-inspired dancing deals more
often than not with celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Myroslav Vantukh, who became artistic director in 1980, has kept
this in mind while adding his own choreography to the pieces by
Virsky on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The latter include ``The Lads From Kiev,'' a superbly danced
contest between two male groups, one short, one tall. The tall unit
skips in with a mazurka step, while the other group counters with a
spring and kick in the air. One member of the short team seems
suspended in air in a spin, a human helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Steps that are special to Ukrainian dances are always at the
forefront. ``Povszunets'' is a tour de force for the teen-agers in
the company, who have the flexibility to remain in squatting
position, no matter what they do.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Virsky fuses unison and variety, as he does in his martial
dance for Cossacks, galloping with their spears, and in the
familiar ``Hopak,'' executed with amazingly high split-leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Vantukh's welcoming dance, ``Ukraine, My Ukraine,'' is a
dazzling medley of regional dances that introduces the method at
work. The orchestra, conducted by Vitaliy Redko, shifts its rhythms
as the chain dances and coiling circles make room for the couples
who will later perform Vantukh's fine and quick shepherd's dances
from the Carpathian areas of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes dramatic vignettes. Outstanding examples
are Virsky's wistful courtship in ``Podolyanochka,'' and ``Under
the Cherry Tree,' his love triangle for three puppetlike figures.
All are sketched with basic emotions and a national touch coming to
the fore.

IN WAR-TORN ANGOLA, U.S. OIL WORKERS LIVE IN BUBBLE OF PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALONGO, Angola _ In this remote northern region of war-ravaged
Angola, many of the accents are from the South _ Texas,
Mississippi, Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Here there are paved roads smooth enough to Rollerblade on.
Folger's' coffee seems to be percolating in every office. You can
have hot dogs and chocolate chip cookies for lunch. Or play golf on
the 18-hole par-3 course.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years that civil war has raged across this once lush
and prosperous former Portuguese colony _ leaving virtually every
road cratered, every power plant destroyed, every manufacturing
plant silent _ the oil rigs at Chevron's installation have just
kept on pumping. The offshore horizon is a collection of spindly
towers, some spouting bright orange gas flames.
</P>
<P>
   The uninterrupted flow was made possible by one of the more
bizarre twists of money and politics. At the height of the war,
Chevron's installation was protected by Cuban troops who were
supporting the Marxist Angolan government in its struggle against a
rebel onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   At that time the United States was a staunch supporter of the
rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
known as Unita, the acronym for its name in Portuguese. But the
Reagan administration continued to allow Chevron to produce oil,
about 50 percent of which went to the Angolan government to pay for
its war against Unita. Most of the oil was sold to America.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are now gone. With the country in an uneasy bridge
between war and peace, Angolan troops protect the area, which as
part of Cabinda Province is cut off from the rest of Angola, and
business is booming. The compound is a work in progress: expanded
living quarters, a new dining hall, new office space and a new
clinic are all under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Angola is Africa's hottest oil territory right now. Recent
offshore discoveries by Chevron and other international oil
companies hold out the promise that Angola, which pumps about
740,000 barrels a day, may someday rival Nigeria's 2 million a day.
Experts say this new-found wealth has the potential to speed
Angola's recovery from its devastating war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what troubles many diplomats and business executives is the
habit the wealth has of disappearing. Angola's books have remained
so opaque that the International Monetary Fund refuses to do
business here. World Bank officials say that more than half of the
government's spending is on items not in the official budget. And
while Luanda, the capital, has become a city with fancy sports cars
and Paris couture imports, such luxuries remain the province of a
tiny minority.
</P>
<P>
   In Cabinda City, the nearest town to the Chevron compound, there
are no signs of Paris and few of public works. The roads quickly
turn to dirt, and much of the housing is shacks. A public pool
under construction when civil war broke out in 1966 remains
unfinished and overgrown, only the diving board rising above tree
line as a reminder of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as across the country, many civil servants are paid
irregularly. And banditry by unfed soldiers is considered at least
a part of the growing violence in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, Chevron has built a bubble world. Its
American employees work 12-hour days for 28 days straight, then jet
back home for 28 days' rest. They are not allowed outside the
fence, which is widely believed to be surrounded by land mines,
though Chevron officials decline to talk about most security
measures. Worried about their employees' safety, Chevron doesn't
even let them drive the 12 miles between Malongo and the airport.
They are taken by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody just walks out the gate,'' said Larry Jostes, who is
general manager here for 28 days, then goes home to San Francisco
for 28 days of rest ``We know where everybody is all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the oil workers say their families know little about the
country. Chuck Blevins, who runs a platform 30 miles out at sea,
says he doubts that his wife or children back in Mississippi could
find Angola on a map. Here the focus is on the huge machinery and
engineering feats that keep the oil production up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very exciting time to be here,'' said Don Nicholson,
an electronic instrumentation specialist from Utah who has been
working on one of the platforms for nine months. ``We're at the
cutting egde of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson says he is nonetheless curious about what goes on in
Angola and has attempted some Portuguese lessons, though without
much success. ``That Portuguese is just tearing me up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies have survived by remaining politically neutral
and are not inclined to change that. Once the oil heads for the
markets, they don't really worry about what happens to Angola's
share of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   But it is increasingly an issue for Angola, which has seen
little social rehabilitation despite annual budgets of about $3.5
billion and 40 months of relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where has all the money gone?'' has become a growing refrain
here, even with members of Parliament. One recently lashed out at
government, describing decrepit hospitals where 12 children a week
die of malaria. Another said prisoners die of starvation in the
country's jails.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have defended their reluctance to let
anyone see the books by pointing out that they are still at war and
do not want information about their financial strength to leak out.
International creditors say some of the oil profits go straight
into arms purchases, but corruption is widely assumed to siphon off
much of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government is driving harder and harder bargains
for its oil. In the past, bidders merely submitted breakdowns of
how eventual profits would be split. Now they must cough up
``signing fees'' that in the last 18 months amount to more than
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the London-based newsletter Africa Confidential,
much of this new income remains inside the state oil company,
Sonangol, and never makes it to the ministries of health and
education that desperately need it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the money reached the treasury, Angola is probably
unable to spend it wisely, experts say. For instance, since it is
unable to get cheaper IMF loans, it is paying huge foreign debts
built up during the war at exorbitant interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of war have left Angola with little expertise at
investment management. But so much money is on the way that it will
be impossible, some experts hope, for corrupt bureaucrats to steal
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the resources,'' a diplomat said, ``make it
impossible for you to just quietly take the money away.''

 &HT;    Waylon can do anything he wants
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Waylon Jennings were a rock star, this would be his
Beatles-like white album. From the ``Run Through the
Jungle''-inspired witchy bass of the opening title track through
odd tempos, experimental instrumentation and offbeat lyrics,
Jennings has obviously come to a personal epiphany: When it comes
to the studio, he can do anything he pleases. And that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   During his 30-plus years in the business, Jennings has produced
a catalog of work better than just about any in country music,
often due to his willingness to take risks and try bold new
approaches to the country formula. Sometimes the stretch makes this
album a bit quirky and inconsistent, as with player piano rolls
mixed in with reverb. But Jennings' midlife attitude shines through
here, like welcome sun burning off the fog. ``I appreciate it if
people like what I do,'' he says, calling from Nashville. ``If they
don't, I don't really care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing In on the Fire''
</P>
<P>
   Waylon Jennings. Ark 21. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Lone wolf Waylon goes his own way with style.

 &HT;    Black and tan
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 28: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khaki's cool. Black's hot.
</P>
<P>
   The tan slacks are as ubiquitous as jeans. Black, which attracts
the sun, is a rare sight in the sweltering months. Khaki connotes
ease. Black implies an edginess.
</P>
<P>
   Together, black and tan create a look that's simultaneously
comfortable and cosmopolitan. They're the ideal combination for
those occasions that aren't too dressy or casual, either.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to wear black-and-tan together to fit in, or get
in. Most summer dress codes are so lax that khakis can be worn with
any old top to events ranging from christenings to funerals without
anyone casting critical stares.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're fashion-conscious, it's not enough to make it
merely through the threshold of propriety. To distinguish yourself
from the khaki-clad masses, you've got to complement those tan
pants with black, Jack.

TREASURIES REFLECT UNEASE OVER JAPANESE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities lost early gains and ended mixed
Wednesday, reflecting some disappointment over the results of a
government debt auction and uncertainty about Japanese financial
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said market participants were concerned about any
further rise in the dollar because that might provoke more central
bank intervention to support the yen, as when the United States and
Japan bought yen last week and sent the dollar down sharply. The
dollar has since retraced much of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond slipped 8/32, to a price of 106 22/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.66 percent,
from 5.64 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In early dealings, Treasuries followed the dollar fairly
closely, as the U.S. currency initially gained strength against the
yen, retreated on rumors of Japanese central bank intervention and
rebounded on skepticism about Japan's ability to solve its
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also derived some early strength from the government's
monthly report Wednesday on production of long-lasting goods, which
showed a sharp decline in May. The report suggested that the crisis
in Asia was slowing economic growth, which tends to help the bond
market, because it diminishes the possibility of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But bonds began to weaken after the Treasury's $11 billion
five-year note auction was seen as a little below average, with the
notes awarded at a price to yield 5.454 percent, less than the 5.47
percent dealers had anticipated. The results suggested softer
demand than expected for new Treasury debt.

 &HT;    Hardships of Irish give new meaning to word `poverty'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 28: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``Angela's Ashes'' upset me so
much I would read awhile and put it aside and turn out the light.
But you can't go to sleep on a family in the crisis of Frank
McCourt's characters, starving and freezing, with a baby in the
family dying every few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So I'd pick the book up and go on. Somebody said it's my
Presbyterian background that makes it hard, if not impossible, to
give up on a book once started. So I read on, and I regard it as a
very fine, if not enjoyable, book. Friends tell me it has humor in
it, but the only passages that caused me to laugh were those
attacking Protestants. The mother in the book, called ``Mam,''
defended her generous Jewish neighbor, but she had no good to say
about Protestants _ and I really valued Mam, who is the Angela of
the title.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything heartening about this book, it is the
realization that most Americans haven't seen the poverty and
suffering that afflicted the people of Limerick, Ireland, while we
were having our own Depression. Those of us who were lucky enough
to have food and a place of warmth and comfort didn't know how bad
things were in Ireland, where children would fight for the peeling
off an apple.
</P>
<P>
   I am well-acquainted with poverty, but it's the American kind,
and that may not be close to what the poor Irish have suffered. A
friend who was also pained over the book said immigrants living in
New York may have gone through somewhat the same, and they may
have. Things, I hope, never got that bad in the South, even in the
dark days of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   I had two social worker friends, Miss Florence Van Sickler, who
later headed the child welfare bureau here, and her assistant, Miss
Dorothy Bennett, who introduced me to far poorer people than I had
ever known, babies crying for milk, old folks suffering from
pellagra. But they got help, and so did the men we saw in bread
lines and in the flophouses along the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in Mobile, Ala., the incidence of the needy wasn't as
great as in Ireland, but I saw my first dead person outside a
Hooverville house made of cardboard and tin signs on the city dump.
I didn't know it at the time, never having encountered death
before, but the man may have starved to death.
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking to a teenager, but no worse than the death of a
railroad engineer whose body I saw hauled out of Mobile River after
a train wreck. Death was death, and I didn't know people died from
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' makes that very real, and unbelievably sad. I
think it is the death of little babies that is so hard to take.
Oddly enough, old aunts convinced me that grown-ups could take it.
They lived during Reconstruction days after the Civil War, and
hunger was very real to them, except that they lived on a farm and
almost always could get something to eat from the earth _ even
collard greens for breakfast, as my Great Aunt Dillie favored. One
thing she made clear to me when I was a finicky teenager was that
you're lucky to have any food at all, and the idea of holding out
for toast and orange juice was so funny she couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt is a fine writer, but he has almost banished my
old desire to vacation in Ireland. We were there once and it is
very beautiful, but memories of those bad old days of starving
dying babies would haunt me. There is a sad line toward the end
when he is sailing to America that he speaks to a Limerick man who
left Ireland ``and never got over it.'' ``You ask God,'' he adds,
``if there's any chance he could give you one soft, rainy Limerick
day.''

 &HT;    For `Sex' star, director is `so wise'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 28: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Ricci could be carved out of soap. That's because her
skin is so pale and glowing. And also because, this afternoon,
she's about as animated as a bar of Ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Lumped in the corner of a sofa at the Swissotel Atlanta, she
plays a variant of good cop/bad cop with ``The Opposite of Sex''
writer-director Don Roos.
</P>
<P>
   He'll rattle off an articulate speech about his comedy, which
opened Friday. Then it's her turn to say something. Usually only a
few syllables. ``I agree'' or ``Yes, that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her usual quote is `Don is so right,''' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   She pitches in: ``So wise; he's so wise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a high-energy act,'' says Roos, the screenwriter of
``Single White Female'' and ``Boys on the Side,'' with a cheeriness
that belies his own words. ``We basically like to sit around and
lounge, watch TV and talk about people.''
</P>
<P>
   A hit at this year's Sundance Film Festival, ``The Opposite of
Sex'' stars Ricci as 16-year-old Dedee, who wrecks her gay half
brother's life. After shooting it, the 18-year-old ``Addams
Family'' and ``The Ice Storm'' star stayed at the Los Angeles home
of Roos and his boyfriend for a couple of months. She lives in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I came home from editing, and she was exactly
where I'd left her on the couch,'' Roos remembers. ``All she said
was, `Wow, you have a lot of channels on your cable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ask her what she did during her two-month stay, and Ricci
doesn't try to amend his story: ``I watched TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Roos didn't write the role of chain-smoking Dedee with a
particular actress in mind, he says he can't think of anyone else
pulling it off. ``Christina was perfect in the role. She brought an
incredible amount of vulnerability and intelligence to it. She
instinctively knew who this character is . ... Which is very scary
if you think about it.'' He glances at the actress on the opposite
end of the couch. ``She's so much a part of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So wise,'' Ricci murmurs again and laughs. Perking up long
enough to cobble together a few sentences, she explains what drew
her to the ``Sex'' script: ``It was some of the best dialogue I'd
ever read, and it was a strong character for a teenage girl. That's
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were no cats and no ghost,'' Roos cuts in, alluding
to Ricci's kid flicks ``That Darn Cat'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really obnoxious how everybody keeps throwing that stuff
in my face,'' she shoots back.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs. ``I haven't actually seen `Casper.' But people love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci: ``Yeah, they do. It's actually not that bad ... for a
kids' movie.''
</P>
<P>
   She's definitely in her don't-cast-me-as-a-kid phase now. In
another Sundance film, ``Buffalo 66,'' she plays a young woman
posing as director-star Vincent Gallo's wife. In ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas,'' she's a lost soul trudging around the
city, tripping on acid and lugging bad portraits of Barbra
Streisand. And in ``The Opposite of Sex,'' not only does she have
sex scenes and smoke nonstop, she goes into labor.
</P>
<P>
   That was her fave scene, she says: ``I liked giving birth. That
was fun.'' But she didn't research the mechanics of pregnancy. ``I
just imitated all the movies I'd ever seen where women gave
birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Roos didn't do much research either. ``I think we made a few
mistakes,'' he says of the scene. ``But you know, I've never seen a
child being born, because who wants to see that, basically?'' being
squeezed out,'' Ricci says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange way to continue the race, don't you think?''
Roos agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Roos initially planned to make his directing debut with ``Loose
Women,'' starring Meg Ryan. But Ryan got cold feet and backed out
of the project. Lawsuits ensued. But so did the idea for his new
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very angry, so I just went to bed for a long time. A
week. And I watched cable,'' Roos says. ``And because I was very
angry, this image of a 16-year-old girl hurling a chair into an
open grave came to me. And everything flowed from that.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might have guessed, Ricci plays that girl.
</P>
<P>
   Roos says inspiration comes from all sorts of places. But in
this case, ``I watched a lot of Sandra Bullock in the movie `The
Net' when I came up with the idea. It was playing a lot that week.
And I guess I was inspired by the sound of her clicking away at her
keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoth Ricci: ``So true. So wise.''

 &HT;    Hats to watches: Patriotic fever colors fashions
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 28: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you run a marathon or sun yourself at the pool this July
Fourth, celebrate your fashion independence in patriotic colors.
</P>
<P>
   White, red and blue are never out of fashion, but this time of
the year, they are definitely in.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, we feel good in these colors,'' says Margaret
Walch of the Color Association of the United States. ``They are
clean, practical and forthright _ everything for which we stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we seem to be more comfortable in these less complicated
shades than say a raspberry or a chartreuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Get into the spirit with head-to-toe items ranging from
red-and-white bikinis and tri-colored athletic shoes to
star-studded T-shirts, baseball caps and Americana jewelry.
Patriotic fever also runs to watches. Swatch always includes
several summer styles in red, white or blue, according to company
representative Trish O'Callahan because ``these are the colors of
several national flags and consistently good sellers.''

 &HT;    Mini views: Reviews of movies now out on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Fast, Cheap &AMP; Out of Control'' (unrated) _ Nonfiction
filmmaker Errol Morris has always gone after big issues, whether
it's the slippery nature of legal evidence (``The Thin Blue Line'')
or the workings of the universe (``A Brief History of Time''). His
latest is an oblique, haunting essay on mortality and the
obsolescence of mankind. He makes his points through mesmerizing,
intertwined interviews with four men devoted to unique occupations:
topiary gardening, lion taming, robot engineering and the study of
mole rats. The film is like a piece of music, a bittersweet sonata
that gets inside your mind and moves you in ways you can't quite
name. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Mr. Magoo'' (PG) _ Leslie Nielsen plays the live-action
myopic man. And your heart sinks. Nielsen is an engaging actor.
It's just that, well, he's not 3 feet tall with a huge head, a
potato-size nose and a perpetual squint. In short, he's not Magoo.
Still, Nielsen has amusing moments as he forges gamely through the
generic caper-comedy script by ``Naked Gun'' alum Pat Proft.
Advocacy groups for the blind have denounced this movie. But the
star and director Stanley Tong have taken great care not to turn
Mr. Magoo into an object of derision. It's a big heart, not bad
eyesight, that defines him. Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Postman'' (R) _ The setting is the post-apocalyptic
United States of 2013, a place of rusting cars and people dressed
in those sci-fi/medieval costumes familiar from flicks like
``Waterworld.'' Kevin Costner directs and stars as a fellow who
raises people's hopes by posing as a mailman, reviving the
long-dormant message service and sparking a war with a fascist
group of thugs led by Will Patton. The script can't decide whether
this postman is a pacifist or a fighter, a hero or the victim of
his own PR. Costner seems to feel no embarrassment about putting
himself (yet again) at the center of a trumped-up mythology. It's a
big, overlong, boring ego trip. Grade: C -

   Audio reviews: Feedback on the latest sounds
</P>
<P>
   By Russ DeVault, Doug Hamilton, Shane Harrison, Sonia Murray,
Nick Tate, and A. Scott Walton
</P>
<P>
   -- POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagination''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wilson. Giant. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   It's great to hear Brian Wilson's voice again. Make that voices
_ the genius behind the Beach Boys layers as many as 96 vocal
tracks on the tunes that make up his first album in 10 years. Too
bad those pipes are put to the service of such mundane songs. Mired
in blah adult contemporary instrumentation, ``Imagination'' serves
up one Muzak-ready track after another. And Wilson's ever-winsome
ruminations on love and loneliness are beginning to take on a
creepy edge. ``Keep an Eye on Summer,'' for instance, finds the
55-year-old singer pondering the post-graduation fate of a high
school romance. Only ``Lay Down Burden,'' a moving tribute to
Wilson's late brother Carl, truly resonates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rufus Wainwright''
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Wainwright.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The progeny of celebrated musicians are suddenly as prevalent as
teenage girls at a Leonardo DiCaprio movie. Sean Lennon, Jakob
Dylan and Emma Townshend are all carrying on the family business.
Wainwright's surname may not be as familiar, but father Loudon
Wainwright III and mother Kate McGarrigle both have created some
fine music. ``Foolish Love'' and ``Beauty Mark'' recall some of his
mother's work with her sister, Anna. Like Randy Newman and
collaborator Van Dyke Parks, Wainwright's songs often recall the
music of the pre-rock era. They reveal new depth with each hearing,
until they begin to sound like the standards they bring to mind.
That's a substantial accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   -- JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing Together''
</P>
<P>
   George Benson. GRP Records.
</P>
<P>
   9 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   What an ironic title George Benson has chosen for his latest
release, ``Standing Together.'' This one's condemnably disjointed
enough to merit the ``Contractual Obligation'' stamp. The fifth
track, ``Poquito Spanish, Poquito Funk,'' will strike groove mavens
as worth the entire album's price, but the title of the fourth
track, ``Cruise Control,'' speaks indicatively of what's on this
record: Benson warbling through sappy love songs, watered-down
tunes for adult contemporary radio, and too few flashes of this
honey-throated guitarist's scat-along brilliance. Six tracks out of
nine feature Atlanta-based percussionist Lil' John Roberts; the
best track and the only one that Benson composed, '``Poquito ...
Poquito ...,'' doesn't. Hard-core Benson collectors should buy this
CD eventually, if only because it'll look right ``Standing
Together'' among his others.
</P>
<P>
   -- SOUNDTRACK
</P>
<P>
   ``Quest for Camelot''
</P>
<P>
   Various. Curb/Warner Bros./Atlantic. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Celine Dion continues her reign as queen of the soundtrack
sirens, lending her power-pop pipes to the central ballad from this
Disney wannabe. Wrapping her supple voice around ``The Prayer,''
Dion delivers the strongest performance on this patchwork of Carol
Bayer Sager/David Foster pop tunes. LeAnn Rimes, Steve Perry and
Andrea Bocelli also make cameo vocal appearances. But the big names
are generally outclassed by Dion and the fresh, folky tracks from
the Irish singing group the Corrs. Beyond these few bright spots,
there isn't much to elevate this collection of insipid,
relentlessly upbeat songs.
</P>
<P>
   -- RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Make It Reign''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Tariq &AMP; Peter Gunz. Codeine/Columbia. 19 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to introduce yourself as party-starters, then turn
around and try to play tough guys. And that's basically the only
struggle with the Lord Tariq &AMP; Peter Gunz debut. As tiring as a
19-song album can be, the producers keep it interesting with
varying musical backdrops. Some variety in delivery would really
help Tariq &AMP; Gunz, but they're still decent storytellers, leaving
story selection the issue. One minute it's ``Fiesta,'' which makes
saccharine-pop Lionel Richie's ``All Night Long'' seem streetwise.
The next, they're shooting in the street. As much fun as the two
seem to be having on the million-selling lead single ``Deja Vu
(Uptown Baby),'' why stop?
</P>
<P>
   -- COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Perpetual Emotion''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Thomas Conley.
</P>
<P>
   Intersound. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding Her and Lovin' You,'' ``Your Love's on the Line'' and
some other tunes from Earl Thomas Conley's catalog are recycled
here, but that doesn't detract from the pleasure of hearing his
rich, winning baritone after an absence blamed on professional,
personal and physical problems. Most of the repeats are too old for
newcomer fans to know them, and Conley's longtime fans will like
the new versions by one of country music's best interpreters. Other
standouts include the cut-loose ``I Ain't Crazy'' and ``Scared
Money Never Wins,'' an admonition to keep getting up and trying
again, no matter whether it's in love or life in general.

 &HT;    Vintage Van Morrison: Miracles do happen
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine, after 20-some years of wearing out your favorite Van
Morrison albums _ whether you'd name ``Astral Weeks,'' ``Tupelo
Honey,'' ``St. Dominic's Preview'' or ``Irish Heartbeat'' _ you
come across new songs, previously hidden from you, tacked onto the
end. They would not have been listed anywhere; you would discover
them by chance. The same great R&AMP;B-kissed Irish soul you know by
heart, only in variations that are completely new to you.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of miracle that die-hard fans usually only dream
of. But in this case, it's true. Skipping through ``The Philosopher
Stone'' is like coming upon Morrison's musical notebooks, where
ideas are worked out, arrangements tested, favorite themes hashed
and rehashed. Here's ``Laughing in the Wind,'' a horn-powered 1973
blues workout with Jackie De Shannon's vocals hugging Van's like a
coat. Morrison's harmonica sparks on the bluesy ``Don't Worry About
Tomorrow''; his falsetto begs a lover for release on the plaintive
jazz dream ``Try for Sleep.'' Take a pew in the First Church of
Passion Unbound for ``Lover's Prayer.'' ``There There Child'' feels
like it was born right after ``Jackie Wilson Said'' or ``These
Dreams of You.'' So many revelations that you realize that
Morrison, like Bob Dylan, isn't the best judge of his own work.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder what else he has locked in the vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philosopher's Stone''
</P>
<P>
   Van Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Polydor. 30 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A

 &HT;    Guitars a welcome sound on heat-seeking 'Hav Plenty'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fire,'' ``Heat'' and Faith Evans on a ballad _ hey, ``Hav
Plenty'' has just about all the elements for a hot album.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's co-producer, singer and producer, Kenneth
``Babyface'' Edmonds, and Des'ree light the embers with a spare,
smoldering cover of Bruce Springsteen's ``Fire.'' New Atlanta R&AMP;B
duo Absoulute follows and keeps the mood going with ``Heat,'' a
slinky, simple come-on that, like most of this album, makes
prominent use of guitars.
</P>
<P>
   That's an unfortunate rarity on R&AMP;B records of late. But that's
their loss and SWV's gain, as the group incorporates muscular
wah-wah guitars into a spirited reworking of the Jackson 5's ``I
Wanna Be Where You Are.'' SWV's Coko appears earlier as well,
vocally bulldozing her way past an obviously outmatched Jon B on
the still enjoyable ``Keep It Real.''
</P>
<P>
   Swooning and soaring up there with Coko is Erykah Badu on ``Ye
Yo'' and Faith Evans, one of the closest voices contemporary R&AMP;B
has to gospel, on ``Tears Away.'' Floating over the hypnotic
keyboards, Evans' call to ``Come to me so that I can be in love''
is certain to elicit only one response: ``gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' soundtrack
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Yab Yum/550 Music/Sony. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``Hav Plenty'' has a lot that pleases.

 &HT;    Novelist counting on new surroundings to refresh her writing
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white linen suit that is rapidly wilting, Anne
Rivers Siddons pauses under a live oak on cobblestoned Church
Street and wipes her face with a handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   It is 99 degrees in the shade. There are no Englishmen or mad
dogs about, only sweat-soaked tourists and one best-selling
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbearable,'' Siddons says, leaning against an iron
gate near the historic 1758 house she bought a few weeks ago. ``I'm
beginning to have second thoughts about moving here in November.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, refreshed by a sudden breeze, the
61-year-old author is enthusiastic again about her newly adopted
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crape myrtle is gorgeous,'' she gushes, ``and I can walk
to three antique book stores right down the street. I think this
city will be good for me. My writing needs a little jump-start
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston to launch her 14th book, ``Low Country,'' Siddons
retreats to the coolness of her hotel bar to talk about leaving
Atlanta and starting a new life in South Carolina's Lowcountry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the furniture is out of the house in Atlanta and we've
bought a small condo near Lenox Square. I'm not going to give
Atlanta up totally. I plan to come back at least once a month.'
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she says, her next book will probably be set in
suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to become a Charleston writer. I'm just going to
write in Charleston.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, she is eager to mine the city for
literary material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that somebody hasn't written a book on
Charleston like `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.' Maybe it
would take a journalist from the outside to do it. I was talking to
people last night whose families had been here for hundreds of
years and the stories were the most bizarre things I had heard.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that everyone had a grandmother or an aunt or knew some
other strong, slightly deranged woman who did outrageous things and
got away with them. Of course, she couldn't use any of those
stories she heard and hope to remain in Charleston, Siddons quickly
adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charleston is a masculine town to me, with the lawyers who
control family money and run things. But the legends and the
stories and the flavor come from the women.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that flavor comes through in ``Low Country''
(HarperCollins, $25). The heroine, Caroline Venable _ Caro to her
friends _ is married to a wealthy South Carolina developer who has
his sights set on a beautiful, unspoiled island populated by Gullah
families and wild ponies. The island is Caro's heritage, left to
her by her grandfather, and she is determined to save it. There are
complications, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Siddons' novels, ``Low Country'' is a story of one
woman's renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write about women who are in transition; they're
unfinished,'' Siddons explains over a glass of artificially
sweetened tea. ``Women my age are faced with many losses and
changes in their lives. They aren't necessarily finished by the end
of the book, but they do have one foot on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the books touch a chord in many readers. More than
250,000 copies of her 1997 novel ``Up Island'' were sold and she
gets a steady stream of fan letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so complimentary,'' says Siddons' husband, Heyward.
``They say, `You turned my life around.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what is so satisfying about writing,'' Siddons says.
``Touching people. I would like to be taken a little more seriously
in New York, but that's not going to happen. I will never be
considered anything but a regional writer by The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of critical acclaim _ a Times reviewer once
cited her ``shamelessly energetic brand of overwriting'' _ Siddons
is a commercial success. She has one book left on a four-book
contract with HarperCollins worth an estimated $13 million. And
though she is not yet on a level with Danielle Steel or Mary
Higgins Clark, who get $12 million per book and whose sales are
near the million-copy mark, she is nonetheless one of
HarperCollins' best-selling authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely knows her mostly female audience better than
most of her contemporaries in the South,'' says Bob Summer of
Publishers Weekly, the industry's trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, Siddons wrote lovingly about
Atlanta. But traffic jams and unbridled development at the expense
of neighborhoods and historic structures finally got to her, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta had a very specific feel to it in the '60s. It doesn't
have that feel anymore. It seems too homogenized. In Charleston,
there's development, but more historic buildings have been saved
here than in any other big city. And here they celebrate the past.
They don't pretend it never happened.''

 &HT;    After reading ``Storm'' and ``Tide'', you might not want to go
near the water
 &HT;    Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're searching for beach books that are more substantial
than sea foam, the latest batch of paperbacks is worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   For outdoor adventure tales, it's hard to beat ``The Perfect
Storm'' (Harper, $6.99) by Sebastian Junger. This superbly written
true story of an October 1991 ``storm of the century'' that hit a
fishing vessel off the coast of Massachusetts is more terrifying
than the scariest fiction. The doomed six-man crew of the Andrea
Gail faced winds of 120 mph and waves 10 stories high. Drawing on
interviews with family members and other fishermen, Junger
skillfully captures the fury of the storm while weaving in details
of the men's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Another water-related book is John M. Barry's award-winning
``Rising Tide'' (Touchstone, $15). The winner of the Southern Book
Critics Circle and Lillian Smith awards, ``Rising Tide'' is an epic
tale of one of America's greatest natural disasters. The
Mississippi River flood of 1927 had more wide-reaching consequences
than the 1 million homes it invaded. It changed the politics and
social structure of the South by destroying empires of tenant
farms, eroding the power of New Orleans bankers, driving hundreds
of thousands of blacks to the North and paving the way for the rise
of Huey Long.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the night the flood hit Greenville, Miss., Barry
switches to three separate stories. One involves the engineers who
fought over ways to control the river, finally settling _
disastrously, it turns out _ on levees. Another story is the
history of the aristocratic Percy family, and a third is about the
New Orleans bankers whose decision to dynamite a levee and flood an
area south of the city resulted in their political demise.
Meticulously researched and well-written, Barry's narrative is as
sure and swift as the river itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now for something on dry land: a baseball diamond, to be exact.
The Polo Grounds in New York is the opening setting for
``Underworld'' (Scribner, $16), Don DeLillo's brilliant portrait of
America in the Cold War years. The date is Oct. 3, 1951, and the
Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants are facing each other in the
final playoff game for the pennant. Among those seated in the
stands are Frank Sinatra, Jackie Gleason, Toots Shor and J. Edgar
Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the game, an FBI agent pulls Hoover aside to
share the news that the Soviet Union has detonated its first atomic
bomb. Bobby Thomson's home run would be called ``the shot heard
'round the world,'' but echoes of that Russian shot would
reverberate for decades. The rest of the novel is a story of a
generation in the shadow of the bomb. ``Underworld'' is a
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLillo attempts to capture the entire nation in his
sweeping novel, James Lee Burke is content to focus on a smaller
landscape. Deaf Smith, Texas, is the setting for ``Cimarron Rose''
(Hyperion, $7.99), Burke's compelling crime novel about Billy Bob
Holland, a former Texas Ranger who is now a defense lawyer. When
Vernon Smothers' boy Lucas is accused of raping and killing a girl,
Vernon asks Billy Bob for help. Because Lucas is really Billy Bob's
son, he has no choice, even if it means dredging up family secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cimarron Rose'' is a departure for Burke, whose well-known
Dave Robicheaux series is set in Louisiana, but the writing is just
as crisp and the misfit characters just as memorable.

 &HT;    CNN hires lawyer to probe sarin report
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--CNN has hired First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams to
conduct an independent investigation into the accuracy of its
controversial report on U.S. use of nerve gas in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is being looked at as heavily as we know how,'' CNN
anchor Jeff Greenfield said Wednesday. ``We're in the process of
finding out, did we make a mistake or were we right?''
</P>
<P>
   A news organization hiring an outsider to review its reporting
is unusual. Abrams, who represented The New York Times in the
Pentagon Papers case and argued for cameras in the courtroom in the
O.J. Simpson trial, will look at CNN's research and process and
report back to CNN executives. Greenfield says CNN will then report
to viewers on the accuracy of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we're not going to do is rush in until we know what
we're saying,'' Greenfield said. ``This is a 28-year-old event. It
ain't like there's a piece of paper we can refer to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were wrong, we'll tell you that,'' Greenfield continued.
``If we were right, we'll tell you that. If we were `right, but
...' we'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial report, which aired June 7 on the new magazine show
``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' charged that U.S. military forces
dropped sarin nerve gas in Laos in 1970 and killed American
defectors and civilians. Retired Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, CNN's
former military adviser, resigned in protest over what he says is
an erroneous story and CNN's refusal, so far, to retract it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is not sloppy journalism, but irresponsible,
dishonest journalism,'' Smith said Wednesday in a telephone
interview from his home in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been conducting his own investigation into the story
since it aired and said it is ``completely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives such as NewsGroup CEO Tom Johnson and CNN/US
president Richard Kaplan have declined to comment on the accuracy
of the report or on the investigation; Greenfield's comments are
the most candid yet from inside CNN confirming that the network is
investigating a story it promoted heavily. And Smith's comments
about CNN are his most pointed yet as the controversy over
Operation Tailwind, as the military called it, continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the raid and the alleged nerve gas use was also
published in Time in a piece written by international correspondent
Peter Arnett and CNN producer April Oliver. (Although Arnett was
the reporter on the on-air piece, Oliver did much of the research
and interviews.) But in the current Time, a ``To Our Readers'' note
from managing editor Walter Isaacson states: ``We feel the doubts
raised deserve full exploration. ... When we get more of these
facts, and, we hope, a clearer picture of what may have happened,
we will report them to you, correct any mistakes and try to clarify
any disputes that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although CNN does not know when it will make a full public
accounting of Abrams' report, the network does plan to address the
controversy at 6:30 p.m. Saturday on ``Reliable Sources,'' its
weekly show that deals with media issues. ``NewsStand'' senior
executive producer Pam Hill and senior producer Jack Smith are
scheduled to appear on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN story about Operation Tailwind was also seriously
questioned by Newsweek, a Time competitor, which quoted Eugene
McCarley, the Army captain who led the raid, as saying, ``It's all
lies.'' McCarley was one of several men involved in Operation
Tailwind interviewed on camera by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen Smith, who was CNN's military adviser on retainer but
was not consulted before the story ran, said he spoke with several
people involved in Tailwind, including the two pilots who dropped
the gas. Smith said both pilots maintained they were certain it was
tear gas they dropped, not nerve gas. They said there were no
special provisions taken for loading the gas, and no chemical suits
or instructions issued to the pliots, even though they were flying
50 feet above the trees and faced exposure, Smith said. The pilots
were interviewed by CNN, but not included in the final story.
</P>
<P>
   Although several aspects of CNN's report, which was titled
``Valley of Death,'' have been questioned, the largest single
dispute is over whether it was nerve gas or tear gas that was
dropped from the planes. Two men on the Tailwind mission told CNN
it was nerve gas, and a chemist said the symptoms of those
afflicted, including convulsions and rapid unconsciousness, were
not associated with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Rose, a former Special Forces medic who treated the
Tailwind wounded, said Tuesday at Washington's National Press Club
that he is positive ``beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' that tear gas
was used, not nerve gas. Rose said he was also interviewed by CNN
but was not included in the ``Valley of Death'' story.
</P>
<P>
   CNN interviewed more than than 200 people associated with
Tailwind for more than eight months. Many of them spoke on
background to CNN and confirmed the nerve gas story, CNN spokesman
Steve Haworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a weapons and tactics officer for an Air Force
squadron and flew 130 missions over Laos in 1968-'69. ``There were
a lot of spooky things going on in Laos, mostly initiated by the
CIA,'' he said. ``I don't think anybody can say with total
confidence that somebody might not have done something really bad
or illegal in the Laotian theater. But it is impossible that nerve
gas was used in Operation Tailwind.''

 &HT;    Drama, trauma in war-ravaged Bosnia
 &HT;    By Steve Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Sarajevo'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   British director Michael Winterbottom found Thomas Hardy's
19th-century melancholy in ``Jude'' and the desolate romanticism of
British back roads in ``Butterfly Kiss.'' He continues to extend
his range with this documentary-textured drama, set in the flaming
ruins of war-torn Bosnia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dillane plays a British TV journalist whose vow of
objectivity gets tested by his stumbling upon an orphanage in the
line of fire _ and by a 9-year-old girl there, whom he impulsively
promises to take home with him to England.
</P>
<P>
   The strong supporting cast includes Kerry Fox and Woody
Harrelson as fellow journalists, who meet at the bar of a
shrapnel-scarred hotel, jockeying for the best footage and
placement on their newscasts back home.
</P>
<P>
   By turns darkly funny, scary and moving, ``Sarajevo'' gathers
emotional power without lapsing into cheap sentimentality. It's
helped by its basis in reality; it's a dramatized account of a real
story.

   JUNIK, Serbia _ Richard Holbrooke met with members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army on Wednesday, calling the Kosovo crisis
``explosive,'' and comparing it to the early stages of the Bosnian
and Vietnam conflicts after they rejected his call for negotiations
with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was going back into the rice paddies of the
Mekong Delta and seeing the same tragic scenario playing itself
out,'' the special envoy told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely organized rebel bands are saying they will fight for
an independent state or die in the process, reiterated that
uncompromising stance, to Holbrooke's open frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who was nominated last week as the new United States
representative to the United Nations, stressed to the rebels that
Washington and NATO did not support their demand for an independent
state in Kosovo, but instead hoped to prod Belgrade to return the
autonomous status that was revoked eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on Wednesday was the first between a senior U.S.
official and the rebel group, which was branded a ``terrorist''
organization earlier this year by senior State Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's decision to meet with the rebels, a move that is
likely to anger Belgrade, underscored Washington's fear that
Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist ethnic Albanian leader, has seen his
authority and prestige evaporate as more and more ethnic Albanians
take up arms. Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the
population of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commander in Junik dismissed Holbrooke's calls for a
cease-fire and an autonomy agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this visit will lead NATO and the United States to
stop this Serbian aggression,'' said Lum Haxhiu, 40, who met with
Holbrooke wearing a uniform and equipped with an AK-47 assault
rifle. ``We didn't like what Holbrooke said about trying to bring
peace to Kosovo. We need freedom, not just peace. It is freedom
that we are fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened to take measures against Serbia, including
carrying out air strikes, if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
does not halt the sweep against the armed separatists that has
driven some 80,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes and left more
than 300 dead since March.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deep reluctance on the part of NATO officials to
carry out such strikes, fearing they could lead to NATO forces'
becoming embroiled in a large-scale confrontation with the Yugoslav
military. Air strikes, these officials say, would also assist the
rebels, who now control about 40 percent of the province, in the
battles with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton accord that brought peace
to Bosnia, has secured an agreement from Milosevic to permit the
western alliance to deploy 100 military observers in Kosovo, and he
is pressing the Milosevic to withdraw most of the 50,000 soldiers
and special police officers, lift roadblocks and establish a
cease-fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, however, has dismissed any withdrawal until attacks by
the ``Albanian terrorists'' are terminated and order is restored in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the real possibility of NATO intervention the chances
of ethnic cleansing by the Serbs is significantly increased,''
Holbrooke warned.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal by the armed Kosovo rebels to accept a cease-fire or
talks with Belgrade can only exacerbate the conflict, western
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is both sides are being provocative,'' said a senior
diplomat traveling with the Holbrooke mission. ``It is not just one
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy appeared dismayed at the scale of the destruction
he saw in towns like Decani, which was heavily damaged by the
fighting. The town is now deserted and most of its 20,000
inhabitants have fled to nearby villages or across the border to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decani is awful,'' Holbrooke said, standing outside homes that
had been gutted by shells and fire. ``It looks like western Bosnia
when I went there in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not fighting, this was the Yugoslav security forces
driving people out,'' he said. ``I think the Serbs should get out
of here, and the residents should come back and be given government
help to reconstruct their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The mushrooming rebel movement lacks a central command structure
and the numerous armed groups are rapidly plunging the province
into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has called on Rugova, who has suspended talks with
Belgrade until the crackdown on Kosovo ends, to return to the table
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova told the local Albanian language-press that the rebel
fighters ``must take orders from me or it could be fatal to
Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rebels, in a move that brought the conflict closer to the
provincial capital of Pristina, took control of an open pit coal
mine in Delacvac, five miles outside Pristina, on Tuesday night.
The mine supplies the huge Obilic power station for the province,
as well as parts of Serbia and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events on the ground have been moving faster than the
diplomatic process,'' Holbrooke said. ``We are not waiting for
intricately coordinated positions in order to try to stop this.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing near a gaping hole from a mortar shell in a cement
wall, he said, ``We are standing in the middle of what amounts to
an Albanian enclave surrounded by Serbian forces, three kilometers
from the Albanian border and both sides are primed for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting along the road between Pec and Pristina forced
Holbrooke's convoy of white armored vehicles to make several
detours. At one point the cars turned back because of heavy sniper
fire. As Holbrooke spoke with rebel fighters the sound of distant
artillery explosions reverberated in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   A group of reporters who did not accompany Holbrooke to Junik
came under fire briefly at a checkpoint a half-mile away when Serb
police and rebels exchanged shots. There were no injuries.

PLAN FOR GARDEN TO COMMEMORATE DIANA DRAWS OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As Britain braces for the first anniversary of the
death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, the government Wednesday
announced a series of steps to commemorate her life.
</P>
<P>
   The plans, whittled down from more than 10,000 suggestions
submitted to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee,
include a (PS)5 commemorative coin that would probably have Diana's
likeness on one side and Queen Elizabeth's on the other, and a
network of community nursing programs to help critically ill
children.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans call for an achievement award for schoolchildren; a
memorial walkway linking Westminster Abbey, where Diana's funeral
was held, to Kensington Palace, where she lived, and a 16-acre, $16
million landscaped memorial garden in Kensington Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the proposals, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown praised the ``time and effort'' that members of the public
``from all walks of life'' had put in to drafting suggestions about
how best to remember Diana, who died in a car accident last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposals which we have announced today were amongst the
most popular and appropriate we received, and we expect them to be
widely acknowledged as a fitting tribute to her life and work,''
said Brown, the chairman of the memorial committee. Other committee
members include Paul Burrell, Diana's butler; Anthony Julius, her
divorce lawyer, and Earl Spencer, her brother.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Brown spoken than the garden plan was bitterly
denounced by residents of Kensington, the London borough in which
it would be built, who pointed out that the princess had never been
particularly interested in gardens or indeed in the outdoors.
Although Brown said that the plan was subject ``to consultation,''
the residents said they were terrified that the government intended
to go ahead with it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the people's princess has gone too far,'' said
Jane Mayhew, a spokeswoman for the Kensington Society, a
neighborhood group. ``This is appeasing the great British public's
appetite at the expense of a whole borough.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sir Ronald Arculus, chairman of the Kensington Court
Residents' Association, said the government seemed obsessed with
the garden plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't much care for gardens herself, she wasn't
interested in them,'' he said of Diana, ``and this one is a
funereal thing. It's not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly 10 months since she died, there has been little
sign in Britain that the public's obsession with Diana has begun to
abate. The newspapers still use any excuse to use her photograph on
their front pages.
</P>
<P>
   Every move the memorial committee has made, from approving the
use of Diana's signature on a brand of margarine whose owners
promised to donate their proceeds to charity, to publicly debating
its own future, has been scrutinized and criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Althorp, Diana's childhood home, is to open to the public next
week, complete with a Diana museum, a cafe and a gift shop. The
multi-million-dollar refurbishment of the estate, which is owned by
Earl Spencer, has been criticized by neighbors worried that it
might become an English Graceland and by Diana-lovers concerned
about the commercialization of her memory.
</P>
<P>
   The earl himself, whose popularity soared when he rebuked the
royal family at Diana's funeral and plummeted during his messy
divorce and when it began to appear that he was cashing in on his
sister's name, has sought to restore himself to public favor
recently with a series of carefully selected interviews in the
newspapers and on television.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a member of Diana's memorial committee, he has been in
the forefront of the country's exercise in keeping her memory very
much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suggestions the government rejected, according to The
Daily Mail, were a proposals to establish a new public holiday in
Diana's memory, and to introduce a new medal that would have been
awarded annually by the monarch. &QL;

DRIVER IN FATAL TRAIN-TRUCK ACCIDENT TESTED POSITIVE FOR
MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The driver of a truck involved in a fatal commuter
train wreck last week has tested positive for marijuana,
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lintz, 39, of Niles, Mich., was driving a double
tractor-trailer into a steel mill in Portage, Ind., on June 18 when
the truck, carrying three 40,000 pound steel coils, became trapped
between two parallel train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   While Lintz was stopped for a freight train on one of the
tracks, a Chicago-bound commuter train on the other tracks crashed
into the rear trailer. The impact hurled one of the coils into the
front car of the two-car train, killing three passengers and
injuring six others.
</P>
<P>
   Chief David Reynolds of the Portage police said tests found
marijuana in Lintz's urine. Blood tests were still pending. He
could not say how much marijuana the tests found or that it
contributed to the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some other drugs, marijuana stays in your system for
quite a while, so it may be a case where he took some marijuana
several weeks ago and it's just still in his system,'' Reynolds
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lintz, whose driving record shows he has received two warning
letters from the Michigan secretary of state's office in the last
five years for accumulating points on his license, was cited for
four violations at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious included a failure to properly secure the
coils, and an overweight violation, which meant Lintz should not
have been pulling the second trailer. Reynolds said evidence was
being formally presented to prosecutors Wednesday, who would have
the final decision on whether Lintz will face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
re-created the crash Saturday. Matthew Furman, a spokesman for the
agency, said preliminary findings from the re-enactment show the
train engineer saw the trailer only five to seven seconds before
impact.
</P>
<P>
   After applying the emergency brake, the engineer was able to
slow the train from 68 mph to 43 mph at the point of impact. Furman
said the full investigation would take about year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Lintz has told investigators the freight train on the parallel
tracks in front of him and the crossing gates behind him boxed him
in, preventing him from moving.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-mile-long South Shore line shuttles more than 12,000
passengers daily between South Bend, Ind., and Chicago. Portage,
Ind., a town of about 30,000 is 30 miles southeast of Chicago. &QL;

LEGISLATION WOULD ENCOURAGE LATER START TIMES AT HIGH SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Starting school later could improve the health and
academic success of high school students, sleep specialists said
Wednesday as they endorsed legislation that would encourage school
districts around the nation to start classes after 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., sponsor of the bill, said it would
offer school districts up to $25,000 in federal money if they would
push back their start times.
</P>
<P>
   She said later start times are necessary ``so that students are
in school during their most alert hours and can achieve their full
academic potential.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no national standard for high school start times.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep expert Dr. William C. Dement of Stanford University told a
Capitol Hill news conference that teenagers undergo a change in
their biological clocks at puberty, making them more alert at night
but sleepier in the morning. As a result, early start hours at many
schools is detrimental to academic success, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep expert Dr. Mary Carskadon, of the Brown University School
of Medicine, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are waking up and going to school at a time when their
brains are still in the night-time mode,'' she said. ``The average
16-year-old would perhaps have to go to bed at 8 p.m. to get enough
sleep to be at school at 7:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some high school students endorsed Lofgren's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Hottot, 17, a student at Herndon High School in suburban
Herndon, Va., said he had to get up at 5:55 a.m. to get to school
on time. He said he was sleepy in his morning classes and that his
academic performance suffered as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so interested in mathematics, so I would kinda let
loose in that class and let it take over and fall asleep. Needless
to say, my lowest course grade this year came in trigonometry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dement said a later school start time could also help prevent
such problems as student-linked crime in the early afternoon when
parents are still at work or dangerous driving by sleepy students
on the way to school.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James P. Moran, D-Va. also blamed early school start times
for the rise in crime in the early afternoon when students get out
of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have arrested the crime rate in virtually every category,
except between 2 and 5 in the afternoon _ and that's when crime
keeps going up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren's bill faces a tough future in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCarthy, the spokesman for the House Education Committee,
said Congress wants to provide more federal funding for schools
without red tape, and this bill ``smacks of red tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren said she introduced the legislation in order to educate
school districts about the problems of early start times.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislation helps make the school districts more aware of
the issue, they will change their start times regardless of the
federal money incentive, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Gunfire will break out again in Tiananmen Square on
Saturday _ to welcome a U.S. president to China.
</P>
<P>
   Detachments of the People's Liberation Army _ whose troops fired
on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around the giant plaza nine
years ago _ will be part of the official greeting for President
Clinton, the first U.S. head of state to visit since the massacre,
which killed hundreds. Clinton, who left Washington on Wednesday,
will get a 21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials say a Tiananmen Square ceremony is how a state
visit must begin, and the White House has gone along, despite
complaints from human rights activists and the Republican
leadership of the House.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any reckoning, it will be one of the most
controversial moments of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In its current configuration, the square is an odd focus of
controversy _ 100 or so acres of dull concrete.
</P>
<P>
   But it is ``the most emotionally and historically charged urban
space in China,'' wrote Yale historian Jonathan D. Spence, and the
scene of internal and international power struggles for at least
300 years.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants, in the midst of a brief rebellion as the Ming dynasty
collapsed, occupied the square in 1644. Foreign troops camped in
the plaza in 1900 as they attempted to put down the Boxer
Rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The square stands immediately in front of the south entrance of
the old imperial compound, just outside the Gate of Heavenly Peace
(Tiananmen in Chinese), a structure so central to the nation that
it is on the official seal.
</P>
<P>
   From atop the gate, Mao Zedong, whose portraits still hang from
the deep red portal, declared the birth of the People's Republic of
China on Oct. 1, 1949, at the end of the civil war. At the
beginning of the Cultural Revolution, up to 1 million young Red
Guard zealots crowd into the square waving the ``little red book''
of selected Mao precepts. The leader's mausoleum was constructed on
the south side of the square, and thousands of visitors a day line
up in regimented ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cosmological center of China,'' said David Lampton of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ``For
somebody to say he's not going to go to Tiananmen Square is, in
effect, to say he's not going to China at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But other old China hands see Clinton's acquiescence to the
ceremony in starker geopolitical terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to make him eat crow,'' said James Lilley, U.S.
ambassador to China during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably not happenstance that the Chinese government
announced the welcoming ceremony June 4 _ the ninth anniversary of
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the U.S. House voted 305-116 that Clinton
should not participate until the Chinese government apologizes for
the deadly crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contends that after agreeing to make the trip, he has
little say in the logistical aspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going to be a state visit to China, and I am going
to be the guest of the Chinese, then they should be designing the
terms of the arrival ceremony, not me,'' the president told a White
House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have accepted that Clinton's participation is
inevitable and have attempted to move the debate along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is what does he say when he gets there,'' said
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a leading opponent of Clinton's China
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that many Americans truly tuned in to China was
nine years ago at the time of the democracy demonstrations and
crackdown, and the dominant memory is the tanks of the People's
Liberation Army rolling into the square as soldiers began carrying
out the orders of the Chinese Communist leadership to disperse the
demonstrators by any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Lampton, who was formerly chief of the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations, said U.S. television networks devoted about
800 hours of coverage to the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of Americans, Tiananmen Square became the defining
experience about how to perceive China,'' said Richard Haass,
director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution and
a National Security Council staff member in the Bush
administration. ``And it took on a significance greater, in a
sense, than it deserved. ... The United States and China ... lost a
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   That is far too temperate an analysis of Clinton's visit for
Chinese directly affected by the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The red carpet he will walk on is soaked with the blood of our
relatives,'' Professor Ding Zilin, whose son was killed in the
massacre, told the South China Morning Post. ``Of course, the state
leaders of other countries get the same reception there, but the
United States is different as it is a superpower of the free world
and is supposed to uphold justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The cry has been taken up by Clinton critics in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer of the conservative Washington-based Family Research
Council said Clinton's plans to be received in Tinananmen Square
``insult democracy advocates around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty religious and human rights groups protested Clinton's
plan in a statement that told the president: ``You are bestowing
legitimacy to the ground where innocent blood was needlessly
shed.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that Clinton's visit, even with the
intense criticism, will serve to get the United States past the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of Clinton's China policy are having none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This post-Tiananmen issue is a myth,'' Pelosi said. ``Unless
prisoners of conscience are allowed to speak freely in China, we
are not in the post-Tiananmen era. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of dissidents from the crackdown remain in jail, and
some have recently been returned to prison, according to democracy
activists.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Chinese Democratic Justice Party said last
month that more than two dozen activists in one province were told
not to leave home during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Some China analysts contend it would have been difficult _ and
politically pointless _ to escape a ceremony in the square.
</P>
<P>
   If the object of the trip is to improve relations, asked
Lampton, ``why bother going if the first thing you're going to do
is insult the Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``To refuse to go,'' he added, ``not only would be insulting the
Chinese leadership but also insulting the Chinese people. They
wouldn't understand why he was doing it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Patrick Heron, 78, the British painter and art critic
whose retrospective exhibition opened at the Tate Gallery on
Thursday, is accomplished in many things, but following orders is
not among them.
</P>
<P>
   A pacifist and conscientious objector during World War II and a
crusader for environmental causes in Cornwall, where he has lived
and worked for most of his life, Heron has rarely taken pointers
about his art from anyone, no matter how influential. Yet that is
precisely what he said the critic Clement Greenberg once proposed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clem Greenberg was an amazingly manipulative so-and-so,'' said
the soft-spoken, white-haired Heron as he sat in the London
architectural office of his daughter Katharine Heron and her
husband, Julian Feary, during a recent visit. ``I was virtually the
first British painter or critic to praise the Abstract
Expressionists full blast, and when Clem came to England in 1954,
he grabbed my hand and said, `The only English critic.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Clem had a fiendish agenda,'' continued Heron, who wrote
for The New Statesman in London and Arts in New York. ``I have
letters from him beseeching me to wipe out everything two or three
feet from the edge of the canvas, bunch everything in the middle,
let it stand for a while, and then tell him how I felt about it. If
I had accepted his invitation and started painting according to his
precise formula, what would I have been producing _ a Gottlieb, a
Frankenthaler? I told him to go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The 80 canvases were selected by the critic David Sylvester and
are on view at the Tate through Sept. 6. They demonstrate in their
stylistic variety and surprising turns of direction that Heron _ a
self-styled explorer of ``the continent of color'' _ has
consistently run counter to prevailing tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was particularly intrigued by Rothko in the early 50s,''
Heron recalled. ``But I'm afraid he went into production, as a
great many Abstract Expressionists did. It's rather reprehensible.
Art should not be the making of a product. It's really
investigation, absolutely parallel to a scientific discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Heron is often cited as a member of the St. Ives School, a group
of modern artists who worked at midcentury in the Cornish resort
town of St. Ives, where he still maintains a beachfront studio. Yet
his sumptuous, color-saturated abstractions of organic shapes bear
little resemblance to the cool, monochromatic compositions of other
St. Ives figures like Ben Nicholson, Dame Barbara Hepworth and Naum
Gabo.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Heron much empathy for the work of his other countrymen.
``No British painter was ever my model,'' he asserted, ``although I
believe Constable was a very great artist indeed, with an immense
international influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his distaste for parochialism and the gritty, urban
subject matter of the School of London painters, Heron early on set
his sights across the English Channel. Typically, it was not the
colossus, Picasso, to whom he looked for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heroes were Matisse, Bonnard, Cezanne and Braque,'' he
said. ``During the war, I used to go to the Redfern Gallery in
London, the first place I ever showed, week after week to look at
this wonderful thing, `The Red Studio' by Matisse, which to my
amazement I had found in the downstairs room.'' It is now in the
Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnard is gigantic, too,'' Heron went on to say. ``The week
he died, in 1947, I was so moved that I wrote a long essay, one of
the themes of which was that Bonnard was not the fag-end of
Impressionism, but right in the center of totally major
20th-century painting.''
</P>
<P>
   According to John Elderfield, chief curator at large of the
Modern and a co-curator of its current Bonnard retrospective:
``Patrick was one of the first critics to see this, and it often is
a painter who has that perception. I do think that painters are
professional lookers, and Patrick is a builder of pictures in much
the same way Bonnard was.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Heron's visual acuity and independent streak can be traced to
his childhood as the son of artistically minded Fabian Socialist
parents. He now recalls that he knew he would be an artist at the
age of 3. A few years later his family moved to Welwyn Garden City,
the Hertfordshire new town based on utopian planning principles.
</P>
<P>
   Summers were spent at St. Ives and nearby at Zennor, where the
artist now lives in Eagle's Nest, a seaside house where he stayed
as a boy. His father, a silk manufacturer, hired modern artists and
architects to establish an avant-garde image for his firm, Cresta
Silks, and at 14 Patrick designed his first silk scarf for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Heron's lifelong leftist sympathies, he has never used
his art to express his political beliefs. ``I think the greatest
mistake ever made is to mix painting and politics,'' he said.
``Politics should be conducted in terms of action, and painting is
an entirely different matter. I love all images and hate all
symbols.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling extended to some of Heron's most successful
paintings, including a luminous series of horizontally striped
canvases _ on view in the Tate show _ from 1956-57. These and
others were clearly prompted by the intense light, majestic scale
and wild natural forms of Cornwall's coastal landscape and the sea
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But it was long forbidden to mention that affinity in the
artist's household. As Susanna Heron, herself an artist and the
younger daughter of the painter and his wife, Delia, who died in
1979, recalled: ``There was certainly a time when it was not
allowed to say there was a resemblance. I can remember coloring in
black-and-white postcards of the landscape around Zennor and
sending them to him anonymously. He looked at them and nothing was
ever said.''
</P>
<P>
   And though as a youth Heron won acclaim for his 1947 portrait of
T.S. Eliot, now in London's National Portrait Gallery, he has since
done personal likenesses only rarely. One recent return to the
genre came at the behest of his friend A.S. Byatt, the novelist and
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Heron painted her against a white background in the loose,
brightly colored calligraphic style that he has been pursuing for
the last decade (The work was added to the National Portrait
Gallery collection in April.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more compelling is the first charcoal sketch he made of
Ms. Byatt in 1995, also acquired by the gallery. Though the
subject's face is left blank in the drawing, the overall
resemblance is uncanny. One can understand when Ms. Byatt writes,
``It looked, I said, like a portrait of what it feels to look out
of my head from inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Another debut during this busy year for Heron is the permanent
installation of ``Big Painting Sculpture,'' a 68-by-40-foot metal
screen he designed in collaboration with his architect daughter and
son-in-law for a pedestrian walkway between two high-rise buildings
in the Pimlico section of London. It will be featured in the show
``Color in Space: Patrick Heron, Public Projects'' at the St. Ives
branch of the Tate from July 18 through Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to act as a wind baffle, the six-layer structure uses
yachting technology to rig and stabilize a collection of biomorphic
metal cutouts painted in the same vivid reds, blues, greens and
oranges Heron likes to wear together.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically lighted at night, ``Big Painting Sculpture'' will
become an exotic ornament to its drab setting, much as the artist's
early works brightened the postwar British art scene.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the London Tate exhibition catalogue by Sylvester and
Martin Gayford, a selection of the artist's essays, ``Painter as
Critic: Patrick Heron Writings, 1945-1997,'' edited by Mel Gooding,
is also being published this season. But the author is not eager to
be remembered primarily for his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought of myself as a critic,'' he said, ``I wrote
simply because I was so enraged at the low level of comprehension
of what I felt was excellent. I really hate to say this, but I love
art.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past, Internet insiders liked to use the phrase ``prime
real estate'' to describe the places online where people liked to
congregate. The new catch term is ``portal,'' which is often
invoked in talk about the online plans of companies like Netscape,
Infoseek, Lycos, Yahoo and Microsoft. Each of them wants to be the
entryway to the Net, the place where users pause and look around
before deciding where else to go once they have logged on.
</P>
<P>
   The word emerged as Internet developers realized that cyberspace
could have places equivalent to town squares, business districts or
malls by providing places where people could turn first by force of
habit.
</P>
<P>
   A portal is a place where people look for information. People
might turn to particular portals first because they are fairly
certain that they will find the information they want there. Yahoo,
for example, has become a popular portal because it provides
reliable and comprehensive listings of things on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has built a big portal business simply by programming
its browser to open at its home page by default. Users could set a
different first page or start with a blank one, but many stay with
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   At first thought, being the first Web page that pops up on a
viewer's screen each day doesn't seem to be particularly valuable
for the company providing the page. People use the verbs ``browse''
and ``surf'' to describe the way they move around the Internet, so
most users will probably not hang around that first page for long.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a mall, the Internet allows browsers to jump from a
portal to any other place on the Web, including another portal. So
stores and sites without ``prime real estate'' are not as hard to
reach as they might be in a large mall or town center.
</P>
<P>
   But even persuading Internet users to pause at a portal can be
quite valuable. The portals carry advertising, and revenue from
that already reaches into the millions of dollars. Companies like
Netscape and Microsoft quickly realized that these revenue streams
might be more valuable than sales of the browser programs
themselves. Netscape gives away its browser, but it says Excite
paid $70 million for a premium spot on Netscape's page.
</P>
<P>
   The banner advertisements that float across the top of pages can
be an ideal way to place brand names and announcements in front of
computer users. Advertisements for products are also common.
Microsoft is a major advertiser, for instance, of its serious
products like Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft also plays the portal game. The company
caught the eye of the Justice Department with its plan to grant
spots on its opening Windows screen, on the so-called channel bar.
This bar, one of the major new features of Internet Explorer 4.0,
appears on the desktop in an easy-to-reach position. It contains a
number of icons for Web sites, including a Walt Disney page and The
New York Times on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Parceling out this real estate raised questions about whether
Microsoft was using monopoly power to gain control of popular
content on the Internet. The channel bar, however, has not gathered
as much steam as other portals, and Microsoft announced plans in
March to drop the bar from the 5.0 version of Internet Explorer
around the same time that the Senate began inquiries into contracts
between Microsoft and the companies with space on the channel bar.
</P>
<P>
   Other portal owners are succeeding by looking for ways to make
money by steering people to preferred merchants. The Alta Vista
search engine, another popular site, offers people a chance to jump
immediately to Amazon's Web site and search for books related to
their Alta Vista search.
</P>
<P>
   That integration is valuable enough for Amazon to pay fees to
Alta Vista. Don Bradley, a spokesman for Compaq, the company that
bought Alta Vista when it bought Digital Equipment, said that Alta
Vista would get a commission for steering a customer to Amazon even
when the customer did not buy anything until a return visit later.
</P>
<P>
   Portals like Infoseek, Excite and Lycos began mainly as search
engines, and the search software can also be designed to make money
for a company. A search may return thousands, if not millions, of
hits _ lists of sites related to a given topic _ and each search
engine has some way to sort its findings.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista offers a service that, for $40, allows a person or
company to register a word, like Titanic, and arrange for a special
Web site to come to the top in a separate section of search results
when someone searches for that word. In this case, a search for
Titanic takes a browser to www.titanicmovie.com, a site that
promotes the movie. Advertising does not affect the order of the
rest of the search results.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rounds in the portal wars include adding new
information _ news, sports scores and other items _ intended to
draw people into the page and keep them coming back. Games are also
frequently offered as a lure. Internet-based games are burgeoning,
and some portals are giving them away. Yahoo, for instance, offers
poker game software that allows people to play against others in
the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Netscape's new version of its Netcenter portal, still being
tested, will present multiple pages with content tailored to
different markets. One, for instance, will offer a mixture of
business news and features for small businesses. The Netcenter
developers are redesigning the site in much the same way that
newspapers or magazines work to identify and attract potential
readers. If the readers show up, the advertisers will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people wonder what it will take to create large
portals that many people will want to visit on the Web. Many users
continue to enjoy the fragmented, eclectic and very homespun nature
of the Web. Several Web pages run by a single writer, like Matt
Drudge, are very popular and thus fairly powerful. But none have
the concentration of viewers that the major networks and newspapers
still have.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cleverest new portal may be the four buttons on
the new Compaq keyboards. If you push the Search button, the
computer will take you to the Alta Vista site, which brings in
advertising dollars to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of mutual back-scratching means that the world of
``real estate'' on the Web is starting to gain the flavor of land
deals in the real world. It may be only a matter of months before
someone remakes ``Chinatown,'' the movie about real estate
double-dealing in Los Angeles, and substitutes characters from
Silicon Valley.

guided tours of his former hell. The 76-year-old Aleksiejunas
escorts visitors around Lithuania's appallingly well-preserved KGB
prison, a lingering monument to the bleak, brutal days of the
Soviet Union. ``I felt ill when I came back here,'' he said of his
first glimpse of the prison in 1992, almost 50 years after his
incarceration. ``People who left this building after interrogation
here just wanted to see it torn down. But if you tore it down the
evidence would be gone.'' (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-CHICANOS _ MEXICO CITY _ The National Association for
Chicano and Chicana Studies holds a conference in Mexico City for
the first time, bringing together people on both sides of the
border who are linked by heritage yet often mutually misunderstood.
The June 24-27 meeting reflects Chicanos' fascination with Mexico's
Zapatista rebels, as well as scholars' ample research on
immigration, machismo, political power and gay identities. Also of
interest: the cultural similarities and differences between
Chicanos and Mexicans. At a press conference for Mexican
journalists to promote the conference, one cultural clash emerged
right from the start: Why, a puzzled journalist asked, was the
conference going to be held mostly in English? Don't Chicanos speak
Spanish? (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   AMISH _ NEW HOLLAND, Pa. _ Eli's grandfather reckons that the
Amish are like other folks. ``We believe the best environment for
the Plain People is the farm,'' he explained, standing in a
well-ordered woodshop near fertile fields that his family has
cultivated for six generations. ``So just like you will save and
bend over backwards to send your children to college, we will save
and bend over backwards to help our sons and daughters buy a
farm.'' The problem for Eli's grandfather _ who does not want to be
identified further because of church strictures _ and the 36,000
other Plain Sect disciples in picturesque Lancaster County is that
developers are encroaching on farmland they have tended since
William Penn welcomed their persecuted forebears nearly three

HOUSE VOTES TO BAR FDA FROM APPROVING ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Wednesday to bar the Food and Drug
Administration from spending federal money to test, develop or
approve any drug _ including the French abortion pill RU-486 _ that
would chemically induce abortion.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 223 to 202, lawmakers amended the fiscal 1999
agriculture spending bill to include the ban, then overwhelming
approved the $56 billion agriculture bill. Thirty-five Democrats
joined 188 Republicans in voting for the anti-abortion measure.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of abortion rights swiftly attacked the move, although
even the sponsor of the amendment, Rep. Tom A. Coburn, R-Okla.,
conceded it was unlikely to be approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to raise the level of level of debate on what
we're doing,'' Coburn, a physician, said in an interview. ``We're
spending federal dollars to figure out how to kill children ... We
ought to be spending the FDA's resources on things that improve
life, not take it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., told the House ``the job of the FDA
is to promote the health of all Americans. That includes unborn
children.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading opponent, Rep. Nita M. Lowey, said the amendment was
``broad and vague'' and could prohibit the development of new
contraceptive methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts ideology ahead of science and compromises women's
health ... This amendment would tie the FDA's hands, rendering it
absolutely helpless in its primary task _ to evaluate scientific
data,'' Lowey, D-N.Y., told the House.
</P>
<P>
   An Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., called the amendment ``one more
time when members of Congress act like they know more than the
scientists and experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking office in January 1993, President Clinton
lifted the import ban on RU-486. His order came on the 20th
anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court ruling that
established a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 has been available for nearly a decade in France and also
is used in Britain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Population Council, a nonprofit
research organization that focuses on reproductive health issues,
filed an application with the FDA in March 1996 to make the pill
available for women.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the FDA declared the drug safe and effective,
but said the agency needed details on how it would manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The Population Council initially had a Hungarian company ready
to manufacture the pill, but the company pulled out a year ago,
said Christina Horzepa, a spokeswoman for the group. Since then,
investors interested in producing the abortion pill have been
negotiating with companies to find a manufacturer, saying they are
optimistic they will bring the drug to market in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The French method involves taking two pills. The first, RU-486,
also known as mifepristone, loosens the uterine lining. That is
followed two days later with another pill called misoprostol, which
causes contractions. The pill causes an abortion for most women
within 24 hours after taking the second pill, but for others it may
take as long as two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood of America, said
Coburn's amendment was ``unethical and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more evidence of the anti-choice congressional
leadership's relentless agenda to make abortion less available,
less safe and less effective,'' she said.

   CHINA-ZHAO (Shanghai, China) _ In a striking act of political
defiance, Zhao Ziyang, China's former Communist Party chief,
challenges the nation's leaders to use President Clinton's visit as
an opportunity to admit that the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 was an
immense political blunder. Zhao, the silvery-haired ex-leader who
has been under house arrest since May, 1989, made his case in a
letter to the Party's Central Committee by arguing that only in a
reversal of the official verdict on the crushing of 1989's student
movement will the government be able to retain any legitimacy with
its people. By Seth Faison.

against Microsoft, it was merely a bump in the road as they head to
court again in September with a broader antitrust case against the
company. Yet antitrust experts said Wednesday that the
split-decision by the three-judge panel _ a majority opinion
written by a conservative and partial dissent opinion from a
liberal _ was both a big win for Microsoft and a reflection of
wider debate over how antitrust doctrine should apply to

COMPUTER INDUSTRY LURING STUDENTS INTO DROPPING OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Texas, Fla., Mass.)  (ps) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high-tech field, the fastest growing of the United States'
economy, has become so voracious in its hiring that computer
science departments across the country are losing graduate students
and, in growing numbers, undergraduates to an industry fueled by
vast sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty positions in computer science are going unfilled and
doctoral programs have seen a big drop-off in applications.
Moreover, students working toward master's and bachelor's degrees
are increasingly abandoning their studies for well-paying jobs in a
field whose wealthy stars, like Bill Gates, famously dropped out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts fear that fundamental research will decline and
that the next generation of American computer scientists will be
stunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we're eating our seed corn,'' said Peter J.
Denning, vice provost of George Mason University in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For many young people, a job paying from $30,000 to $60,000 a
year seems far more appealing than pursuing a degree whose value is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A degree is just a piece of paper with a gold stamp on it,''
said Jonah Blossom, 20, who left Santa Barbara City College after
one year to take a full-time, $30,000-a-year job as a computer
specialist at a nearby concern where a number of his bosses and
colleagues did not finish their studies. ``That paper isn't going
to help you find bugs in a system or create compelling Web sites.
That depends on your ability. My employers are not interested in
certificates or where I've been to school.''
</P>
<P>
   While other academic fields over the years have witnessed shifts
in talent away from universities _ it happened in biotechnology in
the 1980s _ there is no precedent to what is happening today in
computers both in the scale and in the challenge it poses to the
discipline. It is as if every college student with any athletic
ability suddenly faced the realistic prospect of a career with a
professional sports team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without wanting to sound hysterical, this is really changing
the shape of education in a fundamental way,'' said Guy Smith, who
runs the multimedia laboratory at Santa Barbara City College. ``You
hear of kids leaving high school and making almost six figures.
Recently we brought in 30 computer information officers and asked
them about entry-level skills. I didn't hear the word `degree' come
up very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Liemandt dropped out of Stanford after his junior year
and founded the Trilogy Development Group, a hugely successful
software marketing company in Austin, Texas, in 1989. Liemandt says
his company, like many others, simply does not care about an
applicant's university credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we interview two people and one has a 4.0 from MIT in
computer science and doesn't impress us in the interview,''
Liemandt said, ``and the other dropped out of some small college
and impressed us, we'd always hire the second guy.
</P>
<P>
   Computer science professors, in something of a state of shock,
are sharply divided over what is happening and over how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Most are warning that when the overheated market for programmers
and Web-site designers cools or shifts in emphasis, those who have
left their studies will be, in essence, laid-off blue-collar
workers without credentials, like telephone operators after digital
switching or auto workers after robotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is, make sure you aim to get yourself a career and
not just a first job,'' said Ellen F. Hartigan, vice president of
student affairs at Polytechnic University in New York who says her
students are being recruited for full-time jobs before getting
their degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our students are the first generation in their family
to go to college and they don't have the parental support that
encourages them to stay on and finish and go to graduate school,''
Ms. Hartigan said. ``These offers are very tempting. So we are now
much more proactive, teaching freshmen about career preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   At Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Fla., Richard
Newman, associate dean of engineering, says his institution is
trying to compromise with corporate raiders by urging cooperative
ventures whereby the companies pay for students to complete their
studies while they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had two or three freshmen go off to take jobs setting
up Web pages,'' Newman said. ``We're trying to find a solution to
end the competition between us and industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But some computer experts say that universities have failed to
keep computer science curriculums up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities have done such a bad job of providing what you
need to know that a B.A. in computer science is almost considered
worthless,'' asserted Allen Holub, an author and computer design
consultant in San Francisco. ``Many tenured professors came out of
math departments. Mathematicians make lousy programmers. They focus
on algorithms which are the underlying rules of some programs. But
the vast majority of programs today are not algorithm-based but
data-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Martin, a professor of computer and information
sciences at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, and a
member of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, acknowledges
that the gap between theory and practice has grown dangerously
large.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because of the growth of sophisticated new
computer languages, like Java, with which programmers can draw on a
prepackaged set of formulas and tools and simply plug them in,
without a need for understanding the underlying theory of computer
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curriculums are going to have to change. There is no question
about it,'' Martin said. ``Right now, we can't compete. You can
legitimately ask whether what we teach is as important as it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it is more of a hacker's world, and it is less obvious
that students need to know the fundamentals to function at a high
level. With the arrival of Java, they don't program in the same way
as in older languages.'' ``After a semester learning Java, a
student can already do an incredible amount,'' he continued. ``My
colleagues see their former students with a B.S. and stock options.
Maybe that's better than an M.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of well-paid, creative work without full academic
credentials in an exciting field is the result both of economic and
cultural factors.
</P>
<P>
   The American computer industry is exploding. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics projects a 108 percent increase in the need for systems
analysts, engineers and computer scientists from now until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are an estimated 933,000 jobs in the these fields,
and by 2006, the bureau estimates, that will rise to 1.9 million.
Yet the nation's computer science programs each year are graduating
only 25,000 students with bachelor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This projected gap is borne out by the experience of those in
career services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every one of the 1,600 students graduating this year from
Northeastern were computer majors, they would all have jobs,'' said
Carol S. Lyons, dean of career services at Northeastern University
in Boston. ``We're seeing signing bonuses of $7,000 to $9,000,
relocation offers, stock options and starting salaries in the high
30s to low 50s.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Avram Cheaney, 22, who grew up in West Virginia, quit
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and moved out to
California's Silicon Valley several months ago. He posted his
resume on the internet through a temporary computer employment
agency and got 25 calls. Today he earns $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can work anywhere,'' Cheaney said. ``Any company
that has computers needs people and with my experience I am
light-years ahead of many people still in school. Two years'
experience is all that is needed. You can't say `I've been a
Web-page designer for 10 years' because the field hasn't been
around that long. The younger generation can get a jump on
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction is the anti-conventional nature of an
industry, many of whose giants _ Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak,
the founders of Apple computers, in addition to Gates, _ are
college dropouts. Job opportunities at computer companies often
emphasize loose dress codes and strange hours as well as the
financial possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is how Trilogy, the Austin-based software
company, describes its ``company culture'' on its Web site:
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters at Trilogy? Results, results, results. The focus
is not on how many meetings you attend or that you show up for work
at 7 in the morning every day. What's more important is the value
you add to Trilogy and the experience you bring. As for work hours,
Trilogy believes in flexibility. It makes the most sense that
people work when they are most productive, and only you know when
that is.''
</P>
<P>
   It says that some employees dress fancy for work because they
want to while others ``wear a clean T-shirt and shoes when they
want to dress up,'' adding: ``Some work from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
others don't believe in the cruel and unusual abuse of alarm clocks
and never show their faces before lunch time.'' There is further
talk of huge bonuses and ``company boats, spontaneous trips to Las
Vegas, nights out on the town, trips to Hawaii, fully stocked
kitchens.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who left school to take jobs say they want to go
back to school, either part-time soon or full-time later, both for
long-term job security and the satisfaction of completing their
degrees. But their elders worry that by the time those former
students feel the need to return, it will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Beug, chairman of computer sciences at Cal Tech, put it
this way: ``I have students from 10 years ago saying, `Oh Jim, my
company just folded and I don't have my degree to make a new job
search.' Meanwhile, our curriculum has changed vastly from 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that these kids who haven't finished will last
about seven years on the job market. If they haven't learned to
learn and can't go sideways into management, what happens to
them?''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Norcross-based Hayes Corp. said Wednesday it had
renegotiated more favorable terms in a stock deal with several
investors. The modem maker also said it has a new chief financial
officer, Charles Marantz, 52, who succeeds Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The financial restructuring is an attempt to change terms of a
deal made with holders of about $42 million of the modem company's
convertible preferred stock. Those investors represent about 11
different funds. The cash was used for working capital when Hayes
went public in 1997 by merging with Access Beyond, a computer
networking company that was already public.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Howard, the company's chief executive, said Wednesday terms
had been reached with seven of those 11 funds, representing about
half the $42 million investment. The company has lawsuits pending
against the other investors, who have so far declined to accept the
company's offer to convert the preferred shares to common shares at
$9 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said the original deal needed to be renegotiated because
``the company feels that it was misled by the preferred
(investors).''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine, in its July 6 issue, calls the original
arrangement ``an ill-conceived deal last fall to raise desperately
needed working capital'' and said Hayes was ``in bad shape once
again.'' Howard said he disagreed with the article and many of its
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes stock hit an all-time low Wednesday at $2.62 1/2 but
closed at $3.31 1/4, up 12 1/2 cents. Howard said the initial
negative reaction came because the ``market wants it (the
renegotiation with preferred shareholders) fully resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes successfully emerged from bankruptcy in 1996 and at first
reported strong quarters of growth, but begin to falter as the
market for computer modems stagnated. Howard said the company's
hopes have been pinned to the promise of new Internet technology
such as cable TV modems and digital subscriber line technology used
by telephone companies.

   When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, Radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (8-5, 3.25; 1-0,
1.17 lifetime vs. Yankees) vs. LHP David Wells (9-2, 4.28; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A hard time for Neagle, who requested that his start be
moved up a day so that he can serve as a pallbearer Friday in the
funeral of a close family friend in Maryland. On top of that, he is
trying to recover the form that just a few weeks ago had delivered
him to a 7-1 record and 2.82 ERA. In the five starts since, Neagle
has given up 19 runs on 36 hits, including seven home runs in his
last 36 innings. He has been hurt by the big inning during that
stretch, giving up three or more runs in four single innings. His
last outing, at Montreal on Friday, was a disaster, as he yielded
eight runs before being pulled in the second inning. He is working
on three days rest for the first time this season and just the 12th
time in the last five years. He went 4-4 with a 3.04 ERA in those
starts and averaged 6 1/3 innings. Wells faced the Braves only once
in his half-season in the National League but it was a big night--
Game 3 of the 1995 NLCS when he started for Cincinnati. He lost 5-2
that night but shut out the Braves into the sixth, when Charlie
O'Brien hit a three-run homer.

 &HT;    Design won't strip neighborhood vision
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta announced plans
to move its new headquarters to the corner of 10th and Peachtree,
several urban enthusiasts in Midtown rolled their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, grand schemes had been planned for that block. An
urban retail-entertainment center. A mixed-use office, residential
and retail development. A new home for the Atlanta Symphony. A
central plaza for festivals and events.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal building?
</P>
<P>
   How in the world could one design a high-security federal
building that would not deaden potentially the most important
undeveloped block in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   The answer resonated on Wednesday. Leaders of the Midtown
Alliance agreed that the end result was the best they could hope
for given the Atlanta Fed's building requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Guynn, president of Atlanta's Federal Reserve, acknowledged
Wednesday that the design likely would not have been as sensitive
to the community had it not been for an active and agressive
planning process known as Blueprint Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   When the Federal Reserve first announced plans to move its
headquarters from downtown to 10th Street, Midtown Alliance leaders
already had signed on to an elaborate, grassroots process to plan
the commercial corridor along Peachtree Street. It hired urban
designer Anton Nelessen to help coordinate the community's vision
for Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   In a tour of the neighborhood in February 1997, Nelessen voiced
what others were saying privately, saying, ``it is really a
miserable place to put that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Guynn's first reaction was anger. But he decided to translate
that criticism into a challenge to show that the Atlanta Fed could
be a good neighbor in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were clearly influenced to go the extra mile or the extra
10 miles,'' Guynn said. ``It was important to me that (Nelessen),
among others, see we were able to do something that he didn't
believe we could do, that we could try to do something that he
could be proud of as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelessen, who is based in Princeton, N.J., Wednesday had not yet
seen the Atlanta Fed design, but he was delighted to hear Guynn's
comments. ``Excellent,'' he said. ``It proves that the whole notion
of the community planning process can have an impact on the
corporate community.''
</P>
<P>
   Midtown leaders who had seen the plan were especially
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' said Harald Hansen, chairman of Blueprint
Midtown and retired chairman of First Union-Georgia. ``It was
absolutely magnificent, recognizing what they do, and be able to
blend that into what Blueprint was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the big and little touches that impressed Susan Mendheim,
president of the Midtown Alliance. The trees on top of the parking
deck. The public space along Peachtree Street. A money museum off
the main entrance where the public is welcome. The commitment by
the Fed to the streetscape around the block _ closely spaced tree
plantings, light fixtures, wide sidewalks. All that conformed the
vision described in Blueprint Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Mendheim also credited Guynn for participating in an all-day
workshop to plan the neighborhood, for serving on the Midtown
Alliance board and for wanting to please the community with a
sensitive building design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables us to point to the very center of Midtown and say,
`This is the standard,''' said Mendheim, adding that she has
developers coming to her office every day wanting to see the plans
and develop projects that fit the vision for Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely a living plan,'' Hansen said. ``We are
putting size and substance to it every day.''

 &HT;    CLINTON BEGINS MAKE-OR-BREAK CHINA TRIP
 &HT;    With CHINA-ODDITIES-$ADV25; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV25
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT, MARCIA KUNSTEL and BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heaping contention upon controversy, President
Clinton kicked off a nine-day China tour Wednesday by delaying his
departure to assail the country's harsh press controls, saying
Beijing is waging ''a losing battle'' in its historic attempt to
manage an open economy with a repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic gesture sharply at odds with the tone White House
aides had hoped to set for his first-ever trip to China, Clinton
criticized Beijing during a hastily-called White House interview
with three journalists China has barred from covering the
president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   He told the reporters _ two Americans and one Indian, all of
whom work for Radio Free Asia _ that China had ''made a mistake''
in revoking their visas over the weekend, and he said the move
illustrated a far broader chasm between the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a losing battle to try to keep ideas that are contrary to
official dogma out of the public debate,'' Clinton told the
reporters. ''Oppressive government, in the end, will be resisted by
people and, in the end, is inconsistent with developing a free
economy. You can't say, 'We're going to have a free economy but
we're going to try to keep controls on what people know, what they
hear, what they can say.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks during a 45-minute Oval Office
interview, while the presidential helicopter, Marine One, waited on
the South Lawn to take Clinton, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and their daughter, Chelsea, to Andrews Air Force Base for their
Air Force One flight to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to arrive Thursday in the ancient city of Xian,
becoming the first American president to visit China since troops
crushed a democracy movement near Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Xian, with the whole world watching, nine of the
most pivotal days in Clinton's presidency are starting to unfold on
Thursday to the sound of Chinese gongs.
</P>
<P>
   Future historians will measure Clinton's every step in China to
gauge whether this is a journey into greatness or a lame duck's
descent into mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders have agreed to make a joint effort to establish
a constructive relationship between the countries for the next
century,'' said the official Chinese Xinhua news agency as Clinton
was aboard Air Force One to China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is startling so far is that so little about the final
outcome of the summit is pre-determined, even as the Chinese
unfurled a carpet as long as two football fields to greet the first
American president to visit the People's Republic of China in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   The question marks are big ones:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will Clinton be able to make a case for human rights and
religious freedoms without irrevocably angering his Chinese hosts,
whose bottom-line objective is to avoid being humiliated'' on what
they view as internal'' matters?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the two sides hammer out an agreement to pinch off the
threat of nuclear catastrophe under the exigencies of late-night
summit negotiations, as often happens in these high-level meetings,
or will they fail to bridge the final gaps??
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the volatile issue of Taiwan, which the Chinese side has
put at the top of the agenda in recent days, disrupt what both the
Americans and Chinese had hoped would be a smooth summit pushing
bilateral relations up to a new level of cooperation?
</P>
<P>
   Once the breathtaking pageantry of Thursday's Emperor's
Welcome'' in this ancient walled city is finished, Clinton's
journey will get far tougher. Events immediately preceding
Clinton's expected arrival here on Thursday night China time (7:30
a.m. EDT), did not bode well for smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments _ a pointed last-minute rebuttal to Beijing's
decision to ban the journalists _ followed weeks in which he has
sought to parry the protests of human rights activists, many of
whom insist he should not go to China, others of whom have asked
that he meet with political dissidents there. Clinton has
repeatedly stressed the need for Washington and Beijing to build on
common ground across a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from
efforts to contain nuclear weapons and combat global crime to
stabilizing the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Radio Free Asia flap, however, underscored the continuing
differences between the two Pacific giants and the lingering
imperfections in their often troubled relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows you the downside of the government over in Beijing,''
said Radio Free Asia's executive editor, Dan Southerland, former
Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post. '' Despite all the
talk of change, and they have opened up in many ways . . . there is
still a lot of information that is not available to the Chinese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Free Asia is funded by the U.S. government in an effort to
counter China's state-controlled media with alternative news
oriented toward China and often laced with critiques of Beijing's
repressive human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   With strong backing from Clinton, the service began broadcasting
across China _ in the local languages of Mandarin, Cantonese and
Tibetan - in 1996, over the objections of the Chinese government,
which regards the service as American propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese government has always taken particular offense
with my support of creating Radio Free Asia, because they believe
that we did it for the purpose of undermining the government of
China,'' said Clinton, adding ''we think everybody ought to have
free access to ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Radio Free Asia reporters _ Arin Basu, an Indian; Patricia
Hindman, an American citizen, and Feng Xiaoming, also an American
citizen _ were assigned to cover Clinton's trip to China, along
with nearly 400 other Washington-based journalists and media
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, however, China revoked the visas it had issued
to the Radio Free Asia reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they made a big mistake,'' Clinton told the banned
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   With freedom in Tibet an issue gaining more adherents in
America, a lobbying group did manage to get into China on tourist
visas Wednesday and was awaiting the presidential entourage in
Beijing to monitor'' the visit and assure the media doesn't forget
the charges that Tibetan religious and cultural freedoms are being
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know the limits of Chinese government tolerance for
groups such as ours, but we think it is important to be here during
the summit,'' said John Ackerly, president of the International
Campaign for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The American side also continued receiving a spate of letters
from human rights groups and individual Chinese, some of whom have
asked Clinton's help in getting their relatives freed from prison
or labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of detained dissident Liu Nianchun told Beijing-based
journalists she had written a letter to Clinton asking him to pay
her a visit to discuss her husband's case.
</P>
<P>
   Chu Hailan, called on Clinton to push the Chinese government to
free my husband so he can receive medical treatment.'' However, the
Clinton administration was evidently still torn over whether
Clinton should meet dissidents during his China visits.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, two Taiwanese groups fearing Clinton somehow
will accede to China's pressures to help it regain control of the
break-away island province demonstrated on Wednesday at the
American Institute in Taiwan, where U.S. interests are represented.
One banner read ``Opposing selling-out Taiwan at the Clinton-Jiang
Summit.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Simply by making this such a long trip, and by heralding it as
the emergence of a new and important relationship for the 21st
Century, Clinton created his own high-stakes game.
</P>
<P>
   The visit may be just as crucial for the political fortunes of
China's President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the 51-year old Clinton in promoting better
Sino-U.S. relations has been touted throughout the media in the
run-up to Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   A new photo book featuring flattering pictures and highlights of
Jiang's trip to America last October was announced sold out last
week the day after it went on sale.
</P>
<P>
   And Chinese television reported Wednesday that videos of a
documentary about the visit, which proclaimed its significance and
aired for the first time last Friday, already are on back-order.
The news item did not mention that Clinton, the guy standing next
to Jiang in various shots, is arriving on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a gush of publicity has aired in recent days about the first
American presidential visit in nearly a decade, and the general
message beaming out to the Chinese public is that this relationship
with America is important. The rest of the message is that Jiang
has worked wonders to bring relations to this point.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the state-run newspaper Market Economic News
compared the significance of the Clinton visit to the two previous
milestones in Sino-U.S. relations -- President Richard Nixon's
visit that ended hostile relations between the two nations in 1972,
and President Jimmy Carter's move to finally end formal diplomatic
ties with Taiwan and recognize mainland China instead.
</P>
<P>
   Not all factions of political China are convinced that the bold
economic changes Jiang has permitted and the budding friendship
with America are the correct routes to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative bloc in the high councils of China's communist
party will be ready to pounce if Clinton steps out of what they
consider to be in line, particularly on the human rights issues the
American leader is being pressured to address by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and other leading officials in the last few days have
focussed on two areas they want Clinton to address: a stronger
statement that America will not accept any independence initiatives
by Taiwan, and elimination of barriers to China's economic and
trade growth.
</P>
<P>
   In China's sometimes mercuric political atmosphere, it is hard
to predict what might befall Jiang if the American side proves
embarrassingly balky on those issues. What answer Clinton gives is
less important than how he gives it.

   MICROSOFT-REACTION (Undated) Antitrust regulators said Wednesday
they are proceeding at full steam in their litigation against
Microsoft, despite an appeals court ruling Tuesday that many
observers said torpedoed their case. The regulators say they've
raised several issues that are unaffected by the ruling, involving
Microsoft's exclusive contracts with online content providers and
computer makers. Analysts acknowledge that those issues are
separate, but say the question the appeals court did address --
Microsoft's strategy of integrating its Internet browser into
Wondows -- was so important that the broader case might be
crippled. Still, they say, Microsoft must be careful not to act
rashly between now and the Sept. 8 trial, or it could squander some
of the gains it made with Tuesday's ruling.

   WHEAT-NORTHWEST (Washington, D.C.) The House Wednesday voted
373-48 to approve an agriculture spending bill that would change
the nation's nuclear nonproliferation policy to exempt Northwest
wheat from the sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan. The
exemption can not come soon enough for Washington state wheat
growers, whose largest market is Pakistan. Wheat farmers were
already reeling from record low prices when Pakistan detonated
nuclear weapons last month, triggering automatic sanctions that
included a ban on the agricultural credits Pakistan uses to buy up
about 37 percent of the wheat grown in Washington.

most pivotal days in Clinton's presidency are starting to unfold on
Thursday to the sound of Chinese gongs.
</P>
<P>
   Future historians will measure Clinton's every step in China to
gauge whether this is a journey into greatness or a lame duck's
descent into mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders have agreed to make a joint effort to establish
a constructive relationship between the countries for the next
century,'' said the official Chinese Xinhua news agency as Clinton
was aboard Air Force One to China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is startling so far is that so little about the final
outcome of the summit is pre-determined, even as the Chinese
unfurled a carpet as long as two football fields to greet the first
American president to visit the People's Republic of China in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   The question marks are big ones:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will Clinton be able to make a case for human rights and
religious freedoms without irrevocably angering his Chinese hosts,
whose bottom-line objective is to avoid being humiliated'' on what
they view as internal'' matters?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the two sides hammer out an agreement to pinch off the
threat of nuclear catastrophe under the exigencies of late-night
summit negotiations, as often happens in these high-level meetings,
or will they fail to bridge the final gaps??
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the volatile issue of Taiwan, which the Chinese side has
put at the top of the agenda in recent days, disrupt what both the
Americans and Chinese had hoped would be a smooth summit pushing
bilateral relations up to a new level of cooperation?
</P>
<P>
   Once the breathtaking pageantry of Thursday's Emperor's
Welcome'' in this ancient walled city is finished, Clinton's
journey will get far tougher. Events immediately preceding
Clinton's expected arrival here on Thursday night China time (7:30
a.m. EDT), did not bode well for smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments _ a pointed last-minute rebuttal to Beijing's
decision to ban the journalists _ followed weeks in which he has
sought to parry the protests of human rights activists, many of
whom insist he should not go to China, others of whom have asked
that he meet with political dissidents there. Clinton has
repeatedly stressed the need for Washington and Beijing to build on
common ground across a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from
efforts to contain nuclear weapons and combat global crime to
stabilizing the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Radio Free Asia flap, however, underscored the continuing
differences between the two Pacific giants and the lingering
imperfections in their often troubled relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows you the downside of the government over in Beijing,''
said Radio Free Asia's executive editor, Dan Southerland, former
Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post. '' Despite all the
talk of change, and they have opened up in many ways . . . there is
still a lot of information that is not available to the Chinese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Free Asia is funded by the U.S. government in an effort to
counter China's state-controlled media with alternative news
oriented toward China and often laced with critiques of Beijing's
repressive human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   With strong backing from Clinton, the service began broadcasting
across China _ in the local languages of Mandarin, Cantonese and
Tibetan - in 1996, over the objections of the Chinese government,
which regards the service as American propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese government has always taken particular offense
with my support of creating Radio Free Asia, because they believe
that we did it for the purpose of undermining the government of
China,'' said Clinton, adding ''we think everybody ought to have
free access to ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Radio Free Asia reporters _ Arin Basu, an Indian; Patricia
Hindman, an American citizen, and Feng Xiaoming, also an American
citizen _ were assigned to cover Clinton's trip to China, along
with nearly 400 other Washington-based journalists and media
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, however, China revoked the visas it had issued
to the Radio Free Asia reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they made a big mistake,'' Clinton told the banned
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   With freedom in Tibet an issue gaining more adherents in
America, a lobbying group did manage to get into China on tourist
visas Wednesday and was awaiting the presidential entourage in
Beijing to monitor'' the visit and assure the media doesn't forget
the charges that Tibetan religious and cultural freedoms are being
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know the limits of Chinese government tolerance for
groups such as ours, but we think it is important to be here during
the summit,'' said John Ackerly, president of the International
Campaign for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The American side also continued receiving a spate of letters
from human rights groups and individual Chinese, some of whom have
asked Clinton's help in getting their relatives freed from prison
or labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of detained dissident Liu Nianchun told Beijing-based
journalists she had written a letter to Clinton asking him to pay
her a visit to discuss her husband's case.
</P>
<P>
   Chu Hailan, called on Clinton to push the Chinese government to
free my husband so he can receive medical treatment.'' However, the
Clinton administration was evidently still torn over whether
Clinton should meet dissidents during his China visits.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, two Taiwanese groups fearing Clinton somehow
will accede to China's pressures to help it regain control of the
break-away island province demonstrated on Wednesday at the
American Institute in Taiwan, where U.S. interests are represented.
One banner read ``Opposing selling-out Taiwan at the Clinton-Jiang
Summit.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Simply by making this such a long trip, and by heralding it as
the emergence of a new and important relationship for the 21st
Century, Clinton created his own high-stakes game.
</P>
<P>
   The visit may be just as crucial for the political fortunes of
China's President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the 51-year old Clinton in promoting better
Sino-U.S. relations has been touted throughout the media in the
run-up to Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   A new photo book featuring flattering pictures and highlights of
Jiang's trip to America last October was announced sold out last
week the day after it went on sale.
</P>
<P>
   And Chinese television reported Wednesday that videos of a
documentary about the visit, which proclaimed its significance and
aired for the first time last Friday, already are on back-order.
The news item did not mention that Clinton, the guy standing next
to Jiang in various shots, is arriving on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a gush of publicity has aired in recent days about the first
American presidential visit in nearly a decade, and the general
message beaming out to the Chinese public is that this relationship
with America is important. The rest of the message is that Jiang
has worked wonders to bring relations to this point.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the state-run newspaper Market Economic News
compared the significance of the Clinton visit to the two previous
milestones in Sino-U.S. relations -- President Richard Nixon's
visit that ended hostile relations between the two nations in 1972,
and President Jimmy Carter's move to finally end formal diplomatic
ties with Taiwan and recognize mainland China instead.
</P>
<P>
   Not all factions of political China are convinced that the bold
economic changes Jiang has permitted and the budding friendship
with America are the correct routes to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative bloc in the high councils of China's communist
party will be ready to pounce if Clinton steps out of what they
consider to be in line, particularly on the human rights issues the
American leader is being pressured to address by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and other leading officials in the last few days have
focussed on two areas they want Clinton to address: a stronger
statement that America will not accept any independence initiatives
by Taiwan, and elimination of barriers to China's economic and
trade growth.
</P>
<P>
   In China's sometimes mercuric political atmosphere, it is hard
to predict what might befall Jiang if the American side proves
embarrassingly balky on those issues. What answer Clinton gives is
less important than how he gives it.

PARAGUAY'S VICTORY OVER NIGERIA SENDS SHATTERED SPAIN SQUAD HOME  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ Spain Wednesday became the first great
soccer-playing nation to bow out of the World Cup as even a 6-1
victory over Bulgaria proved inadequate to secure qualification for
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The shattered expression of veteran goalkeeper Andoni
Zubizarreta, and the tears of midfielder Fernando Hierro, caught
the agony of a proud nation that has never managed to match the
countless victories of its mythical Real Madrid and Barcelona clubs
in the supreme test of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Spain paid for a terrible start to the tournament. After its 3-2
defeat to Nigeria and and a 0-0 draw with Paraguay, the team was
was no longer master of its own fate Wednesday, knowing that even a
convincing win would be inadequate if Paraguay beat Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what tiny Paraguay did, winning 3-1 against a
Nigerian side that had already qualified for the second round and
fielded several substitutes. The victory meant that Paraguay, and
not Spain, joined Nigeria in the last sixteen and will meet hosts
France in the elimination phase of the competition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saved our pride tonight,'' the Spanish coach Javier
Clemente said. ``But the defeat to Nigeria had a strong
psychological impact, and after that we struggled. What can I say?
Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite qualifying for the World Cup ten times, and often
starting among the favorites, Spain has never managed to do better
than a fourth place in the 1950 tournament in Brazil. Since
Clemente took over in 1992, Spain has lost only four times in 54
matches, but has not been able to shake its World Cup jinx.
</P>
<P>
   It was a match that increasingly took on a surreal quality as
the teams became aware that, whatever the result, they were both
going home. For Bulgaria, which reached the semifinal of the 1994
World Cup in the United States, the game clearly marked the end of
an era as veteran players, including star striker, Hristo
Stoichkov, were substituted by the team's visibly angry coach.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset in France, Bulgaria has looked slow,
disorganized and ill-tempered, a team in visible decline. Wednesday
was no exception, and Spain quickly took advantage of the Bulgarian
disarray. The Spanish side was lifted by a glittering display from
Barcelona striker Luis Enrique, a player of unusual mobility and
vision who will now be denied a chance to make a lasting impact on
the tournament. Moving into the left side of the penalty-box in the
sixth minute, he was brought down. Fernando Hierro converted the
resulting penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, Luis Enrique burst onto a pass from
Etxeberria, brushed off two challenges and cooly slipped the ball
past the Bulgarian goalkeeper. In his defiant howl of jubilation,
and the accompanying raised fist, all Spain's frustration at its
initial failings was evident.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in the match, the Spanish players clearly believed
they were set for qualification as the Nigeria-Paraguay game, being
played at the same time, was tied. Their elation, and relief, were
evident _ but fragile. Bulgaria, having tied and lost its first two
games, tried to fight back and were denied what looked like a
legitimate penalty just before halftime, when substitute Luboslav
Penev was brought down as he rounded Zubizarreta. But, in one of
many controversial decisions during this World Cup, the referee
denied Bulgaria's heated claims. Spain dominated play in the second
half, adding a third goal from the young Real Madrid striker
Francisco Morientes in the 55th minute. But soon after, word that
Paraguay had taken the lead against Nigeria clearly began to filter
onto the field, and even three more goals for Spain could not lift
the team's spirits. Morientes scored again in the 81st minute, and
substitute Kiko added two more in the 88th minute and in injury
time. Bulgaria managed one response, when striker Emil Kostadinov
blasted the ball past Zubizarreta in the 58th minute.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the end, the game had become an empty shell, a
parody of a match being played out by two eliminated teams.
Although Spanish officials privately expressed anger at Nigeria's
decision to field a second-rate side against Paraguay, they knew
that in the end they had only themselves to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In this midst of the drama, Zubizarreta stood out as a deeply
touching figure. It was his terrible mistake against Nigeria in
Spain's first game that allowed Nigeria to equalize and go on to
win the game. The 36-year-old goalkeeper and captain was faultless
Wednesday night, but it was too late for him and for Spain. In all
likelihood _ and he knew it _ this was Zubizarreta's last World
Cup.

REFEREES AT WORLD CUP ADHERING TO DEMAND THEY GET TOUGHER  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Joseph Blatter, the new president of FIFA,
soccer's international governing body, had a message for the
referees several hours before Cameroon was beaten by Italy last
week: they needed to get tougher.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after Cameroon's World Cup came to an end against
Chile in another flurry of red cards, yellow cards and questionable
referee's judgements, its coach Claude Le Roy had a message for
Blatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he should stick to administrative duties,'' Le Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   Refereeing has been a contentious subject for as long as
organized soccer has existed, but the issue has taken on new
urgency in this World Cup, where referees have reached into their
shirt pockets and scribbled names in their notebooks at a historic
clip.
</P>
<P>
   After 36 first-round games in France, the men in black had shown
15 red cards, which signify automatic expulsions. In 1994, when the
last World Cup finals were held in the United States and dangerous
tackling was already being actively discouraged, referees handed
out a total of 15 red cards in the entire tournament, which
comprised 52 matches. The number of yellow cards, or cautions, is
also on the rise compared to the last World Cup, with an average of
3.61 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think FIFA has insisted on this, and the referees are trying
to comply,'' said French captain Didier Deschamps. ``But it's not
easy for them. They don't want us finishing our matches with seven
playing against eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Red cards have not been the only topic generating heat in
conversations in the world's living and board rooms. Debates over
penalty kicks are to soccer what debates over pass interference are
to the NFL, but there has been more grist than usual for debate in
France.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of this competition, referee Lucien
Bouchardeau of Niger awarded Italy a penalty kick against Chile in
the 85th minute after defender Ronaldo Fuentes' right fist got in
the way of a ball kicked by Roberto Baggio. Fuentes' hand-ball
appeared unintentional, but Bouchardeau opted for the hard line.
Italy salvaged a draw, and back in the Chilean village of Glorias
Navales de Vina del Mar, local police said that a 23-year-old named
Leopoldo Oses Lagunas got into an argument with his uncle about the
call and was stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   After Cameroon drew with Chile on Tuesday, when an apparent goal
by goalkeeper Francois Omam-Biyik was wiped out by a questionable
foul called on Patrick Mboma, some white-owned shops were attacked
in the Cameroon capital of Yaounde in protest. Two Cameroon players
also were given red cards in that match. Soccer can be serious
business, and the fact that another controversial late penalty kick
allowed Norway to defeat Brazil on Tuesday and knock Morocco out of
the second round did not improve the mood of Joseph Owona,
Cameroon's minister of sport, who attributed it all to
discrimination against Africa.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper dismissed the idea of any conspiracy
among the referees and said that ``no one had officially complained
about the refereeing.'' Nonetheless, Denmark did write to FIFA to
complain after two of its players were given red cards against
South Africa on a day when five red cards were awarded in only two
matches.
</P>
<P>
   What quickly became known as ``Red Thursday'' came the day after
Blatter said referees were not sanctioning tackles from behind
consistently. Michel Platini, the co-president of the French
Organizing Committee who will soon join Blatter at FIFA, already
had said, ``those referees who don't apply the rules will be sent
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement to crack down on dangerous defensive play is hardly
new. The yellow card was introduced in 1970 to provide another
means of punishing those who consistently flouted the rules, and
the push for further change began after the 1990 World Cup finals
in Italy, where Diego Maradona and other creative players spent
much of their month being hacked at from all angles. FIFA formed a
task force, composed of players, coaches and journalists, which
proposed new rules to make the game more offensive and attractive.
The movement gathered speed with the retirement of Marco Van
Basten, a Dutchman who was once considered the world's finest
striker and whose career ended before age 30 because of a series of
leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Former FIFA president Joao Havelange and many other
administrators, including Blatter, were convinced that Van Basten
had been victimized by too many tackles from behind. Referees in
1994 received explicit instructions to ``protect the player who
wants to play from the players who enter the field to only
destroy.'' That meant awarding red cards for dangerous tackling,
and though the number of goals increased in the United States,
Blatter, then secretary general, felt the right balance had yet to
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the laws of soccer have not changed since the last
World Cup. Tackles from behind and tackles that physically
jeopardize an opponent were subject to a red card in 1994, just as
they are now. What has changed is FIFA's tone and desire to see its
laws more strictly enforced. The question is when referees can give
players the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of mixed signals out there,'' said Cameroon
defender Rigobert Song. ``I can sense some confusion on the
referee's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Platini criticizes many referees for not being able ``to feel
the flow of the game'' and has called for the professionalization
of the refereeing corps, which is still made up, even at the elite
level, of part-time employees, most of whom have other jobs to
supplement their income. He also maintains that the current system,
whereby a referee from each competing nation is given a spot int
the World Cup, is equitable but not effective. A referee from
Italy, for example, which has one of the world's strongest leagues,
has had more experience judging soccer at the speed and level at
which it is played in the World Cup than someone from Saudi Arabia,
Iran or, for that matter, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth there are great differences in level between them,''
Platini said. ''The first two matches of this World Cup really
started well, and after that it got bad. We only should put the
best in the World Cup, even if it penalizes some countries.''
</P>
<P>
   There also have been calls for the use of video to judge vital
sequences, like whether a ball has crossed the goal-line or whether
a penalty kick should be awarded. That is a controversial concept
in a conservative sport, but not as controversial as the idea of
adding a second referee on the field to help cover more of the
action.

 FRANCE URGES ALLIES TO DEFINE PLAN FOr AUTONOMY FOR KOSOVO  
(See also KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ France called Wednesday for an international plan to
restore autonomy to Kosovo province in Serbia, with the threat of
NATO military intervention if Serbian authorities did not quickly
agree to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Contingency planning intensified at NATO headquarters in
Brussels on Wednesday, Allied diplomats said, as special U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke met with Albanian leaders in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   His meeting came a day after he pressed Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to stop Serbian attacks and resume political
talks with the rebels. Serbia and Montenegro are the last republics
remaining in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials are also meeting this week with Serbian
authorities to try to get talks restarted.
</P>
<P>
   A top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, said
in Brussels on Wednesday, ``It's difficult to talk when ethnic
cleansing is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO Secretary General Javier Solana warned Rugova that the
Allies did not support independence, which is the rebels' goal.
Kosovo had autonomy within the Yugoslav federation until Milosevic,
then president of Serbia, revoked it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Some 90 percent of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian, and
with more than a third of the province now controlled by rebels,
French officials said, they fear events could quickly spin out of
control and spread fighting to Albania and Macedonia. Both
countries have called for NATO intervention to prevent a widening
of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to me the right moment for the international
community to define a statute of genuine autonomy for Kosovo,''
said French President Jacques Chirac at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday
morning. ``That is necessary to restart negotiations between the
two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also said only ``very firm action by the international
community,'' including the threat of military force, could break
the cycle of violence in Kosovo as it did in Bosnia three years
ago, after years of ineffective United Nations peacekeeping action
there.
</P>
<P>
   But he said France continued to believe that a mandate from the
U.N. Security Council would be needed before NATO could go into
action in Kosovo. Both Russia and China, permanent members of the
Security Council with the right of veto, oppose military
intervention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russia, the United States, France, Germany, Italy and Britain,
the ``contact group,'' issued a call in London on June 12 for
Serbia to stop its attacks, withdraw its military forces and resume
talks with ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo, or face the
possibility of NATO action. Some 200 to 300 civilians have been
killed by Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin the following
week, Milosevic said he would start the talks but he did not agree
to withdraw his forces. The 16 nations of NATO continued to draw up
military plans, and Allied ambassadors in Brussels ordered that the
plans be ready to be carried out within 24 hours of a political
decision to go ahead, some officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the planning covered options from
large-scale air strikes against Serbian air defenses and other
strategic sites all over Yugoslavia, through moving peacekeeping
troops or monitors onto the border between Albania and Kosovo.
Another option, the officials said, was simply to stage another
demonstration of air power like the one held over Albania and
Macedonia last week to try to intimidate Serb commanders.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that Serbian forces had apparently sealed
off much of the Albanian border and that only a dozen refugees from
Kosovo a day had been seen moving across, compared with hundreds a
day earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   France, which has backed the military planning, pressed for as
wide a range of options as possible and resisted NATO military
authorities who urged a quick, heavy series of air strikes as the
only action that would impress the Serbs, French officials said.

NEW EVIDENCE THAT GERMANY TRIED TO WAGE GERM WARFARE IN WORLD WAR
I 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It appeared to be a harmless lump of sugar, albeit a lump of
sugar dating from World War I. But when scientists examined it they
found living anthrax spores, apparently placed there 80 years ago
by a Germany intent on disrupting the Allies' horse-and
reindeer-drawn supply lines across northern Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Their analysis of the lump and its shadowy history, which they
describe in the current issue of the journal Nature, illuminates
one of the few confirmed instances of the use of germ weapons in
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The anthrax microbe is one of the most common agents of germ
warfare and terrorism. It causes an infectious disease of wild and
domesticated animals, including cattle and sheep, and can also
strike humans with an often fatal illness.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have often said Germany engaged in widespread germ
warfare in World War I, especially against Allied horses, which
were critical to many aspects of the war effort. But the evidence
was usually sketchy, and Germany often denied the reports
vehemently.
</P>
<P>
   The new detective work, by four scientists from the British
germ-defense unit and the Norwegian military, began when the
curator of a police museum in Trondheim, Norway, found in an
archive a bottle with two sugar lumps. An attached note translated,
``A piece of sugar containing anthrax bacilli, found in the luggage
of Baron Otto Karl von Rosen, when he was apprehended in Karasjok
in January 1917, suspected of espionage and sabotage.''
</P>
<P>
   The curator inspected the lumps and found that each was pierced
by a small hole. One hole contained a tiny sealed glass tube.
Alarmed, he sent the exhibition to Norwegian defense authorities,
whose scientists set in motion the detailed analysis.
</P>
<P>
   First, in a cabinet that had been carefully sterilized, the
glass tube was broken open and its contents cultured, the
scientists report in Nature. With some delicate prompting, germs
grew and multiplied. Their identification as Bacillus anthracis was
confirmed by two separate methods, including one that amplifies and
examines the molecular structure of an organism's genetic material,
or DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proved possible,'' the article said, ``to revive a few
surviving organisms from the brink of extinction after they had
been stored, without any special precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax spores are known to survive up to centuries.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing question, the scientists said, is what the baron,
``a Swedish-German-Finnish aristocrat,'' and his colleagues
intended to do with the anthrax. Later, after the baron had been
expelled to Sweden as a result of diplomatic pressure, a belated
inspection of his baggage produced bottles of the deadly poison
curare, microbial cultures and 19 sugar lumps.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the tested lump was the only surviving weapon in
that small arsenal of germ warfare. The scientists say the baron's
mysterious companions admitted that they had been organized by the
Germans to sabotage war equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And the germs? The scientists say Berlin had approved a
microbial assault on reindeer used for sledging British arms across
northern Norway. And local newspapers of the day were convinced
that the deadly sugar cubes were also used to poison horses
involved in war transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grinding of the sugar and its glass insert between the
molar teeth of horses would probably result in a lethal
infection,'' the scientists wrote, though it is unknown whether
such killing was ever attempted or successful.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists added that it is unclear whether reindeer eat
sugar lumps.

SKIP AWAY IS IN THE STRETCH FOR $10 MILLION IN EARNINGS  
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sonny Hine sat in the little office in Barn 1 at
Belmont Park and reflected on the impact that Skip Away had made on
his life: winning 15 races, running in the money 30 times in 33
starts and earning $8.3 million. But mostly Hine reflected on the
impact that he expected Skip Away to make during the next four
months as he enters the homestretch of a career with one purpose:
to become the richest horse in racing history.
</P>
<P>
   It is more of a family business than anything else: Hine is the
trainer and his wife, Carolyn, is the nominal owner of Skip Away,
the gray 5-year-old champion. They all start the stretch run
Thursday when they cross the continent with Skip Away to confront
Gentlemen in the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup in California on
Sunday. And make no mistake, Hine considers Skip Away a partner in
the family business, not the family pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all business,'' Hine said. ``He's a business horse. He's
very sharp. He doesn't want to be petted or hugged. If you're in
his stall working on his legs, he won't attack you. But he doesn't
want you petting him, except for my wife. He listens to her. If
he's eating and she calls, he'll come to her. Otherwise, he's all
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Big business. After some anxious moments last weekend when his
legs showed some swelling, Skip Away heads west with a winning
streak of six races, five of them Grade 1 stakes. They are the $1
million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park last October, the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park in November, the
$300,000 Donn at Gulfstream Park in February, the $250,000
Gulfstream Park Handicap in March and the $750,000 Pimlico Special
in May.
</P>
<P>
   He took a slight cut in quality but still collected first prize
in the $500,000 Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in Boston
in late May. Then he came home to Belmont Park to rest for
Gentlemen and Silver Charm and any other challengers waiting in the
second half of his final season at the races.
</P>
<P>
   His goal: to surpass Cigar's record haul of $9.9 million and
become racing's first $10 million horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could just go to the Breeders' Cup and go over the top,''
Hine said. ``But he's been in training constantly for four years
now, and he'll race his way up to the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins the Hollywood Gold Cup, he'll get first prize of
$600,000 and would reach $8.9 million. In the Pacific Classic in
August, he could reach $9.5 million. The Woodward in New York only
has a small purse, but he'd reach $9.9 million. And he'd pass $10
million in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Then the Breeders' Cup
Classic, with first prize of $2.5 million, would put him way
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Having charted the final strides for his business horse with
precision and profit, Hine allowed himself to look farther ahead,
and said: ``We want him to stay healthy and go to stud. That's
where the real money is. He can make more money standing than
running.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he is running, Hine will continue to press for
recognition for his star, who has been voted the 3-year-old
champion and the champion older horse but has twice lost the vote
for Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets respect,'' the trainer said, with some irony, ``from
the racing secretaries when they assign the weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine seems determined to make his horse not only the richest but
also the most honored in the business. He cannot understand why
other people would object, especially Bob Baffert, the trainer of
Silver Charm and Real Quiet, who won the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness the last two years. The two trainers have exchanged
volleys in a war of words over who is ducking whom. The obstacle to
a confrontation had seemed cleared when Silver Charm suddenly was
booked into the Hollywood Gold Cup last Friday. But then Silver
Charm dropped out Wednesday when he developed a fever,
</P>
<P>
   Hine still reached for respect for Skip Away, and found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets mail every day,'' the trainer said. ``One letter made
me cry. It was from a teen-aged girl whose daddy took her to the
Jockey Club Gold Cup the year before last when Skip Away beat
Cigar. She bet 10 bucks on Skippy, and won. But not long after that
day, her father had a stroke and passed away. Now, every time
Skippy runs, she relates back to her father and how he took her to
the track to see him run for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with sentiment, Hine lives on strategy. He has already dug
deep into Cigar's experience and concludes that Del Mar brought an
end to that horse's 16-race winning streak in 1996 by trapping him
with a surface that was softer and deeper and more tiring than
usual and with two horses in tandem who made him run too fast,
early and late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip Away worked very good over a heavy track here last
week,'' he said. ``My rider that morning was Angel Cordero. He also
worked him before the Pimlico Special, so this was his second trip.
I wanted him to tell me about the surface. Angel said Skippy looked
like the best horse he'd ridden since Seattle Slew.''
</P>
<P>
   With that attitude and $10 million in sight, let the stretch run
begin. &QL;

DOUGLAS AND SAVARESE LOOKING PAST THEIR FIGHT TO SOME BIG MONEY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ James ``Buster'' Douglas and Lou Savarese
are both looking at their bout here at the Foxwoods Resort Casino
on Thursday night as crucial to the heavyweight division's future.
That would be laughable if the division wasn't such a shambles. The
fighter left standing here may well be in line to fight Evander
Holyfield or Lennox Lewis for a title or a big payday.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas (36-5-1) and Savarese (37-2) are headlining a card that
includes a welterweight bout between Julio Cesar Chavez (100-2-2)
and Ken Sigurani (22-1), a middleweight bout between Dana
Rosenblatt (30-1) and Arthur Allen (23-3) and a women's
superlightweight bout between Lucia Rijker (10-0) and Lisa Ested
(6-1). The fights will be broadcast on TVKO pay per view.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Seinfeld'' is in summer reruns, Bob Arum, of Top Rank
Boxing, is banking on Thursday night television viewers being
willing to spend money on another show about nothing. Chavez was
added to prop the card up, and for his effort was given a lucrative
rematch against Oscar De La Hoya in September. Arum has promised
Chavez a $250,000 bonus if he knocks Sigurani out.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who was in a diabetic coma and weighed more than 400
pounds two years ago, is trying to salvage self-respect in the
sport and make a few bucks. Savarese, who has lost two of his last
three bouts, is looking at this as his last stand. ``I want to be
on top of the game,'' Savarese said. ``I don't want to be a
journeyman. This is my fight. I have to win this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Since emerging from his coma and trimming off what amounts to a
middleweight boxer _ 160 pounds _ Douglas has fought, and won, six
times. But his last bout was nearly a year ago, on July 13, 1997,
against Quinn Navarre. An October bout was scuttled because he
injured his hand. Douglas, 38, believes a good showing against
Savarese, 32, will put him in line for possible bouts against Lewis
and Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a point where they are running out of bodies,''
Douglas said. ``Being impressive against Savarese will put me in
line. There will be a public demand. This will put me in the middle
of the road. People will be saying, `Why are you ducking him?'''
</P>
<P>
   A quick inventory of the division gives credence to Douglas'
estimation. Holyfield, the World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation champion, is waiting for Henry
Akinwande's hepatitis B to clear up so that he can defend the WBA
title. After that, Vaughn Bean, the IBF No. 1 contender, is waiting
for the champion.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion, has a date with Zeljko
Mavrovic on Sept. 26 in a mandatory bout. Mike Tyson, who can
appeal his current suspension on July 9, is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   And if that isn't enough, George Foreman, 49, and Larry Holmes,
48, are expected to square off in January in a senior heavyweight
bout. Douglas, who knocked Tyson out in 1990 to win the undisputed
heavyweight championship and lost the title to Holyfield in his
next bout, has already been mentioned as a possible opponent for
Tyson if his suspension is lifted. Douglas said that people still
view his knockout victory over Tyson as a fluke and he views his
knockout loss to Holyfield as an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese has been training with Holyfield's personal trainer,
Tim Hallmark. Savarese spent 13 weeks doing the same workout that
transformed Holyfield from a cruiserweight to a heavyweight. The
regimen includes sprints instead of traditional roadwork, plus
weight training, which is normally taboo for boxers. In addition,
Savarese has been doing yoga.

WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS MARKET-BASED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Wednesday announced a new
affirmative action policy under which minority-owned businesses
will be given an advantage when they compete for government
contracts, but only in industries where surveys show they do not
seem to have a fair share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   What this means, for example, is that companies controlled by
blacks will get a leg up in trucking contracts with the government
but not in food manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of construction, a preference will be given to
minority contractors in some regions of the country, where surveys
show that their share of the government's business is smaller than
could be expected, but not in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   All told, affirmative action will be employed in industries
representing about three-quarters of all the money the government
spends on procurement contracts with small businesses, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was devised to meet the terms of a Supreme Court
decision in 1995 that strictly limited the justification and scope
of government programs that grant preferences based on race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday by the White House shortly after
he left for China, President Clinton said that the new rules
``continue my promise to mend, not end affirmative action.'' The
approach, he added, ``satisfies constitutional requirements while
targeting our efforts in areas where disparities still exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of affirmative action challenged the new policy.
Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for
Public Policy Research and one of the most outspoken academic
critics of racial preferences, called the policy ``old wine in new
bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Counting heads is a bad way of measuring discrimination,'' Ms.
Thernstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Canady, R-Fla., who is the sponsor of legislation to
end racial preferences in government programs, said that under the
new policy ``decisions will still be made on the basis of ethnic
background'' and that ``classifications based on race are
inherently harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters of affirmative action were pleased. Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif., who is chairwoman of the Congressional Black
Caucus, said that the new policy would ``provide opportunities for
qualified minority businesses to compete openly and fairly for
federal government contracting opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, which lobbies for the interests of
members of minority groups, called the policy ``at best a mixed
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was afraid it would ``mean a loss of business
for some women and minority-owned firms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has defended the principle of
affirmative action programs in Congress and the courts. But since
the 1995 Supreme Court ruling, the administration has curtailed or
cut back many of the dozens of programs throughout the government
involving racial preferences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, all programs were ended in which a specific sum of
money or percentage of contracts was set aside for minority-owned
companies. In addition, programs designed to help members of
minority groups and women win contracts from the Federal Highway
Administration, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency have
been reduced in scale. So have programs to increase the number of
minority teachers, scientists and Foreign Service officers.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, there has not been a government-wide policy on
how to handle procurement contracts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, in a case called Adarand Constructors vs.
Pena, the Supreme Court held that government programs that extend
advantages to members of minority groups must serve a ``compelling
national interest'' and must be ``narrowly tailored'' to address
the effects of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The policy announced Wednesday applies to what the government
calls ``small disadvantaged businesses'' and affects every
government procurement contract for which there is open bidding. It
does not need to be approved by Congress. It will go into effect in
stages between now and Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses owned by blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and
Asians are presumed to be disadvantaged. Those owned by whites,
including women, fit the standard only if they can show through a
``preponderance of the evidence'' that they are socially and
economically disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that are considered disadvantaged and bid for
contracts in particular industries will be entitled to a 10 percent
price break. That means that they will be the low bidder if their
price is within 10 percent of the low bid filed by a business that
is not disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   To determine where discrimination exists, the government
evaluated more than 70 different industries. The survey compared in
the fiscal year 1996 the value of contracts in each industry that
went to disadvantaged businesses, called utilization, with what it
called the capacity of such companies to perform the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity was based on factors like the age and size of the
companies and was meant to show the value of contracts that would
go to disadvantaged businesses if everything else was equal.
</P>
<P>
   The methodology was called benchmarking.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, the 10 percent price break will be allowed
only in industries where the value of contracts let in the year
studied was well below the capacity of disadvantaged businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, affirmative action will be allowed in textile mill
products, where 2.2 percent of the money went to disadvantaged
businesses but the capacity was said to be 8.3 percent. It will
also be allowed in oil and gas extraction, where utilization was
9.7 percent and capacity 13.8 percent, and in trucking, where
utilization was 21.4 percent and capacity was 35.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But affirmative action will not be allowed in food
manufacturing, where 10.4 percent of the value of contracts went to
disadvantaged businesses and the capacity was said to be 8.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of industries where the price break will not be
permitted are forestry and fishing (25.2 percent utilization and
18.6 percent capacity), and agriculture (41.5 percent utilization
and 29.9 percent capacity).

   Affirmative action will be practiced for general contractors in
Middle Atlantic states, where the survey found that only 13.6

with general contractors in the Pacific states, where utilization

ECONOMIC SCENE: CHINA'S CURRENCY STANCE KEY TO ECONOMIC STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
   ( nk ) 
 By PETER PASSELL 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Briefing reporters before President Clinton's arrival in China,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin explained that the Chinese economy
was ``an island of stability'' _ the only Asian power that was
still growing, the only one whose currency had not taken a dive
since the troubles swept the region last summer.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't explain is that China's economy is fundamentally
in no better shape than, say, Indonesia's. Or that the primary
reason the Chinese yuan hasn't budged is that currency markets lack
the mechanism to topple it: Unlike most Asian economies, China does
not allow anyone to exchange its currency for dollars or yen
without government permission.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the hordes of economists who counseled developing
economies to adopt convertible currencies as quickly as possible
were wrong? ``Frankly,'' said Fred Bergsten, the director of the
Institute for International Economics in Washington, ``the answer
is `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, it is easy enough to do a Dorian Gray-style
analysis of the Asian economic miracle. Vast domestic savings and
sheer hard work effectively masked the fragility and lack of
sophistication of institutions that support modernization in a
capitalist economy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Asia was able to grow rapidly through the 1980s and
1990s, even though far too much money went into grandiose,
ill-advised investments and far too many banks and businesses took
open-ended risks by borrowing heavily in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   But the often-corrupt, top-down capitalism that weakened the
economies of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia
describes China equally well. Indeed, Indonesia had a more solid
institutional base on which to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's private banks, largely left alone by President
Suharto's family and friends, flourished. Moreover, unlike China,
Indonesia carried far less baggage in the form of inefficient
state-owned industries with debts that could not possibly be
repaid.
</P>
<P>
   However, when currency panic spread from Thailand and Malaysia
last fall, Indonesia proved extremely vulnerable. For one thing, it
was easy to bet against the Indonesian rupiah because it had long
been legal to exchange rupiah for other currencies. For another,
Indonesian banks and industries owed billions of dollars to banks
and bondholders that were callable on a few months' notice.
</P>
<P>
   In China, by contrast, there was no easy way to make a currency
bet in which you win if the yuan were devalued. To buy dollars with
local currency requires permission from the Chinese central bank,
which is not forthcoming unless it serves government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Chinese banks and corporations have very little
short-term dollar debt because Beijing won't cooperate. Lenders
won't lend dollars because they can't be repaid unless the
government agrees. Most foreign investments in China are thus in
the form of equity in Chinese subsidiaries of foreign corporations
or in long-term loans to Chinese corporations that are tied to
machinery imports such as aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   While hindsight has not been kind, there was method to the
seeming madness of all those economists who pressed developing
countries to allow free convertibility of currencies. Among other
things, convertibility attracted foreign capital by reassuring
investors that they could always repatriate their profits. It gave
local importers and exporters a means of hedging their currency
commitments. It reduced incentives for government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution,
notes that the exceptionally high domestic savings rates in Asia
(in contrast to Latin America) minimized the advantages of free
convertibility. ``What Asia needs is foreign technology and
business organization, which comes with direct foreign investment,
not dollar loans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While an inconvertible currency creates inefficiency since
government bureaucrats ultimately decide who has access to foreign
cash, the cowboy capitalist ethic of financial markets in
developing countries creates equally important inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   After all, private lenders in most of Asia were plainly out for
the quick profits that came with borrowing in foreign currency _
and thus apt to ignore their exposure to currency fluctuations.
With a convertible currency, ``you're betting the farm on the
vagaries of the international markets,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, an
economist at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   China is not entirely immune to the Asian currency flu. As
Beijing has publicly acknowledged in recent weeks, China will
eventually feel compelled to devalue the yuan to insure that its
exports remain competitive. But devaluation is probably months or
years off, both because Hong Kong would be adversely affected and
because China is enjoying the prestige derived from currency
stability.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese focus on stability is the exception in a global
economy full of opportunistic borrowers and pathologically
optimistic lenders. The best hope now, suggests Perry, is that ``we
will finally respond to the alarm bell that rang three years ago in
the Mexican peso crisis.'' The movers and shakers of international
finance, he argues, have to make clear that freely convertible
currencies are accidents waiting to happen. &QL;

YANKS HAVE TO GET SERIOUS AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ It would be nice to give old boys like Marcelo
Balboa one last turn around the pitch in a star-spangled jersey. To
let Preki Radosavljevic catch up on things with his old countrymen.
Or to give a nod to 2002 and put the rookies out there.
</P>
<P>
   The US men's soccer team has been eliminated from the World Cup
since last Sunday, after all. So why not treat Thursday night's
group finale with Yugoslavia at the Stade de La Beaujoire like a
consolation match?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a consolation match only for the Yanks, who are
playing for pride and a feel-good point or 3 before scattering for
home tomorrow. The Yugoslavs are out for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal, mind you, even though the US government treats
Yugoslavia (i.e., Serbia and Montenegro) as an outlaw state. ``We
will play against the US as any other match,'' insists captain
Dragan Stojkovic. ``The politics, it does not concern us.''
</P>
<P>
   All Stojkovic and his mates want from the Americans are the 3
points they thought they had against the Germans last time. The
Yugoslavs, who hadn't beaten Germany in 25 years, were leading,
2-0, with 14 minutes left _ and stopped playing. The Germans
promptly popped in two goals in six minutes and walked off with a
draw.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Yugoslavs held on, they already would be through to the
second round. Now, unless Germany defeats Iran in Montpellier
Thursday night, Yugoslavia needs at least a draw against the US to
advance. What the Yugoslavs really want, though, is to win the
group and play a runner-up in Montpellier instead of a victor in
Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win big, we go to Montpellier,'' says Miljan Miljanic,
president of the Yugoslav football federation. ``If we win small,
we go to Toulouse. If we lose big, we go to Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans don't show up and play, they could be on the
short end of a long score, and they know it. So whom will coach
Steve Sampson have in his lineup? Except that he'll start Brad
Friedel in goal, Sampson isn't saying. ``Whether it's the old guard
or the new guard,'' he says, ``the best 11 players will be on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the old guard _ striker Eric Wynalda, defenders
Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa, and midfielder Radosavljevic _ have
been on the field little or not at all during the tournament and
aren't particularly happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players come here to play, not to sit on the bench,'' says
Sampson. ``It's normal for players who aren't seeing playing time
to voice their frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   After the opening 2-0 loss to Germany, Sampson started five new
faces against Iran because he wanted an attacking lineup. Odds are
he'll go with a more balanced look, with more defenders in the
midfield. ``Yugoslavia is an elite team,'' Sampson says. ``We have
to play intelligently, but at the same time, we have to take risks
to create scoring opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who are only 2-5-3 in their last 10 matches with
but three goals in their last five, want dearly to take home a
stuffed bear from this global church bazaar after reaching the
second round in 1994. ``We'd like to finish on a good note,'' says
defender David Regis. ``We're going to play seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs, who were banned from the last Cup because of
their government's ``ethnic cleansing'' policies, are going to play
for survival and redemption. Though the country that qualified for
seven Cups after World War II has broken apart, the reputation of
its soccer team _ inventive but undisciplined, brilliant but
mercurial _ endures.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing a two-goal lead to the Germans was just another line on
the resume. Same old Yugos. ``That's why everyone calls us the
Brazilians of Europe,'' sighs Miljanic. ``We do not win many
tournaments but we play beautiful football. We are like a beautiful
woman with no brain.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Yugoslavs are on, as when they vaporized Hungary,
7-1 and 5-0, to qualify for the Cup, they score goals in bunches.
They may have nothing personal against Uncle Sam, but he happens to
be in the way. So if the Yanks treat the contest like a church
bazaar, they may go home with the booby prize.

WILLIAM EUSTIS; FOUNDED VT. MUSIC FESTIVAL; AT 36  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held on Saturday for William J.
Eustis, chief executive officer of Eustis Cable Enterprises Ltd.,
dog lover and founder of the annual Funk and Blues Festival in
Brookfield, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eustis was a self-taught businessman whose cable
installation operation stretched from the United States to
Indonesia. He died last Thursday when he fell from a cliff in
Jamaica. He was 36.
</P>
<P>
   Friends described him as an inveterate Dead Head _ a devotee of
the Grateful dead rock group _ whose personal style statement
tended toward jeans, open shirts and a perpetual smile. Each
August, he sponsored the Blues and Funk festival on his farm and
donated the proceeds to the local elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   He made news in St. Petersburg, Fla., on May 17, 1997, when he
hired an airplane to trail a banner over the city offering a reward
for the return of his dog, a pit bull terrier named Samson, who had
been abducted while Mr. Eustis was preoccupied with a cable
installation crew.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account published on the front page of the St.
Petersburg Times, Mr. Eustis paid $585 to the pilot and offered a
$5,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said he saw throngs of people on the streets looking
for the dog. Some would break off and search in pairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has ever loved a dog knew I wasn't crazy,'' said
Mr. Eustis. ``If he lives another five years, that's pretty cheap
loving over five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who had absconded with the dog took it home. When his
wife saw the pooch, she kicked them both out. They slept overnight
in a car.
</P>
<P>
   Hounded by the thought that his high profile theft would soon be
discovered, he arranged to return Samson to Mr. Eustis in a
supermarket parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The dognapper declined the $5,000 reward, but Mr. Eustis
insisted that he take $500. He said his reunion with Samson was
sweeter for him than it was for the dog, which had grown fond of
his temporary master. ``I'd been missing him and he'd been out
having fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eustis was born in Japan. He graduated from Tabor Academy in
Marion and attended Ithaca College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mr. Eustis' uncle, Samson is now living in
``semi-retirement'' in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eustis leaves his parents, Ralph and Merry Eustis of
Mattapoisett, Mass.; a brother, Ralph of Vernon, Conn.; and his
longtime companion Lisa Michel of Brookfield.

SENATE BACKS BILL OFFERING TAX BREAKS FOR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ga., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday voted to send President
Clinton a bill that would provide tax breaks for parents who save
for education costs, including private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would veto the legislation. In a
recent letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Clinton called the
bill ``bad education policy and bad tax policy'' that embraces the
wealthy, shrugs off the poor and siphons federal tax dollars from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   With the votes in the House and Senate falling slightly short of
the numbers needed to override a veto, Republicans and Democrats
will take competing education agendas to the public for the
November elections _ one that calls for funneling money into public
schools and another that advocates redirecting that money to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, a compromise between the House and the Senate,
passed the Senate 59-36.
</P>
<P>
   While the bill is the centerpiece of a Republican education
agenda and is designed to make in-roads on an issue that Democrats
have successfully used to their advantage, it drew some Democratic
support. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., co-sponsored the bill with
its chief architect, Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a simple idea,'' said Torricelli. ``How basic. American
families can save their own money, in their own savings accounts,
without taxation, to educate their own children in the school of
their own choice. What possible argument could anyone have with
that proposal? And yet people have found reason to object.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would expands a program that promotes
saving for college, would allow family members and other sponsors
to contribute up to $2,000 a year to special savings accounts for
individual elementary and secondary school students. The money
would have to be used for education expenses, like tutoring,
computers and private and religious school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Interest on the money and withdrawals from the account would be
tax free and could be rolled over for college expenses. The
program, which would cost the federal government $1.6 billion over
10 years, would be phased out for individuals who make more than
$95,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate the two parties have used statistics to
their own advantage. While Coverdell maintains that the bill would
benefit 20 million children and lead to savings of $12 billion over
10 years, Democrats say that the average yearly benefit for a
student would be minuscule, between $7 and $37.
</P>
<P>
   To try to draw Democratic support and thwart a veto, House and
Senate negotiators removed several contentious provisions from the
bill and added a few sweeteners, including $210 million for reading
programs. The move appealed to some Democrats but not enough to
override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   With dogged persistence, Republicans have seized on Coverdell's
proposal, the only major education legislation in Congress this
year, to castigate Clinton for his stance on education, which they
view as unimaginative, short-sighted and beholden to the teachers'
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long favored a policy of ``school choice,''
which has grown in grass-roots popularity. It would permit tax
dollars to be used for private schools as a way of making public
schools more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept is reviled by Democrats who frame it as a
Republican attempt to abandon public schools in favor of religious
and other private schools, and they point to Coverdell's bill as
the first step leading down that path. Most Democrats advocate
earmarking funds to repairing schools, building new ones and hiring
more teachers, and tried several times to derail Coverdell's bill.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
criticized Republicans for pushing the bill at the same time that
House Republicans had voted in a subcommittee to slash funds for
summer jobs programs and educational technology, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut back $1.8 billion yesterday, and they are over here
now in the United States Senate saying we are doing the most
revolutionary thing for public school students,'' Kennedy said.
``This is an absolute sham.''

OFFICIALS SEEK SOLUTION TO HOOLIGANISM PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Many solutions have been proposed for ``the hooligan
problem.'' British newspapers have called for the banning of
English teams from international soccer competition. In the 1980s,
then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher tried issuing Orwellian-style
identification cards to fans. Before the England-Romania World Cup
match in Toulouse Tuesday, a Romanian Mafioso offered ``to calm''
the hooligans along with some compatriots _ provided he be released
from a French prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not so simple. First of all, it is not
confined to English supporters. Germans best described as
``pseudo''-neo-Nazis have been involved in the most disturbing act
of violence at France '98. After Germany and Yugoslavia tied, 2-2,
Sunday, three policemen were attacked outside Stade Felix Bollaert
in Lens, leaving David Nivel, a 43-year-old squadron commander,
comatose.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the incident ``a national
disgrace,'' and the Germans offered to pull out of the World Cup.
The request was denied by tournament organizers, who were
especially disturbed because it occurred on FIFA Fair Play Day,
when Iran and the United States were meeting in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 91 arrests at France '98, most occurring in
Marseille, where England met Tunisia in its opening game. Markus
Warnecke, 27, of Hamburg and Karl-Heinz Elschn, 27, of Brunswick
were arrested for assaulting Nivel. England's second game was
relatively calm, but authorities are preparing for a potential
hooligan battle when England meets Colombia in Lens tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And things could get worse. If England qualifies for the second
round, it could confront Argentina, recalling memories of the
Falklands/Malvinas conflict. After that, there is a possible
quarterfinal date with Germany or Holland _ hooligan heaven for
some, a nightmare for most.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there is the matter of England advancing. England
needs at least a tie against Colombia to move on and appears
capable of accomplishing that. The English qualified for France '98
by playing for such a result in a 0-0 draw with Italy in Rome in a
pressure-filled atmosphere of clashes between fans and police. The
Italians were perceived as heavy-handed as 40 fans were arrested
and five injured.
</P>
<P>
   French World Cup organizers have attempted to be more tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   But as Nivel remains on the edge of death, tension is bound to
increase between law enforcement officers and exuberant fans. There
will be increased vigilance because of the presence of two of
England's most famous supporters _ Prince Charles and Prince Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed there were about 20,000 supporters in Marseille
and Toulouse,'' said Stephen Beauchampe, former international
officer of the Football Supporters Association and now a journalist
with the BBC. ``There will be double that in Lens, and most don't
have tickets. I'm worried about what could happen because there has
been so much talk for so long about trouble in Lens that it could
be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is sold out and tickets are only available on the
black market. Lens is a small venue for an enormous amount of fans,
and it is only three hours from London on the train. A lot of
people are flying to Brussels because all the flights to France are
booked. It's a Friday night. There is the added significance
because England are facing defeat. This has the potential to be the
biggest problem of the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The capacity of Stade Felix Bollaert is 41,275, larger than the
population of Lens, a coal mining town north of Paris. Lens was
awarded six World Cup matches because it is among the most
supportive cities of soccer _ RC Lens won the French championship
last season. Lens's economy has been declining, and the World Cup
was supposed to boost its image.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize trouble, Lens Mayor Andre Delelis is encouraging
businesses to close during the match. Even Zebulon, the bar which
serves as headquarters for fans of RC Lens, will likely comply.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol sales have been banned within a 50-kilometer radius of
Lens. An additional 1,200 police and gendarmes, plus 100
plainclothes officers, will be present, according to Daniel Cadoux,
prefect of Pas de Calais. English fans will be under surveillance
by ``spotters'' especially wary of Category C hooligans, those with
criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly not unique to Britain, and what is happening
here is an eerie recall to Italy '90, when the English had problems
in Sardinia and the Germans had problems in Milan,'' said John
Williams, director of the Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football
Research at Leicester University. ``Some Germans have said they
want to show the English we are up for it as well as they are. And
when a local group, such as the Tunisians in Marseille, are
involved, the problems can escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said most of the hooligan problems have been solved in
England, where the Premier League is thriving and soccer has become
very fashionable and richer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch and Italians have domestic problems related to the
nature of nationhood, history, traditions, and masculinity,'''
Williams said. ``There are strong supporters of club sides in
Italy, but their identity resides with the club and the city state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany and England are different. They each have a recent
historical tradition of a real and perceived role in the world
which is quite similar, and their reaction to other races is
similar. England is influenced by its recent colonial past, and
Germany is undergoing the strains of unification and the
integration of migrant Poles and Turks. Between the two countries,
you have a very strong, bellicose, almost innate sense of
superiority. They are almost competing for the world hooligan
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the blame for problems at the World Cup has been placed
on FIFA and the CFO, the French Organizing Committee, for the
ticket distribution plan. Since the black market is thriving, fans
are encouraged to try their luck, creating a glut of ticketless
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotland was allocated 3,000 tickets and there were 20,000
Scots at their games,'' Williams said. ``They paid large amounts of
money to buy tickets from another source.''
</P>
<P>
   The hooligan problem is not about to disappear. But as long as
rival groups remain separated, it can be controlled. This was the
lesson of the first two England games at France '98. In Marseille,
the North African immigrant population is high, providing a
perceived threat to hooligans. In Toulouse, the aeronautics
industry thrives, and the game was played on a weekday night. Both
Marseille and Toulouse are nearly 1,000 miles from London. Lens is
much closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the 30,000 or so who will come to Lens, 200-400 will be
looking for trouble,'' Beauchampe said. ``But there is more
determination among supporters to try to calm things down, like the
Scots have done over the years. There will be occasional blips like
Marseille, but at the stadium in Marseille, there were no issues.
The trend is that things are improving quite a bit.''

PIONEER GROUP EXPECTS SECOND-QUARTER LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Citing its troubled natural resource operations and
roiled markets in Russia and Asia, The Pioneer Group Inc. said
Wednesday that it would report a loss of around $10 million, or
$0.40 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The diversified asset management company blamed the shortfall _
which comes after earnings of $0.21 a share in the previous quarter
_ on its Siberian timber project, Moscow bank, and gold mine in
Ghana. Analysts had forecast Pioneer's second-quarter net income at
around $0.21 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, the Boston-based company, which earns most
of its revenues from its US mutual fund business, said it expected
its worldwide operations to be profitable for the last six months
of this year. Shares in Pioneer, which has over $23 billion in
assets under management, slipped 1 5/16 to close at 26 5/16
Wednesdayon the New York Stock Exchange. .
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer is now seeking a strategic partner for its timber
business, which has been felled by log prices that are at historic
lows and depressed demand from Asian consumers. The company will
adjust downward the value of its log inventory by $2 million for
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Citing power supply glitches at the company's gold mine, Pioneer
chief financial officer William H. Keogh said he anticipated more
disruptions in gold output later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other losses came from the Pioneer Bank in Moscow, in which
Pioneer has an 80 percent stake. Keogh said Pioneer still planned
to sell a 35 percent stake in the bank to an Estonian bank.

CLINTON SEEKS U.S.-CHINESE LEGAL EXCHANGE AND COOPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-GOALS, CHINA-ZHAO,

(bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ President Clinton plans on Saturday to announce a
plan for extensive legal cooperation and exchanges between the
United States and China, a White House official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, the centerpiece of what is described as a ``rule of
law'' initiative, is intended to offer Chinese scholars and
officials American expertise as Beijing pursues ongoing legal
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Paul Gewirtz, who is on leave from the faculty of
Yale Law School, said Clinton would announce that the Chinese had
agreed on a ``variety of cooperative activities'' in a wide range
of legal areas including the training of judges, legal aid for the
poor, reforming legal procedures and ``legal protection of human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the cooperation described in the plan is largely
limited to jointly sponsored symposiums, exchanges of lawyers and
judges and other activities that are at least partly symbolic and
unlikely to yield concrete results for some time. American and
Chinese lawyers have been slowly building such contacts for almost
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gewirtz said the administration believed that engaging the
Chinese in such discussions as they were building a new legal
system would provide an opportunity to promote democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important new channel with the Chinese,'' he said,
adding, ``It's a significant step forward on the Chinese side to be
open to interactions on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But some legal experts said releasing the plan to reporters as
Clinton was departing for China appeared timed to give the
appearance of progress on human rights. And not all share the
administration's optimism over what this initiative might achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laundry list might be viewed as areas in which we aspire
for cooperation, and the president's visit could create the right
political space for these kinds of initiatives,'' said Sharon Hom,
a law professor at the City University of New York who has been
involved in legal work in China for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to view this in the context of the long history
of such exchanges and what we've learned,'' she said. ``And there
needs to be a serious financial commitment in these areas.
Otherwise, they are just being used as political rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal exchanges and conferences have so far been almost
exclusively financed by universities, and White House officials
said that would probably continue to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House initiative is a collection of projects covering
areas where there has already been significant agreement between
the two sides and areas where the governments are miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding legal aid for the poor, for example, the Chinese have
already begun developing their own system, both publicly and
privately financed legal clinics. And Chinese and foreign
organizations are already involved in improving the training of
judges.
</P>
<P>
   In the area described in the plan as ``legal protection for
human rights,'' there is little common ground. While the Chinese
have expressed a willingness to discuss rights like the presumption
of innocence at criminal trials, freedom of speech is not on the
agenda, Gewirtz said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese constitution guarantees a wide range of
rights on paper, they are narrowly defined or not respected in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are proposing is a dialogue,'' the professor said.
``It's not prison releases. But I think it's an important new
channel.''

UTILITY DEREG CAMPAIGN DEALT BLOW IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The effort to repeal utility deregulation in this state
was dealt a serious blow Wednesday when the Supreme Judicial Court
ruled against some of the campaign's signature collection
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Ballot Law Commission will have the final say when
it decides _ as early as today _ whether the ruling should be
applied to all the signatures.
</P>
<P>
   While the Committee for Fair Electric Rates collected more than
enough signatures to win a spot on the ballot, the state's highest
court said volunteers made a big mistake when they altered petition
sheets with a highlighter pen and placed the group's name with a
return address on others.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, more than 10,000 signatures would be
rejected, leaving only 100 extra signatures keeping it on the
ballot. But depending on what the Ballot Law Commission decides,
that number could drop well below the amount needed to put the
issue before voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision is expected to hinge on a
technicality.
</P>
<P>
   The retail and industrial groups who took the matter to the SJC
claiming unfair signature collection practices may have made a
fatal mistake. When the objectors stated their case, they were
supposed to supply a list of all the signatures they were
challenging. But they accidentally left out signatures from
Barnstable and Berkshire counties.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will have to decide whether signatures from those
counties should be covered by the ruling. If they are, the ballot
question will die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I'd like them to come down,'' said Robert Ruddock,
executive vice president of the Association Industries of
Massachusetts, which challenged the signatures. ``We believe we
have a good case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruddock said the return address information printed on the
signatory sheets contained the name of the Committee for Fair
Electric Rates, which ``turned a document into propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't simply their return address, it was the name of
their organization, which was a slogan to persuade people,''
Ruddock added.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Connor, who is leading the repeal of deregulation, said
he was outraged by the SJC ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic that the Supreme Court threw out 10,000
signatures simply because our volunteers stamped a return address
on the petition,'' said O'Connor, who is organizing the repeal
effort and running for the 8th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when democracy is beleaguered, when big money is
corrupting or soiling the democratic process, that the Supreme
Court has sided with big money over grassroots efforts I think says
something about the relationship between the utility companies and
the those in power in this state,'' O'Connor added.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is trying to repeal deregulation because he says the 10
percent initial discount customers are receiving on their power
bills is too small and that there is no real utility competition in
the state.

 &HT;    SENATE APPROVES EDUCATION ACCOUNTS AND SPARKS PARTISAN BATTLE
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders plan to gather in the Capitol's
august Statuary Hall on Thursday to hail final congressional
approval of education savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by the Senate on Wednesday, will likely go to
President Clinton's desk after the July 4th recess, and Clinton has
said repeatedly he will veto it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, Republicans plan to extract as much
political mileage out of the legislation as they can. Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., who is the chief sponsor of the measure and who
is up for re-election this year, plans to fly around Georgia next
Wednesday to promote the education bill, and he is urging his
Republican colleagues to do likewise during the upcoming
congressional break.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be well armed when they leave here,'' Coverdell said
Wednesday after the Senate vote. ``It is a great message and a
great victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's legislation would allow parents, guardians and other
third parties such as unions and corporations to contribute up to
$2,000 annually to tax-free savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the accounts could be used to fund private school
tuition, public school fees, tutoring costs, or books and supplies.
Unrelated language in the bill extends business tax deductions for
companies that send employees for further education, and authorizes
the Department of Education to spend $210 million on reading
programs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a provision to allow federal funds to be spent on
same-sex public schools or classes, sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is for every parent in our country to have the
same option that a parent who can afford private school has,''
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a co-sponsor of the
legislation, and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said they would seek a
meeting with Clinton to prevail on him to sign the bill, but other
Democrats predicted that Clinton will hold fast on his veto pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not only say to the president, don't sign it _ I'd say
veto it,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``What this bill does is
comfort the comfortable and do very little to assist the problems
of those who are in the most challenged areas of our school system
in this nation. And that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, one of eight Democrats to vote for the bill, said 70
percent of the tax benefits would go to families earning less than
$75,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a bill that comforts the comforted,'' Lieberman
said. ``This is a bill that lightens the burden on the overburdened
middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats opposed to the legislation have also begun to stake
out political ground to attack the Republicans on in this election
year. In addition to accusing the Republicans of blocking Clinton's
proposals to reduce class sizes and repair school buildings,
Democrats will also hammer the GOP for proposing new cuts to
education spending.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House Appropriations subcommittee handling
education eliminated $860 million in funding for summer jobs
programs and rebuffed Clinton's requests for money to place
violence prevention coordinators in 6,500 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find me an educator ... that does not believe that funding
those summer jobs is light years more important than this program
about a potential savings that is going to go primarily to the
private school,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``What
hypocrisy.''

JAIL SUICIDE RATE SOARING IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Angela Arduini, 33, was awaiting trial at
MCI-Framingham on charges of assault and shoplifting when she tied
prison bedding to her neck and hanged herself last July.
</P>
<P>
   She left a suicide note behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said &UR;  &LR; Ruth Arduini of Worcester, Angela's
mother. ``She was supposed to be on suicide watch. If she was, we
can't understand why they gave her a sheet in her cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Arduini's death was one reason Massachusetts had a prison
suicide rate last year nearly four times the national rate,
according to a study by the National Center on Institutions and
Alternatives, which trains criminal justice agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The study, funded by the US Department of Justice, found that
the state's prison suicide rate was 74 per 100,000. The national
rate is 21 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the number of suicides over a longer period is
alarming, too. The state's five-year prison suicide rate is 38 per
100,000, nearly double the national rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinarily high,'' said James Pingeon, an attorney
who handles prison-related cases at the Center for Public
Representation. ``If it was one bad year you could say it's a
fluke, but a five-year period gives you a trustworthy sample. It
seems clear that people are dying because they don't get adequate
mental health treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight prisoners turned their cells into scaffolds last year,
despite scrutiny by prisoner advocates since the November 1996
suicide of inmate John C. Salvi III, who had been convicted of
murdering two women at Brookline reproductive clinics.
</P>
<P>
   After Salvi's death, the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center found critical gaps in the Department of Correction's
psychiatric services. But &UR;  &LR; the most urgent suggestions, including
that the staff of full-time psychiatrists be boosted from four to
nine, have not been followed because of lack of funding, DOC
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Dennehy, DOC deputy commissioner, said the department
has retrained staffers and implemented UMass recommendations that
did not require money. She said the DOC has required Correctional
Medical Services, whose contract was just renewed for three years,
to meet all of the report's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1998, no suicides have been reported by the DOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any single death is of concern to us,'' Dennehy said.
</P>
<P>
   John Noonan, director of health services for the DOC, said CMS
is forming a partnership with UMass to provide psychiatric services
once the new contract is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   State representative Kay Khan, a Newton Democrat who had tried
to raise the DOC's funding for mental health services by $2 million
last year, is again urging passage of legislation to get prisoners
help.
</P>
<P>
   The House is mulling a measure that increases the DOC's $44.3
million budget for health services by $3 million and earmarks
enough &UR;  &LR; money for the &UR;  &LR; nine full-time psychiatrists. The Senate is
considering similar legislation, but its version provides nearly
$800,000 less and does not include mental health services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not addressing prisoners' mental health needs, because
all the suicides had psychiatric histories,'' Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Lee would agree. The Dorchester woman said her son, Andre
Brown, committed suicide after three years in prison and an hour
after he was put on suicide watch in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was adequately cared for,'' said Lee, still
angry at DOC officials. ``Prison is not a place where they're
interested in treating people for mental illness. It's dangerous
that these people can have this kind of control and are not held
accountable for what happens to people in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The UMass report estimated that between 12 and 15 percent of
prisoners have major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or
manic depression. Pingeon has said that 25 percent of all prisoners
have milder disorders that would warrant professional treatment
outside prison.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other tragedies linked to prisoners' mental
illness: In 1996, an undiagnosed prisoner with schizophrenia gouged
out his own eyes; in 1994, a mentally ill prisoner bludgeoned his
cellmate to death and proudly summoned correction officers to
inspect the carnage on the cell floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised the suicide rate isn't higher because life in
prison is meaningless,'' said Jill Brotman, executive director of
the Massachusetts Prison Society, an advocacy group. ``The cuts in
rehabilitative programs over the last five or six years only serve
to further cripple and enrage people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay M. Hayes, who monitors such suicides for the National
Center on Institutions and Alternatives, said Massachusetts prisons
have long had higher-than-normal suicide rates, citing a 10-year
study (1984-1993) that showed a rate of 32 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Massachusetts has a prisoner population that is only
25th in size among the 50 states and facilities run by the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, its suicide rate over that 10-year period was
16th. The national suicide rate in the general population is 12 per
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what I was predicting,'' said James Gilligan,
who was the state's clinical director of prison mental health
services from 1981 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Gilligan said, a murder a month and a suicide
every six weeks was not uncommon. In 1977, prisoners successfully
sued the state, resulting in federal oversight of medical and
psychiatric care until 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, US District Judge W. Arthur Garrity dismissed the
case. Shortly thereafter, then-governor William F. Weld fired 23
psychiatrists and social workers from Gilligan's group. Gilligan
and psychiatrist Joan Eccleston quickly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the courts walked out, the state went back to business as
usual,'' he said. ``I didn't want to keep up a charade that we
could meet mental health service needs of this population.''

   A new 20-volume edition of  &UR; George Orwell &LR; 's works reveals that
the writer informed on  &UR; Charlie Chaplin &LR; ,  &UR; George Bernard &LR;

   CHINA-ZHAO (Shanghai, China) _ In a striking act of political
defiance, Zhao Ziyang, China's former Communist Party chief,
challenges the nation's leaders to use President Clinton's visit as
an opportunity to admit that the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 was an
immense political blunder. Zhao, the silvery-haired ex-leader who
has been under house arrest since May, 1989, made his case in a
letter to the Party's Central Committee by arguing that only in a
reversal of the official verdict on the crushing of 1989's student
movement will the government be able to retain any legitimacy with
its people. By Seth Faison. (We plan to move the story by 9 p.m. ET

To the Justice Department and 20 states pitted against Microsoft,
it was merely a bump in the road as they head to court again in

BILL
 &HT;     Eds: Material at end can be used as a separate text box.
 &HT;     By SHANNON JOYCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Senate and House leaders reached an agreement
Tuesday on a bill to restructure the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are very happy to announce that we have reached a
bipartisan agreement on a plan that will change the way the IRS
does business,'' said Sen. William V. Roth, Jr., R-Del., who
chaired the House-Senate conference committee in charge of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reform bill will be the most comprehensive overhaul of the
Internal Revenue Service ever enacted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swift approval of the compromise is expected in both houses of
Congress, and President Clinton is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes two years after a group of tax experts,
members of Congress and former IRS employees and commissioners
began a thorough study of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who co-chaired the group along with
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said the bill closely follows their
recommendations and should end many of the IRS's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give taxpayers new protections, hold IRS
employees accountable for their actions, and create a nine-member
board to guide the agency and review its procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 50 taxpayer protections in the bill are provisions
that shift the burden of proof to the IRS in court proceedings,
insulate a divorced or separated individual from his or her
ex-spouse's tax burdens, and extend an attorney-client privilege to
accountants and other tax practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law will increase the likelihood that the IRS will work
for the people and not the other way around,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require the IRS to fire employees who
vengefully violate IRS rules, falsify documents or fail to get the
proper approval for seizing property.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the bill ``has given David the
taxpayer an arsenal of slingshots to use against Goliath the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Congress passed major changes to the IRS was in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second biggest agency in government. We did it on
a bipartisan basis. We did it in a short period of time,'' Portman
said of the bill. ``So it truly is a great accomplishment of this
Congress, and the American people will benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The bill's major provisions would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a nine-member board whose members include the secretary
of the Treasury, the IRS commissioner, an employee representative
and six private sector members.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put an IRS contact name and phone number on all the agency's
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require the IRS to fire an employee who commits perjury,
falsifies or destroys documents to hide mistakes, willingly fails
to obtain the required approval for property seizures, commits
assault or battery against a taxpayer or IRS employee, or violates
the civil rights of a taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   New taxpayer rights include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shifting the burden of proof to the IRS in court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Insulating divorced or separated individuals from their
ex-spouse's tax burdens.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suspending interest penalties if the IRS does not notify a
taxpayer within 18 months of the violation. In 2004, the time limit
would change to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cutting the ``failure to pay'' penalty in half if the taxpayer
is paying the debt by installment.
</P>
<P>
   _ A computation of penalties or interest in each notice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving accountants and tax practitioners an attorney-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving taxpayers 30 days to request a hearing before seizing
any property.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting the IRS from seizing residences without a court
order or for debts less than $5,000.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PRESENT PLAN TO CONTROL MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans on Wednesday announced their plan
to regulate managed health care programs, offering legislation that
gives patients an elaborate system for appealing plans' adverse
health care decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-awaited Republican plan, billed as ``protecting
patients without big government,'' did not give patients the right
to sue managed care companies when they suffer because of health
care decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The right-to-sue rule is contained in the competing Democrats'
``Patient's Bill of Rights'' and a separate proposal of Rep.
Charles Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the various other plans, I will tell you this
Republican plan is as good as it gets,'' Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means health subcommittee,
told a packed Capitol press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was referring to the Academy Award-winning motion picture
``As Good As It Gets,'' in which actress Helen Hunt complains about
a managed care company's treatment of her son. Politicians in both
parties have pointed to the movie as a sign of popular resentment
toward managed care, a trend confirmed by several public opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care plans save money by limiting patients' choices of
doctors and access to specialty care. About 85 percent of people
who get health insurance through their employers are now in managed
care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., appointed by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., to chair a Republican task force that produced the
legislation, said the GOP plan would ``provide patients with the
necessary protection to get them well, without new taxes, without
more bureaucracy or the heavy hand of government.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Norwood said he would endorse the
Republican bill and halt efforts to get his own legislation through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked as hard as I know how over the last three years in
order to have liability in any final product,'' he said. ``I lost
that ... But I can tell you without a doubt it is time now to pass
this (Republican) legislation, because it is the right thing to do
for the patients of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said the Republican bill contained ``75 percent'' of
what was in his bill, the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act,
known on Capitol Hill as PARCA. ``I don't think anybody has any
doubt that in this town where 435 (House members) get to have an
opinion, that ain't bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the proposed legislation represented a major
effort by House Speaker Newt Gingrich to make up for political
setbacks on what has been a vexing issue for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally responsive to health care and insurance lobbyists,
the Republican leadership has been ambivalent on what to do about
managed care at a time when Democrats and Norwood were responding
to public resentment with measures to bolster patients' leverage
against health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many nervous Republicans endorsed the Norwood or Democratic
bills, while others urged Gingrich to make some response to the
managed care issue, especially in view of the prospect that managed
care would become an issue in the November elections. Republicans
have a narrow 12-vote majority in the House..
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Democrats have tried turning the managed care
issue into a political bonanza, running television ads in
individual districts that contrast their candidates' support of
managed care regulation with the Republicans' lack of ideas on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the Republican announcement mirrored the shifting
political ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a group
advocating tight controls on managed care, said the GOP proposal
was filled with ``poison pill'' elements that are so controversial,
they could never pass the House.
</P>
<P>
   Among these are a proposal to cap doctors' medical malpractice
liability at $250,000, something Republicans have failed to push
through Congress because of staunch Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is designed to insulate Republicans from criticism
that they do not advocate health care consumer protections, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Vice President Al Gore said, ``The
Republican proposal does not nearly provide the protections that
Americans need in a patients bill of rights.'' But he added, ``We
are hopeful this ... signals a renewed effort to get beyond raw,
partisan, election-year politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Business and the Health
Insurance Association of America, usually allies against any
regulation of managed care, split on the Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   NFIB, which represents small businesses that frequently cannot
afford health insurance for employees, praised the bill for
permitting interstate small business alliances to purchase health
insurance at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the HIAA, which helped torpedo President Clinton's 1994
health care legislation drive with its famous ``Harry and Louise''
television ads, called the Republican bill ``a mishmash of
cobbled-together ideas that are guaranteed to raise consumers
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican measure, when a managed care plan decides
it will not cover a particular medical treatment or procedure, a
patient may take the complaint to a company internal review board,
supervised by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Patients not satisfied with the review board decision could take
their complaints to an independent panel of medical specialists.
Emergency complaints would be expedited so that all appeals would
be completed in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Patients still not satisfied then could take the managed care
company to court. The Norwood and Democratic bills permit court
action for any health plan decision that injures health, regardless
of the outcome of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea here is to get the plan to go along with the internal
and external reviews,'' said Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo. The appeal
route, he added, also is aimed at ``resolving these matters swiftly
up front, so (patients) get the care they need when they need it
(and) health care dollars are devoted to care, not to litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Republicans readily acknowledged they
incorporated many of the ideas that first appeared in the Norwood
and Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high degree of commonality in certain areas,'' said
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the common features of the Republican bill and the
Democratic and Norwood measures are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Require managed care plans to provide access to emergency room
treatment at hospitals not affiliated with a patient's plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibit the ``gag rule'' that keeps doctors from discussing
treatment options not covered by a plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Appeals of adverse managed care decisions to external
independent reviewers.

   ``We've been unlucky but we also exhibited a terrible
inefficiency in front of the goal,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson said.
``We're going to have to do a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, on the other hand, seemed to limp into the World Cup
finals last month.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bickering, hurting team, still getting accustomed to a
new coach and unsettled at various positions. But two weeks later,
Mexico is undefeated and talking about outattacking one of the best
attacking teams in the world today, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the groups were selected last December, I'm sure our
opponents were happy to have been drawn against us,'' Mexico coach
Manuel Lapuente said. ``Now, they are not so confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the coach of the explosive Dutch team, which faces Mexico
today at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in a crucial Group E game here,
has called the match vital to his team's hopes of making it deep
into the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have a lot of trouble in this game,'' Dutch coach
Guus Hiddink said. ``Mexico is playing with a lot of confidence and
going at everybody. We want to win the group, but they have the
same hopes. If we can beat Mexico and win our group, it will be big
for our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which faces Yugoslavia in a meaningless game
for the U.S. team after the disappointing losses to Germany and
Iran, merely hopes to salvage a few nuggets of pride from the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough group, and we didn't play well,'' veteran
U.S. defender Thomas Dooley said. ``In the first match we gave
Germany too much respect, and then in the match against Iran we
were right on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd scored a goal first, and we had our chances, it could
have been an easy win for us. But it wasn't. We have to try to pick
it up now and prove that we are a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game in Nantes is one of those pride games. It was
supposed to mean something. Both nations were supposed to be
walking on pins and needles in anticipation of its kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tuesday the Americans officially became the tourists
that some would say they were in the first two games. Sampson
canceled practice and invited wives and girlfriends to join the
players in taking in various Paris sights.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one sign of concession by Sampson and the U.S.
Soccer Federation. Wednesday, the team went through only a light
practice, and Sampson acknowledged that as much as he hoped for a
victory today, he would give various reserve players a chance to
start and taste the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who backed up Tony Meola
at the 1994 World Cup but never saw action, will start in place of
Kasey Keller. And because this could be the final World Cup chance
for such U.S. veterans as Alexi Lalas, Marcelo Balboa and Jeff
Agoos, who was the final player cut from the 1994 team, it is
expected they also will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever 11 players we put out there, it's going to be with
winning in mind,'' Sampson said. ``Our aim in the match is to prove
that we can compete with one of the very best teams in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a meager goal, considering the high hopes this team had a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that we be very professional in this game
because any time you have an opportunity to play in a World Cup
match against a team like Yugoslavia, you should use it as a great
experience,'' Sampson said. ``We're hoping that's going to be the
attitude of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps once the game begins, the U.S. team will be out to prove
something. But since the Iran game ended, it has been obvious the
U.S. players merely want this bad experience to end so they can go
home.
</P>
<P>
   Several players have made arrangements to fly out of France on
Friday morning, and there are obvious ill feelings about how
Sampson has handled the team during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran scorer Preki Radosavljevic, who has played just 33
minutes in the tournament, said Sampson was ``just trying to find a
reason for not playing me'' when Sampson said he didn't think Preki
was in top condition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the normally media-friendly Eric Wynalda, another top
scorer who did not play against Iran, has said little since the
Iran game.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the Mexicans, whose turnaround and cool under
the pressure of trailing 1-0 in both first-round games has them
thinking a berth in the second round is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico can guarantee a trip to the 16-team second round with a
win today over the powerful Dutch. The Netherlands remains favored
to beat Mexico, especially after whipping the South Koreans 5-0 in
its last outing and because Mexico could be without scoring ace
Luis Hernandez, who injured his ankle against Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico is conceding nothing. What a drastic change from a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to Europe under heavy criticism, and it's true we
weren't at our best,'' Mexican keeper Jorge Campos said. ``But
we've silenced our critics. Our team now is united, and it believes
in our chances to keep winning. This is the World Cup. We've raised
our level of play.''

COMMENTARY: SOME NERVE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing is more criminal in war than the use of
poison gas. Thus it was with some horror that we read and watched
the accusation by Time magazine and CNN that the United States used
poison gas _ sarin, a lethal nerve gas _ in a commando raid in Laos
during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the KGB disinformation department spread word that the
United States was causing the AIDS epidemic in Africa has there
been such a charge of American evildoing. This time it was Ted
Turner's two responsible news organizations, citing 200 interviews
during an eight-month investigation, reporting eyewitness accounts
of the atrocity. Time wrote that Adm. Thomas Moorer, then chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, was ``confirming the use of sarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Time-CNN story seemed airtight. One of the commandos said he
had called in Air Force choppers to drop ``sleeping gas _ slang for
nerve gas'' that killed pursuers. The correspondent Peter Arnett,
whose antiwar coverage in Vietnam made his reputation 28 years ago,
stated as fact that Moorer ``and other top military officials have
confirmed the use of sarin.'' But then, on closer examination, the
story _ a ``grabber'' needed to launch the news magazine-TV joint
venture _ began to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the Weekly Standard, Eric Felton dissected the ``poisonous
smear'': CNN-Time's primary source, it seems, had written a book 15
years ago about his Vietnam experiences but never mentioned the
amazing episode. He now claims to have ``suppressed the memory''
until the hypnotic CNN camera began to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Moorer, 87 and in a nursing home, denies having confirmed the
story; the reporters apparently badgered him into general
statements that fit their mindset. Interviews refuting the story
were never aired or were twisted out of context. The Army medic who
went on the raid later stated that only non-lethal tear gas had
been used. Other ``top military officials'' supposedly confirming
the accusation have not come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Good journalists at the news magazine are dismayed at this
Turnerization of Time. The editor Walter Isaacson says ``we feel
that the doubts raised deserve full exploration'' and promises to
``correct any mistakes and clarify any disputes that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   But the doubts will never go away. New memories will be
unsuppressed. Blame-America types will always believe it. My Lai
happened, they'll point out _ why not this atrocity?
</P>
<P>
   Though not so intended, this questionable report about
poison-gas use _ slyly cast as an accusing question in Time's
headline _ will reinforce CNN's favored access to facilities in
Baghdad at a critical moment.
</P>
<P>
   We know for certain that one nation in our time has developed
and used poison gas: Iraq dropped mustard gas on Kurds in Halabja
in 1988, killing 5,000. (That's documented; soon after, a Kurdish
contact sent me authentic film of the attack and Dan Rather
broadcast it on CBS.)
</P>
<P>
   This week, Jim Hoagland and Vernon Loeb of The Washington Post
revealed the recent discovery by U.N. inspectors of deadly nerve
gas traces on missile warheads built in Iraq before the Persian
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the nerve gas was ``weaponized.'' It means that
Saddam Hussein has long lied about having _ and probably still has
_ chemical weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.N. Security Council Wednesday, the inspector Richard
Butler laid out the scientific evidence to France, Russia and
China. These nations, eager to believe Saddam, demand that Butler
show more hard evidence before any surprise inspections. As usual,
Iraq denies all, and warns of ``grave consequences'' if the United
Nations does not soon lift all sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve gas evidence may buy the United States a couple of
months. Then Saddam will begin harassing inspectors again. The
U.N.'s Kofi Annan, who doubled Iraqi oil exports, will find a
fallback compromise. President Clinton, having drawn down the U.S.
military presence, will accept the further fraying of resolve and
proclaim peace for our time.
</P>
<P>
   And Saddam's friends will say: Everybody knows the Americans
used nerve gas in the Vietnam War. Aren't they hypocrites to object
to his having a few warheads to protect him from the Israelis?

 &HT;    RANKS OF HOMELESS INCLUDE MORE FAMILIES, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Homelessness across America is increasingly turning
into a family affair, with more families in search of shelter than
ever before, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Homes for the Homeless's Institute
for Children and Poverty in conjunction with Columbia University in
New York, evaluated the homeless populations in 10 urban areas,
finding that the typical homeless family is a single mother with at
least two children under the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homelessness today is a family issue, and a children's
issue,'' the report states. ``The real picture that emerges from
behind these numbers is of thousands upon thousands of homeless
children nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, researchers interviewed 777 homeless families from
Atlanta; Chicago; Dallas/Fort Worth; Milwaukee; New York; Norman,
Okla.; Salem/Eugene, Ore.; San Antonio; San Francisco, and South
Bend, Ind. The study examined their overall quality of life,
including housing, job and educational backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not include comparative data for all cities.
However, using New York as an example, the study found that the
number of homeless families living there increased by more than 500
percent from 1981 to 1995. Last year, the first year that
information was made available, there were 700,000 homeless
families living in America.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also sees homelessness as a pressing issue.
Seizing upon the study as evidence that more ought to be done,
Andrew Cuomo, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, said the study should persuade Congress to approve
President Clinton's budget request of $1.15 billion in grants and
vouchers to help the homeless. That is a 40 percent increase in
grants for the homeless over this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's economic policies have brought new
opportunity to millions of our people, but homeless Americans
remain only spectators to the wave of prosperity sweeping across
our nation,'' Cuomo said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republican appropriators have allocated about $975 million for
homeless grants, up from $823 million spent last year.

LEADERS OF HIGHBROW ARTS FUME OVER SUPPORT FOR POPULAR CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Budgeted earlier as BRITAIN-LUVVIES) 
(ja) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A number of Britain's best-known performing arts
institutions are in financial crisis, and directors and producers
are assailing the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair for
aggravating their plight by devoting too much of its attention to
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate fueled by a combustible mixture of hurt, anger and
lost money, they are accusing the government of cheating treasured
British stage and concert hall traditions of funds and directing
its support only to art forms that it believes have contemporary
relevance, wide appeal and economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about how Dylan is really as good as John Keats,
they bang on about populism, Cool Britannia, and they seem to favor
film, television, video, rock music, architecture, design, and not
to favor classical music, dance and theater,'' said Sir Peter Hall,
the director who is a former head of the National Theater and the
Royal Shakespeare Company. He said he had concluded that ``they are
hostile to the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   The performing arts leaders, trained to assign dramatic
importance to subtle changes in behavior, have been alarmed by the
atmospherics surrounding the debate. Many more government ministers
show up these days at pop music awards ceremonies than in theaters
and opera houses, and the ceremonial rooms at the prime minister's
official residence, 10 Downing St., have increasingly become scenes
of cocktail parties for glamorous stars of television, movies and
rock.
</P>
<P>
   John Tusa, the 62-year-old chairman of the Barbican Center, the
stage, concert hall and movie complex in the center of London, said
44-year-old Blair and his colleagues were victims of a 1960s
generation mind set. ``They are much less attached in every sense _
in their experience, in their knowledge and in their beliefs _ to
whatever we're encumbered with, the Western history and culture
that are our intellectual moorings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tusa, is among the 20 arts leaders whom Blair has summoned to 10
Downing St. next Monday for what the invitation calls a
``teach-in'' but may end up bearing more resemblance to a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor government has continued the Conservatives' policy of
reducing subsidies to arts groups, and budget deficits have forced
regional theaters to close, orchestras to make survival cutbacks in
programming, and museums to start charging admission. In a letter
to Culture Secretary Chris Smith last week, Sir Colin Southgate,
the chairman of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, said the
historic hall would not be able to reopen after its current
renovation unless its annual $24 million grant was doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance to the arts, including the yearly $300 million grant
to the Arts Council, which distributes government funds, has not
increased since 1993, and the council estimates that this has
amounted to a cut of 15 percent in real terms. When Labor came to
power 14 months ago for the first time in 18 years, people in the
arts clung to the notion that it would loosen the Conservatives'
grip on money. In fact, the Labor platform pledged the party would
abide by Conservative spending limits the first two years in
office, and no exception has been made for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Hostilities came to a head late last month when some prominent
people in theater and dance resigned en masse from their Arts
Council panels. They were protesting a decision by the council's
new chairman, Gerry Robinson, the chairman of Granada Group Ltd.,
the television, hotel and theme-park conglomerate, that appeared to
exclude people from the arts in decision making on culture
subsidies. Sixty directors, producers and playwrights led by Sir
Peter, Sir Cameron Mackintosh and Sir Alan Ayckbourn wrote a letter
to Smith saying they would have no more dealings with the council.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard Eyre, former director of the National Theater, made
an impassioned speech defending theater at the annual Royal Academy
dinner May 27 in which he turned the name of the arts' onetime
Conservative nemesis to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working in the theater,'' he said, ``I sometimes feel like a
thatcher _ the sort that cuts up straw, not cabinets _ in pursuit
of a craft that seems increasingly anomalous when set aside the
confident certainties of video games and `Termininator 2.'''
Electronic games are a $1.5 billion business for Britain, and the
Culture Ministry has singled it out for encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly galling example to the government's critics is
the Greenwich Theater, which folded on March 28 when it lost its
$330,000 grant. The now darkened stage is in the same Southeast
London neighborhood as the government-sponsored $1.2 billion
Millennium Dome, the vast new arena going up on the Greenwich
meridian as the centerpiece of Britain's commemoration of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   The dome has become a convenient symbol for the distressed
champions of high culture, because the government has hinted that
it plans to use it to portray British culture with trade-show
presentations, multimedia theme-park attractions and
virtual-reality displays. It will be the largest building of its
kind in the world, more than twice the size of the current tape
breaker, the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. Blair visited the 130-acre
site on Monday for a ceremony marking the completion of the highest
point of the dome roof and proclaimed it a showcase of ``the best
of British.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Young, columnist for The Guardian, said, ``Many temples of
great culture all over the country are struggling to survive, while
a fortune exceeding that spent on the entire Getty Museum in Los
Angeles, which was built for the centuries to house work for the
ages, is lavished on a cultural statement that is proud to proclaim
its utter ephemerality.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has defended the government's approach to supporting the
arts as one that rewards tighter management and celebrates
endeavors that are accessible to the most people, help educate
people in the arts and have ``economic significance.'' He said the
government found it easy to back the $7 billion popular-music
industry because it ``doesn't need nannying, it doesn't even need a
raft of tax incentives or handouts from the state.'' He has said
that he hoped to stimulate the ``creative industries'' that amount
to an $82 billion enterprise in Britain, creating jobs, exports and
allure.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Parliamentary committee this month took a different view,
saying that Smith was ``obsessed with the glamorous and trivial
matters.'' An editorial in The Evening Standard said that Smith,
who has a `octorate in English literature from Cambridge, was
demonstrating that ``even highly educated Labor ministers have
become infected with the sort of old populist nonsense that equates
reggae music with Beethoven, which holds that if there is no mass
audience for something, it can't be worth much _ or at least many
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tusa, the Barbican head, said he believed the debate centered on
an ``artificial distinction.'' Taking up Smith's praise for the
``creative industries,'' he said, ``They are fashion, design,
architecture, rock, pop, media, Internet, films, videos, anything
like that, at all of which the British are very good. And somehow
these are held up as being (a) successful, (b) moneymaking and (c)
international, very much in the new millennium, very new Labor. I
mean, that's fine, nobody would disagree with that. But then they
go to the next stage and make this an explicit criticism of the
arts for being a pain in the neck because they are not like the
creative industries.''
</P>
<P>
   John Newbingin, an aide to Smith, said this formulation was a
``complete misreading'' of the Labor government's attitude. ``The
support in the past focused on the fact that art forms like the
strong tradition of performing arts in Britain needed financing for
their own sake,'' he said, ``We are saying that we need to
recognize now that as well as being culturally important, they are
economically important.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Conservative cuts were made in the name of seeking
more support from the private sector. Private donations to culture
are rising in Britain, but they do not come close to levels of
giving in the United States, and people in the arts here believe
they never will. ``It's not in our tradition,'' said Sir Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they wanted to wean the arts from a
``dependency culture.'' According to Arts Council figures,
government spending on the arts amounts to $27.40 for each person
in the United Kingdom, as opposed to $6.25 in the United States and
$97.70 in Finland, the biggest spender in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Culture in Britain has benefited from the hugely successful
national lottery, but in the process may have given a false
appearance of arts prosperity to would-be contributors. Lottery
grants are explicitly for capital projects like building,
renovating and equipment, and cannot be devoted to ongoing expenses
or to replenishing budgets reduced by cuts in grants. A law now in
Parliament would ease this restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lottery money has been used in a great big bonanza on
buildings,'' said Sir Peter. ``So up and down the country, there
are now refurbished theaters that are all spankingly new and clean
and splendid, all going bust because they don't have enough money
to run them.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Manchester's 140-year-old Halle Orchestra, which
performs in a gleaming modern hall, avoided disbanding only through
a hurried rescue plan that involved the sale of three instruments _
a 17th-century Amati violin and two Steinway pianos _ and a pledge
to curtail ambitious programming and restructure its
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Smith addressed the furor with a
self-congratulatory book based on 14 of his speeches and two essays
called ``Creative Britain'' that may have been ill-timed. Among the
many critics who savaged the work was George Walden, a writer who
is a former Conservative member of Parliament. ``This is an
appalling book, a small tragedy of a book,'' he wrote in the
Labor-bashing Sunday Telegraph. ``A Secretary of State for Culture
has put his name to some of the most sanctimonious bilge written
about the arts in recent times.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbingin, the Smith aide, took the long view. ``Patronage and
art have always had an uncomfortable relationship, and there have
been lots of shootouts throughout history,'' he said. ``Even
Michelangelo and Pope Urbino fought about finishing the Sistine
Chapel.''

   CHINA-ZHAO (Shanghai, China) _ In a striking act of political
defiance, Zhao Ziyang, China's former Communist Party chief,
challenges the nation's leaders to use President Clinton's visit as
an opportunity to admit that the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 was an
immense political blunder. Zhao, the silvery-haired ex-leader who
has been under house arrest since May, 1989, made his case in a

reversal of the official verdict on the crushing of 1989's student

RIOS MAKES EARLY EXIT; SAMPRAS, GRAF CRUISE TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Bewitched by a few blades of grass,
second-seeded Marcelo Rios self-destructed in his first-round match
at Wimbledon on Wednesday, losing an opportunity to find Grand Slam
respectability and another chance to snatch the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with himself, Rios elected to direct that disgust at
the venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take Wimbledon, like playing on grass, like a really
important thing,'' he said after being upset, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 3-6,
6-3 by Francisco Clavet of Spain, a 29-year-old journeyman whose
only resemblance to the talented but tempestuous Rios is his
virtually nonexistent Wimbledon resume.
</P>
<P>
   After Rios dropped his serve, along with the third set, he began
to lose interest in his shotmaking and Clavet merely had to guide
the ball within the boundaries and wait for the better player to
play like a beginner _ a beginner with a bad attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis, when you see it on grass, it's not tennis,'' said
Rios, who has now lost in the first round here twice in three
years. ``It's not a surface to watch or play tennis on; it's really
boring. You just serve, return, go in, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios' low opinion was not shared by Jennifer Capriati, who
verged on jubilance after powering her way into the second round
past the Australian Nicole Pratt, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 in her first
Wimbledon appearance in five years.
</P>
<P>
   It was a landmark victory for the 22-year-old Capriati, who
reached the semifinals here in 1991 but had not passed the first
round of a Grand Slam tournament in her last five attempts, dating
back to the 1993 U.S. Open loss that preceded her two-year spiral
into substance abuse and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe in myself, that I can go all the way, and
maybe that's not No. 1, maybe that's just No. 5, but that's fine,''
said Capriati, a wild-card entry here.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing comes automatically for Capriati anymore, but most of
the big names, including the defending men's champion Pete Sampras,
the seven-time women's champion Steffi Graf and sixth-seeded Monica
Seles were on automatic pilot Wednesday as springlike conditions
settled in after Tuesday's disruptive showers.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras cruised past Mikael Tillstrom, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5); Graf
reached the third round with a 57-minute 6-0, 6-4 demolition of
Henrieta Nagyova, and Seles walloped Alexandra Fusai, 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   One contender who had problems was fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski,
the Canadian-born British star, whose match with the qualifier Mark
Draper was delayed by rain Tuesday with Draper leading, 4-6, 6-2,
5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, capable of becoming the first British man to win here
since Fred Perry in 1936, had sprained an ankle two weeks ago at
Queens Club and displayed all the mobility of the bronze statue of
Perry that guards the grounds. He was glued to the baseline,
double-faulted 18 times and hoped it would rain all week so that he
would not have to resume Wednesday on his one good leg.
</P>
<P>
   When Rusedski woke up to a blue sky, he knew it was curtains. He
decided to withdraw after morning practice. The Court One crowd let
out a collective groan when it heard; then there was more music to
face.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Rusedski, a 1997 U.S. Open finalist who has
the fastest serve on the circuit, had played Tuesday against the
wishes of his coach, Tony Pickard. Unhappy that Rusedski had
disregarded his advice in favor of that of his physiotherapist,
Reza Dandesman, Pickard waited until Rusedski withdrew and then
informed him that their relationship was over, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no ranting and raving,'' said Pickard, Stefan
Edberg's former coach, who came out of retirement to guide Rusedski
into the top five. ``Over the last two weeks, there was a total
breakdown in communication. There were outside influences telling
him he was fit to play; I didn't consider he was, but the thing
that broke the camel's back was the fact that for two days I
couldn't find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski described the timing of the break-up as a case of
Pickard's ``showing his true colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickard had an angry retort: ``Maybe the young man would be a
lot better to say nothing, because if I was to elaborate for you, I
think you would all tear him to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighth-seeded Cedric Pioline, who reached the final last year,
lost his first-round match to Marc Rosset, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6
(7-5), 13-11.
</P>
<P>
   _ Karol Kucera, seeded 15th, was ousted by Vladimir Voltchkov, a
218th-ranked qualifier from Belarus, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   _ The only seeded woman to lose was No. 9 Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa, who sank in the second round for the seventh time in
nine visits. This time she was dispatched by 33rd-ranked Naoko
Sawamatsu of Japan, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former No. 1 Jim Courier, a first-round loser in four of his
last six Grand Slam tournaments, was eliminated, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6),
6-4, by Thomas Johansson of Sweden. But a rising star, 21-year-old
Jan-Michael Gambill of Spokane, Wash., survived a momentous debut.
After three days of rain-interrupted play, and after squandering 10
match points, Gambill won, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 4-6, 8-6
against Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first five-set match, and I've never had a match
last three days,'' said Gambill. &QL;

FAGAN EXPECTED TO USE `NECESSITY DEFENSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When he is arraigned Thursday in Middlesex Superior
Court, Stephen Fagan will take the first step in the battle to
defend himself against charges he kidnapped his two daughters from
his ex-wife 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But since his arrest, Fagan has been laying the groundwork for
his legal strategy: the so-called necessity defense.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper and TV interviews, Fagan never denied he took his
daughters. Rather, he insisted he swept them away from their
mother, Barbara Kurth, because their lives were in danger from her
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to trial, Fagan hopes to convince a jury he
saved his daughters from a greater harm.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity defense is rarely successful in courts here,
specialists say. But Fagan can employ it to win an acquittal if he
convinces a jury of three things: that the children were facing a
clear and immiment danger; that his action was necessary; and that
there was no legal alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third one is usually the stumbling block,'' said John
LaChance, president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan says he took the girls, then ages 2 and 5, to Palm Beach
and changed their identities to save them from Kurth, whom he
describes as a neglectful, alcoholic mother.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 56, will be arraigned before Judge Joseph A. Grasso
Jr. &UR;  &LR; on two counts of kidnapping and one count of contempt of a
probate court order, which had prohibited Fagan from taking the
children out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who is free on $250,000 bail, was arrested in April in
Palm Beach. He had masqueraded as Dr. William S. Martin, an
Ivy-League-educated psychiatrist, wealthy socialite, and
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were living with Kurth in North Adams in 1979 when he
picked them up for a three-day visit and never returned. Later, he
told them their mother died in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Fagan remarried twice and raised the girls with his
affluent wives. His daughters, Rachael Martin, 23, and Lisa Martin,
21, have prospered by all accounts and have stood by their father.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, meanwhile, hired private detectives but did not find the
children. A research scientist at the University of Viriginia,
Kurth has adamantly denied she had a problem with alcohol or was
neglectful.
</P>
<P>
   LaChance said Fagan's chances for success with the necessity
defense may depend on whether his attorney, Richard M. Egbert, can
convince a jury that his client ``had no alternative but to get
(the children) out of there before they were badly harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Chapman, former head of the Massachusetts Bar
Association's criminal section, said that strategy will allow
Egbert ``to present evidence that will engender sympathy for your
client _ evidence, for instance, about Barbara Kurth's conduct that
would not otherwise be admissible.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are risks, Chapman said. ``The bad thing about it is
that, like the insanity defense, you have to essentially admit you
did the crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaChance said the defense has worked in some cases, such as a
person driving with a suspended license because he or she was
taking someone to the hospital in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said judges often refuse to give the jury the option of
acquitting a defendant on the basis of necessity. He cited a recent
needle-exchange case in Peabody District Court in which a defendant
accused of distributing hypodermic needles to drug users claimed he
was acting to prevent the greater harm _ the spread of AIDS. The
judged barred the necessity defense, and the defendant's conviction
was upheld on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy Carter, the daughter of former President Jimmy Carter,
won acquittal with the necessity defense in 1987 after she was
charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct for joining in the
occupation of a building at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst to protest CIA recruitment there.
</P>
<P>
   When the case came before a jury in Northampton, Carter's
attorneys argued that the courts and Congress could not control the
CIA, so the protest was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hoopes, a Boston defense attorney, agreed that Fagan's
biggest hurdle could lay in persuading the judge to give
instruction on the necessity defense to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some sympathy for (Fagan) out there,'' Hoopes said.
``If he can get a judge to instruct on necessity, he has a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is fighting in the right direction,'' Hoopes added. ``Does
he have enough to get there? I don't think he is going to know
until he sees who he draws as a (trial) judge.''`

MUSEUMS OF A MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 28)  
 (JT)  
 By KEVIN SACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the notion was broached nearly a decade ago, it seemed
tastelessly morbid. A museum of the civil rights movement was to be
built at the Lorraine Motel, the motor lodge in Memphis where the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot to death in 1968 while
standing on the balcony outside Room 307.
</P>
<P>
   But seven years and 650,000 visitors later, the decision seems
as visionary as the men and women whose courage and strategic
insight are now honored by the museum. Of all this country's
monuments and shrines, few hold the visceral power of the National
Civil Rights Museum in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors wend their way down a chronological path through the
movement, walking past the burned-out hull of a Freedom Riders' bus
and tasting the abuse served up to lunch counter demonstrators,
many are moved to tears as they come upon the culmination of their
tour and, in the minds of many, of the movement itself.
</P>
<P>
   Preserved behind glass is Room 307, just as King and his
lieutenants left it on April 4 after a staff meeting that ended
shortly before the assassination at 6 p.m. An unmade bed. A room
service tray cluttered with dirty dishes. That day's Memphis
Press-Scimitar. A butt-filled ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out a window, you can trace the path of the bullet from
the rooming house across the street to the spot where King fell,
now marked by a wreath of red and white carnations. The mournful
mood, reflecting the destruction of both a 39-year-old leader and a
movement's momentum, is set by a recording of Mahalia Jackson
singing ``Precious Lord,'' just as she did at King's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after King's death, commemorations of the struggle
for civil rights are proliferating across the South, a region once
preoccupied with memorializing the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   There are now civil rights museums in Memphis and Birmingham,
Atlanta and Little Rock, Selma and Savannah, several among the
premier tourist attractions in their cities. A museum is scheduled
to open in the fall at the old Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany,
Ga., a staging ground for that city's demonstrations. Ground was
broken in April at Troy State University in Montgomery, Ala., for a
40,000-square-foot Rosa Parks Library and Museum, scheduled to open
in 2000. Money is being raised to build a museum at the former F.W.
Woolworth in Greensboro, N.C., where four students began the sit-in
movement in 1960, a protest against segregation at lunch counters
and in other public places.
</P>
<P>
   The current building boom has been inspired by the graying of
the civil rights generation and a feeling that the heroes of the
1950s and 1960s, both the famous and the footsoldiers, should be
acknowledged in a formal way. In doing so, the museums celebrate
the remarkable distance that race relations have progressed in the
second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every instance, the most compelling displays at the
museums _ even more so than the newsreels of memorable marches and
speeches _ are the artifacts of segregation, numbing in their
matter-of-factness. What stayed with me after a visit to the
Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in April was a photograph of a
laundry truck, emblazoned with an advertisement reading ``We Wash
for White People Only.'' Even dirty laundry, the curators point
out, was not allowed to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Another impetus in the construction of the museums, civil rights
veterans say, has been the ignorance of the movement by today's
students, who are often only a generation or two removed from the
Montgomery bus boycott and the 1963 March on Washington. One of
those veterans, Julian Bond, the chairman of the NAACP and a
prominent civil rights historian, said in a recent interview that
not one of the 500 students he surveyed between 1989 and 1993 in
classes at five prominent universities could correctly identify
George Wallace, the defiantly segregationist former Governor of
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In their educational mission, the museums strive to place the
civil rights movement within the mainstream of America's
revolutionary tradition. The Memphis exhibition pointedly concludes
with a plaque bearing words not of King, but of Thomas Jefferson:
``A little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing. . . . It is a
medicine necessary for the sound health of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, several of the museums include replicas of the
Birmingham jail cell where King wrote his famous 1963 letter to
white ministers, proclaiming that the non-violent protests of the
day had brought the country ``back to those great wells of
democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in that same letter that King made one of his most
prescient predictions. ``One day,'' he wrote, ``the South will
recognize its real heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   National Civil Rights Museum, Memphis
</P>
<P>
   As was the case in so many Southern cities, the Lorraine Motel
was one of the few lodgings available to black travelers when King
arrived in Memphis to lend his support to a sanitation workers'
strike. While the facade, with its distinctive green doors and
yellow trim, has been maintained as it was in 1968, the interior of
the motel has been gutted and expanded into 10,000 square feet of
display space and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis museum provides by far the most comprehensive
interpretation of any of the civil rights exhibitions, and it is
sometimes criticized for being too dense with words. The time line,
after all, begins in 1619 and touches on slavery, Nat Turner, Dred
Scott, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass well before moving on
to Jim Crow segregation, a term derived, you learn, from a minstrel
show called ``Jump Jim Crow.'' A less demanding alternative to
reading the lengthy historical explanations is a one-hour
tape-recorded tour, narrated by Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, that
moves you through the museum at a brisker pace.

<P>
   The displays are full of first-person accounts and copies of
original headlines and documents, but the most memorable moments
are interactive. When you walk on to a green and yellow Montgomery
city bus, you find the first five rows reserved for whites, and a
mannequin of Rosa Parks seated defiantly in the second row. As you
take your seat, a driver's voice barks: ``I need that seat now.
Please move back. If you don't move from that seat now I'll have
you arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more powerful is a reconstruction of a lunch counter, where
gray statues of protesters sit in front of video screens showing
footage of an actual sit-in. In the videotape, taken during the
Greensboro sit-in, a black man sits stoically at a lunch counter as
a white tough dumps a milkshake on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The museum makes effective use of a tape recording of a tense
telephone call in which President John F. Kennedy confronts Gov.
Ross Barnett of Mississippi about the unrest accompanying the
enrollment of the first black student at the University of
Mississippi, James Meredith. And it humanizes King with the
transcript of a telephone conversation with his wife, Coretta Scott
King, while he was jailed in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's the baby?'' he asks. ``How's Bernice?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine, growing, cute as a button,'' she responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wonderful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum is at its best in documenting the final hours of
King's life and the chaos that followed the assassination. The
words of the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who was at King's side at
his death, are used to convey the sense of emotional convulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Young was the first to get up there by me,'' Abernathy
recalls. ``And Andy said, `Oh God.' He said, `Ralph, it's over.' I
became furious. I said, `Don't say that. Don't you say that, Andy.
It will not be over. It will never be over.'''
</P>

   Birmingham Civil Rights Institute
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated in 1992, this handsome museum and archive is the
centerpiece of a complex of civil rights sites in downtown
Birmingham. It is across the street from the 16th Street Baptist
Church, where a bomb set by Klansmen in 1963 took the lives of four
young girls. And just to the north of the museum, across 16th
Street, is Kelly Ingram Park, where the helmeted troops of Police
Commissioner Eugene T. (Bull) Connor confronted protesters earlier
that year. The park, now remade as ``a place of revolution and
reconciliation,'' is a regular stop for the city's schoolchildren,
who come to experience the past through James Drake's powerful 1992
metallic sculptures of water cannon and snarling dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The museum itself depicts the civil rights movement through the
prism of the Birmingham experience, with timelines that note
milestones in that city along with their national context. The tour
begins with a brief film about the history of the city. Then the
screen lifts to reveal the entrance to the rest of the exhibition,
beginning with a display of water fountains designated for either
whites or blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The museum cleverly demonstrates the racial inequities in
education and health care that had become so accepted in
Birmingham. In 1944, for instance, the average class in a black
school in Birmingham had 43 students, compared to 24 at white
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Here you also see the original door to the jail cell that
confined King in 1963, as well as copies of his police fingerprint
sheets. And you learn of the 50 unsolved bombings against black
citizens or institutions from the late 1940s to the mid 1960s that
gave the town its nickname, Bombingham.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the video of the waterhosing of students is
gripping and its melding with recent interviews with the same
people provides a nice touch. Another high point is the showing of
King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech at the March on Washington in a
circular room where video walls create the sensation of being on
the Mall that day.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   This site, many civil rights buffs agree, is not what it should
be. Instead it reflects years of distrust between the King family
and the National Park Service, a distrust that culminated in the
early 1990s when the Park Service went ahead with plans to build a
visitors center on land the Kings had wanted for a museum. The
family continues to search for a site for the museum. While none of
the exhibits scattered down Auburn Avenue offer a comprehensive
account of the movement, it remains a valuable stop on any trip to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to King's elegant tomb, its white marble mirrored in a
blue reflecting pool, is always a solemn experience. The
inscription is perfect in its simplicity:
</P>
<P>
   REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR
</P>
<P>
   1929-1968
</P>
<P>
   `` FREE AT LAST. FREE AT LAST.
</P>
<P>
   THANK GOD ALMIGHTY
</P>
<P>
   I'M FREE AT LAST.''

<P>
   In the adjacent Freedom Hall, which is part of the
family-managed King Center, visitors can see King's Nobel Peace
Prize and displays of personal effects of King and Mrs. King.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, the National Park Service has erected a
visitors center that features two films, one about King and one
about the Sweet Auburn business district where he was born and
where he worked. It also includes a modest exhibit of videotapes
and text about the movement, with King's biography used as a
framework. The park service is currently in negotiations with the
King Center about the possibility of taking control of the center.
</P>
<P>
   The park service offers tours of the upper middle-class home at
501 Auburn, where King was born and where three generations of his
family lived. Park service rangers reel off plenty of King family
lore, like the anecdotes about how young M.L. broke the piano stool
to shirk his music lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Another worthwhile stop is Ebenezer Baptist Church, the brick
sanctuary where King, his father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.,
and his maternal grandfather, the Rev. A.D. Williams, all preached.
In a deal with the park service, Ebenezer is about to complete
construction of a glass and steel building next to the historic
site visitors center. The original Ebenezer will then be leased to
the park service, which should offer a wonderful opportunity to
interpret the vital role played by the black church in the civil
rights movement.

PANEL DECRIES DECLINE OF CIVIC LIFE IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Public trust in politicians and government is about
as low as it can go, and neither good economic times nor some
encouraging social trends are getting Americans off the sidelines
and into the action of creating a more civil society, a new report
says.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Civic Renewal, a high-powered panel
of academics, business executives, and Washington insiders, issued
a failing report card Wednesday on the nation's moral health and
concluded the state of American civil life is as depressed as it
was during the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a time of hope for Americans,'' the report
said. ``And when we consider our economic circumstances, it is. But
when we assess our country's civic and moral condition, we are
deeply troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, co-director of Empower America, a conservative
think tank, and author of the morally prescriptive ``Book of
Virtues,'' co-chaired the commission along with former senator Sam
Nunn, a Georgia Democrat. They said they overcame their political
differences to agree that lack of civic participation is weakening
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corrosive cynicism has crippled our civic spirit, and a sense
of helplessness has zapped our civic strength,'' said Rebecca
Rimel, president of the Pew Charitable Trusts, the philanthropy
that sponsored the 18-month study of declining citizen
participation in the US political process.
</P>
<P>
   The result of these ill feelings, the commission said, is that
Americans have become a ``nation of spectators'' who, instead of
taking individual reponsibility for their communities and families,
stand on the sidelines and whine or sit in front of the television,
mindlessly clicking the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of us have become passive and disengaged,'' the
report said. ``Too many of us lack confidence in our capacity to
make basic moral and civic judgments, to join with our neighbors
... to make a difference. Never have we had so many opportunities
for participation, yet rarely have we felt so powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all: According to the panel, which studied social
trends over 25 years as well as new survey data, Americans fret
about weak families but don't work to strengthen them, deplore
pubic schools but won't help their children with homework, worry
about out-of-wedlock births but won't condemn them, complain about
vulgar TV shows but don't turn off the set, and reelect leaders
they say they distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans claim they are busier than they have ever been, that
they are stressed, stretched, and under extreme pressure for
time,'' said Bennett, who was President Reagan's education
secretary and President Bush's drug czar. ``Yet what we found is
that Americans have more leisure time than they ever have. They
watch more television than they ever have.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question about time is how are Americans spending it,
and are they giving up civic things in order to keep the boat, or
the second house, or fourth motorcycle?'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission report says that compared to earlier generations,
Americans today place less value on what they owe society and
whether they need to play by the rules or fulfill obligations as
citizens. At the same time, they express individual liberty by
valuing self-gratification and personal choice more, Nunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-member commission proposed a series of steps to civic
renewal, recommending that individuals join at least one civic
association, neighborhoods institute crime watches and clean-up
projects, and schools offer instruction in good citizenship and
historic documents, like the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing and abhoring the end of a civil society has become one
of Washington's most popular academic pursuits. This commission's
report is the latest in a series of studies looking at why
Americans distrust government and politicians, why they don't vote,
and whether their disengagement from civic life is somehow warping
the nation's moral fiber.
</P>
<P>
   It also has some practical consequences. Low voter turnout and
declining political activity _ from making fewer campaign
contributions to not volunteering for a candidate _ can affect the
outcome of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Solo, president of the nonprofit Institute for Civil Society
in Newton, says the commission's report ``misses the mark'' and is
typical of what happens when Washington's intellectual elite has a
conversation with itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I sit, this doesn't look to me like a nation of
spectators,'' Solo said. ``There is a lot of innovation and
creative activity going on at the grass-roots level, where people
are redefining community and what being involved means.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is most depressing because the elitists in
Washington treat local people like colonists and try to prescribe
their own 10-point training program for democracy,'' Solo said.
``What Americans have learned _ and the commission hasn't _ is that
national politics is not going to solve national problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the commission's report does note ``the stirrings of a
new movement of citizens acting together to solve community
problems.'' Because the movement operates on a shoestring and is
``nontraditional'' _ in other words, the impetus comes from
churches, foundations, and volunteers rather than government _ the
movement ``has gone largely unnoticed, unappreciated and
unsupported,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said another hopeful sign is some of the ``most
worrisome trends'' included in its index of national civic health
are turning around. Among them are crime rates, which have fallen
sharply in this decade; the lower divorce rate; improved school
performance; fewer teenage pregnancies; and even distrust in
government, which has leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal shouldn't be a leveling off at the bottom,'' Nunn
said. ``We've got to see the trendline _ and trust in government _
going up.''

IN XIAN, 2 FARMERS VIE FOR CREDIT FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-GOALS, CHINA-ZHAO,
CHINA-LAW, CHINA-PEONY, CHINA-PEONY-FRANCE) 
(bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ Just outside the archaeological dig that made this
ancient city famous sit two old farmers who share at least three
things: the name Yang, the stubble of a not-too-recently shaved
head and the claim to have unearthed China's greatest historical
find of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It is such a spectacular site _ an army of terra-cotta warriors
built to guard the tomb of Qin Shihuang, the emperor who unified
China in 220 B.C. _ that President Clinton is making his first stop
here when he arrives in China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton, traveling with an entourage of more than 1,000, may
not have a chance to stop and meet either of these two
plain-looking men. And that is too bad, because they tell quite a
tale. Two different tales, actually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the soldiers,'' asserted Yang Quanyi, 70, the older
and shorter of the two, who now works in a tourist gift shop to
sign signing coffee-table books about the soldiers. ``Don't believe
what other people tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove his claim, Yang pointed at the enormous color
sign hanging over the table where he sits each day, ``The Man Who
Discovered the Terra-Cotta Warriors, Yang Quanyi.''
</P>
<P>
   If Yang seems inept at describing how he actually made the
discovery, he tries to make up for it by simply saying over and
over, often in a conspiratorial whisper, that it was indeed he who
made the big find.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby building, beside another collection of touristy
kitsch, the other Yang also spends his days posing for photographs
and signing his name.
</P>
<P>
   At 60, Yang Zhifa is a tall, kindly farmer, given to soft grunts
of approval at almost whatever anyone says to him and happy to
smile and pose for a photograph. But his amiable demeanor vanishes
when his competitor's name comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can claim he found it, so can you!'' Yang Zhifa said,
frowning sternly. ``You really want to know the truth? Ask him what
time of day the discovery was made. Eh? Ask him what day and what
time, and see what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged to put aside the dispute for a moment and tell his
story, Yang Zhifa regained his calm and explained how the
terra-cotta warriors had come to be unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries farmers living to the east of Xian heard ancient
lore about the ghosts that lurked in the dry, forbidding soil. Only
now, Yang explained, is it evident that it was broken pieces of
terra cotta in the shape of human faces that scared the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1974 an unusually bad drought prompted the local
commune leader to send several farmers to dig a well in Lintong,
just outside Xian.
</P>
<P>
   It was about noon on the third day of digging, Yang Zhifa said,
when he and one other farmer were six feet deep in a cylindrical
hole and his shovel hit something hard.
</P>
<P>
   Digging it out, Yang Zhifa saw the better part of a torso-shaped
piece of terra cotta, carved in the shape of a warrior's tunic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought I had hit a brick,'' Yang recalled, eyes
sparkling at the memory. ``But when I scraped away the dirt, it was
the length of a full body.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the site of the well was only inches inside
the original front entrance of an underground vault, which was
eventually discovered to contain 6,000 life-size figures. The exact
spot is marked in today's excavated vault and will doubtless be
pointed out to Clinton, as it is to every visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another foot in the other direction and we would have
missed,'' Yang mused. ``I'd still be farming.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of his work brigade were terrified by Yang's
discovery and urged him to rebury it. But he was unafraid, he said,
and placed it in the back of three-wheeled cart and took it to the
county Cultural Relics Bureau for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   A local historian guessed that it was 100 years old or so. It
was not until months later, when visiting archaeologists from
Beijing were asked to examine the piece, that they gradually
figured out that it was actually a clue to something much larger.
</P>
<P>
   No written record of the terra-cotta vault existed, so
archaeologists were stunned as they uncovered its full length,
several hundred yards long _ and then found three smaller vaults
behind it. The excavation continues and will probably take decades
longer.
</P>
<P>
   At the tourist stores outside the site, the two old farmers may
continue their competing claims for just as long.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Quanyi seemed surprised when he was pressed for details of
how he had made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaaaah, the date and time were not so important,'' he said
dismissively. ``I was the one who found the arrows and swords
beside the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed even further, Yang Quanyi admitted that he might not
have been present ``at the first moment'' of discovery. Instead, he
insisted, there were six farmers who dug out the first pieces
together.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the competing claims, the two Yangs can agree on
one thing: they prefer sitting in a tourist shop, signing picture
books for $35 a month, to tilling the fields, no matter what may
lurk beneath the soil.

FLEMMI EXPECTED TO TESTIFY WHEN MOB HEARINGS RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The federal court hearings that have provided almost
daily revelations about the hidden world of FBI agents and their
prized informants have been suspended for now, without hearing from
the man whose affidavit started it all last summer:
gangster-turned-informant Stephen Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   When testimony resumes in August, Flemmi, the acknowledged
co-leader of the Irish mob and sometime FBI informant for 30 years,
is expected to finally take the stand. But what he will say _ and
what prosecutors will be allowed to ask him _ is still a matter of
debate, as shown by a hearing Wednesday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kenneth J. Fishman, doesn't want the government to ask Flemmi
about his alleged involvement of three unsolved murders _ including
the May 1981 murder of millionaire World Jai Alai owner Roger
Wheeler in Oklahoma, the May 1982 killing of fringe
gangster-turned-informant Edward ``Brian'' Halloran in Boston or
the August 1982 killing of World Jai Alai president John ``Jack''
Callahan in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi and his criminal partner, James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger were
suspects in the Wheeler murder but were never charged.  &UR;  &LR; Halloran
was killed four months after he began talking to the FBI about
Bulger and Flemmi's alleged involvement in the Wheeler killing.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran had told the FBI that Callahan claimed Flemmi was the
getaway driver for the Wheeler shooting and Bulger the back-up
driver. When the FBi questioned them in November 1983, Flemmi and
Bulger each denied they were involved in the three murders.
</P>
<P>
   In April, former FBI supervisor John Morris testified that he
told Bulger and Flemmi's handler, agent John Connolly, that
Halloran had implicated them in Wheeler's murder. But Connolly has
denied talking to Bulger and Flemmi about Halloran before Halloran
was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The issue outlined before Judge Mark L. Wolf Wednesday hinges on
the scope of Flemmi's testimony and whether he would have the right
to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if
asked about the three murders.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is considering whether extortion and racketeering charges
brought against Flemmi in 1995 should be dismissed. In a court
affidavit filed last June, Flemmi claims that Morris told him and
Bulger they could do anything as long as they didn't ``clip
anyone'' _ slang for murder. Morris has denied it.
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Fishman argued that the government should
not be allowed to ask Flemmi about subjects that Fishman does not
raise during direct examination of his client.
</P>
<P>
   That means, for instance, that if Fishman does not ask Flemmi
about the three murders, the government can't, either. Fishman
argued that the murders are not covered by the 1995 indictment
being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, does the government have the right to
cross-examine regarding any criminal conduct Mr. Flemmi is alleged
to have committed?'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman indicated that his questions to Flemmi will focus on the
allegations his client made in three affidavits filed last year,
none of which mention the murders of Wheeler, Halloran or Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant US Attorney Fred M. Wyshak Jr. said the wide scope
of the hearings _ which have featured a parade of witnesses called
by the defense and hundreds of pages of FBI documents detailing
Bulger and Flemmi's alleged criminal activity dating back to the
1960s _ have opened the door on those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have placed in play every crime Mr. Flemmi has
committed,'' argued Wyshak.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf has asked both sides to submit written arguments during the
break in testimony.

REPUBLICANS RETAIN SEAT IN SPECIAL ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory that Republicans trumpeted Wednesday
as a promising omen for the November elections, Heather Wilson, a
Republican, won a House seat on Tuesday in a special election in
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   But strategists on both sides said Mrs. Wilson's triumph over
Phil Maloof, a Democratic state senator, in holding a seat that has
been Republican for nearly three decades might say more about local
political dynamics than signal any shift in the larger electorate.
</P>
<P>
   While education was the overriding issue, Republicans in New
Mexico said their victory turned largely on the double-digit
showing of a Green Party candidate, who appeared to have siphoned
votes from Maloof, and from what their polling found was a
perception that Maloof was not up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson, a 37-year-old former New Mexico Cabinet officer who
was an arms negotiator in the Bush White House, will be sworn in
here on Thursday to complete the term of Rep. Steven Schiff, a
Republican who died of skin cancer in March.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious problem for Maloof was the strong finish of the
Green candidate, Robert Anderson. A similar scenario was played out
in New Mexico's Third Congressional District in May 1997 when Rep.
Bill Redmond, a Republican, defeated Eric Serna, a Democrat who
lost much of his support to a Green candidate, Carol Miller, who
drew 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a warning shot across the bow of all Democratic
candidates where there are active Green candidates,'' said Daniel
Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club, which had dispatched
organizers to Albuquerque to help Maloof. ``This demonstrates that
the Green Party can be a powerful force for defeating
pro-environmental candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson campaigned very little, he built name recognition
by appearing in televised debates with the other candidates. His
support may have come not simply from his position on the
environment; his appeal may have been that he offered voters a
respite from the negative attacks that marked the Maloof and Wilson
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With all but the absentee ballots tallied, Mrs. Wilson drew 45
percent; Maloof, 39 percent and Anderson, 15 percent. All three
have been nominated to run again in November for a full two-year
term. For weeks, polls had shown that the race was neck and neck in
the First Congressional District, which is about evenly split
between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that Mrs. Wilson's victory in her first
race for public office gives her an edge in the fall. Maloof drew
on his family fortune to outspend Mrs. Wilson by far, and Democrats
had hoped that he would win so the party would only have to wrest
10 seats from the Republicans to regain control of the House. The
national Democratic Party was so invested in the contest that it
sent Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore, among others, to the
district last weekend to campaign for Maloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides an enormous psychic boost to Republicans around
the country,'' said Glen Bolger, Mrs. Wilson's pollster, ``and more
importantly to Republicans in the House who have been reading three
months of stories about how the Democrats were going to retake
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolger said debates during the campaign were unusually helpful
to Mrs. Wilson because his surveys showed that Maloof turned off
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing voters said he had the intellect of a grape,'' Bolger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the impact of the Green candidate, Bolger said
Greens might not have voted at all had Anderson not been in the
race because Maloof registered an 82 percent unfavorable image
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, conceded in an interview that
Maloof would have been far better positioned in November had he won
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly better if you have the incumbent; there's no
question about that,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he intended to examine the strength of the Green
Party but that he was not prepared to say Anderson had cost the
Democrats the election.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who ran for president as the
Green candidate in 1996, said the outcomes in New Mexico this year
and last should be a wake-up call for Democrats to field more
progressive candidates. And he noted that Green candidates were
running in November in two of New Mexico's three congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is still in denial,'' he said. ``As
Greens begin fielding more candidates, we're going to see more of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloof, who is 31, pledged to spend what it takes to win in
November. ``Whatever the outcome,'' he said referring to Tuesday's
election, ``we still have November.''

PANEL DECRIES DECLINE OF CIVIC LIFE IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Public trust in politicians and government is about
as low as it can go, and neither good economic times nor some
encouraging social trends are getting Americans off the sidelines
and into the action of creating a more civil society, a new report
says.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Civic Renewal, a high-powered panel
of academics, business executives, and Washington insiders, issued
a failing report card Wednesday on the nation's moral health and
concluded the state of American civil life is as depressed as it
was during the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a time of hope for Americans,'' the report
said. ``And when we consider our economic circumstances, it is. But
when we assess our country's civic and moral condition, we are
deeply troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, co-director of Empower America, a conservative
think tank, and author of the morally prescriptive ``Book of
Virtues,'' co-chaired the commission along with former senator Sam
Nunn, a Georgia Democrat. They said they overcame their political
differences to agree that lack of civic participation is weakening
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corrosive cynicism has crippled our civic spirit, and a sense
of helplessness has zapped our civic strength,'' said Rebecca
Rimel, president of the Pew Charitable Trusts, the philanthropy
that sponsored the 18-month study of declining citizen
participation in the US political process.
</P>
<P>
   The result of these ill feelings, the commission said, is that
Americans have become a ``nation of spectators'' who, instead of
taking individual reponsibility for their communities and families,
stand on the sidelines and whine or sit in front of the television,
mindlessly clicking the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of us have become passive and disengaged,'' the
report said. ``Too many of us lack confidence in our capacity to
make basic moral and civic judgments, to join with our neighbors
... to make a difference. Never have we had so many opportunities
for participation, yet rarely have we felt so powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all: According to the panel, which studied social
trends over 25 years as well as new survey data, Americans fret
about weak families but don't work to strengthen them, deplore
pubic schools but won't help their children with homework, worry
about out-of-wedlock births but won't condemn them, complain about
vulgar TV shows but don't turn off the set, and reelect leaders
they say they distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans claim they are busier than they have ever been, that
they are stressed, stretched, and under extreme pressure for
time,'' said Bennett, who was President Reagan's education
secretary and President Bush's drug czar. ``Yet what we found is
that Americans have more leisure time than they ever have. They
watch more television than they ever have.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question about time is how are Americans spending it,
and are they giving up civic things in order to keep the boat, or
the second house, or fourth motorcycle?'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission report says that compared to earlier generations,
Americans today place less value on what they owe society and
whether they need to play by the rules or fulfill obligations as
citizens. At the same time, they express individual liberty by
valuing self-gratification and personal choice more, Nunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-member commission proposed a series of steps to civic
renewal, recommending that individuals join at least one civic
association, neighborhoods institute crime watches and clean-up
projects, and schools offer instruction in good citizenship and
historic documents, like the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing and abhoring the end of a civil society has become one
of Washington's most popular academic pursuits. This commission's
report is the latest in a series of studies looking at why
Americans distrust government and politicians, why they don't vote,
and whether their disengagement from civic life is somehow warping
the nation's moral fiber.
</P>
<P>
   It also has some practical consequences. Low voter turnout and
declining political activity _ from making fewer campaign
contributions to not volunteering for a candidate _ can affect the
outcome of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Solo, president of the nonprofit Institute for Civil Society
in Newton, says the commission's report ``misses the mark'' and is
typical of what happens when Washington's intellectual elite has a
conversation with itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I sit, this doesn't look to me like a nation of
spectators,'' Solo said. ``There is a lot of innovation and
creative activity going on at the grass-roots level, where people
are redefining community and what being involved means.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is most depressing because the elitists in
Washington treat local people like colonists and try to prescribe
their own 10-point training program for democracy,'' Solo said.
``What Americans have learned _ and the commission hasn't _ is that
national politics is not going to solve national problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the commission's report does note ``the stirrings of a
new movement of citizens acting together to solve community
problems.'' Because the movement operates on a shoestring and is
``nontraditional'' _ in other words, the impetus comes from
churches, foundations, and volunteers rather than government _ the
movement ``has gone largely unnoticed, unappreciated and
unsupported,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said another hopeful sign is some of the ``most
worrisome trends'' included in its index of national civic health
are turning around. Among them are crime rates, which have fallen
sharply in this decade; the lower divorce rate; improved school
performance; fewer teenage pregnancies; and even distrust in
government, which has leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal shouldn't be a leveling off at the bottom,'' Nunn
said. ``We've got to see the trendline _ and trust in government _
going up.''

HOUSE VOTES TO BLOCK APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an affirmation of its anti-abortion stance, the
House voted Wednesday to block the Food and Drug Administration
from approving an abortion-inducing pill.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA in 1996 had deemed the pill, RU-486, safe and effective
and allowed its use in limited, tightly controlled studies. But it
has not given final approval for the pill's general use.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents described the measure as a way to prevent the
use of taxpayer dollars to further the killing of unborn children;
abortion-rights advocates said the measure, which was attached to
an agriculture appropriations bill, was a circuitous way to try to
prevent women from having any kind of abortion, even one that they
say is the earliest, safest and least-invasive.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Wednesday's House action _ on a relatively close
vote of 223-202 _ is unclear. The measure came to public attention
with so little advance notice that its sponsor, Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., an obstetrician who has delivered more than 3,200 babies,
said he was still looking for someone to introduce it in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, even under Republican control, has been more
supportive of abortion rights than the House. But if a similar
measure did pass the Senate, it would present President Clinton
with a dicey political dilemma, and neither side would predict
Wednesday what he might do.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who supports abortion rights, has supported the
advancement of RU-486 in the past. But opposing this measure would
also mean vetoing the broader, politically appealing $56 billion
agriculture bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill provides $23 billion in food stamps, $609 million for
food-safety inspection and $2 billion for rural economic projects.
It also helps wheat farmers by exempting them from sanctions on
India and Pakistan for exploding nuclear devices and protects
subsidies for sugar processors and peanut farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for President Clinton, said the
administration opposed the bill. He said it would mistakenly allow
Congress to intervene in the drug-safety standards of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart stopped short of saying the president would veto
it. ``We're early in the process,'' he said, suggesting the Senate
would scrap the measure. ``We think we can solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, supporters of abortion rights were concerned that Clinton
could waver on this matter because he is under political pressure
on other fronts and has not held much sway lately on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This White House needs to issue a strong veto message
immediately,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., a leading defender in
the House of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has stood firm in allowing a procedure that
abortion opponents call partial-birth abortion, the administration
has sent signals that Clinton could side with the Republicans on
the most recent anti-abortion measure to arise in the House. The
bill would make it a crime for anyone to transport a minor across
state lines for an abortion. Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, recently wrote a letter to Congress saying that the
president would support the measure if it were properly drafted.
</P>
<P>
   And the difficulty of opposing the entire agriculture bill
because it contains anti-abortion language was demonstrated by the
House. The agriculture bill passed overwhelmingly, 373-48. It was
opposed by 23 Republicans and only 25 Democrats.

Getting foothold on soccer a pipe dream for U.S.
<TEXT>

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NANTES, France _ By nature, Americans aren't quitters. We're the
world's leading can-do country by far. Bigger, better, richer _
that's what Old Glory stands for.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, in soccer. Or football, as most of the rest
of the globe knows it.
</P>
<P>
   When the soon-to-be-unemployed U.S. coach, Steve Sampson,
accused his floundering team of, yikes, playing ``like Americans''
against Iran, he spoke a cruel truth. In the planet's most popular
sport, we remain second-rate. We're closer to being the Clippers
than we are to being the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Lots of reasons, none of which you need for me to
reiterate. They beg the obvious. A more to-the-point question is, I
think, ``Why should it make any difference?''
</P>
<P>
   We aren't very good in field hockey, team handball, table tennis
or cricket, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we don't play cricket, do we? Perhaps we shouldn't
play soccer, either.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not right. It provides wonderful exercise for our
kids without presenting a grave threat to their collarbones.
Anything that can drag America's youth away from MTV and Nintendo
for a couple hours a day definitely has merit.
</P>
<P>
   As for continuing our clearly quixotic quest to become a soccer
Goliath, however, it appears time to contemplate aborting the
mission with the current Coupe du Monde drawing to another dreary
conclusion for the overmatched U.S. entry.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to Yugoslavia here in this Brittany seaport tonight _ a
likely scenario given the demoralized, divided state of the U.S.
team, never mind the Yugos' practical need to whip the Yanks by as
many goals as possible _ will leave Sampson's Delilahs exactly
where America's starry-eyed kiddie contingent of 1990 stood in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-and-three. Zero points. Four-F in Group F. To date, the U.S.
has spent more than three hours scampering about the pitch and
scored one goal. In short, and in shorts, we are jogging in place.
This despite at least a generation-long effort to produce, in
sufficient quantities, men who can compete on reasonably equal
footing with the Ronaldos, Baggios and Zidanes.
</P>
<P>
   If it hasn't happened by now, people, it ain't going to happen.
Baseball is our, quote-unquote, national pastime, yet we can't
develop enough major-league pitchers to adequately fill out
rosters. How are we supposed to imagine strikers gifted enough to
play Premier League in England, much less star for Turin's
Juventus, AC Milan or Real Madrid? The notion is absurde!
</P>
<P>
   It's the same reason baseball goes begging for good arms. Our
best, and hungriest, athletes choose other pursuits. When the
children of the inner city start practicing headers and bicycle
kicks off graffiti-marked walls in Brooklyn, South Central LA or
Houston's Fifth Ward, then will we have a snowball's chance of
winning the World Cup. The American college system has no hope of
developing a team on par with the mighty Brazilians, Italians or,
for that matter, the war-weary Yugoslavians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer in the USA is still a very young sport,'' notes Vujadin
Boskov, Yugoslavia's wizened veteran of a half century in the game.
``(Americans) run a lot, work a lot, but they still do not have
outstanding individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody coached Michael Jordan into becoming Michael Jordan. He
had the right genes, and the requisite want-to, to evolve into the
world's greatest athlete. Had he picked soccer instead of hoops as
the sport he intended to dominate, he would be at least the equal
of any player anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't, because poor, black kids in rural, backwater
towns or teeming slums have no more exposure to soccer than a boy
in Marseille, Naples or So Paulo has to squash. They're more apt to
accidentally wind up with a 5-iron, or a hockey stick, in their
hands than wearing an Umbro shirt.
</P>
<P>
   So what's to lament? We can't be the best at everything. We must
pick our spots _ and sports _ and not fret about the rest. Soccer
doesn't need America's rabid interest to thrive, and we don't need
soccer to amuse us. Our society already misdirects too much energy
and resources toward jock pursuits at the expense of education and
public services.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Soccer Federation says it needs $40 million to
meet the demand for grants by local associations to upgrade their
programs, the heart stops pumping for a moment. Talk about throwing
good money after bad, particularly if the underlying goal is to
raise our own Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, the Federation's president, may have had the
best idea when he joked before the Iran defeat about dispatching
more U.S. servicemen to mingle with the populace in soccer's A-list
countries. Because fathering a soccer star abroad seems a far
easier proposition than growing him in the back yard.

BRUINS PLAY BY THE RULES IN EXPANSION DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In deciding whom to leave unprotected for Friday's NHL
expansion draft, the Bruins had to figure out how best to play by
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NHL guidelines that will be used for stocking
the Nashville Predators, Boston must expose at least one defenseman
and forward who played 40 games this year or 70 combined in the
last two years. President-general manager Harry Sinden said the
Bruins wanted to protect two goaltenders _ Byron Dafoe and Rob
Tallas _ which meant they could protect just three defensemen
initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allowed to protect one additional player, forward or
defenseman, and we chose to protect an extra (fourth) defenseman,''
said Sinden. ``Had we protected only one goaltender, we could've
protected five, but we were not in a position to lose a goalie. We
weren't going to leave Robbie exposed, anyway, but had we had any
thoughts of that, we wouldn't have done it after Byron's (shoulder)
surgery. That forced us to leave both Dave Ellett and Grant Ledyard
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellett's age (34) and sizable contract and Ledyard's age (36)
made it worth the calculated risk for Boston to expose them. Sinden
said he preferred to take a chance on losing them than someone like
25-year-old Darren Van Impe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think he's better than Ellett and Ledyard, but would
we lose him? I think there's a good chance we would,'' said Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   The likely forward to be lost is two-way center Mike Sullivan,
30. Sinden believes the Bruins have enough depth at the slot
position that if Sullivan is selected, they can absorb it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of deciding between him and Landon Wilson,''
said Sinden. ``I don't think they'll take Mike. Wilson is our
draft. We look at No. 19 (Boston's first-round pick, which Colorado
received in trade for Wilson and defenseman Anders Myrvold) and
say, `Would we sooner have what's there at 19 or have Wilson?' He's
only 23. To us, he's a way better prospect than anything that's
available at 19. He's got to play more, he's got to get better to
stick, but so would the No. 19 guy. It would've been different if
it were the top No. 6 or 8, but I think right now, by getting
Wilson, we got every bit as good a player as we would at No. 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible loss could be 32-year-old enforcer Ken
Baumgartner, a favorite of coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very important to the chemistry and the makeup of the
team,'' Sinden said. ``The coach feels he needs him badly, and I
agree with him. He could be drafted by Nashville. I'm led to
believe they won't, but he could be. If he is, we've got to look
somewhere else for that kind of a role player. But for $80 million
(the expansion fee), you've got to give up something. There are a
number of players like him available who are younger, and we knew
there would be, so you calculate that they'd take a younger player.
Whether they do or not, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario is that Nashville, which must take a player
from each of the 26 established clubs, could select a Bruin who can
become a free agent as of next Wednesday, anyway. That way, the
Predators would adhere to the rules, wouldn't have to sign the
player and thus would have more money to spend elsewhere, and the
Bruins really wouldn't lose anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the impression _ and it was only an impression _ that
they would take a player from us that they really didn't want and
just dump him, not even sign him,'' said Sinden. ``I call it a
throwaway pick. Then instead of taking on a contract, they would
take a throwaway pick and use the money to go out and get a
different free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden used defenseman Evgeny Shaldybin as an example. If the
Predators take him and don't make him a qualifying offer, Shaldybin
would be a total free agent. Nashville could use the money it
would've paid him to put toward an unrestricted free agent like
Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are allowed to take six people like that from across the
league,'' Sinden said. ``If they passed on six contracts, even at
$500,000 a player, that would give them $3 million to go out and
work with. There's a thinking (by other teams) that they're going
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for making deals, Sinden will wait to see how the expansion
draft plays out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if we lost a defenseman in the draft, we'd be
initiating something,'' he said. ``With Ellett and Ledyard, plus
the four we're protecting and Hal Gill, that gives us seven, which
is all we need here. We need another two or three in Providence who
could come up and play. Johnathan Aitken going down there makes
eight. On defense, we're not really deep in the organization right
now. Barry Richter and Jon Rohloff haven't really worked out, and
the Russians we tried haven't come around.''

MEDICARE EXPANDSDRUG SALES POTENTIAL OF AMGEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in biotechnology powerhouse Amgen Inc. rose
more than 6 percent Wednesday on news the government has expanded
reimbursement for one of the company's top-selling drugs and rumors
that a pharmaceutical company is considering a bid for Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks, Calif., Amgen shares rose $4.06 on Wednesday to
close at $66.75. The gain followed a similar rise Tuesday, bringing
the issue's two-day gain to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government said Wednesday that it will expand the
pool of Medicare patients eligible for subsidized Epogen, an Amgen
drug used to boost a patient's red blood cell count. Last year, the
Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said
only patients whose red blood cells accounted for less than 36.5
percent of the total volume of their blood over a three-month
period would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The government Wednesday changed the cutoff to 37.5 percent,
meaning more patients can receive the drug and those getting it can
be given higher doses. That should translate into increased sales
of Epogen, which generated about half of Amgen's 1997 revenues of
$2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly positive,'' said analyst Robert LeBoyer at
San Francisco-based Genesis Merchant Group Securities. ``It
eliminates the fear of penalties (on physicians prescribing Epogen)
and encourages higher dosing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Amgen's share price is now ``probably what I'd call close to
fully valued. Beyond this, you need new drugs coming out of the
pipeline to justify a higher price target,'' LeBoyer said.
</P>
<P>
   One additional factor that could boost the share price is
speculation over a buyout. Rumors that Johnson &AMP; Johnson is
considering a bid for Amgen were circulating Wednesday and likely
contributed to the stock's rise, said Prudential Securities analyst
Caroline Copithorne. But, she said, the two companies are not an
ideal fit.
</P>
<P>
   Because both firms have robust management and sales forces,
there would be redundancies that Johnson &AMP; Johnson would have to
pay for but which would add little to the combined organization's
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, they'd be paying for something they don't need,''
Copithorne said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors last month over a possible sale of Amgen to DuPont Co.
led to a similar _ but short-lived _ rise in Amgen's share price. &QL;

DOUGLAS HOPING TO REPEAT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION _ His face looked drawn and his
belly seemed to sag, fighting against the elastic of his purple
waistband as he stepped on the scales Wednesday. Buster Douglas was
ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it is for Douglas these days, eight years and
150 pounds having come and gone since the night he destroyed Mike
Tyson in Tokyo for the world heavyweight championship. That
evening, Douglas was a 231-pound, 29-year-old fanatic hell-bent on
only one thing: winning a fight. Thursday night he will be someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   When he enters the ring at Foxwoods to face a younger
heavyweight named Lou Savarese, Douglas will be a 242-pound,
38-year-old man who has lost a title and all those pounds just to
reach this point ... which is probably only one or two more
victories away from another shot at Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas will be seeking the first of those victories against
someone who appears to be his polar opposite. While Douglas looked
worn out and soft Wednesday, like a man who has lost too much
weight to rid himself of all the skin that once surrounded it,
Savarese looked like an action movie hero. At 234 1/2 rock-hard
pounds, the 32-year-old Savarese appeared to be everything Douglas
no longer was. But boxing is deceiving in that way. What you look
like and how you fight are often two different things, and that is
what Douglas will be counting on when he hitches up his shorts on
pay-per-view to risk future millions against a fighter who has lost
two of his last three but has the appearance of a guy who could
derail an old man in search of one last dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fighting him because he was the only one out there,
actually,'' said Douglas (36-5-1) when asked why he was risking
what's left of his future against Savarese (36-2), who is barely a
year removed from a split-decision loss to George Foreman. ``We
thought we had other opportunities but we didn't have a ton of
smart possibilities. I expect him to come to fight, but this kid is
going to get peppered. He's going to get totally outclassed.
Totally outgunned. Totally outmanned.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is, Douglas will have won his seventh straight fight since
a six-year layoff that came after he lost the titles he'd won from
Tyson to Evander Holyfield in his next outing. By the time Douglas
collapsed from a punch in the nose from Holyfield, he had learned
that Shakespeare's King Lear was right about the difficulties of
ruling the kingdom, regardless of what kingdom we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,'' Lear once
lamented. And Douglas learned that firsthand after being peppered
by lawsuits before he found himself outclassed, outgunned, and
outmanned by Holyfield and a battery of lawyers for Steve Wynn, Don
King, and John Johnson (his former manager).
</P>
<P>
   After that fight, Douglas walked away from boxing and began to
eat. And eat. And eat. He ate until he weighed nearly 400 pounds
and lay in a diabetic coma. Then it was back to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this for my health, but it's changed,'' Douglas
said. ``Now it's an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity is to relive a moment that ran too short. It is
the opportunity to get another shot at Tyson or Holyfield or the
title World Boxing Council champion Lennox Lewis now owns. It is an
opportunity to save his health and his spirit, which was lost in
boxing's maze after he became the accidental champion that glorious
night in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this started again, really, all I wanted was a chance to
rewrite things with Holyfield,'' Douglas said. ``Now all three of
them are about the same to me, and it's exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more joyous now than it was in 1990. I guess it's a
little surprising it got to this, because by the latter part of
last year, it didn't look like things would work out (proposed
fights with John Ruiz, Roy Jones Jr., and Lewis collapsed). Now I
hear my name mentioned with the Big Three, so I'm ready to fight
Savarese for this little (International Boxing Association) title
and then go after a world title ... or that little punk.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it always seems to come back to that little punk when
Buster Douglas's name is in the conversation. He was the first to
lick Godzilla, the first to show what was really behind the curtain
in the Land of Oz. He was the first to destroy Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are still many fight fans who will argue that it was
all just a fluke, that Douglas happened to be a 42-1 shot in the
right place at the right time to beat a guy who mentally had been
worn down by his own sad circumstances. Buster Douglas understands
those people, just as he understands the risk he is taking night
against Savarese.
</P>
<P>
   But he is unconcerned because he believes another chance is
coming and Lou Savarese will provide it for him, and when it
arrives, he will answer both the bell and those charges one last
time, just like he did that night in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll knock his ass out again,'' Douglas said of Tyson.
``Holyfield beat a shell of what I beat. That (expletive) punk.
It'll be easier this time. It'll be just like what's going to
happen to this kid Savarese. He's going to get peppered. He's going
to get totally outgunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings Buster Douglas back to the man he is really
chasing. Back to Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is Holyfield he wants, not Mike Tyson. It is
Holyfield, not Lennox Lewis; Holyfield, not Lou Savarese;
Holyfield, not another world title. It is Holyfield and Holyfield
alone because it was he who took Douglas's self-esteem when he
knocked him on his back nine minutes into their meeting in Las
Vegas, leaving him lying on the floor with no desire to get up even
though many thought he could.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson may be in his future, but Evander Holyfield is why
Douglas will risk millions Thursday night against Tyson. He risks
them to one day get back in front of Evander Holyfield and stay
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to get the opportunity to show him my best,'' Douglas
said. ``His time is short, but I do think there's a chance,
especially with the Henry Akinwande fight falling out. He doesn't
really have many competitive opponents, either.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Douglas heard his name called. It was time to strip
down to his shorts, his lower abdomen hanging low like a
gunfighter's belt. He looked like an old man in front of the
bathroom mirror, gravity winning a fight with his waistline.
</P>
<P>
   But he stood there, anyway, half-naked, and weighed in before
posing next to Savarese, who looked so much younger and so much
stronger and so much more like a fighter than Buster Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he went back to his room, his trainer, John Russell,
by his side, knowing that what he looks like at a weigh-in won't
matter Thursday night. What will matter is what he does. And as he
shuffled away, one of his supporters looked at him and said,
``Buster's going to walk through this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the looks of the two of them, it hardly seemed possible,
but eight years ago, this same man stood in a similar situation
with another fighter no one thought he could beat, and the rest is
history. By late Thursday night, either Lou Savarese or Buster
Douglas will be, too.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Being a shareholder in Bufete Industrial has been
rough going lately.
 &HT;    The Mexican construction and engineering company lost three big
public tenders last year after management all but promised it would
win at least one. Its backlog of projects grew, but didn't provide
much cash flow to pay the debts weighing down its balance sheet.
And the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) continued to delay
payment of a three-year-old Bufete receivable worth at least US$65
million, a further drag on the bottom line.
 &HT;    This year could be different. New tenders will provide new
chances to win a brass ring, Mexico's construction recovery could
boost revenues 20 percent to 30 percent from Bufete's level of $495
million last year, and the CFE might finally pay up.
 &HT;    With some good news to trumpet, markets might even take stock of
the strength of Bufete's underlying strategy: Since 1994, the
company has diversified its business within Mexico and successfully
expanded abroad, laying the groundwork for a sturdy, well-tempered
balance sheet.
 &HT;    But only the groundwork. For now, Bufete needs to reduce its
$280 million debt load, interest payments on which essentially
cancel out operating profits. ``The balance sheet is definitely an
issue, as well as investors' frustration regarding the CFE
payment,'' says Gordon Lee, an analyst with Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell in Mexico City.
 &HT;    Bufete could also regain market confidence by proving it can
still win large public tenders. Much of last year's discontent
regarding Bufete came from its failure to win one of the contracts
tendered by state-owned oil monopoly Pemex, worth around $1 billion
each.
 &HT;    Worst of all, Bufete and several Japanese partners lost the
contract to refurbish Pemex's Cadereyta refinery near Monterrey to
an upstart alliance of Mexico's Tribasa, South Korea's Sunkyong
Engineering and Germany's Siemens _ even though the project's
premium engineering work is Bufete's specialty.
 &HT;    Jarringly, the Bufete group's bid was nearly double the
winner's, leading to speculation that one of them misunderstood the
requirements.
 &HT;    It's not clear who erred or how, but the debacle made Bufete
look amateurish.
 &HT;    Financial strength became crucial in Mexico's construction
industry in the wake of the economic crisis of 1995, as Pemex and
the CFE introduced projects that were financed by the contractors _
and their foreign partners with better access to foreign financing.
That shift did not play to Bufete's traditional strengths, but with
a return this year to direct financing by the state companies,
Bufete's strong engineering skills could help it win one or more of
three large refinery refurbishments in Ciudad Madero, Salina Cruz,
and Minatitlan. Each is reckoned to be worth as much as $800
million. Winning one could be an immediate shot in the arm for
Bufete's stock.
 &HT;    ``Operating profits are very sensitive to movement in [revenue]
growth, because operating costs are pretty steady,'' says Sebastian
Shatel, an analyst with Caspian Research in Mexico City. ``The
outlook for Bufete is more positive just because of that.'' Big
projects get headlines and boost stock prices, but counting on them
is risky. Indeed, Jose Mendoza, Bufete's president, moved to reduce
Bufete's traditional reliance on Pemex and the CFE in 1994, and
seems to have succeeded. While the big disappointments of last year
dominated the market's attention, Bufete also proved itself a
diversified company with important foreign interests and a good mix
of domestic projects.
 &HT;    In late 1994, Bufete took its first big step abroad by buying
the Chilean construction firm Ovalle Moore. Even as Mexico copied
Chile in everything from telecommunications liberalization to the
introduction of a private pension plan, Bufete learned that the
Southern Cone country's construction industry was fragmented and
actually less advanced than Mexico's. By introducing its own
technology and management ideas, it has turned Ovalle Moore into a
market leader _ and the source of nearly 25 percent of Bufete's
revenues last year. Bufete is also active in Argentina, built a
refinery in Ecuador, and has even ventured into the United States
with simple projects such as housing complexes and schools.
 &HT;    With so much foreign activity, more than 50 percent of Bufete's
1997 revenues were in dollars (some of which came from Mexican
projects denominated in dollars). That percentage should fall a bit
this year if the company's core Mexican operations make a comeback,
but it will also provide a nice cushion against any future peso
surprises. Within Mexico, the company won a project to build
low-income housing in Tabasco _ not glamorous work but something
that allows Bufete to keep its foot in the door of a fast-growing
market.
 &HT;    With continued diversification, serious debt reduction and a bit
of luck in scoring a big contract this year, shareholders could
smile again.

ANALYSIS: AT&AMP;T-TCI MERGER IS DRIVEN BY THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: AT&AMP;T-TCI, AT&AMP;T-FCC, AT&AMP;T-EXECS,
AT&AMP;T-MARKETPLACE)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A telephone giant agrees to acquire the cable company
Tele-Communications Inc. in a bold move that promises to redefine
the communications landscape. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It should. Nearly five years ago, another big phone company,
Bell Atlantic struck a merger agreement with the same cable giant.
But that deal, which soon unraveled, was based on the vague plan of
morphing telephone and cable networks into an ``information
highway'' with 500 channels of interactive television _ something
no one could be certain consumers even wanted.
</P>
<P>
   So what is different now that that would prompt AT&AMP;T to spend
$48 billion to buy TCI? In two words: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to merge, AT&AMP;T and TCI are not so much gambling on a
vague vision of the future but betting they can help satisfy the
proven public demand for high-speed connections to the global
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Though few would have predicted it back in 1993, the Internet
and its multimedia World Wide Web have become that vaunted
information highway _ and the main vehicle for driving it is not a
television set but an increasingly TV-like computer.
</P>
<P>
   These days, tens of millions of households are regularly surfing
the Web to download text, images, sound and video clips and to chat
on America Online or other Internet access services.
</P>
<P>
   So important has the Internet become to so many people's lives,
in fact, that the average amount of time Americans spent watching
television declined for the first time last year since television's
invention. And for the first time, more messages were sent via
electronic mail than through the post office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted 500 channels,'' said Eric Paulak, a
telecommunications analyst for the Gartner Group. ``Today, what
people do want is Internet access.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than chasing an elusive vision, then, AT&AMP;T and TCI are
scrambling to keep pace with a race to use phone networks, cable
networks and other means to provide consumers and businesses with
connections to the Internet _ a race that involves not only other
cable titans like Time Warner and ambitious phone companies like
MCI-Worldcom, but also competitors like America Online that were
barely visible five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as AT&AMP;T began talking to TCI days ago, the phone
company was still trying to arrange a merger with America Online,
which decided to remain independent _ at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the home computer caused a whole lot of changes over
the last 10 years, there is going to be new revolution in
telecommunications,'' said Barry Schuler, the president of creative
development at America Online. ``When you are chatting with someone
on AOL, you will be able to click a button and your phone will ring
and you can talk to them by voice.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, primarily a long-distance telephone carrier, with 90
million customers, and TCI _ still mainly a cable company, serving
13 million homes _ are already dabblers in Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's generic Worldnet Internet access service has attracted
about 1 million customers on the strength of its brand name and an
initial offering of a year of free service.
</P>
<P>
   TCI owns about 40 percent of At Home Network, which is
developing technology and information and entertainment content for
high-speed Internet access over television cables. While phone
networks have the advantage of being able to route traffic
virtually anywhere on the system, cable networks have a much higher
carrying capacity _ which on the Internet translates to higher
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both companies know the network future lies not in today's
telephone-network or cable-system technologies but in providing
consumers and businesses with high-speed network access based on
Internet technology _ whether for data transfers, voice
conversations or, yes, eventually even TV-quality video.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet traffic can flow over phone wires or cable lines
or even wireless radio waves, the Internet itself employs a
transmission format that is far more efficient and flexible than
conventional telephone or cable systems and seems destined
eventually to render those conventional systems obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be no difference between local and long
distance, between voice and data, between voice mail and e-mail,''
said Howard Anderson of the Yankee Group, a telecommunications
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such a network is so flexible, that everything from
thermostats to refrigerators to door locks are being designed that
can be linked to the Internet so they can be controlled remotely by
the owners.

 Por BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO, D.F. _ En los ultimos tiempos, ser accionista de Bufete
Industrial no ha sido facil.
 &HT;    La empresa mexicana de construccion e ingenieria perdio tres
licitaciones en 1997 despues que la gerencia casi prometio que
ganaria por lo menos una. Su lista de proyectos crecio, pero no
ofrecio mucho flujo de caja para pagar las deudas. Y la Comision
Federal de Electricidad (CFE) siguio retrasando el pago de una
cuenta de US$65 millones de hace tres anos, un nuevo golpe para la
firma.
 &HT;    Este ano podria ser distinto. Nuevas licitaciones ofreceran
oportunidades de obtener grandes contratos, la recuperacion de la
construccion en Mexico podria aumentar los ingresos del 20 por
ciento al 30 por ciento por encima de los US$495 millones del ano
pasado, y la CFE quiza pague al fin.
 &HT;    Con varias buenas noticias que anunciar, los mercados podrian
incluso aprovechar la fortaleza de la estrategia fundamental de
Bufete: desde 1994, la empresa se ha diversificado en Mexico y se
ha ampliado fuera del pais, sentando las bases de un balance
general solido.
 &HT;    Pero esos so solamente los preparativos. Por ahora, Bufete
necesita reducir su deuda de US$280 millones, porque el pago de los
intereses practicamente elimina las ganancias operativas. ``La
cuenta de resultados es un problema decisivo, al igual que la
frustracion de los inversionistas con la cuestion del pago de
CFE,'' dice Gordon Lee, analista de Deutsche Morgan Grenfell en
Mexico DF.
 &HT;    Bufete tambien podria recuperar la confianza del mercado
demostrando que aun puede ganar grandes licitaciones. Gran parte
del descontento del ano pasado con Bufete se debio a que no obtuvo
ninguno de los contratos de Pemex, de casi US$1.000 millones cada
uno.
 &HT;    Lo peor de todo: Bufete y varios socios japoneses perdieron el
contrato para renovar la refineria Cadereyta, de Pemex, cerca de
Monterrey, a manos de una nueva alianza de Tribasa (Mexico),
Sunkyong Engineering (Corea del Sur) y Siemens (Alemania), aunque
la principal obra de ingenieria del proyecto es la especialidad de
Bufete.
 &HT;    Curiosamente, la oferta de Bufete fue casi el doble de la del
ganador. No esta claro que sucedio, pero el desastre le hizo perder
credibilidad a Bufete.
 &HT;    La fortaleza financiera se hizo crucial en la industria mexicana
de la construccion a raiz de la crisis de 1995, cuando Pemex y CFE
iniciaron proyectos financiados por los contratistas y sus socios
extranjeros con mejor acceso al financiamiento foraneo. Ese cambio
no favorecio los puntos fuertes tradicionales de Bufete, pero con
un regreso este ano al financiamiento directo de las empresas
estatales, la fuerte capacidad ingeniera de Bufete podria ayudarlo
a ganar una o mas de tres grandes obras de renovacion de refinerias
en Ciudad Madero, Salina Cruz y Minatitlan. Cada una se valora en
US$800 millones y ganar le daria impulso inmediato a las acciones
de Bufete.
 &HT;    ``Las ganancias operativas son muy sensibles al movimiento de
los ingresos totales debido a que los costos operativos son muy
estables,'' dice Sebastian Shatel, analista de Caspian Research en
Mexico D.F. ``Las perspectivas de Bufete son mas positivas
simplemente debido a eso.''
 &HT;    Las grandes obras acaparan titulares y elevan los precios de las
acciones, pero contar con ellas es algo arriesgado. Jose Mendoza,
presidente de Bufete, planeo reducir la tradicional dependencia de
Bufet de Pemex y CFE en 1994, y parece haber triunfado. A pesar de
las grandes decepciones del ano pasado, Bufete mostro que era una
compania diversificada con importantes intereses en el extranjero y
una cifra respetable de obras nacionales.
 &HT;    A fines de 1994, Bufete dio su primer gran paso en el exterior
al comprar la constructora chilena Ovalle Moore. Aunque Mexico
copio a Chile en todo, desde la liberalizacion de las
telecomunicaciones hasta la creacion de un plan de pensiones
privadas, Bufete advirtio que la industria de la construccion en
Chile estaba fragmentada y, en realidad, menos adelantada que la
mexicana. Al introducir su propia tecnologia y sus ideas
gerenciales, ha convertido a Ovalle Moore en un lider del mercado y
en la fuente de casi el 25 por ciento de los ingresos de Bufete el
ano pasado. Bufete tambien tiene presencia en Argentina, construyo
una refineria en Ecuador y hasta se ha aventurado en EU con obras
sencillas como escuelas y urbanizaciones.
 &HT;    Con tanta actividad en el exterior, mas del 50 por ciento de los
ingresos de Bufete en 1997 fueron en dolares. Esa cifra debe bajar
un poco este ano si las operaciones esenciales de la compania en
Mexico se recuperan, pero tambien ofrecera proteccion contra
cualquier sorpresa futura del peso. En Mexico la empresa consiguio
un proyecto de construccion de viviendas en Tabasco, una obra nada
llamativa pero que permite a Bufete mantener una presencia en un
mercado de rapido crecimiento.
 &HT;    Con la constante diversificacion, una gran reduccion de la deuda
y un poco de suerte que le otorgue un gran contrato este ano, los
accionistas podrian sonreir de nuevo.

AT&AMP;T TO ACQUIRE TCI, NATION'S SECOND BIGGEST CABLE PROVIDER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest telephone company, said Wednesday
that it had agreed to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the second
biggest cable television provider, for $31.8 billion in stock in a
deal that is the most ambitious product yet of the 1996
deregulation of the telecommunications industry by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will assume TCI's debt of about $11 billion and will pay
$5.5 billion in cash to repurchase shares it issued to TCI in a
previous transaction. AT&AMP;T will also acquire TCI's interest in a
venture that delivers Internet data over television cables. That
gives the deal a total value of about $48.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combining AT&AMP;T's financial muscle and nation-spanning
communications network with TCI's wires into millions of homes
would create a communications behemoth with a reach unrivaled since
AT&AMP;T spun off its local phone operations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, behemoths in general are not what they used to be in
the communications industry. Since the Telecommunications Act of
1996 was signed two years ago, huge mergers have become almost
common in the industry, with the seven Bell local phone companies
agreeing to become four and MCI Communications Corp. making a deal
to be acquired by Worldcom Inc. for $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal between AT&AMP;T and TCI could be the first to make a
concrete difference in how everyday consumers purchase and use
communications services. By giving AT&AMP;T an electronic path into
millions of homes and apartments, the acquisition could create
vibrant competition in the market for local telephone service for
the first time since AT&AMP;T's predecessor was led by Alexander Graham
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they wanted to begin selling digital
phone and data service over the cable system by the end of next
year but would not commit to a firm timetable for deployment. The
companies said they would begin to bundle and jointly market one
another's existing services as soon as possible, even before the
deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   TCI and its affiliates have run wires past about a third of the
nation's households. So even after acquiring the cable giant, AT&AMP;T
would not have a clear path into the local market for most of the
nation's consumers. And it is not entirely clear how difficult and
expensive it will be to adapt TCI's cable networks, which are
generally designed to transmit information in only one direction,
for use in two-way data and voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what C. Michael Armstrong, who took over as AT&AMP;T's
chairman just last November, intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't deliver on the promise of the telecom act of
'96, I've just missed my bet,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
Armstrong said he was sending a message to the Bell companies,
which dominate the local phone business: ``We intend to show up.
Also, many in Washington had some doubt that AT&AMP;T was serious about
pursuing the $110 billion local exchange business, and this mutes
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hectic pace of communications mergers has raised hackles on
Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission. But the
commission's chairman, William Kennard, approached the AT&AMP;T
announcement with an encouraging attitude on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies bring some synergies that are quite
compelling,'' he said in an interview. ``They're not direct
head-to-head competitors but both of them have said in the past
that they want to offer a package of services to consumers. If
through the combination they are able to bundle services and be
more competitive with the incumbent providers, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard added that his review would hinge on the details of the
companies' plans, which he had not yet seen. But his positive
comments were very different from the reaction AT&AMP;T received the
last time it tried to break into local markets through acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   After news emerged last summer that AT&AMP;T was negotiating to
acquire SBC Communications, the Bell company that provides local
phone service in much of the West, Reed Hundt, then the
commission's chairman, called such a deal ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI had a preliminary agreement to be acquired by Bell Atlantic
Corp. in 1993, but those talks fell apart amid antitrust concerns.
The two common communications pipelines into homes are the phone
wire and the cable television wire. By acquiring TCI, Bell Atlantic
would have eliminated a potential competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has minimal presence in local markets, and by acquiring
TCI it could potentially become a more formidable competitor
against its former subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group, said the deal held
promise but added a note of skepticism about AT&AMP;T's intentions of
competing for local phone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deal that is the make-it-or-break-it for the
telecom act,'' he said. ``This is the first proposal for
cross-industry competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Using industry shorthand for telephone calls, he added: ``Every
effort to use the cable wire for telephony has been less than
successful. I'm concerned that AT&AMP;T maybe is buying the cable cash
cow and milking it for profits and hoping _ hoping _ that it can be
used for telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI is in the first phase of a $1.7 billion project to upgrade
its networks to offer advanced service. But Malone said that TCI
had little chance to buy the asset it needs most for the future: a
widely recognized brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a strong, well-established communications brand our
penetration with these sorts of services would be adversely
affected,'' Malone said. ``It would be virtually impossible for my
company to construct a brand on our own to enter that space.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why all TCI services will be sold under the AT&AMP;T name.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, holders of TCI Series A stock would
receive .7757 shares of AT&AMP;T. Holders of the cable companies'
Series B stock, including Malone, would receive .8533 shares of
AT&AMP;T stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T expects to finish the deal in the first half next year. The
company said the acquisition would dilute its earnings for the
first two years after the deal's completion and add to its earnings
after that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malone would join AT&AMP;T's board and remain chairman of Liberty
Media, TCI's programming wing, which would remain under his control
even as its stock became a so-called tracking stock of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would fold TCI's cable assets into its consumer business
and spin off that unit as another tracking stock. John Zeglis,
AT&AMP;T's president, would become chairman of the consumer unit while
Leo Hindery, TCI's president, would become the unit's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong would remain at the helm of the AT&AMP;T parent company,
which would retain the company's network operation and the units
that sell services to business customers and other communications
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a AT&AMP;T and TCI combination started last November
when Armstrong visited Malone to discuss ways the two companies
could work together, the two men said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies began final negotiations just last Tuesday,
they said. Several days ago, a small team of executives from both
companies holed up with their advisers to hammer out the details of
an agreement, said a person close to those talks. By Monday,
Armstrong and Malone were spending long hours at the offices of
AT&AMP;T's law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, in face-to-face
meetings hashing out the final details.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month AT&AMP;T held preliminary discussions with
America Online Inc., the No. 1 provider of access to cyberspace,
about a merger between the two companies, but America Online was
not interested in such a deal.

XIAN SCRAMBLES TO READY ITSELF FOR CLINTON'S ARRIVAL

<P>
   XIAN, China _ With just 24 hours to go before President
Clinton's arrival here, this city was madly at work putting the
finishing touches on its latest make-over.
</P>
<P>
   Although most everyone knew that Clinton was coming here soon,
it was only Wednesday morning that the local news media announced
that the big day was Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As if anyone needed an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   On Weiyang Road leading into town from the airport, ads and
slogans had been removed from factory walls, covered with a fresh
coat of whitewash. The police were standing on freshly painted
traffic kiosks. And orange cones that stretched for miles guarded
freshly painted divider lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xian is very dusty so they've even dusted off the greenery,''
said a taxi driver who gave his name as Ma. ``I hope President
Clinton doesn't nap on the way into town, otherwise this will all
be for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are part of the scenery in China. But even for China,
their presence around this city of 2.7 million people was huge,
with police cars and motorcycles outnumbering civilian cars on some
stretches of highway.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, police seemed far outnumbered by the small armies
of street cleaners in bright orange vests who crouched at the edge
of streets like the busy Second Ring Road, meticulously sweeping
every last speck of dust into sewers or dustpans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sub-district government had a meeting last week and told
us that Clinton was coming so we should keep the city especially
clean,'' said Li Putan, 62, a migrant worker from Gansu province
who was raking, then sweeping, a seemingly spotless patch of dirt
across from Xiaoyanta Park.
</P>
<P>
   Pedicabs, ordinarily a common form of transport in Xian, were
ordered off the street two weeks ago. Pedicab drivers have
organized demonstrations to protest, but none of that was apparent
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some factory workers, like those at the Xian Petrochemical
Plant, said long-overdue pension payments had been paid in full so
that all would be calm for the presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, workers had hung dozens of red lanterns at the
elegant South Gate of Xian's old city wall, where the president
will be welcomed in an elaborate ceremony Thursday evening. For the
moment, each lantern remained carefully wrapped in its plastic bag.
Enormous rolls of red carpet lay piled on the pavement, waiting to
be laid out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome Americans,'' said Liu Yongchen, a balding retired
factory worker who now runs a toy stall in the cavernous, private
Changle Market.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he had heard of the Clinton visit, he replied:
``The owner of the mall called us all to a meeting last week and
told us to welcome Americans. Everything is pre-arranged here!''

 &HT;    MERGER PRESENTS ANTITRUST REGULATORS WITH A DILEMMA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The AT&AMP;T Corp.'s proposed $68 billion takeover of
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. will be closely examined by
federal officials in a regulatory high-wire act destined to shape
the way American homes and businesses buy telephone services worth
more than $1 trillion a year.
</P>
<P>
   As details of the proposed mega-merger developed Wednesday, it
wasn't clear whether the Justice Department or the Federal
Communications Commission would ultimately be charged with deciding
whether to bless the deal or condemn it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be reviewing that,'' Attorney General Janet Reno told
reporters, ''but there is no final decision that has been made with
respect to whether the FCC would handle it or we would handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the issues will revolve around a question that has
perplexed telecommunications regulators ever since the government
ordered AT&AMP;T to spin off its regional companies in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   That question, put simply, is: When must regulators intervene to
promote increased choices and improved prices for consumers of
telecommunications services, and when should they get out of the
way and let technology and market dynamics play that role?
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma has been complicated by technological advances that
have revolutionized telecommunications over the past 14 years,
turning an industry built on copper wire, creosote-soaked poles and
dial tones into a global web of satellite signals, cell phones and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When the government broke up Ma Bell, it essentially split the
industry into two parts: the regional ``Baby Bells'' such as
Atlanta-based BellSouth would offer local service, while AT&AMP;T and a
handful of competitors would provide long-distance service, relying
on the regional companies to relay the calls to homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side of the industry was ever fully satisfied with being
shut out of the other _ by regulations, in the case of the Baby
Bells, and by the high cost of installing local lines and switching
systems, in the case of the long-distance carriers _ of part of the
telephone business.
</P>
<P>
   Buying TCI would give AT&AMP;T something it currently doesn't have:
a wire into millions of homes. With some engineering changes, that
wire could carry high-quality telephone calls and extremely fast
connections to the Internet as easily as it carries cable
television signals.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, would enable AT&AMP;T to provide one-stop shopping
for millions of consumers, something the telecommunications
behemoth has wanted since the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ''This goes back to 1984,'' said former AT&AMP;T executive Douglas
Dunn, dean of the graduate school of industrial administration at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ''It has been AT&AMP;T's
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   By enabling AT&AMP;T to provide a full bundle of telecommunications
services, said Dunn, the merger would increase competition and
promote increased options for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Justice Department is concerned, Dunn said, that
should satisfy any potential anti-trust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is it's a free ride through Justice,'' said Dunn.
''The FCC's going to have a much tougher time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the FCC is charged with actually enhancing
competition, not merely protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This merger is eminently thinkable,'' FCC Chairman William
Kennard said Wednesday in a speech to the Federal Communications
Bar Association, ''but only if there are tangible consumer
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is already under challenge by the Baby Bells to allow
them to compete in the lucrative long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act was designed to facilitate their
entry into long-distance, but the Baby Bells aren't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, for instance, hasn't been able to win federal
approval to offer long-distance rates, said the company's
Washington spokesman, Bill McCloskey.
</P>
<P>
   If the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal is approved, he said, it could crack open
the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have an increased urgency for the FCC to allow us into the
long distance market,'' McCloskey said, ''because you have a major
competitor now able to come in and offer the kind of services
people want _ everything on one bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst John Mayo, a professor of economics, business
and public policy at Georgetown University, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one seems to have, at least on its face, an essentially
pro-competitive engine driving it,'' Mayo said of the proposed
AT&AMP;T-TCI merger.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing a raft of industry mega-mergers _ last year's $22.7
billion wedding between Bell Atlantic and NYNEX; a pending takeover
of MCI Communications Corp. by WorldCom for $37 billion; and SBC
Communications Inc.'s proposed $62 billion merger with Ameritech _
some analysts see consolidation resulting in fewer choices, not
more, for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of a larger story of how the telecommunications
law (of 1996) is one of the greatest has-beens that never was of
all time,'' said George Kleinfeld, an attorney with extensive
global telecommunications experience with the Washington firm of
Rogers &AMP; Wells. ''The giants have decided to consolidate or to
cooperate, to make the market less, rather than more, competitive.
This is just one more example of that rather sad trend.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC Commissioner Susan Ness, not surprisingly, doesn't see it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the core of FCC merger policy is that merger review helps
to promote the pro-competitive, deregulatory framework established
by Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996,'' Ness testified
Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee. ''Signs of budding
competition are emerging.''

PERU PREMIER OFFERS TO QUIT IN DISPUTE OVER AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Peru's prime minister of three weeks said Wednesday
that he had offered to resign after President Alberto Fujimori
rejected his suggestion to pardon an American imprisoned on
terrorism charges. Fujimori declined the resignation offer.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra sparked a storm of
congressional protests when he said Sunday that the 1996 military
trial of Lori Helene Berenson, a 28-year-old former New York
resident, was legally flawed and should be annulled.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Fujimori emphatically and swiftly rejected the
suggestion that Ms. Berenson be expelled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Valle Riestra, in a radio interview Wednesday, said he was in
``a difficult emotional situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in a difficult situation because I can't be in
continual and constant disagreement with majority opinion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since his surprise appointment as coordinator of Fujimori's
cabinet only three weeks ago, Valle Riestra has made a series of
statements opposing government policy that have puzzled foreign
diplomats and local journalists alike.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day as prime minister, he said he opposed
Fujimori's expected bid for a third term in 2000. Soon after, Valle
Riestra said he disagreed with the government's plan to use
military courts to try common criminals. And he has suggested that
several Cabinet members be dismissed and replaced by human rights
lawyers who have been critical of Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Valle Riestra's televised statement on Sunday about
Ms. Berenson that left him isolated from the entire Fujimori
administration and much of the political establishment. Newspaper
editorials harshly criticized him, as did several prominent
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Valle Riestra said Ms. Berenson should be pardoned because of a
lack of due process and ``for reasons of state and for the sake of
Peru's prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berenson has been held in a tiny cell high in the Andes
since her conviction in January 1996 by a tribunal that did not
allow her lawyers to question evidence or to cross-examine
witnesses. She was accused of aiding the Marxist guerrilla group
Tupac Amaru in a plan to take the Peruvian Congress hostage. Ms.
Berenson said she was innocent but expressed sympathy for the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's choice of Valle Riestra came as a complete surprise.
The 67-year-old constitutional lawyer and former congressman had
long been a member of the leftist APRA party and an advocate of
human rights. But with Fujimori's standing in the polls falling,
the economy jeopardized by the Asian economic crisis, and sensitive
negotiations with Ecuador over a border dispute entering a crucial
stage, several experts said the president was looking to broaden
his base and improve his image by naming a liberal to be prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Valle Riestra sounded tired and frustrated,
as if acknowledging that his efforts to push reforms in the
Fujimori administration had failed. But by an afternoon news
conference, he sounded defiant again, as if Fujimori's refusal to
accept his resignation signified a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue in this struggle, even when I oppose the chief
of state,'' he told reporters, shaking his fist. ``All the
repressive acts of this government must be opposed, and that is
what I will continue to do.''

JUDGE QUESTIONS USE OF CONSUMER LAW IN HANDGUN SAFETY EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Superior Court judge questioned Wednesday whether
state Attorney General Scott Harshbarger has the authority under
the state's consumer protection law to require handgun
manufacturers to meet new standards for quality and safety.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing on a request by gunmakers to block a new set of
handgun safety regulations, Judge Diane Kottmyer said Harshbarger's
approach could have an effect on every product sold in
Massachusetts _ not just those handguns Harshbarger believes are
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's simply no way to narrow a (legal) holding that the
attorney general has the authority to issue these regulations so
they do not apply across every line of product sold in
Massachusetts,'' Kottmyer told Assistant Attorney General Glenn S.
Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan argued the regulations &UR;  &LR; Harshbarger announced last
spring are narrowly drawn and affect only handguns that do not meet
the standards. Such failures, he said, makes the guns a danger to
consumers; therefore, Harshbarger was well within his authority to
set new standards.
</P>
<P>
   Kottmyer said she would hand down a decision on the request for
a temporary court order by Tuesday, when a new set of regulations
are to go into effect. Arguments over the regulations are expected
to continue through August.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the state consumer protection law, Harshbarger has
issued regulations on handguns broken into three phases. The first
phase took effect Jan. 15 and requires warning labels on each
handgun sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase, set to begin next Tuesday, all handguns
sold in the state must meet minimum standards governing the quality
of materials used to make them. They must also pass a test to
ensure they will not accidentally fire when dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The third phase, scheduled for Sept. 30, requires all handguns
to have trigger locks, requires gunmakers to build guns with
triggers stiff enough to resist the pull of a child, and an
indicator that shows how many cartridges are in the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Frank A. Libby, Jr., who represents several gun
manufacturers and gun store owners, told Kottmyer that Harshbarger
went too far when he issued the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swimming well past the markers,'' Libby said.
</P>
<P>
   Libby also filed affidavits from store owners who said the new
regulations could put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Wayne Marshall, the owner of the Gloucester Cobbler store,
said the cost of doing the proposed safety tests on used handguns
sold by his store are high enough to bankrupt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that the total costs of these tests alone will force
me out of business,'' Marshall wrote in his affidavit. He said the
store is his sole source of income and that handgun sales account
for 48 percent of his annual revenue, which ranges from $60,000 to
$90,00 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Eldon McElhiney, the owner of a self-named store in Waltham,
said handguns account for 88 percent of his $220,000 in yearly
sales, but the regulations have caused one supplier to stop selling
new weapons to him.
</P>
<P>
   But John A. Wortmann, Jr., an attorney who represents the
Massachusetts Association of Police Chiefs, nine physician-related
groups and the Center for Handgun Violence, told Kottmyer that
regulators already set manufacturing standards for all kinds of
products, such as automobiles. Gunmakers alone are wrongly exempt
from goverment scrutiny on the quality and workmanship of their
product.

IRAQ MAKING CHEMICAL WEAPONS, U.N. OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief United Nations weapons inspector for
Iraq told the Security Council on Wednesday that laboratory tests
left no doubt that the Iraqis had loaded deadly VX nerve agent into
missile warheads, but he said he was content to go along with a
Council decision to call for further tests.
</P>
<P>
   The new analysis will be carried out at laboratories in
Switzerland and France to address Iraq's contention that the U.S.
Army laboratory that originally found traces of VX was biased.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with eliminating weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq, described the original findings as ``utterly
unambiguous.'' The tests, he said, detected traces of VX and
stabilizing chemicals on warhead fragments that United Nations
inspectors retrieved at Nibai, Iraq, in March.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters later, Butler said he made clear to the
Council ``that there is no doubt that VX was present in some of the
warhead remnants.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``In the spirit of cooperation, we've said, yes,
we'll re-run some further tests in other labs and see what they
come up with.'' Butler said he expected their findings to be
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said a delegate had asked whether there could have been a
mix-up in the tests. ``The answer is no,'' he said. ``These are
unique products. They were of VX. They were found in ammunition,
namely a missile warhead. That's weaponization.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the new tests, the U.S. representative, Bill
Richardson, said, ``We have no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler told the Council that the laboratory's findings were
``very serious,'' because while Iraq admitted producing VX, it has
denied pouring it into weapons. VX is so lethal that a few drops
can kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now these findings show that they did weaponize it,'' Butler
said. ``They put it into missile warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest analysis, which was completed two weeks ago, revives
a lingering uncertainty about whether the VX stocks were destroyed,
as Baghdad reported. VX has a long shelf life and could be stored
for years, experts say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Security Council urged that Butler press ahead with the work
schedule for disarmament that he recently proposed to Iraqi
officials. He said he would ask them how much VX agent was produced
and what happened to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with Iraq on this with good will and get to
the bottom of the question of how much of this substance did they
make, where did they put it, where is it now,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq initially denied making VX, then said that some was
produced experimentally but later destroyed. Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said 1.7 tons of VX were produced, but not of
weapons grade.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's efforts to shake off the oil embargo imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990 have been undercut by the latest report on
VX. Aziz, who is visiting Spain, charged in a Madrid interview
Wednesday that the disclosure of the analysis was a ``political
strategem'' to poison the atmosphere before the Security Council
reviews the sanctions issue.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Iraqi officials visited the Council to
describe their progress in qualifying for the lifting of sanctions.
Wednesday, Britain's chief representative, Sir John Weston, called
the VX analysis ``a rather potent symbol'' of the gap to be bridged
before Iraq could be declared free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the United States also protested a letter that Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahaf sent to the Security Council
last Friday in which he disparaged a senior State Department
official, Martin Indyk, as ``a known Jew and a Zionist.'' Sahaf
complained that Indyk, who is assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, told some journalists that Washington was planning
a new effort to build up political opposition to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements of the United States assistant secretary of
state, Martin Indyk, who is a known Jew and Zionist, are simply an
official and documented reaffirmation of the enmity of the United
States administration toward Iraq,'' al-Sahaf wrote. He asked that
his letter be circulated as a Security Council document.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said five other delegations expressed support for the
U.S. view that ``racist slurs in a Security Council document are
totally unacceptable.'' He called upon Sahaf to apologize.

HOUSE VOTES TO BLOCK APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to add 7 grafs at end)  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an affirmation of its anti-abortion stance, the
House voted Wednesday to block the Food and Drug Administration
from approving an abortion-inducing pill.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA in 1996 had deemed the pill, RU-486, safe and effective
and allowed its use in limited, tightly controlled studies. But it
has not given final approval for the pill's general use.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents described the measure as a way to prevent the
use of taxpayer dollars to further the killing of unborn children;
abortion-rights advocates said the measure, which was attached to
an agriculture appropriations bill, was a circuitous way to try to
prevent women from having any kind of abortion, even one that they
say is the earliest, safest and least-invasive.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Wednesday's House action _ on a relatively close
vote of 223-202 _ is unclear. The measure came to public attention
with so little advance notice that its sponsor, Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., an obstetrician who has delivered more than 3,200 babies,
said he was still looking for someone to introduce it in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, even under Republican control, has been more
supportive of abortion rights than the House. But if a similar
measure did pass the Senate, it would present President Clinton
with a dicey political dilemma, and neither side would predict
Wednesday what he might do.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who supports abortion rights, has supported the
advancement of RU-486 in the past. But opposing this measure would
also mean vetoing the broader, politically appealing $56 billion
agriculture bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill provides $23 billion in food stamps, $609 million for
food-safety inspection and $2 billion for rural economic projects.
It also helps wheat farmers by exempting them from sanctions on
India and Pakistan for exploding nuclear devices and protects
subsidies for sugar processors and peanut farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for President Clinton, said the
administration opposed the bill. He said it would mistakenly allow
Congress to intervene in the drug-safety standards of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart stopped short of saying the president would veto
it. ``We're early in the process,'' he said, suggesting the Senate
would scrap the measure. ``We think we can solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, supporters of abortion rights were concerned that Clinton
could waver on this matter because he is under political pressure
on other fronts and has not held much sway lately on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This White House needs to issue a strong veto message
immediately,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., a leading defender in
the House of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has stood firm in allowing a procedure that
abortion opponents call partial-birth abortion, the administration
has sent signals that Clinton could side with the Republicans on
the most recent anti-abortion measure to arise in the House. The
bill would make it a crime for anyone to transport a minor across
state lines for an abortion. Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, recently wrote a letter to Congress saying that the
president would support the measure if it were properly drafted.
</P>
<P>
   And the difficulty of opposing the entire agriculture bill
because it contains anti-abortion language was demonstrated by the
House. The agriculture bill passed overwhelmingly, 373-48. It was
opposed by 23 Republicans and only 25 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans voting against the larger bill were
conservatives who object to other portions of it like the farm
subsidies, which they perceive as corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's measure would prohibit the FDA from using taxpayer
money to test, develop or approve any drug for the chemical
inducement of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business of the FDA is to protect lives, not to facilitate
death,'' he said during the lengthy floor debate. He also said that
the pills made abortion too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey said the FDA should be allowed to do its job ``free
from right-wing intimidation,'' adding that the public did not want
the Christian Coalition ``dictating'' drug-approval policy.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has approved RU-486, generically called mifepristone,
for research purposes. But no manufacturer has come forward saying
it wants to make the drug on a large scale for general use. That
has held up the FDA from giving its final approval, which requires
inspections of laboratories and other actions that cannot take
place until someone starts making it.
</P>
<P>
   The Population Council, a nonprofit group based in New York, has
been working to bring mifepristone to the U.S. market through a
group of private investors called the Danco Group.
</P>
<P>
   Heather O'Neill, a spokeswoman for Danco, said Wednesday that
Danco had identified a manufacturer ``willing and able'' to make
the drug but she would not name it. Nor would she say if the
company was actually producing the drug yet but she said it would
be available sometime next year. She said the group was
``horrified'' by Wednesday's House action but was moving ahead to
bring the drug to the general market anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood Federation of America president Gloria Feldt
said the House blockage of the FDA process ``came from left field''
and that her organization had not had a chance to discuss it yet
with the Clinton administration. But she was by no means certain
that the president would veto it.

LABOR CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS WORKERS' RIGHT TO UNIONIZE
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN.: Calif., N.C., Conn.) 
 (ja) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO kicked off a campaign Wednesday to highlight labor's
argument that the right of workers to join unions is being unfairly
undercut by fierce employer hostility and by laws that labor
leaders say do little to protect workers seeking to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation has begun the campaign in an effort to
embarrass fervently anti-union employers and to pressure Congress
to strengthen labor laws by, for example, increasing penalties for
employers who dismiss workers for supporting unions.
</P>
<P>
   For labor leaders, the campaign is important because they hope
that it will reduce some obstacles to organizing at a time when
labor's stepped-up efforts to recruit millions of workers have
failed to catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, with 13 million members, sponsored rallies in more
than 70 cities Wednesday to focus the public's attention on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, hundreds of union supporters demonstrated to
protest a Marriott hotel's resistance to a unionization drive. In
North Carolina, farm workers rallied to pressure Mount Olive Pickle
Co. to stop fighting unionization.
</P>
<P>
   At rally after rally, speakers talked about how companies
frequently dismissed workers who headed unionization drives and how
the courts often did not order them reinstated until years later,
often after the organizing drives had fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor leaders likened the campaign to a new civil rights
movement, asserting that the only legally guaranteed right that
Americans are afraid to exercise is the right to form a union.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation
of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, addressed a rally
Wednesday in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth,'' Trumka said, ``is that in this most advanced of
industrial democracies, you can lose all your rights when you try
to join or form a union. No freedom of assembly; if you assemble
you can get fired. No freedom of speech; if you speak up, you can
get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Trumka was in Connecticut to support workers trying to organize
at the Doubletree hotel in Norwalk and the Honey Hill Nursing Home
in Stamford. Doubletree is a subsidiary of the Promus Hotel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited New York City, where limousine drivers rallied
in their effort to unionize the Last Radio Group and restaurant
workers rallied at Angelo &AMP; Maxie's Steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Yager, general counsel of the Labor Policy Association, a
business-backed policy group in Washington, said the labor's
campaign was misguided, insisting that unions' recruitment woes
stemmed not from external obstacles but from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they can't sell their message to employees,'' Yager
said, ``so they have come up with all sorts of other scapegoats for
that failure.''
</P>
<P>
   To generate broader support for their campaign, AFL-CIO leaders
also urged unions around the nation to seek support from community
groups and the clergy to help counter employer campaigns to keep
out unions.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation cited a study by a Cornell University
researcher who found that 75 percent of private-sector employers
aggressively oppose unions, that 80 percent hire anti-union
consultants, that 32 percent dismiss workers involved in organizing
drives and that 50 percent threaten to close plants if workers
choose a union.
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials at the rallies also detailed how unionized
workers received better wages and benefits than nonunion employees.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Denise Mitchell, the AFL-CIO's communications
director, said: ``This campaign has a dual message. If we say
workers in the country are denied the right to organize, it
wouldn't be very meaningful unless we also explain what unions do
to make workers' lives better.''

SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN HELPING GAY MEN HAVE CHILDREN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROKEN ARROW, Okla. _ Diane Thornton said that often, when she
looked at her 5-year-old and 3-year-old sons, she felt there was a
debt unpaid in her life, a kindness unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton and her former romantic partner, who are lesbians,
each conceived one of the boys with sperm from the same gay friend,
and she told him that if he ever wanted to have and raise a child
himself, ``You just say `boo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He never did. So Ms. Thornton, 36, a social worker who lives in
this suburb of Tulsa, went in search of a surrogacy agency with gay
men among its prospective parents. Two months ago, for $15,000 plus
expenses, she gave birth to a boy, who lives with his father and
his father's partner in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child was conceived in their hearts long before it was
conceived in my womb,'' she said. ``I gave him 35 weeks,'' she
added, referring to a pregnancy that ended in a slightly premature
delivery, ``but I didn't invest my hopes in him. His parents were
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   As uncommon as Ms. Thornton's actions may be, they are not
singular. In a society that is still grappling with its attitudes
toward gay people having equal rights or marrying, let alone
raising children, a small but growing group of women _ most, it
seems, heterosexual _ are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to
help gay men have children genetically related to them.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number is unknown, but a few experts on surrogate
parents said at least scores of women have acted, or agreed to act,
as surrogates for gay men. Their existence reflects the explosion
in the use of surrogate parents for infertile couples and the
emboldening of gay men and lesbians, many of whom no longer see
their sexual orientation as a barrier to being parents.
</P>
<P>
   The surrogates who help them are venturing onto largely
uncharted terrain and issuing a bold challenge to traditional
models of family life.
</P>
<P>
   It is a challenge that deeply unsettles many Americans. Some
legal and medical experts say that surrogate parent arrangements
exploit vulnerable women and treat babies as commodities. And many
conservative and religious groups say that children raised by gay
and lesbian parents get a distorted picture of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're exposing kids to an unhealthy environment,'' said Steve
Schwalm, a senior policy analyst for the Family Research Council,
an advocacy group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But that sentiment is part of what motivates the surrogates who
work with gay men, even though heterosexual couples are willing to
pay surrogates as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they had the ultimate restrictions placed on them in
trying to become parents, and I wanted to say it was ridiculous,''
said Michele Cohen, 31, in an interview in her two-room apartment i
n Santa Rosa, Calif., about 50 miles north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen, who is training to become a childbirth counselor, is
three-months pregnant through artificial insemination by one of two
gay men who live together in the Northeast. Two years ago, she
delivered a baby boy for a gay man in California who did not have a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen, who is heterosexual, has a 4-year-old son, whom she
is raising alone. She said the financial burden is eased by her
surrogate mother fees.
</P>
<P>
   She said she revels in being open-minded and has known gay
people well. While that description fit most of the six surrogates
interviewed for this article, one of them, Jennifer Waterman, 27, a
nurse in Red Oak, Iowa, had never met an openly gay person when she
decided, a year ago, to become a surrogate parent for one.
</P>
<P>
   Her inspiration was twofold, she said. A cousin's painful
experience with infertility had persuaded her to do something to
help people frustrated in their desire to have children, and a
community college project that involved reading ``And the Band
Played On,'' a book about the AIDS epidemic, had filled her with
compassion and admiration for gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just clicked,'' Ms. Waterman, a married woman with two
children of her own, said in a telephone interview. She roamed the
Internet, found a surrogate agency that worked with gay men and is
now trying, through artificial insemination, to get pregnant for a
gay couple in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She has the blessing of her husband, Robert, 27, who served for
several years in the Navy and is studying to become a high school
teacher. ``I know how I am with my kids,'' he said, ``and I'd hate
to be in the shoes of someone who couldn't have kids.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waterman, Ms. Thornton and Ms. Cohen are working with
Growing Generations, an agency in Beverly Hills, Calif., that
sprang up two years ago and has matched more than 15 gay couples
with surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs also indicate that surrogacy for gay men _ arranged
in rare cases for at least a decade _ is taking firmer root. Last
month, Andrew W. Vorzimer, a Beverly Hills lawyer, got a California
judge to list two gay men on the birth certificate of a girl
conceived through the artificial insemination of a surrogate. It is
believed to be a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Vorzimer said, the names of the biological father and
mother go on the birth certificate; the mother then relinquishes
her legal rights while the father's partner applies for a
second-parent adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Although several states, including New York and New Jersey, do
not allow surrogacy agencies to operate in their borders, dozens of
agencies operate elsewhere, especially in California.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Zager, director of the Organization of Parents Through
Surrogacy, estimated that 10,000 babies have been born through
surrogates in the last two decades. She said that a miniscule
percentage of them went to gay men, with whom most agencies,
fearing added controversy, will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of children being raised by gays and
lesbians were conceived in earlier heterosexual relationships,
adopted, or born to lesbians through artificial insemination. And
the price of surrogacy _ from $30,000 to $70,000 for the
surrogate's fee and legal and medical expenses _ is prohibitive for
most people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts said an increasing number of men are like Will
Halm and Marcellin Simard, a Beverly Hills couple who used a
surrogate to have a daughter, now 2 years old, and are expecting a
son from another surrogate, Elizabeth Nila, 33, of San Diego, who
is six-months pregnant. Halm, a lawyer, is the chief executive of
Growing Generations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nila has no genetic relation to the fetus she is carrying:
she had an embryo, created through the in-vitro fertilization of
another woman's egg, implanted in her uterus. Halm declined to say
whether he or Dr. Simard, a cardiologist, provided the sperm,
because they think of the child they are expecting as both of
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nila, who is married and was raised in a Roman Catholic
family of eight children, said she has a lesbian sister and
believes that society should be more accepting of gay men and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that when she was a surrogate for a heterosexual
couple, she worried that the woman envied her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not jealous,'' Ms. Nila said over lunch with Halm in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Halm responded: ``I'm glad she's going to get the stretch
marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nila, a homemaker, has two children and two stepchildren of
her own. Reputable agencies insist that surrogates be experienced
at motherhood, so they can better imagine what it will mean to give
up a child.
</P>
<P>
   The surrogates with Growing Generations, who seem to be women of
relatively modest educations and means, said the money they
received, $15,000 to $20,000 plus expenses, came in handy but was
not their primary motivation. They said their willingness to do
something that most women would not do made them feel special, and
that they liked being pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Their contracts typically specify what sorts of medical
treatments they are willing to undergo and whether they would abort
in cases of birth defects or multiple pregnancies. The intended
parents are almost always present at childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships often become more involved. When Halm saw
news reports of contaminated tap water, he brought Ms. Nila two
cases of bottled water. He also consulted her about names for the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she plans to pump breast milk after the delivery,
freeze it and express mail it to him, and she has informally agreed
to carry another child for him and Dr. Simard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton, the Oklahoma woman, gets regular reports about the
son, conceived through artificial insemination, that she gave up
two months ago, but said she never really thought of him as hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my children, and I can tell you every nuance of my
children,'' she said. ``My children are the most incredible in the
world. Their baby's nice.''

 &HT;    INDIAN LEADERS LEARN ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES WATER PROJECT
 &HT;    BY EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ute Indian tribal leaders had planned to testify
before Congress on Wednesday in support of a scaled-down version of
the Animas-La Plata water project.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they spoke to the U.S. Senate about their shock and
sadness upon finding out a few hours before the hearing that the
Clinton administration strongly opposes the slimmed-down project,
dubbed ``A-LP Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government-to-government relationship that the
administration talks so much about is a big joke,'' said Clement
Frost, chairman of the Southern Ute Tribal Council. ``They do not
stand behind their word.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a measure, introduced by Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., that would largely provide municipal and
industrial water to Ute tribes and other communities in southern
Colorado and northern New Mexico. The project has been estimated to
cost about $290 million, about one-third of the size of the
original plan.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the scaled-down project has major
problems, including environmental impact and language that could
make the federal government pay for delivering water from a water
project near Dolores and constructing facilities to deliver water
on the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be a need to allow for exploration of a
variety of alternative means to deliver water to the tribes,'' said
Eluid Martinez, commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, who was
grilled by angry members of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and
the Senate Water and Power Development subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, appearing flustered, admitted he had first seen the
administration's final statement just four hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The admission caused Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, to respond:
``And you expect us to take your statement seriously?''
</P>
<P>
   Inouye asked Martinez if he had a comparable bill that the
administration would agree to.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that they would present a report
this summer about the shrunken project but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that A-LP Lite is the first step in an attempt
to construct the original $754 million project, and that taxpayers
will foot a large part of the bill. In addition, they said that the
project will be exempt from environmental laws, and that it will
dewater a trout fishery and inundate winter range for the state's
second-largest elk herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are alternatives to a big reservoir 500 feet up on a
mesa, evaporating, with no pipelines to anywhere,'' said Lori
Potter, a Denver attorney who represented the Sierra Club at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents told Congress that denying the project would mean
turning its back on water rights obligations to the Ute tribes.
This would lead to legal chaos, said Gale Norton, Colorado's
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   If A-LP Lite is not enacted, ``the State of Colorado, the United
States, the Ute Tribes and southwest Colorado water users appear
destined for years of expensive and acrimonious litigation,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Knight Frank, chairperson of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribal
Council, told the committee that litigation might be the only
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all really tired. I think we're ready to go to court and
take our chances there,'' she said.

LIZ CLAIBORNE WINS CASE IN TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liz Claiborne Inc. won a trademark infringement case Wednesday
against Mademoiselle Knitwear Inc., a New York sweater factory that
is involved in a tangle of litigation with Claiborne and Unite, the
garment workers union.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet ruled that Mademoiselle
repeatedly violated Claiborne's trademarks in 1995 by selling
thousands of sweaters made exclusively for Claiborne through other
outlets. Mademoiselle was ordered to pay damages of $582,000, its
estimated profits on the illegal sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge rejected Claiborne's request for triple damages
and lawyers' fees, citing the uncertainty about the actual volume
of illegal sales. ``Moreover, the complicated business relationship
between the parties, and the poor documentation of that
relationship on both sides, distinguishes this case from more
egregious cases of intentional trademark infringement,'' the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling is an important victory for Claiborne, which once
boasted of dealing with Mademoiselle's showcase unionized factory.
As Claiborne sent more of its manufacturing abroad, it tried to
reduce its dealings with Mademoiselle, but was blocked by a union
arbitrator in 1996. A second arbitration case was pending when
Claiborne and Unite settled last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ruling represents a triumph of overwhelming evidence
against Mademoiselle's baseless allegations,'' said Roberta Karp,
the general counsel for Claiborne. ``The court has rejected the
false charges Mademoiselle publicized and tried to use to defend
its illegal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweet's decision is a serious setback for Mademoiselle, which is
operating under federal bankruptcy protection. In a separate suit,
Mademoiselle has accused Claiborne of conspiring with Unite to drop
the arbitration claims in exchange for a payment of $13 million in
``liquidated damages.'' Such damages, an important source of income
for the union, are assessed against manufacturers that fail to use
unionized factories. The payments have recently become a focus of a
congressional subcommittee that is examining current labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   John Schryber, Mademoiselle's lawyer in the trademark case, said
Sweet's decision would be appealed. He added that the ruling should
not affect Mademoiselle's case against Claiborne and the union.
</P>
<P>
   That case is one of three remaining in the long-running dispute.
In addition, workers at Mademoiselle sued Claiborne and their union
late last year over the settlement of the arbitration claims. And
the National Labor Relations Board is scheduled to hold hearings in
the fall on various complaints of unfair labor practices that the
union has filed against Mademoiselle.

 &HT;    A direct line into the home
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AT&AMP;T's blockbuster bid to buy the nation's largest
cable company may be a huge gamble, but it is a loud confirmation
of the fact every communications company is now either hunter or
game.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to buy Tele-Communications Inc. in a stock swap worth
about $48 billion will give AT&AMP;T a direct link to consumer homes,
even as it pushes rivals to find their own partners and accelerate
their own competing connections. The long-distance giant, which has
floundered in several efforts at entering the $110 billion market
for local service, finally has a strategy that detours around the
lines controlled by the regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the move we have been waiting for,'' said analyst
Brian Adamik of the Yankee Group. ``There are only two lines to the
home, and AT&AMP;T is aligning itself with that other wire.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after passage of the Telecommunications Act,
most consumers have no choice in local service and no new choices
in long-distance. The law, touted as a way for industries to invade
each other's territories, has instead spurred only a spate of
mergers that did not cross industry lines _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike San Antonio-based SBC Communications, which has purchased
three other local phone companies, AT&AMP;T cannot simply add lines to
grow. While it has more than 70 million consumer customers, AT&AMP;T
does not own any lines into their homes. To compete in local
service, AT&AMP;T has been forced to choose between reselling service _
which is not profitable _ and constructing its own network _ which
is stunningly expensive. AT&AMP;T recently spent $11 billion to buy
Teleport Communications Group to beef up its ability to sell
services to businesses. But owning a cable company gives AT&AMP;T a
path to consumers. TCI has systems reaching 11 million homes and
owns parts of companies that reach 10 million more. In Georgia, TCI
serves 23 communities, including Columbus and Albany.
</P>
<P>
   When complete, a high-speed cable connection can offer a
lightning-quick link to the Internet, along with television and
phone service. Using its huge customer base and world-renowned
brand name, AT&AMP;T should be able to market the new service to
millions.
</P>
<P>
   But that path is studded with both cost and risk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the awesome expense of the purchase, success depends on
a multibillion-dollar upgrade of TCI's lines to permit phone calls
and high-speed data transmission. Between 10 percent and 15 percent
of the nation's cable lines have been upgraded to handle
interactive traffic, high-speed data and phone conversations, and
analysts believe TCI is below average in making that transition. A
similar effort in metro Atlanta by MediaOne, projected to cost $350
million, has already taken several years and is only about 20
percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Bell Atlantic agreed to a merger with TCI intended to
do much of what AT&AMP;T now plans. That deal collapsed under the
weight of corporate egos, financial haggling and industry doubt.
But that was then. Now, the technology for improving networks is
greatly improved. More importantly, the Internet is a vibrant
reality with the promise of still more lucrative growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that it won't be as expensive as it would have
been before, that the payoff is better than it would have been and
AT&AMP;T has lots of bucks,'' said Dwight Allen, director of global
telecommunications for Deloitte Research.
</P>
<P>
   For months, AT&AMP;T has been seen as the helpless giant, watching
events swirl past.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share of long-distance, once dominant, has faded
to about half. Meanwhile, it has been outflanked by WorldCom, which
after finishing the purchase of MCI and MFS, will be a major player
in long-distance, Internet and local service to business. SBC
Communications has purchased two other Bells, while Bell Atlantic
bought Nynex.
</P>
<P>
   On the cable front, cable companies have been building
high-speed lines that will give customers quick access to the
Internet along with phone service. Bells have been planning to
offer DSL, a high-speed service over phone lines, while Internet
companies tinker with techniques for carrying voice.
</P>
<P>
   And while AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI is bold, AT&AMP;T has stumbled
before making grand gestures. For example, the disastrous purchase
of NCR, later reversed, which looked so promising on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the payoff from TCI is years away. By the time those
upgrades are made, other technologies _ such as wireless _ could
eclipse cable. Still, AT&AMP;T could not afford to wait, Allen said.
``You just don't know what's going to come crashing onto the scene,
but you've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bells need to do something, too. They already face
competition for their more lucrative business customers. The
prospect of mighty AT&AMP;T stomping into residential neighborhoods
offering a full range of telecommunications services is not taken
lightly. But first the Bells hope the TCI deal can be good news,
providing a reason for federal regulators to permit them into
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   U S West, the smallest of the remaining Bells, released a
statement Wednesday arguing just that. ``All of us should be
allowed to compete, now that the biggest kid on the block just got
bigger. A combined AT&AMP;T and TCI would have a market value of about
$125 billion. WorldCom and MCI together would be valued at about
$82 billion. The thought that these big companies continue to need
protection from U S West is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, at $22 billion a year in revenue, has during the
recent industry consolidation gone from the largest Bell to the
second-smallest. So the Atlanta-based company also hopes to have
long-distance as an offering when AT&AMP;T enters consumer markets. But
the thought of competing with a cable-owning behemoth could
accelerate BellSouth's efforts to roll out its own high-speed
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Any major player in telecommunications must soon provide a
high-speed digital mix of voice, data and video, said BellSouth
Executive Officer C. Sidney Boren. ``This will stimulate our
efforts, no doubt. It stimulates everybody's research and
development into how to get broadband closer to the home.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth plans to start offering DSL in metro Atlanta starting
Aug. 31. While DSL is not quite as fast as a cable modem and cannot
be used too far from a central office switch, phone companies
should be capable of getting it to market much faster than cable
companies can install upgraded lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sadler, analyst at Robinson Humphrey, said BellSouth should
feel pressure to push DSL into the market. ``No more trials. No
more messing around. They have got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's announcement evokes the specter of trouble on BellSouth's
home turf, he said. ``This is a flashing green light with a klaxon.
The potential is to hit BellSouth not only in local residential
service but also in business-to-business. This is a cold slap in
the face.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's huge purchase would be added to its long-distance
network, Teleport's local network for business and AT&AMP;T's business
in wireless phones _ the largest in the nation. But the deal is
almost certainly not the last of the industry mergers _ perhaps not
even for AT&AMP;T. It has a national presence in long-distance, and
would presumably want the same for its local business.

 &HT;    Deal viewed as milestone; stocks climb
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AT&AMP;T's purchase of Tele-Communications Inc. is the
biggest in a series of big endorsements of the cable TV pipeline as
the new standard in communications.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several years, Microsoft, Bell Canada and U S West
have all invested in cable TV with varying degrees of success. But
AT&AMP;T's $48 billion deal raises that investment to a new level,
driving the industry's soaring stock prices even higher Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the Microsoft investment in Comcast last year, this
transaction is a strong endorsement of the cable's broadband
plant,'' said Jim Robbins, president of Atlanta-based cable TV
operator Cox Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is fairly significant for other cable players, but
you have to remember that the industry has already experienced
consolidation,'' said Andy Grossman, deputy editor of influential
industry trade weekly Multichannel News. ``This is part of a
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it continue? ``It's hard to tell whether AT&AMP;T will create a
rush by outsiders to buy other cable operators,'' said Bruce
Leitchman, a media analyst at Boston-based consultant Yankee Group.
``MCI and Sprint, for example, have shown no interest so far in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides soaring stock prices, though, industry observers doubted
the merger would have much impact on other cable TV companies. The
top operators such as Cox Communications and MediaOne have already
embarked on billion-dollar programs to rebuild their systems to
handle two-way traffic such as high-speed access to the Internet
and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal doesn't change the video angle of the business one
iota,'' said Leitchman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, though, could greatly change TCI. With 10 million
subscribers, the Denver-based operator is the industry's
second-largest. Most of its systems, which include Chicago, Denver,
Seattle and San Francisco, are west of the Mississippi. It does
have some 100,000 subscribers spread out over 23 systems in South
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   TCI ranks low within the industry in terms of both customer
service and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has very, very few systems that are two-way digital,'' said
Leitchman. ``The company faces one heck of a challenge to finish
rebuilding all its systems as two-way by the year 2000 as promised
by Malone (TCI Chairman John C. Malone).''
</P>
<P>
   That upgrade is critical if AT&AMP;T is going to successfully use
TCI's systems to deliver local telephone service and high-speed
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Also critical is TCI's ability to improve customer service. If
unhappy with their cable TV, subscribers are unlikely to buy other
services from TCI such as local telephone and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Since hiring Leo Hindry Jr. as its second-in-command two years
ago, TCI has worked to improve service and its systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has been pretty successful where it has upgraded
service,'' said Grossman. ``But they still have problems in pockets
where the company has not upgraded.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is expected to bolster TCI's upgrade. ``Its cash
flow should greatly help TCI deliver on its promise of
next-generation services,'' said Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers wonder, though, whether Malone was really
interested in building a better TCI. There have been rumors for the
past six months that he was rebuilding to get ready for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Malone is renown for his financial acumen. He cobbled
together small cable TV systems into what once was the country's
largest operator. And he's continually restructuring TCI, spinning
off and then re-buying parts of his company.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's portfolio includes more than cable systems. He controls
stakes in a variety of programmers, including Time Warner. He
holds, through TCI, a nonvoting 9.2 percent stake in the New
York-based media conglomerate, which in turn owns Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malone has done a masterful job of inspiring confidence with
Wall Street,'' said Leitchman. ``In a sense, this is just his
biggest deal yet.''

 &HT;    How do we heal the strife in Asia?
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Given President Clinton's trip this week to China and
the recent testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, it
seemed a good time to discuss Asian security issues with John
Endicott.
</P>
<P>
   Endicott is an expert on Asian security matters, an author and
the director of the Center for International Strategy, Technology
and Policy, a think tank at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But if that makes his career sound a tad dry, guess again.
Endicott worked in 1958 as a U.S. Air Force intelligence officer in
Japan, where he interrogated Japanese prisoners of war still
straggling out of Siberian prisons. In 1962, during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, he was in the Strategic Air Command's underground
headquarters in Nebraska when it was sealed for the first and only
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s, the Air Force sent him to Vietnam, where he
became intelligence adviser to Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky.
</P>
<P>
   After another stint in Japan, Endicott worked in strategic
planning in Washington, D.C. _ going through the Cold War as, he
says, ``a strategic nuclear weaponeer.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the Air Force in 1986 and became director of the
Institute for National Strategic Studies, which gave policy advice
to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretary of
defense. He came to Georgia Tech in 1990 to create the School of
International Affairs and the policy study group.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from a conversation with him this week:
</P>
<P>
   Q:The prime ministers of Pakistan and India have said they're
going to talk face-to-face next month. What can we realistically
expect out of that?
</P>
<P>
   A:Not too much, I don't think. But I would like to see them
really start to get serious about maybe a fissile manufacturing
cut-off proposal. They've already got enough stuff to probably make
60 weapons as far as the Indians are concerned, and maybe 25 or 30
as far as the (Pakistanis) are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the real problem is the Indians and the
Pakistanis really don't know enough about what each country is
doing. (America) could do two things, I think that would really
make a difference. One is to offer immediately, to the Indians and
the Pakistanis, the latest PAL technology to both states. P-A-L,
permissive action link technology. This is the technology that
complicates unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. Prohibits it,
basically.
</P>
<P>
   But secondly, we're not really sure and they're not really sure
of each other's actions. They almost went to war in '96 by rumor
alone. So there's a lot of satellite intelligence that we could
make available to them and tell the Indians and tell the
(Pakistanis) that we're going to make this information available to
both sides in an honest broker kind of maneuver so that there can't
be any sneak attack.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The U.S. wants Pakistan and India to sign on to nuclear
proliferation and test ban treaties, but not as nuclear states.
Isn't that asking them to put the genie back in the bottle?
</P>
<P>
   A:Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   This brings another issue up that's really bothersome. And it's
the way we, in our current international system, welcome latecomers
on the international system. We went to war with Germany in World
War I because we couldn't adapt to what they were trying to do,
that happened to be about 30 or 40 years behind what the Brits and
the rest of the world had done _ the French, etc. We went to World
War II because the Japanese were trying to do the same thing as far
as colonies, etc., that was the norm 40 years prior.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we get to the same kind of situation, only the norm
now is non-proliferation. And the international system really
demands that these two countries forgo the right to nuclear weapons
when they ascertain by their own processes that their national
security is in danger. Well, if we had those same kind of
circumstances, you know the kind of answer that we would find.
</P>
<P>
   Q:With regard to India and Pakistan, what can China do to help?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, China has already stated that it was very disappointed
in the Pakistan explosions. And it is generally, I think,
acknowledged that there was up until several years ago quite a bit
of Chinese assistance to the (Pakistanis) in the development of the
nuclear capability and missiles. This has supposedly stopped now,
so certainly China can play a role in this situation of a good
adviser toward Pakistan, but they don't have very much credibility
with the Indians, and that's a real major problem. And of course
the Indians see China as their number one threat.
</P>
<P>
   So, in this case, the United States cannot back away from this
kind of responsibility for being a senior counsel in this
relationship. Russia also has a real opportunity here to play a
major role as a responsible international power. The Russians do
have a much better relationship with India, of course, than we do.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's the best that you think, in terms of U.S.-China
security, that Clinton can achieve there?
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, if we do get a de-targeting situation, that would be
very good. De-alerting would also be very good. De-alerting would
be the separation of warheads from the missiles themselves, so it's
very, very difficult to marry them again without showing your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How committed should the United States be to the protection of
Taiwan, and what do you think the U.S. response ought to be if
Taiwan were to declare its independence?
</P>
<P>
   A:I agree with the U.S. current policy that recognizes that
there is one China, and that China and Taiwan are both claimants to
that real title. We (should) tolerate any outcome as long as it's
an outcome that is viable between both parties. We will be very
unhappy, in fact under the Taiwan act we should use force, if the
PRC (People's Republic of China) intervenes with force in an
outright aggressive way.
</P>
<P>
   But I think if Taiwan declares its own independence, then it
takes its chances and it takes its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your assessment, how dangerous is North Korea to security
in East Asia?
</P>
<P>
   A:Extremely dangerous. It's sort of the danger represented by a
person who is starving, desperate and willing to hold on to an
ideology that they have spent their lives saying was the right way.
Knowing how the Russians feel about the collapse of Communism and
Marxism, etc., and what sort of real problems that's caused, it's
by a factor of 10 as far as the North Koreans are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a very dangerous situation, and it's a danger from
weakness, not a danger from strength. Often we talk about the
forward-deployed North Korean forces _ and of their million-man
military, about 60 percent are forward-deployed, therefore in
positions that could be very critical and very dangerous to a South
Korean defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is really a deployment, though, not of strength and threat;
it's a deployment of weakness, I believe. Because the North
Koreans, I don't think, have the petroleum, the communications, the
training to carry off a forward deployment after the fact, when the
situation becomes tense. I don't think they're ready to execute a
forward deployment because they don't have enough money to exercise
their forces now in large groups, their communication technology is
antiquated, and certainly where they're sitting gives them a chance
to maximize politically the threat and not look so weak.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a very dangerous situation in the sense that if Kim
Jong-il and his group get into factional fighting and a coup is
attempted, and then in order to put down the coup they launch _ you
know, you can write all sorts of scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   I think, having said that, we're now in a period where common
strife, both South Korean and North Korean, and a new political
leadership in the South, brings the whole peninsula closer to a
rational settlement than we've seen in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Both Kim Dae-jung and a task force headed by former Ambassador
James Laney haverecommended that sanctions against North Korea be
lifted. What's your view?
</P>
<P>
   A:Definitely, they should be lifted. I think what we need to do
is everything that we can to reduce those items that make the North
Koreans feel we're threatening and constraining and conspiring
against them. And it doesn't take many kinds of good works to
reduce their fear. It's fear that drove them toward nuclear
weapons, and they were surprised, I think, at the international
willingness to really work this problem out and come up with the
1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What kind of role should Japan be encouraged to play in Asian
security matters in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Japan has got security _ writ large _ responsibilities, in
this case economic security as well as military security.
Everybody's on them: ``Do something outstanding, forward-looking as
far as getting the Japanese economy out of neutral.'' It's almost
in reverse. And the problem, of course, is that Japan is also going
through a restructuring of its economic system. (And) the western
European Union is forming a monolith that's going to be a very,
very difficult thing to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   Having said this, there's also an area where Japan should be
actively a leader in the region. And this is in the
non-proliferation area. Japan, of all the countries in Asia _ of
all the countries in the world _ has the charter, basically, to
lead against proliferation of nuclear weapons. Japan could become a
leader in non-proliferation, could become a leader in an area where
it doesn't threaten anyone. And this is an action where China would
be reassured, North and South Korea would be reassured, even the
Philippines.

 &HT;    Deal makes phone giant major force in broadband
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AT&AMP;T's acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. and
its broadband service (at)Home may have forced the Internet
industry to take a long, hard look at broadband development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, how far and how fast broadband can reach into U.S.
homes and abroad will impact the future development of America
Online, the world's largest proprietary online service.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous false starts, AT&AMP;T's acquisition of
Tele-Communications finally gives AT&AMP;T the power to emerge as a
serious Internet player.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the TCI acquisition, AT&AMP;T's failed forays into
electronic commerce and online services such as AT&AMP;T Interchange
left analysts shaking their heads, wondering why AT&AMP;T couldn't
leverage its telecommunications prowess into a successful Internet
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, AT&AMP;T seems to have looked into the future and saw what
analysts like to call the ``big pipes'' of broadband. Broadband is
delivered to subscribers through a set-top box and offers its users
Net access up to 100 times faster than the standard dial-up modem
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Along with local phone service possibilities, the merger with
TCI enables AT&AMP;T to take a leap of faith into the world of
broadband communications. In addition to some 10 million cable
subscribers, AT&AMP;T also would acquire a controlling interest in the
(at)Home Network (http://www.home.net/home/), a leading provider of
high-speed Internet access and content services. The service
currently has roughly 110,000 subscribers who pay between $30 and
$50 for the service.
</P>
<P>
   TCI has controlling stake in the venture, whose other primary
partners are Comcast and Cox Communications, a public company
controlled by Cox Enterprises. Wednesday, (at)Home shares closed at
$51.12 1/2 up $11.87 1/2, a 30 percent increase. The company also
reached its all-time high of $54 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of just following Internet trends, AT&AMP;T has a
chance to lead the way into broadband Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Its closest competitor is Time Warner and MediaOne's Road
Runner. That company plans to build out its service with a $425
million investment from Microsoft and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   TCI's deals with other cable systems already give (at)Home
access to 67 million homes, but there is still a long way to go
before the world embraces broadband. Of those 67 million homes,
(at)Home is only available in 6 million, and of those 6 million,
only 100,000 are (at)Home subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   However, AT&AMP;T also gains (at)Home's expertise at developing
content for the high-speed broadband connections. High-speed access
allows content developers to employ streaming audio, video and
Shockwave enhancements that aren't feasible on dial-up connections
because of long download times and limited dial-up bandwidth. With
cable modems, there are no such limitations.
</P>
<P>
   But this sudden flurry of interest in cable modems and broadband
technology leaves America Online at a technological crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   For now, AOL says it wants to remain independent but form
``alliances'' with other companies. But the decision facing AOL in
the long term is whether to bet on cable and broadband, or the
phone companies and their high-speed DSL technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has to stop and develop its broadband
strategy,'' says Robert Seidman, editor and publisher of Online
Insider (http://www.onlineinsider.com).
</P>
<P>
   According to Seidman, America Online isn't ready to compete in
the broadband arena or partner with a major cable operator. ``They
are boxed out of cable access right now,'' he says, adding that
(at)Home already has spent several years developing content for the
high-speed arena, putting it at an advantage over AOL in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
   Even though AT&AMP;T may have forced the broadband issue, Seidman
says AOL can take its time developing the next generation of its
service. ``Next year and the year after that and the year after
that, dial up at 28.8k bps or 56K bps is still going to be the
dominant method of access,'' he says. ``That gives Steve Case some
breathing room.''

 &HT;    Parents questioned the safety of public pools
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Armed with a season pass, Joan Yesner has taken her
three children to White Water park almost every day this month.
</P>
<P>
   But after trying to reach officials at the Cobb County water
park and talking to public health workers Wednesday, Yesner said
she can't go back _ not until she knows more details about how
public pools are cleaned and inspected in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just devastated by the whole thing,'' said Yesner, a
Marietta resident who filed a complaint about White Water with the
Cobb County health department Wednesday. ``But what really bothers
me is the seeming lack of information about how pools are to be
monitored.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most public pool facilities _ including White Water _
have been deemed safe by public health workers, there are no
statewide regulations regarding swimming pool maintenance or water
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Georgia Department of Human Resources allows
individual counties to develop their own codes of conduct, although
most are based on a set of guidelines that were issued almost three
decades ago by the state's Environmental Health Division.
</P>
<P>
   Those guidelines, 20 pages worth, outline standards for
everything from filtration systems to cleanliness of bathhouse
buildings. But they do not spell out how facilities should respond
to specific incidents, such as the case of a child defecating in a
pool, which is believed to be the cause of an E coli outbreak at
White Water park.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 25 counties _ including most metro Atlanta counties _
have enacted some portion of those recommendations into ordinances,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But how diligently the counties follow or enforce their codes
varies. That factor, along with the need to make sure Olympic
swimming venues were safe for the 1996 Games, prompted Georgia to
start developing a new set of uniform statewide regulations. But
those laws are not slated for release until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started looking at writing rules and regulations about
three years ago,'' said Ken Dickson, assistant director of
environmental health with the state division of public health.
``There was no single incident that sparked this, but we wanted to
avert any potential problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say the White Water outbreak is
extremely unusual. E. coli is most often passed through food
contaminated with fecal bacteria. The White Water case is only the
second known incident where a chlorinated pool was the route of
transmission for E. coli. The first also occurred in Georgia, in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, chlorine is highly effective in keeping pools safe _
even from the unpredictable potty habits of children. Chemically
speaking, chlorine _ often used in cleaning supplies_ is a strong
oxidant that releases free radicals that attack and destroy
bacteria by invading the cell walls and internal structure,
according to Laren Tolbert, chairman of Georgia Institute of
Technology's school of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   But he said when chlorine is used to protect people from
bacteria in pools, ``the hard part is controlling the level of
chlorine so it's sufficient to kill the bacteria without being
uncomfortable for the swimmers.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there has been a case of someone defecating in the pool,
chlorine has to have a time to work, he said. ``It doesn't work
instantly,'' Tolbert said. That's why it's recommended that pool
owners place a higher dose of chlorine in a pool at night _ ``to
give it time to kill everything that shouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gormley, who oversees the safety and water quality of 1,200
community pools in subdivisions and public facilities in Fulton
County, said he believes the best policy when someone has had an
accident is to close the pool, remove the bulk of the matter, and
``shock'' the pool _ or over-chlorinate the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a pool should have a chlorine level of at least 1.5
parts per million, with between 2 and 5 parts per million being
optimal, said Gormley, manager of Fulton County Health and Wellness
Department's environmental health service division. But when owners
shock a pool, the level should rise to at least 12 parts per
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then, pool owners should wait 24 hours until the chlorine
returns to a normal level, said Gormley.
</P>
<P>
   However, owners don't want to have a pool with too much chlorine
either. Tolbert points out that it's such a powerful agent it was
used as a poison gas against soldiers during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   And even when chlorine hits 8 to 10 parts per million , it's
enough to bleach bathing suits, tint dyed hair green, irritate eyes
and even cause respiratory problems for asthmatics.
</P>
<P>
   The key to having a safe pool has more to do with consistent
maintenance that just taking care of a crisis, experts say. Gormley
and others who run pool stores say routinely testing the water is
the only way to make sure bacteria can't ruin a summer pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Going by a strong chlorine smell, for example, is one of the
worst ways to determine whether there's enough chlorine. In fact,
when a pool smells heavily like chlorine, it might mean its level
is too low _ because it indicates that the chlorine has bonded with
the bacteria and has formed a new chemical compound which puts off
a stronger smell.
</P>
<P>
   Test kits typically cost between $6 and $26, said Cheryl Lanuza,
office manager of Atlas Pools and Spas on Peachtree Industrial
Boulevard. ``You need to make sure your pool is in balance, and you
need to shock your pool every seven to 10 days, depending on the
number of swimmers you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Filters are also important, public health workers and pool
salespeople say. And if there's been an accident, owners need to
make sure they scrub the filter traps and skimmers that might have
trapped fecal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said homeowners in subdivisionshave the right to set
their own standards for community pools. In some cases, it might be
helpful to bar children under 3 years old _ or until they are
potty-trained. If parents don't want to block a child's access to a
pool, the subdivision should require that the babies wear diapers
that are rubberized or tight enough to contain any accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do have some control over this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, in light of the White Water outbreak, would it be better to
return to nature?
</P>
<P>
   No, say public health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ocean does offer some protection against bacteria
because it has such a high concentration of salt, and natural
scrubbers, it is not clean. Neither are lakes and rivers, which
often contain bacteria from septic tanks and run-off from sewers
and pasture lands.
</P>
<P>
   For Yesner, the lawn sprinkler is going to see more action in
the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I get some answers, we can't go back,'' said Yesner,
mother of a 9-year-old, a 7-year-old and a 20-month-old. ``I'm not
going to take the risk.

 &HT;    Metro's smog is worse than you thought
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As metro Atlanta faces its third consecutive ozone
pollution alert today, some commuters are bemoaning the frequency
of these requests to leave their cars at home in the name of
cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
   But Rhonda Hill knows it's worse than they think, because the
air is even more unhealthy than they've been told. Long before
ozone smog hits the level at which the state Enviornmental
Protection Division triggers an ozone warning, kids like Hill's son
Kellan Bolden, a severe asthmatic, need to leave the yard or the
pool and head indoors. Failure to do so risks a life-threatening
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary,'' Hill said. ``I can't let him play outside
when ozone is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for parents like Hill to get adequate warning,
however. The EPD issues pollution forecasts geared toward meeting
an ozone standard now declared out-of-date by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after controversy-ridden debate, the EPA set a new
health standard acknowledging that for children like Kellan, and
even for healthy people who are active outdoors, prolonged exposure
at lower levels is more dangerous than brief spikes.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is stark: Under the new standard, based on levels
averaged over eight hours rather than one hour, metro Atlanta in
May alone had twice as many ``bad air'' days than the five EPD
reported. Using the new standard, EPD officials say the region will
likely register three or more times the current average of 11
violation days.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPD is not yet required to use the new standard in
issuing its alerts. Consequently, if forecasters call an alert
based on the older standard, the EPD's Web site says confidently,
if not altogether accurately, ``ozone conditions are not
unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   State air experts issued warnings for Tuesday, Wednesday and
today. While neither Tuesday nor Wednesday exceeded the older
standard, both days saw ozone levels above the new one, according
to information on the EPD web site.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that metro Atlanta's air pollution problem is more
intractable, and possibly more dangerous to health, than the EPD is
acknowledging with its current program. The EPD hopes to make a
serious dent in the pollution problem by asking resi-dents to leave
cars at home, put off mowing and take othermeasures on ozone alert
days.
</P>
<P>
   Under the updated standard, however, almost every other day
could be an alert day. Skeptics have suggested that indicates a
need to switch habits for the entire May-September ozone season,
rather than only on ``action days.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sheer number of likely alert days is one reason the
EPD decided not to issue warnings based on the new health standard,
said Ron Methier, EPD's chief of air protection.
</P>
<P>
   EPD was worried that it's so-called Voluntary Ozone Action
Program would be doomed from the start if action days came too
fast, Methier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of 10 or 20 action alerts a summer we may be issuing
40 or 50 under the 8-hour standard,'' Methier said. ``We wanted to
ease into this and get people to understand there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Methier also noted that federal regulators are allowing problem
cities like Atlanta to wait until after they have met the existing
standard to start working toward the new one. The EPD doesn't plan
to meet the old standard until close to 2005.
</P>
<P>
   That's not acceptable to Dr. Leroy Graham, the
cardiopulmonologist who treats Kellan Bolden.
</P>
<P>
   ``To wait is foolish and dangerous,'' Graham said. ``We
shouldn't get caught up in thinking that compliance with
regulations is all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents are getting an unrealistic picture of the
healthfulness of Atlanta's air and what it will take to fix it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellan's mom, too, hopes they get the picture sooner, rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to hear him ask, `Why can't I play football and
baseball? Why do I have to take all this medication?'' she said.
``It's not just the air pollution, but that's a lot of it.''

COURT DECISION REFLECTS DEBATE OVER HOW TO APPLY ANTITRUST LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Microsoft Corp., a federal appeals court ruling in the
company's favor on Tuesday was a gratifying triumph of sweeping
import for its long-running antitrust battle with the government.
</P>
<P>
   To the Justice Department and 20 states pitted against
Microsoft, it was merely a bump in the road as they head to court
again in September with a broader antitrust case against the
leading computer software company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet antitrust experts said Wednesday that the split decision by
the three-judge panel _ a majority opinion written by a
conservative and partial dissent from a liberal _ was both a big
victory for Microsoft and a reflection of the wider debate over how
antitrust doctrine should apply to high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The majority ruling, they say, echoes the hands-off approach
championed by Microsoft, while the dissent mirrors the Justice
Department's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a landmark antitrust opinion,'' said Stephen Axinn, a
leading antitrust litigator. ``It deals with a classic fault-line
in antitrust _ when a court can second-guess a company's product
decisions. The majority opinion, at least for the moment, moves the
law further toward a non-interventionist stance, especially in
high-tech cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed the opinion as a critical victory for Microsoft
and a green light to buy Microsoft stock, which rose 5.15 percent
Tuesday and a further 4.16 percent Wednesday to $104.9375, a
record.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and state attorneys general
Wednesday pointed to reasons why the impact of the ruling may be
limited. The appeals court struck down a ruling last year by a
federal judge who had ordered Microsoft to offer its Windows 95
operating system and Internet Explorer browser program separately.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
was intended to preserve competition in the market for browsers,
software used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, the Justice Department had alleged that by bundling
its browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system,
Microsoft was violating its 1995 consent decree with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's majority opinion, Justice Department officials noted,
applied to the consent-decree case and not necessarily to the
government's broader antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The broader monopoly case, based on a far more extensive federal
investigation, contains several additional charges against
Microsoft. But a pivotal argument in the case _ and one sharply
criticized by the appeals court majority opinion _ is that by tying
new software programs to its Windows operating system, Microsoft is
unfairly squelching competition in new markets, like Internet
software and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that it, and it alone, should be the arbiter
of what new software is bundled into its Windows operating system,
the equivalent of the central nervous system on some 90 percent of
personal computers. Besides, Microsoft contends, its Internet
browser is not a separate product, as the government asserts, but
an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court majority sided with Microsoft, saying ``the
limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product designs
and the high cost of error should make them wary of second-guessing
the claimed benefits of a particular design decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, legal experts say, could have merely struck
down Jackson's injunction with a brief ruling. Instead, it
presented detailed views on antitrust law and high-technology
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion, legal analysts say, is clearly intended as
a warning signal to the government, the states and Jackson, who
will hear the broader antitrust case starting Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion is very applicable to the broader case,'' said Joe
Sims, a partner at Jones Day Reavis &AMP; Pogue, who is a former senior
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ``It's a
first indication that this court believes that the conceptual
approach of the Justice Department is a stretch legally.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court majority ruling must figure into the
preparations for the broader case, acknowledged Justice Department
officials and state attorneys general, by suggesting where more
facts must be marshaled to strengthen its arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very definitely a bump in the road,'' said Richard
Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, ``but it doesn't
knock the wheels off our wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Miller, Iowa's attorney general, emphasized that the
appeals court setback will not prompt the states to reconsider
proceeding with the broader case. ``It's full-speed ahead _ no
thought of the opposite,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Several states filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Justice
Department's consent-decree case. Though Justice Department
officials said no tactical decision has yet been made on appealing
the appeals court ruling, it is unlikely to try to appeal to the
Supreme Court _ saving that option, if necessary, for the broader
case.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion reflects the more conservative approach
termed ``judicial restraint'' by its advocates. Its author was
Judge Stephen Williams, a Reagan appointee and self-described
adherent of the doctrine of judicial restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative approach leans hard on the notion that if a
company, like Microsoft, can show a discernible consumer benefit to
its tying together of products or features, such bundling should be
permitted under antitrust law. The government contends that other
factors, especially the potential harm to competition and
innovation, should also weigh in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives tend to shun judicial ``balancing'' in antitrust
cases. Williams wrote, ``Courts are ill-equipped to evaluate the
benefits of high-tech product design, and even if they could place
an evaluation on one side of the balance, the strength of the
`evidence of distinct markets,' proposed for the other side of the
scale, seems quite incommensurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patricia Wald, a Carter administration appointee, took
issue with the majority opinion in some key respects. The majority
view, she wrote in her dissenting opinion, seemed to mean Microsoft
could bundle anything into its Windows operating system merely by
``identifying some minimal synergy associated with such
`integration.'''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wald suggested that some sort of balancing of consumer
benefit vs. economic harm in product decisions was, at times,
something courts should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means do I endorse routine judicial intervention in the
details of product design,'' she wrote. ``But I also do not endorse
(as the majority comes close to doing) judicial abdication in the
face of complexity. The courts are certainly capable of determining
whether a particular integration offers any synergistic benefits at
all or whether these benefits are minimal, significant or great.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School,
observed, ``The majority opinion is one possible interpretation of
antitrust law, but it's a very laissez faire interpretation. Judge
Wald's interpretation is much closer to the Justice Department's
argument.'' &QL;

 DOCUMENTS SUGGEST SALVADOR HIGH COMMAND ORDERED NUNS' DEATH in By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ El Salvador's defense minister suspected that a member
of his high command had ordered the killing of four American
churchwomen in 1980 and later informed the U.S. ambassador of his
belief, according to newly released State Department documents.
</P>
<P>
   For years both governments have asserted that no high-ranking
military officials were involved in the slayings, which provoked an
intense debate about U.S. policy in Central America. The
declassified documents also raise questions as to Washington's
motives for not investigating the confidential information more
aggressively, human rights advocates and former officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions were confided to Thomas Pickering, who was then
the American ambassador to El Salvador and is now under secretary
of state for political affairs. It is not clear from the documents
what action, if any, the State Department took to investigate the
leads passed on by Pickering or to pressure the Salvadoran
government to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, who is on vacation, did not respond to a request for
comment left with his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone should be called on the carpet for this,''
Robert White, the American ambassador at the time of the killings,
said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He made clear, however, that he was not referring to Pickering.
``What has been released moves toward confirming what most of us
have always believed, that this was ordered by higher ups and was
not the idea'' of the enlisted men who were convicted, White added.
</P>
<P>
   Three Roman Catholic nuns, Maura Clarke, Ita Ford and Dorothy
Kazel, and a lay worker, Jean Donovan, were abducted by a military
unit on Dec. 2, 1980, and raped and shot to death. The killings
occurred as the United States was beginning a decadelong
multibillion-dollar effort to prevent left-wing guerrillas from
gaining power, and the case immediately came to symbolize the
pitfalls of American involvement in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 four members of the El Salvadoran National Guard and
their immediate superior were convicted of the murders and
sentenced to 30 years in prison. In March the four enlisted men
broke their 17-year silence and told American human rights
investigators that they had acted only after having received clear
and explicit ``orders from above.''
</P>
<P>
   (The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a judge granted
conditional freedom to three of the five guard members under a
two-month-old law that mandates a reduction in prison overcrowding.
A prosecutor said officials might seek to have the order
overturned, however. The three men, who would be released Tuesday,
have been given credit for good behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered the release of
relevant American documents in response to requests by members of
Congress and representatives of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, which represents the families of the churchwomen and which
interviewed the guard members. State Department officials have said
the 300 pages will be published and posted on a State Department
website in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 12-year civil war, in which 75,000 people were
killed, the Reagan and Bush administrations always echoed the El
Salvadoran government's contention that the slayings were the work
of a small group that was acting on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, however, make clear that officials at the
American Embassy in San Salvador, based on conversations with the
highest levels of the El Salvadoran military, had strong
indications to the contrary and that their superiors in Washington
apparently chose to ignore the indications.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In February 1985, Pickering met with the defense minister at the
time of the killings, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia. Garcia
acknowledged that ``there existed an attitude among the National
Guard elements that colleagues should be protected'' and suggested
that a subaltern might have been directly involved in the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became clear the women had been murdered, he thought
immediately of Col. Edgardo Casanova,'' military commander in the
zone where the churchwomen were abducted, a State Department cable
about the discussion said. ``Without recounting specifics, Gen.
Garcia noted that, sometime before the churchwomen incident,
something similar had happened within the territory falling under
Casanova's jurisdiction,'' the cable said.
</P>
<P>
   In another cable, Pickering related a conversation with the
deputy defense minister, Col. Rafael Flores Lima, regarding
information that ``Edgardo Casanova had been aware of and possibly
ordered the murder of the churchwomen.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores Lima ``noted that Gen. (then Col.) Garcia had had
reservations about Edgardo Casanova,'' the document states, and it
pointed out that Casanova had been transferred to a desk job at
headquarters partly ``because of Garcia's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the families of the churchwomen said Wednesday that
they particularly welcomed a chance to examine the ``special
embassy evidence'' that American officials, as well as a judicial
commission that is looking into the case, have always cited as
proving the guardsmen acted on their own. That evidence turns out
to be a clandestinely taped conversation between the guardsmen's
immediate superior, Sgt. Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman, and a
higher-ranking officer in which the issue of orders from above does
not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that those
insisting this evidence was definitive proof were engaging in some
kind of fraud intended to avoid irreparable damage to the policy,
which was to continue working with the Salvadoran military,'' said
Scott Greathead of the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, which
is based in New York. ``That's the only conclusion you can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript does, though, make it clear that senior
Salvadoran officers organized and directed a cover-up of the
killings. Sgt. Colindres Aleman states that within days of the
killing he admitted his role to Maj. Lizandro Zepeda, who was in
charge of the military's initial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, Zepeda took declarations from at least some of
those involved'' in the crime, in which they concocted an offical
verson of events that absolved them of responsibility, according to
an Embassy cable accompanying the transcript notes. ``Zepeda
included these in his January report knowing that they were
false.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a United Nations Truth Commission report concluded that
Garcia and Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova organized and
directed the cover-up. Col. Vides Casanova, who in 1980 was
director of the National Guard, is a first cousin and friend since
childhood of Col. Edgardo Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   Awarded a general's rank, Vides Casanova later served as
minister of defense during one of the most violent periods of the
war, working closely with American authorities. Within days of
retiring in 1989, he moved to Florida, where he gained permanent
resident status and lives with his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   The new material is unlikely to lead to additional legal
proceedings in El Salvador, however, because the 10-year statute of
limitations on murder has expired.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES TO MEET EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Texas, Conn.)  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four Supreme Court justices will lead a delegation
in meetings next month with judges in four European countries, the
court announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The four justices, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, will present papers and exchange
views on court procedures and topics such as religious freedom,
federalism, discrimination in the work place, human rights and the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation includes two other judges, Richard Arnold of the
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Little Rock, Ark., and Texas
Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Phillips. The group will also
include Thomas Susman, a Washington lawyer representing the
American Bar Association, and two law professors, Paul Verkuil,
dean of the Benjamin Cardozo Law School in New York, and Paul
Gewirtz of Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The four justices have all spent part of past summers teaching
in Europe or meeting with European judges, and they have expressed
interest in various ways in drawing on other countries' legal
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the justices' individual interests, a joint project on
this scale is unusual for the court. The trip, July 5 to 15, will
include visits to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg; the
European Commission in Brussels; the German constitutional court in
Karlsruhe; the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg,
France; and three French appellate courts in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is being underwritten by the State Department, the U.S.
Information Agency and a private foundation.

   &QL;  CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES ANIMAS LA PLATA -- TRIBAL
LEADERS SAY SEE YOU IN COURT
</P>
<P>
   By Elliot Zaret
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 24 -- In a move that Ute tribal leaders say may
force them to sue the federal government for their water rights,
the Clinton administration Wednesday announced strong opposition to
the Animas-La Plata water settlement and called for the bill to be
re-written.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, as chairman of the Southern Ute Tribe, will climb upon my
war pony and spread to all the Indian nations across the country
that the administration has broken its promise,'' said Clement
Frost, chairman of the Southern Ute Tribal Council, one of the two
tribes involved in the water settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., said that until
Wednesday, the administration had been supportive of the bill,
which would have resolved water rights issues remaining from an
1868 treaty with the Ute tribes. The plan to divert the Animas and
La Plata Rivers in southwestern Colorado and northern New Mexico to
bring water to the tribes has been the subject of numerous bills
over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our last time to sit down and negotiate -- we've gone
as far as we can go,'' Frost said. ``We'll go to court if we need
to. We don't have anything else to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who blasted the administration for ``backstabbing''
and ``pulling the rug out from under the tribes'' said the
administration's opposition effectively kills the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've encouraged the tribes that maybe they should go back to
court and sue,'' said Campbell, who had co-authored the bill with
Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo. ``It's going to be long, litigious and
expensive for the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's bill, the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of
1998, would build a reservoir and pumping plant on the Animas River
near Durango, along with other features for municipal and
industrial water supplies, to serve Ute tribes and other
communities in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The scaled-down version of Animas-La Plata -- known as ``Animas
La Plata Lite'' -- would cost approximately $300 million, far less
than the original $754 million project which Congress passed in
1988. But environmental groups have attacked the plan as just the
first step in an attempt to reinstate the original, larger plan.
</P>
<P>
   Eluid Martinez, commissioner of the Department of the Interior's
Bureau of Reclamation, told a Senate panel that ``the modified
Animas-La Plata project raises renewed concerns over the same
unanswered, critical environmental, fiscal, financial, economic and
legal issues that have kept the project from coming to fruition for
a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Richardon, director of policy for the Bureau of
Reclamation, said the administration had three concerns: that the
current plan lacks a mechanism to actually deliver water to the
tribes, that the bill waives environmental laws, and that the bill
waives an law that would require the tribes to pay for the parts of
the plan that don't affect their land.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who refused to say whether Clinton would veto the
bill if it were passed by Congress, said the administration plans
to release an alternative package sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And though the administration ``strongly opposes'' the bill,
Martinez said, ``it is committed to continue a dialogue with the
Tribes and others in pursuit of the best means to obtain a just and
final settlement for the Tribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Knight-Frank, Chairperson of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribal
Council, said the opportunity for that dialogue has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent many hours and many nights and many years trying
to work with them, and they say they want a dialogue,'' said
Knight-Frank. ``If they want to talk to us they've had every
opportunity and the opportunities have been there for over 100
years to fulfill their trust obligation -- and they have not done
that. I think that it's too late. I know that it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit by the Ute tribes would put into question many issues
of water rights in southwest Colorado, said Colorado Attorney
General Gale Norton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such litigation would involve virtually all water users in the
Animas and La Plata basins, take many years of trial and appeals,
cost millions of federal, state, and local taxpayer dollars, and
undo decades of cooperation between Indians and non-Indians in
southwest Colorado,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   To the tribes, however, the issue runs deeper than the money --
or the rivers, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are treated like strangers in our own nation, we are
treated like aliens,'' said Frost. ``It's saddening that many
things (the administration says) are not true. They do not keep
their word.''

<P>
   XIAN, China _ President Clinton's aerial caravan arrives here
Thursday for a visit eagerly sought by his Chinese hosts as
long-overdue recognition of China's status as a major global power.
But Clinton leaves behind an America deeply uneasy about the
conduct and intentions of a rising China.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the summit talks, the friction in the
relationship has been evident in the two countries' failure to
reach agreement on a number of agenda items the United States
considers important, including human rights, trade, military
cooperation, and a largely symbolic gesture to announce that
neither country would aim its nuclear missiles at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of these problems, the White House has been trying to make
the case that the success of the visit ought to be measured not in
the number of agreements reached or documents signed _ they will be
relatively few and modest _ but in whether Clinton and President
Jiang Zemin can subtly redefine the relationship between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's nine-day voyage to China is the longest presidential
visit to a single country since Harry Truman attended the Potsdam
peace conference in Germany after the end of World War II in
Europe. It is the first to China since President George Bush was
here in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The president intends to devote the majority of his schedule and
his public appearances to addressing China's people, not its
leaders. He will visit a small village that has conducted its first
open election, attend services at an officially registered
Protestant church in Beijing, speak to students at Beijing
University, and engage in a roundtable discussion with young
entrepreneurs in Shanghai. The official part of his schedule is
essentially limited to a half-day of meetings with Jiang and two
elaborate dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, Clinton and his advisers say, is to show the American
people a dynamic and diverse China that could become the U.S.
economy's biggest customer and an important ally in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The message is simple: China is too big to be ignored and the
U.S.-China relationship too important to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That relationship,'' Clinton said in an address 10 days ago
outlining the goals for his trip, ``will in large measure help to
determine whether the new century is one of security, peace and
prosperity for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's schedule is also an answer to critics in
Congress and elsewhere, who object to the warming of relations with
a government that still jails dissidents, threatens Taiwan,
oppresses Tibet, forces abortions and imposes stiff tariffs on U.S.
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The political goal of the president's journey, as formed by
White House strategists, can best be understood as a long defense
of his policy of engaging China, which is the focus of
congressional investigations into political contributions and the
possible transfer of U.S. technology to the development of Chinese
nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the visit will be heavily symbolic, beginning with his
arrival in Xian, the ancient Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   The official welcoming ceremony will be held Saturday morning in
Tiananmen Square, a place where the Chinese have celebrated triumph
and witnessed tragedy repeatedly over the decades since the
communist revolution of 1949. Clinton has already come under
criticism in the United States for agreeing to appear at the
square, the symbol of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The trip ends in Hong Kong, which Clinton will portray as the
hoped-for future of all China.
</P>
<P>
   The images Clinton wants his domestic American audience to
remember are his contacts with ordinary Chinese _ villagers,
students, business people, first-time homeowners, churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton makes his progress from historic Xian to imperial
Beijing to bustling Shanghai to picturesque Guilin, he will be
following the standard tourist itinerary. Each stop has a policy
component, but it the risk for the White House is that Americans
will see only the pictures and find few concrete benefits to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly risky summit for the president,'' said David
Shambaugh, director of the Sigur Center at George Washington
University and a former China policy adviser at the National
Security Council and the State Department. ``It's the longest trip
of his presidency and he is spending most of it sightseeing.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has tried to win Chinese concessions in some
important areas as part of the president's visit. But senior
officials said Clinton left for China with little prospect of
agreement on major parts of that agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped that China would sign the
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, as Beijing
promised to do this spring, when Clinton chose not to sponsor a
resolution condemning China's human rights practices. But Jiang
announced that China would only sign the convention this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   China also has thus far rejected U.S. efforts on Tibet, by
refusing the idea of a visit, by an internationally known person or
organization, to the young Panchen Lama designated by the Dalai
Lama. China has appointed its own Panchen Lama, the second-ranking
spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. The 9-year-old Panchen Lama
and his parents, Beijing says, are under the state's protection in
an unidentified location.
</P>
<P>
   China has also resisted U.S. requests to stop the re-education
of monks and nuns in Tibetan monasteries, and has thus far not
released any well-known Tibetan prisoners of conscience. Nor has
China yet released any of the dissidents on list given to Beijing
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   China has also rejected the idea of any sweeping review of the
cases of nearly 2,500 prisoners convicted under a
counter-revolutionary offense now scrapped from Chinese law,
including some dating from the Tiananmen demonstrations.

   And officials in Washington were pessimistic about the
possibility of an agreement under which China would stop targeting
its nuclear missiles at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the White House said there was still hope for the
gesture and sent Deputy National Security Adviser James Steinberg
to to China ahead of Clinton for a last round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the State Department and Pentagon, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said it was unlikely a deal could be
reached. China has insisted it would not ``detarget'' its nuclear
weapons until the United States pledges never to use nuclear
weapons first in a crisis. ``We're absolutely deadlocked,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Against this political backdrop, Clinton hopes to assuage
domestic critics of engagement with the Chinese with frank talk on
China's continuing human rights abuses. He will remind China's
leaders that attempts to meddle in U.S. politics by secret campaign
contributions are illegal and unacceptable. He will praise China
for its role in trying to restrain an arms race between India and
Pakistan. He will urge it to open its markets. And he will say that
China must take painful steps to reduce pollution that is damaging
the health of its people and contributing to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   On each of these areas the president has come under attack from
critics across the political spectrum in the United States, who
complain that he is turning a blind eye to Chinese misbehavior in
the interest of advancing America's commercial ties to the world's
most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is his real policy? Engaging them by money?'' asked Harry
Wu, a Chinese dissident now living in the United States. ``Only in
giving them money, it means an appeasement policy. If your policy,
foreign policy, doesn't contain a moral basis, this is a typical,
hypocritical appeasement policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other human rights advocates, in Congress and in
non-governmental groups, say that by agreeing to visit China
without solid pledges of internal reform the president is
squandering an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has created many of his own problems, some of his
critics argue, by shifting his views and his rhetoric on China
repeatedly during his five years in office. As a candidate in 1992,
he criticized Bush for ``coddling'' the leaders who later mowed
down demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. As president, he linked
normal trading relations to progress on human rights, then reversed
himself and de-linked them.
</P>
<P>
   He sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait in March 1996
after China conducted a series of provocative missile tests near
Taiwan. A year later he invited Jiang to the White House for the
first state visit by a Chinese leader in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration spent the first five years trying to
develop a China policy that satisfied its many objectives,'' said
Robert Ross, a China scholar at Boston College. ``It went through
at least five or six phases, then settled on the new China policy
of working toward a strategic partnership.''

ADVERTISING: STUDY CITES 6 CATEGORIES OF CONSUMERS WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A venerable research company is offering additional
evidence that consumers around the world are more similar than
different, sharing attitudes and behavior that advertisers and
agencies may study to create more effective sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Roper Starch Worldwide in New York, has interviewed
35,000 consumers in 35 countries to identify shared values that
cross national borders. The results of the study, ``Global Consumer
Hot Buttons,'' are to be presented Thursday at a conference in
midtown Manhattan marking the 75th anniversary of Roper Starch.
</P>
<P>
   The study is indicative of concerted efforts to broaden consumer
research beyond traditional considerations, be they demographic,
psychographic or geographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are increasingly taking a more global view to consumer
understanding, strategic planning and business management,'' said
Larry Mock, vice president for market research worldwide at Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co. in Cincinnati, who is scheduled to speak at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Examining consumers ``at deeper, more emotional levels has
allowed us to accelerate the rate at which we roll out our new
product initiatives worldwide,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Farnsworth Riche, a consultant who until January was the
director of the U.S. Census Bureau, said certain factors once
deemed crucial to understanding consumer behavior, particularly
overseas, had become less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't all that different,'' said Ms. Riche, who is
also scheduled to speak at the conference. ``Their tastes are very
similar. That's why it's worth Whirlpool's while to figure out what
size refrigerators to make to sell in Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make sure that you don't use the taboo color,
for instance,'' she added, ``but the cultural stuff is just a
wrinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the study, said Tom Miller, group senior vice
president and director for international operations at Roper
Starch, ``was to put into place a globally comparable system of
gathering consumer intelligence and predicting consumer trends
around the world.'' Miller, who will present the study at the
conference, offered a preview of the findings in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for the bedrock values, the fundamental, stable
things in people's lives that determine who they are,'' Miller
said, ``to understand the underlying motivations that drive their
attitudes as well as their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which covered countries in Asia, Europe and North and
South America, found ``six distinct global value groups,''
according to Miller, ``belief systems that define consumers long
term.'' As research companies are wont to do, Roper Starch has
given the six categories catchy names that are meant to be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at the groups, as described in the study.
</P>
<P>
   STRIVERS _ The largest group, 23 percent of the world's adult
population, hold ``material things extremely important,'' Miller
said, valuing ``wealth, status, ambition and power'' and products
like computers and cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Strivers are ``middle-aged, more male than female,'' he added,
``and found disproportionately in the developed and developing
nations of Asia like Japan and the Philippines.'' They have little
time for media apart from newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   DEVOUTS _ Devouts, 22 percent of adults, have ``more traditional
values,'' Miller said, like ``faith, duty, obedience, respect for
elders,'' and are concentrated in Africa, Asia and the Mideast.
They are least involved with the media and least likely to want
Western brands.
</P>
<P>
   ALTRUISTS _ As the name implies, Altruists, 18 percent of
adults, are ``very outer focused,'' Miller said, interested in
social issues and causes. They are ``generally well educated,'' he
added, as well as older (median age of 44) and ``more female than
the norm.'' Altruists are often found in Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   INTIMATES _ This group, at 15 percent of the adult population,
is composed of ``people people,'' Miller said, ``focusing on
relationships very close to home: spouses, significant others,
family, colleagues, friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Intimates, frequently found in Britain, Hungary, the Netherlands
and the United States, ``are well worth targeting'' if you are
selling familiar consumer brands, he added.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``very heavy users of media that can be shared to
create a common bond with other people,'' Miller said, like radio,
movies and television. That helps explain the phenomenon of a
``water cooler show'' on TV, which people watch to discuss with
others the next day.
</P>
<P>
   FUN SEEKERS _ At 12 percent of adults and ``the youngest
group,'' Miller said, Fun Seekers prize values such as ``pleasure,
excitement, adventure and looking good.'' They frequent bars, clubs
and restaurants and devour electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``the group that is more global in its life style,'' he
added, ``particularly in music.'' He said, ``It really is an MTV
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATIVES _ The smallest group, at 10 percent, is dedicated to
``learning, knowledge and technology,'' Miller said, and is ``a
global trend setter in owning a PC, using a PC, surfing the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatives ``are the highest consumers of media'' of any group,
he added, ``with a big skew toward books, magazines and
newspapers.''

CHINA CANCELS OPERA AT LINCOLN CENTER
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplicaation warning: also moved in `e' category; with
CHINA-PEONY-FRANCE) 
(bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ After a final round of negotiations failed to
yield a workable compromise, Shanghai's Bureau of Culture refused
Wednesday night to let a classic Chinese opera be staged as
scheduled next month at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Festival director Nigel Redden, director of the festival, said
late Wednesday night that Shanghai officials maintained that the
production of the opera, ``The Peony Pavilion,'' would have to be
extensively revised to better reflect Chinese tradition before it
would be allowed to travel to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although Redden was willing to accept a staging with minor
changes, the officials insisted on a new set of rehearsals that
would make it impossible for the opera, a 20-hour production that
was to have been presented in several segments, to open July 7 as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have effectively canceled the project,'' said Redden, who
flew to China on Monday to try to negotiate a way out of the
impasse. ``This is a tremendous loss for us, but it's even worse
for people in the company, who worked day and night for so long to
pull this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden said he planned to leave Shanghai on Thursday night. Yet
he still expressed the hope that President Clinton or Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who are to arrive in China that evening,
would intervene and persuade Shanghai officials to reverse their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Bomin, the director of Shanghai's Bureau of Culture, said she
blocked ``The Peony Pavilion'' because it was a national treasure
that needed to be protected from unorthodox interpretations like
the one Lincoln Center wanted to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precious piece of Chinese culture,'' Ms. Ma, a
former opera singer, said in an interview. ``If we are going to
show it to the world, it must be presented in line with Chinese
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly about ``The Peony Pavilion'' for the first
time since its staging was suddenly thrown into doubt last week,
Ms. Ma defended her bureau's right to be the arbiter of what is
consistent with Chinese tradition. Her comments reflected the
doggedness with which opera buffs in China can try to guard their
turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the power to decide how an opera is performed,'' Ms.
Ma said. ``You must understand, our standards for Kunqu Opera and
Peking Opera are not the same as for other arts. I am an artist,
and I have a responsibility to see it done properly.''
</P>
<P>
   (At Lincoln Center, Beverly Sills, the chairman, and Nathan
Leventhal, the president, issued a statement saying that the Bureau
of Culture's position ``makes it physically impossible for Lincoln
Center to receive the production in time to mount and present it as
scheduled.'' They praised ``the superb artistry of the Shanghai
Kunqu Opera Company,'' which was to have performed the work, and
congratulated the director of the production, Chen Shi-Zheng, ``for
his brilliant and evocative conception.''
</P>
<P>
   (Lincoln Center will explore legal steps, Leventhal said. ``We
own the production,'' he said, referring to Lincoln Center and its
partners in the commissioning consortium. ``They don't.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma brushed aside arguments that the opera be judged by
Lincoln Center, which is financing the production with co-producers
in France, Australia and Hong Kong, where the opera is also
scheduled to appear. She also discounted the importance of a
contract that she approved last year granting Chen full artistic
freedom in its staging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to the contract, and we thought the production was a
good idea,'' Ms. Ma said. ``But now we find that it includes
elements that cannot be allowed, unhealthy elements that violate
China's cultural exchange regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton arriving for a nine-day visit to China on Thursday,
Redden expressed hope that Chinese and U.S. officials would be
eager to resolve a dispute involving a cultural exchange,
especially since Shanghai is now trying to present itself as a
vibrant financial and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Unless some senior official intervenes, Ms. Ma is having her
way. ``I don't see what this has to do with President Clinton's
visit,'' she said. ``This is about art, and the debate should
remain about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma cites three artistic objections to the modern staging of
``The Peony Pavilion'': that the production violates the spirit of
the author Tang Xianzu, who wrote the opera in 1598; it violates
the specific rules of Kunqu Opera, one of China's most refined and
classic strands of traditional opera; and it introduces what she
called ``unhealthy elements,'' which she defines as ``feudal,''
``superstitious'' and ``pornographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Ms. Ma spoke, it became clear that her biggest problem
was with Chen, a native of China who moved to the United States in
1987 and became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's innovative staging of the opera uses an elaborate set _
complete with a duck pond, water wheel and singing birds _ in what
he described as an effort to recreate the atmosphere of daily life
in China for ordinary people in the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma and other elders of Shanghai's culture bureaucracy,
accustomed to simple staging and more stylized acting, are also
apparently accustomed to getting the changes they demand when they
preview a piece of theater. Ms. Ma expressed surprise and some
resentment when Chen resisted some changes she sought after seeing
a dress rehearsal this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the director has the right to interpret the
opera, but the spirit must be true to the original,'' Ms. Ma said.
``When we made suggestions, he said he would accept some, but not
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrinkling her nose in disgust, she delivered what seemed to be
the most serious criticism she could make about a fellow artist of
classic opera: ``He lacks knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   A director like Chen _ with new ideas, a healthy American budget
and a firm artistic vision _ is almost inevitably going to raise
hackles or induce professional jealousy in a country like China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has his own ideas and he is very stubborn,'' Ms. Ma said.
Asked why her bureau's objections to ``The Peony Pavilion'' were
raised only after the production had rehearsed in Shanghai for
eight months, she said concerns had been raised indirectly all year
long. Only after Chen staged the dress rehearsal, Ms. Ma said, did
she have a chance to fully explain what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When Chen wanted to go over the script with her, to ask which
points she specifically objected to, Ms. Ma seemed to rely on a
tactic common to Communist Party censors, insisting that he make
the changes himself and then let her judge the finished product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him: `You're the director,''' Ms. Ma said. ``You have
to make the changes, and then let us see the rehearsal as it will
be performed. Then we will decide.''

PROPOSED WETLAND RULES DRAW BROAD CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is proposing changes to
a long-disputed system of wetland development permits, potentially
opening up more wetlands to builders but also creating new
restrictions that are intended to help minimize environmental
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The special permits allow developers to fill in several acres of
wetlands at a time without going through prolonged regulatory
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which was criticized as too lenient by
environmental advocates and too strict by developers, would allow
the permits for more types of wetlands and for larger construction
sites. At the same time, the plan would allow local authorities in
some parts of the country to put new conditions on development, and
would limit the extent of wetland destruction in some
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``nationwide permits,'' the special provisions
governing wetlands were established by Congress years ago to avoid
potentially lengthy reviews of relatively straightforward projects.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the permits authorize thousands of residential,
commercial and other developments affecting wetlands of a few acres
or less. Developers are often required to offset the environmental
damage by preserving or protecting other wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are supposed to be used only where minimal
environmental harm is expected, the permits cumulatively account
for a significant portion of the estimated 70,000 to 80,000 acres
of wetlands that are lost each year.
</P>
<P>
   Because wetlands provide ecological services such as water
purification and wildlife habitat, the federal government is trying
to reduce annual net wetlands losses to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Army Corps of Engineers, which regulates
wetlands, briefed industry and environmental groups on the proposal
on Wednesday. Officials said the rules would be published soon for
public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they are moving the program in the wrong direction,''
said Michael Luzier, assistant vice president at the National
Association of Home Builders. He said fewer developers would be
able to use the new permits, and that new, regional restrictions
would cause delays for builders.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Caputo, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said the broad scope of the new permits was troubling and that the
limit on how many acres of wetlands could be destroyed was far too
high.
</P>
<P>
   One kind of permit would allow up to three acres of wetlands to
be destroyed in construction of residential subdivisions and
shopping malls, while another would allow up to ten acres to be
eliminated by larger developments.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes come at a time when wetlands regulations
are under broad attack by industry groups, which have won a series
of court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia upheld a lower court's ruling that the Corps of Engineers
overstepped its authority by regulating developers whenever they
drained wetlands by dredging. The court's decision invalidated a
1993 regulation, known as the Tulloch rule, that had greatly
expanded Army Corps jurisdiction over development in wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Court decisions have put such pressure on federal regulators
that they now must consider asking Congress to rewrite the portions
of the Clean Water Act that govern wetlands, a request that
environmental agencies are loath to make because many members of
Congress are hostile to wetlands regulations.

PREKI READY TO TAKE ON YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France --- Like Thomas Dooley before him, Predrag
Radosavljevic is ready to take on his native land in a World Cup
clash. Whether he'll get that opportunity, only Steve Sampson
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Radosavljevic --- known to all as ``Preki'' --- would love to
celebrate his 35th birthday with a goal to beat Yugoslavia tonight
at Stade de La Beaujoire, but he's not anticipating it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like I'm starting, and that's very
disappointing for me, especially since this game means very little
for us,'' he said following training on Wednesday. ``I knew coming
in I would not be a starter, but I thought I'd get more playing
time, maybe one or two starts. I'm being overlooked every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory over the Yugoslavs would do nothing but bolster Yankee
pride --- the Americans are heading home afterwards regardless of
the result --- and the match offers Sampson an opportunity to
reward the Belgrade-born forward, whose spectacular goals off the
bench notched back-to-back wins over Costa Rica and Brazil in
February.
</P>
<P>
   But Preki, who played the final 33 minutes of Sunday's 2-1 loss
to Iran, doesn't think he'll be on the field, at least not
initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with Steve for two minutes after the Germany match (on
June 15), and he was trying to assure me that he still believed in
me,'' he said. ``I don't think that's the case. It would be nice to
start my first World Cup match, but it doesn't look like it's going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not played so well offensively, and everyone's getting a
shot but me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson won't say one way or another if Preki, whose birthday
was Wednesday, would be in his lineup. Asked why Preki wouldn't be
starting, he replied: ``Who says Preki won't start. I didn't say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson has used Preki almost exclusively off the bench,
questioning his ability to go a full 90 minutes. Preki has done so
repeatedly with the Kansas City Wizards, with whom he won Major
League Soccer's scoring title and MVP award last season, but he
carries far more defensive responsibilities when playing for the
national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Sampson is) just trying to find a reason not to play
me,'' Preki said. ``It's certainly not the case'' that he can't
play the full game.
</P>
<P>
   Preki came to the United States in 1984, leaving Red Star
Belgrade for an indoor soccer career. He was an indoor star most of
the next 12 years --- with brief stints outdoors in Portugal and
England --- then became one of MLS's biggest stars when the league
kicked off in 1996. He gained U.S. citizenship in October 1996 and
has been in and out of the U.S. squad since; he was left out of the
team for a time after sulking over playing time, but Sampson
brought him back after an attitude adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's been the Americans' 12th man, a player of
superb skill and a great left foot, which he proved most notably in
that 1-0 stunner over the Brazilians at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   He'd love the chance to show Yugoslavia --- the ``Brazilians of
Europe'' --- what he can do, in great part because it is where he
was born, bred and learned to love the game. But his feelings
mirror those of Dooley, the German-born U.S. captain who led the
Yanks against Germany in their World Cup opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought it would be very emotional (to play against
the Yugoslavs), but I really haven't thought about it yet,'' he
said. ``I'm sure it will be even more emotional as the game gets
closer, and more so if I play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as the game starts, it's just a game.''

 UNDATED: the owners. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the many billions of dollars that will be required for the
communications industry to update its networks for a future
all-Internet format must come from the revenues of current
customers. That is why the first battles in the long war over who
provides Internet access to the home will probably be over local
voice telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   After all, nearly every household, whether it subscribes to
cable service or even has a personal computer, requires phone
service _ which remains the one surest way to establish a direct
relationship with an individual household.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has not had a direct line into most consumer's homes since
it was banished from the local telephone business by the Bell
System breakup in 1984. But the company, freed to return to the
local phone business by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, now
hopes to offer customers a complete package that includes local,
long-distance and wireless telephone service along with cable
television and Internet access all on one monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the TCI deal, AT&AMP;T had been assembling pieces of
that capability. In January, it agreed to pay $11.3 billion for
Teleport Communications Group, which provides local phone and data
services _ mainly to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been trying to develop an affordable wireless system
for local calls from the home that would bypass the local telephone
companies, by tapping into the vast cellular network it acquired
with the purchase of McCaw Cellular. It has been expanding and
modernizing that network ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But in the local markets in which TCI operates, the deal
announced Wednesday would give AT&AMP;T direct wires into homes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that AT&AMP;T and TCI will succeed in their
joint quest, of course. The competition is simply too fierce to
predict the winners, as players in all areas of the
telecommunications industry are rapidly moving into one another's
markets.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, in an effort to fend off phone company
competition, for example, has signed up 1 million people for its
low-cost long distance service, offered through Tel-Save Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Local telephone companies, meanwhile, are creating technology
that would enable them to offer high-speed Internet connections
over conventional phone wires. And Sprint, the long-distance
company, already a big provider of Internet transport services to
other network operators, has spent $2 billion to reconfigure its
entire network to use Internet-format technology rather than
traditional phone-network circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the industry urge to merge grows stronger on
the assumption that victory ultimately will go the companies with
the greatest size and geographic reach. Thus Worldcom has a pending
deal to acquire MCI, the Baby Bell SBC Communications has agreed to
buy another Bell, Ameritech, and so on. All of which has put
pressure on AT&AMP;T to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WorldCom/MCI deal will make the resulting company the most
important worldwide supplier of communications,'' said Jerry
Michalski, a computer industry consultant. ``AT&AMP;T had to do
something in order to avoid slipping out of contention as the major
platform for worldwide, integrated communications.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only when a company can offer a full range of services
that it can hope to recoup the cost of building an advanced,
Internet-ready network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cost $500 to $600 per house to offer Internet,
telephone and cable services,'' said David Dorman, the chief
executive of the Internet company Pointcast and a former top
executive of one of the original Baby Bells, Pacific Telesis. ``If
a household spends $100 to $200 a month for all those services, it
doesn't sound like a terrible payback.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Paulak of the Gartner Group points out, only the affluent
will be able to afford these new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $100 a month for telephone and high-speed Internet access,
that rules out the half of the population that earns less than
$35,000 a year,'' he said. ``And it will mainly benefit the 12
percent who earn more than $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, TCI, lumbering under a huge debt burden, has been
much slower than its competitors to modernize its network.
</P>
<P>
   ``TCI is big hat, no cattle,'' said Anderson of the Yankee
Group, who estimates that AT&AMP;T will have to invest $10 billion in
TCI's network to be able to deliver all the new services it is
promising. And AT&AMP;T better start writing big checks immediately,
Anderson added, because the winner in the market will be decided
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person to provide high speed Internet access with
voice and data wins,'' he said, ``because if customers are
satisfied, they are never going to switch.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Government plans to use Aquifer Storage and Recovery to save the
Everglades
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The federal plan to save the Everglades
depends on the untested practice of storing up to 1.7 billion
gallons of water underground every day during wet years and pulling
it back up during dry times.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it's never been done before on such a massive
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that federal regulators at the highest levels are
agonizing over the idea of injecting untreated _ and possibly
tainted _ lake water into underground drinking sources.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the alternatives are not well-defined, could
cost millions or even billions more and would fill at least 100,000
acres with water ringed by levees 112 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' plan for the Everglades relies
on the approach known as Aquifer Storage and Recovery, or ASR,
because of its promise.
</P>
<P>
   The system could be a savior of the 21st century, reducing the
need for reservoirs that turn valuable farmland into swamps while
replacing a brackish layer of ground water with enough fresh
watercq to meet the demands of Florida's fast-growing population.
</P>
<P>
   It has so much promise, it should be attempted on a scale five
times as large as planners envision, said a Gainesville consultant
who has shepherded such projects in Florida since the procedure's
infancy in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that without ASR the cost will be so high it would
take us a long time, maybe decades, to solve the problems,'' said
David Pyne, ASR director for CH2MHillcq. That engineering firm has
worked on all five underground storage projects operating in
Florida and about half of the 30 in planning or construction
stages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics say the approach is so uncertain it should be
consigned to backup status. The plan's reliance on the underground
storage system to meet the demands of people while water from other
sources flows into the Everglades is too extreme, said Gary
Dernlan, who manages the Palm Beach County water and sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to take a stance to restore everything and forget
the 5 million people who are here. We don't feel that's the best
route to go,'' Dernlan said.
</P>
<P>
   For the water managers crafting the plan, the answer is in the
middle, a cautious approach that doesn't rely entirely on the
underground storage system but still makes it a significant factor.
They are rushing to create backup plans if the system doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing concern is whether they would have to treat
the water before injecting it underground.
</P>
<P>
   Planners estimate that building 200 underground storage wells
around Lake Okeechobee will cost $600 million. But if the water
must be treated first, it would cost nearly another $1 billion,
making the ASR system as expensive as other storage options, if the
water must be treated first.
</P>
<P>
   The science involves digging a hole more than 1,000 feet deep to
reach the brackish Floridan aquifer. The injected water pushes
aside the brackish water, creating a bubble of fresh water that
eventually can be pulled out and pumped through canals to treatment
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether the water will still be there years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, water managers have worked to persuade the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to let them send untreated water
into the aquifer. The EPA refused, worried about the presence of
coliform bacteria in the injected water. But at a meeting last
week6/9/98, EPA official Richard Harvey said the agency would allow
untreated water to be injected as long as it met other
water-quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came from EPA Secretary Carol Browner, Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that our legacy down here is not that we
allow the ground water to be trashed,'' Harvey said. ``The only
reason we're willing to consider this is because of the potential
economic benefits for the whole South Florida system.''
</P>
<P>
   By summer, an underground storage project in the city of West
Palm Beach may get the nation's first permit to inject untreated
water.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is promising, water managers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is beginning to look like it will be an A-plus with
ASR and maybe a B-minus without it,'' South Florida Water
Management District Chairman Frank ``Sonny'' Williamson said at an
April 15 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Palm Beach County environmentalist Rosa Durando put it:
``ASR is really our only hope. If it doesn't pan out we're dead.''

 &HT;    U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to redesign drainage system
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- A half-century ago, weary from an
unending cycle of flood, drought and fire, South Florida residents
asked Washington to build them a barrier against the extremes of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. All too well.
</P>
<P>
   Federal engineers constructed a 1,600-mile-long bulwark of
canals, levees, pumps and floodgates to ensure that people would
always have enough water _ but never too much. That let the
region's farms prosper. Suburbs and strip malls swarmed, faster
than anyone had imagined, toward the gravel-covered dikes that
marked the Everglades' new boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond those walls, the Everglades strangled in its man-made
straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Now the engineers say it's time to start over. They want to
redesign the entire drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists call it the Everglades' last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers and water managers say it will cost more than $7.5
billion, making it the biggest environmental restoration ever. The
project would spend decades restoring the Everglades' life-giving
pulses of water. The engineers say it's also needed to serve a
region whose population is expected to more than double during the
next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will mean transforming the landscape once again, creating a
network of reservoirs occupying enough territory for a good-size
city. Imagine water covering eight Miamis or two Philadelphias.
Water managers will use so-far-untested methods to store hundreds
of billions of gallons more than 1,000 feet underground, hoping to
retrieve the water years later.
</P>
<P>
   It likely will mean higher taxes or water bills. No one has
decided how to divide the costs, although Washington is expected to
pay half.
</P>
<P>
   All this can happen only if Congress OKs the proposal sometime
after mid-1999. But first, the plan's creators have to sell it to
the people of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water
Management District say their plan wouldn't just rescue the
Everglades. They say it's also the key to making South and Central
Florida livable for the next half-century as its population doubles
to 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, residents can expect more frequent water shortages,
greater floods and repeats of this winter's pounding of the St.
Lucie and Indian rivers by Lake Okeechobee's overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cost to doing nothing,'' said Stuart Appelbaum, the
corps' restoration chief in Jacksonville. ``These problems won't go
away. They'll get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet parts of the plan have drawn skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar growers say it would cripple their industry to give up
tens of thousands of acres of productive farmland for some of the
reservoirs. Water utilities fear relying on unproven storage wells
that might not be able to get federal permits.
</P>
<P>
   Even environmentalists, eager to see the long-promised
restoration become reality, want assurances that this time the
Everglades will come first.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than the old fight between environmentalists and
sugar growers. Everyone has a stake in this debate _ even
suburbanites who wouldn't know saw grass from crab grass. A more
natural Everglades
</P>
<P>
   In corps-speak, the plan is the Central and Southern Florida
Restudy, ordered by Congress in 1992. It's the update of the 1947
federal blueprint that led to the creation of today's South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That project, which the corps built largely in the 1950s and
'60s, began by erecting a 100-mile-long wall to separate the
Everglades from the populated coast.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a reliable water supply, the corps divided what
remained of the central and northern Everglades into a series of
bathtub-like basins. The engineers straightened the Kissimmee
River, widened drainage canals and created the 700,000-acre
Everglades Agricultural Area.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal would leave that structure largely intact. But
it would overlay it with a complex web of pumps, canals, dikes,
100-foot-deep underground ``curtain'' walls, well fields and every
conceivable type of reservoir, from shallow marshes to steep pits
left over from rock mining.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea is to find new places to store water until it's
needed _ especially the estimated 600 billion gallons that drain
unused into the sea each year.
</P>
<P>
   The cities and farms would get all the water they need, with
plenty left over for the Everglades, engineers say.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Everglades could return to natural
cycles, no longer dependent on humans' leftover water. The corps'
advisers say the plan would help birds, crocodiles, deer and fish.
</P>
<P>
   The plan rests on a paradox: Man-made dikes and pumps have
trashed the Everglades. To rescue it, the engineers would add more.
</P>
<P>
   That has worried some scientists and environmentalists, who said
the plan could amount to a $7.5 billion water supply project that
helps the Everglades only slightly. They have pressed the corps to
be more aggressive in dismantling canals and dikes to restore the
features that the Everglades' plants and wildlife need: the wide
stretches of slow-trickling water with a mix of shallow and deep
marshes.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone can agree on what's natural.
</P>
<P>
   When the engineers looked at removing part of the levee around
the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge,
scientists there objected. They said the Palm Beach County refuge
would dry out if the levee didn't hold the water inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the plan, the levee stays.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the latest version of the plan, unveiled last week, would
remove 228 miles of canals and levees, including most of the Miami
Canal and the entire east-west levee that runs north of Everglades
National Park along Tamiami Trail. The corps would add bridges or
culverts to the road to let water flow south into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Appelbaum calls truly natural flow an impossible goal for an
Everglades that has lost half its territory to development.
</P>
<P>
   Park researcher Robert Doren agreed but said the current plan
goes further toward that goal than any earlier proposal. He said he
still questions whether the plan would restore enough water to the
heart of the park, but the rest of the proposal seems likely to
help the environment a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to get back the way the Everglades used to
be,'' Doren said, noting that early explorers found the marsh so
wet that they could ride sailboats from hammock to hammock. ``It's
not that way today, and it will probably never be that way again.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's supporters say scientists don't know enough about
how much water, at what places, at what times, will do the most
good _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to learn a lot as we implement this plan over the
next 20 years,'' said Dan Cary, the water district's planning
director. ``What I want is the most tools in the toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible sticking point is the project's price.
Florida's half of the $7.5 billion cost would be more than the
water district could handle by itself so some mix of state, county
and local money would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The corps and district have given too little thought to the
price tag, argued Palm Beach County Utilities Director Gary
Dernlan, although he said he supports the project and thinks it
will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing they can do is price themselves out of the
market,'' Dernlan said. ``Then the project goes down the tubes, and
everyone loses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Audubon Society lobbyist Charles Lee said the price,
paid out over decades and helping more than 12 million people,
isn't that expensive compared with other big-budget projects. He
cited the estimated $4 billion cost for expanding Miami
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really talking about is a couple of airport runways
or an expressway somewhere,'' he said. Fooling with nature
</P>
<P>
   The proposal follows a century-old tradition of carving up South
Florida to fit the prevailing ideas of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, when most saw the Everglades as a
vermin-ridden swamp in need of draining, a Philadelphia millionaire
named Hamilton Disston(cq) dug a canal linking the Caloosahatchee
River to Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   By 1917, his successors had dynamited riverbeds and scraped four
major drainage canals from the lake to the east coast. Later they
linked the lake to the St. Lucie River, still another outlet for
Okeechobee's excess.
</P>
<P>
   But those primitive efforts backfired in the 1940s, when fires
raged across the dried Everglades, and salt from the ocean invaded
the canals and coastal wells. Then two hurricanes and a tropical
storm struck in the fall of 1947, spreading a blanket of water
across 4,700 square miles from Kissimmee to Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Things got dangerous quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the farming towns around Lake Okeechobee, schoolboys and
prisoners packed sandbags atop canal dikes. In Canal Point, a dike
collapsed, and 4 feet of water flooded the community.
</P>
<P>
   In West Palm Beach, health officials evacuated 400 families from
their homes in neighborhoods where flood waters mixed with sewage.
Loxahatchee Slough sloshed across Okeechobee Road (cq) when a dike
just west of Military Trail gave way.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make a cow cry. Or so the state implied in its
official plea to Congress, which bore a drawing of a cow bawling
its eyes out as water rose to its neck.
</P>
<P>
   The corps had a drainage plan ready, and public sentiment was in
no mood to wait.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, 1948, the day after President Harry Truman signed the
bill giving the go-ahead, the front page of The Palm Beach Post
carried a cartoon of a big equipment crane labeled ``Flood
Control.'' The man at the controls was shouting, ``Let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   For the Everglades, the results were deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Canals offered a conduit to foreign plants and fish while drying
out vast stretches of saw-grass marsh, allowing melaleuca trees to
invade. Other areas have drowned in too much water, causing
island-dwelling trees to wilt. The levees destroyed the fringe
marshes that give wading birds a place to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Water often arrives at the wrong time, scattering the prey of
nesting wood storks and other wading birds. In a cruel ritual, baby
birds routinely starve to death when rising water forces their
parents to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Little surprise, then, that the Everglades' wading bird
population has declined about 90 percent since the corps began its
work.
</P>
<P>
   North of the Everglades, the drainage system failed miserably
this year as El Nio-driven rains filled Lake Okeechobee and sprang
leaks in the Herbert Hoover Dike. The corps released billions of
gallons of lake water down the St. Lucie Canal, devastating fish,
sea grass and tourism-based businesses downstream.
</P>
<P>
   No such misgivings seemed to matter 50 years ago, said Johnny
Jones, retired former chairman of the Florida Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they could think of in those days was how do you get rid
of all that damn water,'' said Jones, who used to hunt ducks near
where the Palm Beach Mall was later built. ``It was simply land
reclamation.'' What's next
</P>
<P>
   The corps and the district plan to revise their proposal during
the summer, then unveil it to the public in mid-October. After
holding public hearings in November, they'll ship a final version
to Congress in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even congressional approval won't end the story. The engineers
and water managers would spend the next 20 years or so designing
each step of the project and lining up the money. What they have
now, the district's Cary said, is ``just a skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   But parts of the project already are under way. Aided by $200
million from Congress, the corps and district have bought tens of
thousands of acres for future reservoirs south of Lake Okeechobee
and along the Everglades' fringes.
</P>
<P>
   The land will be crucial. In a flat region like Florida, most
above-ground reservoirs have to be shallow _ which means they have
to be broad. Water managers are in a race to buy the land,
especially just east of the Everglades, before developers snatch it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Some think it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the coast there's nothing left,'' said Herb Zebuth, a
coordinator for the state Department of Environmental Protection,
who thinks the plan calls for too little storage. ``What are you
going to do in downtown West Palm Beach? Are you going to tear up
all the streets, replace the buildings with treatment areas?''
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain, but supporters say the plan represents a great
leap forward. Twenty-five years ago, most politicians called even
the idea of Everglades restoration a pipe dream, and engineers and
water managers relied on piecemeal fixes that created their own
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember, even as recently as the '80s, really becoming
discouraged at how unwilling, how unprepared we were to take a
big-picture look,'' said John Ogden, a water district biologist and
Everglades expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all turned around just remarkably.''
</P>

Lynne Palombo contributed to this report.

 &HT;    City attempts to capture new water sources
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Palm beach gardens relies on wells when
we flood the slough, this will replenish your wells we're not sure
about that we need the overland flow of water put in a pump we
flood the slough, but who does it really help? at heart, that's the
question _ because it affects who pay for it jupiter _ half wells,
half treated salt water may help me, but we've secured a source of
water independent from your system west palm beach _ where do we
get water to fill the catchment area. had been coming from lake O,
now how about acreage stormwater jupiter and gardens afraid water
management district will tax their wells. fine _ tax our wells but
show us a benefit $34 million _ pumps, wells, canals does this
include buying rock quarry?
</P>
<P>
   A plan to assure a future water supply for residents of northern
Palm Beach County is shaping into a turf battle, with wary
governments positioning themselves to keep the spigot on and the
flow of new taxes off.
</P>
<P>
   _ For West Palm Beach, the revision of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers' 1947 plan puts the city in a strong position to capture
new sources of water, store it and sell it to neighboring
communities.
</P>
<P>
   _ For The Acreage, it's an opportunity to unleash torrents
during heavy rains that otherwise would blanket yards and driveways
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ For Palm Beach County, the plan offers a mechanism to reflood
the 10,000-acre Loxahatchee Slough, recreating lost wildlife
habitat while replenishing freshwater sources in Jupiter and Palm
Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   _ But for communities north of West Palm Beach, the proposal
raises concerns about new charges for improvements they say they
don't need.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the portion that covers northern Palm Beach
County is estimated at $34 million. And West Palm Beach, which
benefits the most, says the money can be found without new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a mosaic,'' said Erik Olson, who heads West Palm
Beach's water and sewer department. ``It is true that the city will
no doubt have a better water supply. But so will The Acreage and so
will the areas to the north of us. We've all got to be together, or
otherwise it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, togetherness has been hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   The portion for northern Palm Beach County would enhance West
Palm Beach's water supply by offering a new source: storm water
from the flood-prone Acreage.
</P>
<P>
   The city would get enough water to meet growth demands and still
market water to other cities _ even perhaps The Acreage. It also
could pump excess water northward into the 10,000-acre Loxahatchee
Slough, which water managers wish to restore to a more natural
flooded state.
</P>
<P>
   A flooded slough would help replenish underground water sources
in Palm Beach Gardens and Jupiter, water managers say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet utilities officials in Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens say
their water supply is fine, and there's no assurance flooding the
slough will make it better. In fact, officials of Seacoast
Utilities, which supplies Palm Beach Gardens, North Palm Beach and
Lake Park, argue the changes would interrupt an overland water
source they rely upon.
</P>
<P>
   The move is great for the environment and like other
environmental improvements should be paid for on a regional basis,
not by local rate payers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities' biggest scare came last year, when water
management district Executive Director Sam Poole broached the idea
of applying a tax on utilities' wells to help pay for the plan for
northern Palm Beach County. He later backed away from the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Loxahatchee Council of Governments, a group of 11 north
county cities and special districts, sent Poole its objections and
produced a resolution for its members to sign. So far, Jupiter and
Juno Beach have signed. Seacoast votes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach officials, trying to avoid conflict, are putting
together grant requests to find the money without tapping local
sources. They believe they can get $20 million from Congress and
$12 million from the South Florida Water Management District.

 &HT;    Officials cites possible fire as reason for firework ban
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Celebrate your liberty this Fourth of
July by setting off a bottle rocket anywhere in Palm Beach County
and you might wind up under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But only if a law enforcement officer actually sees you light
the fuse.
</P>
<P>
   While county officials were trying to decide how best to enforce
their ban on private fireworks Wednesday, Gov. Lawton Chiles
prepared to cancel all public displays as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Chiles said the lack of any forecast for
sustained rainfall could lead him to ban all municipal Fourth of
July fireworks displays, possibly today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that we look forward to doing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Gardens has already canceled its $15,000 Fourth of
July fireworks display on The Gardens mall property because of the
fire danger.
</P>
<P>
   The site north of the mall _ the only one that could accommodate
the 20,000 to 30,000 people who attend the annual event _ has brush
and woods, and firefighters put out a small brush fire there
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County officials acknowledged they're largely
depending on voluntary compliance to not set off fireworks to
reduce the threat of brush fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statewide state of emergency,'' warned county Fire
Marshal Jim Sweat, ``and we're hoping people will pitch in just
like they did after Hurricane Andrew. People said hurricanes can't
happen here. We've had 150 brush fires in June, and it can happen
here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency resolution, signed Tuesday by County Commission
Chairman Burt Aaronson, restricts until Aug. 6 the use of all
fireworks, sparklers and open burning to people or groups with a
government permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fully enforce this resolution and make arrests when
necessary,'' said sheriff's Capt. Ed Bieluch, ``but the violation
must occur in the presence of officers.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Bieluch said, violators will be given a notice to
appear, unless they're drunk or belligerent. Juveniles will be
turned over to their parents, and officers will confiscate any
fireworks in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really hoping our 1 million-plus sensible and
law-abiding citizens will recognize the severity of the
situation,'' Bieluch said.
</P>
<P>
   Three deputies are working solely on illegal fireworks sales and
use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the county, police responded to the ban with varying
degrees of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach police also will issue notices, spokeswoman Dena
Peterson said. ``But our best advice is for people to police
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach Gardens and Jupiter, officers will have the option
of issuing warnings instead of notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids are doing it, it would probably be a warning,'' said
Gardens police chief Jim Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Greenacres will have two extra officers on duty July 4 from noon
to midnight to watch out for bootleg fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   While setting off fireworks is banned, buying them isn't, but
vendors reported slow sales Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exceptionally quiet,'' said Ronald Hunnewell, owner
of Galaxy Fireworks at Boca Rio Road and Florida's Turnpike.``We
anticipate we're going to have about a 50 percent drop in business
from last year, but we'll have a better picture after the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Hunnewell had only five customers, a drop
from the 15 to 20 he had daily this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Circuit Judge Edward Fine heard a request by Hunnewell
for an injunction to bar the county from enforcing its new vendor
ordinance, which requires vendors to post a $15,000 bond, check
photo IDs, take down names and addresses of anyone who buys
fireworks and note the exemption in the law that allows them to
make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnewell claims the county's new rules violate state and
federal laws that permit fireworks sales. Fine did not rule
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Schwartz, manager of Phantom Fireworks in West Palm Beach _
a year-round fireworks business _ said the county's ban on the use
of fireworks already has decreased his customer traffic. It will
only get worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very devastating blow to our business,'' he said.
``This is our Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's employees tried to go about business as usual,
stopping people as they came through the door and asking them to
fill out the affidavits and show a driver license or other forms of
identification.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as John Lewis and his 10-year-old son Devon are
concerned, they're lighting up on July 4 _ ban or no ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Fourth of July, you should be allowed to have
fireworks,'' Lewis said. ``I know I'm going to do it. I think the
ban will be pretty tough to enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Farkas, manning a Forest Hill Boulevard fireworks tent,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more tempted to do stuff that's illegal,'' said
Farkas, who by early afternoon had sold fireworks to about six
people. ``It's like telling a little kid not to do something, and
then it just makes them more determined to do it. And this is the
kind of thing you can get away with.''

<P>
   In his book ``A Guide to Confident Living,'' Dr. Norman Vincent
Peale tells of an experience at a railroad station newsstand. His
attention was drawn to an extensive display of magazines and books
dealing with the common problems of everyday living.
</P>
<P>
   Peale commented to the salesgirl, ``I notice you have a great
deal of this literature for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she replied, ``and I'm telling you that kind of stuff
sure does sell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than murder mysteries or movie magazines?'' Dr. Peale
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, more than all of those and they even out-top the love
stories,'' she declared. ``This self-improvement literature is what
we count on to pay the profits of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the reason? Peale asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer's easy,'' she replied. ``The poor things (referring
to her customers) are all tangled up. There are so many things they
want to get away from, mostly themselves, I suppose. I guess
they're looking for someone to release them from all their
troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   One learns not to be surprised at wisdom that comes from
unexpected sources. An observant salesgirl daily serving the public
may develop shrewd insights into the ways of human nature and the
needs of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of dealing with today's world and its many
complexities, some people seem to have developed increased tension,
greater nervousness, deeper fears, and more profound anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   The profession of personal counseling has expanded extensively
over recent years in an effort to assist people in these
situations. This work is largely performed by psychiatrists,
psychologists, clergymen, social workers, and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   We are learning that the condition of our emotional health can
indicate whether we shall have peace, serenity and strength in our
daily lives. And mental, emotional, and spiritual health are
essential to successful living.
</P>
<P>
   In determining how to handle some of the stresses in life and
learn more about ourselves as individuals, we gain fruitful
insights from the Plains Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say each person had an important part to play in the
life of their tribe. At an early age, the young people participated
in an activity known as the ``vision quest.'' It emphasized
self-denial and spiritual discipline, extending to a lifelong
pursuit of wisdom of mind, body, and soul.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians believed that through the proper preparation for the
vision quest -- prayer, fasting, meditation, the ceremony of the
sweat lodge, and spending time in solitude -- the individuals could
receive a special vision of their purpose in life.
</P>
<P>
   The personal revelatory experience received during the vision
quest then became the fundamental guiding force for the individual.
The dogma of tribal rituals and the religious expressions of others
became secondary to the guidance for living a productive life that
one received from his personal visions.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the uniqueness of the vision quest as a fundamental
guiding force in some Amerindian medicine is to underscore certain
universal aspects of the experience and invite comparisons with the
samadhi of the Yogi, the satori of the Zen Buddhist, Dr. Raymond
Bucke's cosmic consciousness, and the ecstasy of the Christian
mystic.
</P>
<P>
   In our contemporary world, we begin school at an early age and
become educated to varying degrees. This process of education seems
to operate on the theory that information must be added to us, and,
when enough facts are added, we may then be ready to be of service
and become more productive in our world.
</P>
<P>
   We may ask the question, ``How productive is this process?'' By
understanding the philosophy of the Plains Indians, we learn to
view the child as a person who has come to us with a special gift
to give instead of as a product of the educational system. We use
the educational process to discover the special gift, or talents,
inherent within each child and then begin to develop those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Are you struggling with a sense of unfulfillment? Do you have a
feeling that you're here on earth for reasons that presently elude
you? A lot of the world's creative work has been achieved by people
who did it under whatever conditions they had to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Begin to practice the belief that you do have a significant part
to play in life and take steps to discover what it is.
</P>
<P>
   How? Each time an opportunity comes your way that will allow you
to express your talent, welcome that opportunity with open arms!
Since good things may be attracted to you when you put what you
know and believe into action, it is important to practice,
practice, what you know.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what it might feel like to live a productive life and
then assume that attitude. Go forward to meet life with
self-confidence and self-assurance. Do what you are doing so well
that people may be amazed at how talented you are!
</P>
<P>
   Let the joy in your heart give great inspiration and good cheer
to others. Let your caring and consideration for others be
reflected in your thoughts, words, and actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seek and you shall find'' is excellent guidance for leading a
productive life.

U.S. TO RELEASE PATENT DATA ON A WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a new plan for making government information freely available
over the Internet, the Clinton administration will announce
Thursday that it will make the full database of the United States'
patents since 1976 and trademark text and images starting from the
late 1800s available on the World Wide Web beginning in August.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which will create the largest government database
on the Internet, is to be announced by Bruce Lehman, assistant
secretary of commerce and commissioner of patents and trademarks,
in a speech to the American Bar Association's section on
intellectual property law in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make the database freely available is a result
of a fierce debate that has gone on for years between public
interest advocates who argue that government information should
routinely be made available on the Internet and companies that
purchase the data from government agencies to resell.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Clinton administration's action came less than a
week before a deadline imposed by Carl Malamud, an independent
Internet pioneer, who in May said he planned to purchase the data
from the Patent and Trademark Office and make it publicly available
if the government failed to act.
</P>
<P>
   After imposing the deadline in a letter to Vice President Al
Gore and the commerce secretary, William Daley, Malamud said that
he had received an anonymous donation to support his project and
that he was developing his own system of patent and trademark
records.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, however, said that his agency had already made a
commitment to Gore to make the database available as part of the
vice president's ``reinventing government'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Malamud said Wednesday that he had decided to shelve his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site was a backup in case the administration refused to
budge,'' he said. ``We very pleased with the outcome of this
five-year struggle. The American public gets the data they deserve,
and the Clinton administration has shown real responsiveness by
reversing its earlier policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1994, Malamud's group, the nonprofit Internet
Multicasting Service, posted the full text of filings made by
corporations to the Securities and Exchange Commission and several
years of the patent database over the objections of the SEC and the
Patent and Trademark Office. His organization later added databases
from the General Services Administration, the Federal Election
Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the government Printing
Office.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Lehman said that it had long been his
intention to make both databases available on the Internet but that
he needed first to meet a range of technical and policy criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating a 1.3-terabyte searchable database is a big technical
feat,'' he said. A terabyte is 1 trillion characters of
information, equivalent to about a million copies of ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, such a system requires tight security provisions
to isolate it from the Patent and Trademark Office's internal
computer network. In addition, he said, his agency had to perform
an economic analysis on how the decision would affect both the
Patent and Trademark Office and the information industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in competing with the private sector,'' he
said, adding that his agency's analysis had shown that the
private-sector offers added value beyond the patent and trademark
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The new databases will be available at the Patent and Trademark
Office's Web site beginning in August, when trademark text will go
on line. Trademark images and patent text will follow in November.
Patent images linked to the text of the patents will be made
available by March 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The database of more than 2 million patents will be searchable
by key word, as will more than 800,000 registered trademarks and
300,000 pending trademarks. The entire database will be made up of
21 million documents.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the Patent and Trademark Office makes abstracts of
patents available, a system that is already providing users with
more than 3 million pages of patent material a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Patent and Trademark Office received 237,045 patent
applications in the most recent fiscal year _ a 14.9 percent annual
increase _ and approved about 114,000 patents. Trademark
applications grew by 11.8 percent, to 224,355.
</P>
<P>
   The new database on the World Wide Web is a significant step
forward, Lehman said, adding that his plan calls for completely
automating the nation's patent system by 2003. &QL;

<P>
   Zhao, who has been under house arrest for nine years, made his
case in a letter to the party's Central Committee by arguing that
President Clinton's visit to China, which begins on Thursday,
offered a chance to reverse the official verdict on the massacre
that bloodied the streets of Beijing and deeply scarred the
nation's conscience. The Communist Party has insisted that the
government had to use the military to quell a
``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   For a former Communist Party leader to confront the leadership
so openly, and on such a sensitive political issue, is
extraordinary in China. Yet it may reflect Zhao's confidence that
the party's position is squarely on the wrong side of history, and
that the vast majority of Chinese people agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   By trying to provoke debate within the party on the events of
June 4, 1989, when the military killed hundreds of demonstrators
who had been protesting in Tiananmen Square for seven weeks, Zhao
has also risked further punishment. Two ex-officials who know Zhao,
and who attested to the letter's authenticity, said he intended
that it both be read by party leaders and circulated in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are facing the arrival of a new open, democratic and
information-age era,'' Zhao wrote in the letter, which was
published on Wednesday by the Reuters news agency. ``What reason do
we have to reject the will of the people, cling to the June 4
problem and block our road to democratic politics? The trend of
democracy cannot be blocked.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with previous fallen leaders in China, Zhao has
steadfastly refused to admit wrongdoing, apparently calculating
that creating some distance between himself and his successors can
leave the door open to a possible return to power, should the
current leadership falter in a future crisis.
</P>
<P>
   No liberal when in power, Zhao was fast losing influence when
student protests erupted in the spring of 1989, and he painted
himself as sympathetic to their cause as a way to try to save his
own career.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a pragmatic politician or a cynical one, Zhao now uses
his opposition to the crackdown of June 4, 1989, as his greatest
weapon. His supporters make the case with eloquent simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resolving the June 4 question is a common desire of all
Chinese people,'' said Bao Tong, Zhao's chief aide for many years,
who spent seven years in prison after 1989. ``Political reform is
the biggest issue in China today. It begins with June 4.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrives in China, landing in Xian Thursday evening
and then proceeding to Beijing on Friday, he will follow an
itinerary designed to accentuate the nonpolitical side of life in
China. Meeting teachers, lawyers and entrepreneurs, Clinton is
expecting to celebrate the ever-greater degree of personal freedom
that is thriving in the private affairs of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zhao's letter, and even the mere mention of his name, is a
pointed reminder of the authoritarian and secretive system that
still reigns, sharply restricting political freedom in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's case is not a typical one. Held under tight security for
nine years, he has never been charged with a crime. His real
offense was to lose in the high-stakes poker of Communist Party
politics at a time of crisis in 1989, and to refuse to go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Zhao's rival and predecessor as Communist Party
chief, Hu Yaobang, took a much more conciliatory stance after he
was dumped in January 1987. By accepting criticism, and promising
obediance to his successor, Hu retained a seat on the Politburo
until he died in April 1989, an event that sparked the
demonstrations that led to the Tiananmen confrontation as students
used his death as an excuse to protest government shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zhao has also retained his membership in the Communist
Party, and under the sometimes arcane rules that guide China's
ruling elite, that allows him certain privileges, such as access to
internal documents, even as he is deprived of other more basic
rights, like freedom of speech and movement.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao lives with his wife in a spacious home on a small alley
near the Forbidden City in Beijing, and not far from Zhongnanhai,
the compound where China's leaders live and work. Zhao can receive
select, pre-approved visitors, and often sees his daughter and two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   Said to suffer from mild heart trouble, Zhao has occasionally
been allowed to play golf, a sport he became passionate about
during his rise to power on the coattails of Deng Xiaoping during
the 1980s. Every time Zhao wants to leave Beijing, he must apply
directly to President Jiang Zemin, who personally decides.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Zhao has spent many winter months in the resort
city of Hangzhou, where he is believed to have been in February,
1997, when Deng died. Zhao applied to Jiang for permission to
return immediately to Beijing and attend Deng's memorial service,
but Jiang turned down the request, eager to establish himself as
the sole heir to Deng and evidently still threatened by Zhao's
reputation as a capable economic reformer. As prime minister, Zhao
pioneered early stages of China's shift to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who replaced Zhao in 1987as head of the Communist Party,
is judged by political scientists to be vulnerable on the question
of the massacre of June 4, 1989. Even though Jiang was not named as
party General Secretary until three weeks later, emerging as a
complete surprise and compromise candidate, he was physically in
Beijing as a member of the Politburo during the crackdown and is
tainted by association with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders generally try to avoid public
discussion of the Tiananmen incident, it is an issue that weighs
heavily on top-level party politics and that has been repeatedly
been debated at internal meetings, as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
recently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference that was nationally televised when he took
his new job in March, Zhu was asked about the Tiananmen incident.
He appeared to offer the party line in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, every major meeting of our party and
government has drawn a correct conclusion regarding that matter,
and that conclusion can not be changed,'' Zhu said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet careful listeners noticed that, inadvertently or not, Zhu's
comment revealed that at ``every major meeting,'' the Tiananmen
incident had to reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, only if an issue is raised will it be
reaffirmed,'' said Bao. ``That means there are different views.
Otherwise there would be no need to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zhao's letter, he uses the issue of China-U.S. relations to
call for a reappraisal of the June 4 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's visit to China marks a turn for the better
in Sino-U.S. relations,'' Zhao wrote. ``But the United States and
the whole of the West have again and again raised the issue of June
4 and the issue of human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than let it become an obstacle to international
relations, it would be better to resolve the issue of June 4
ourselves, voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the Tiananmen crackdown ``one of the biggest human
rights issues in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao, speaking in a telephone interview from his home in Beijing
late Wednesday night, said, ``I have not seen the letter, but it
sounds like it would be in line with Zhao's thinking.''
 &UR; STORY MAY TRIM HERE &QL; 
 &LR;  Bao is a telling case of political persecution himself. As Zhao's
chief aide and secretary to the Politburo, Bao was one of the most
powerful people in China's leadership before his boss fell from
favor and he was suddenly taken into custody on May 28, 1989, just
days before the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bao was found guilty of subversion for leaking information about
internal party debates in the days leading up to the crackdown,
apparently in a desperate attempt to stop it and save his boss'
career, and his own.
</P>
<P>
   By an odd quirk of China's legal system, Bao recovered his
rights to speak freely on May 28, nine years to the day after his
detention. After granting a few interviews to international
reporters, Bao was again silenced by public security officers who
warned him that in the sensitve days before the June 4 anniversary
this year, keeping quiet would be ``healthy and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know exactly what they meant by that,'' Bao
said, chuckling. ``But today I am speaking to you because I feel
strongly that Chinese people should show President Clinton during
his visit that we have respect for a constitution that guarantees
freedom of speech.''

MARKET PLACE: U.S. STEPS UP PRESSURE FOR JAPANESE ECONOMIC REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after the Clinton administration signed off
on a multibillion-dollar intervention in the foreign-exchange
markets to support the Japanese yen, American authorities stepped
up the pressure on the Japanese government Wednesday to make good
on its promises of economic reform and avoid another decline in the
currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps we can take _ currency intervention _ can have an
effect, but they can have an effect primarily through what they
signal,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday, hours after returning
from a trip to Japan and Indonesia. ``What is crucial is the pace
of action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investors seem to have been unimpressed with the speed
of Japan's efforts to clean up $600 billion in bad bank debts, spur
the economy and accelerate the deregulation of its financial
markets. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told President Clinton
last week that he would accelerate those efforts, a promise that
led to the joint intervention in the currency markets last
Wednesday. That sent the yen's value up sharply though briefly _ it
lingered at a rate around 136 to the dollar for a day or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the yen has slipped ever since, as Japanese leaders reverted
to talking about the difficulties inherent in moving quickly. Late
Wednesday, the yen settled in New York trading at 141.25 to the
dollar, compared with 139.15 on Tuesday, and not far below the
level when the United States agreed to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to interpret Summers' comments as suggesting
that Washington would not intervene again any time soon. But they
have been burned once before: When Summers' boss, Secretary of the
Treasury Robert E. Rubin, told Congress earlier this month that
interventions only worked temporarily, traders saw that as a green
light to bet against the Japanese currency. Their rush to sell yen
at that time gave Rubin an opportunity to take the markets by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Summers also told the Senate committee he had
received additional assurances from Chinese officials that they
were ``committed to maintain exchange-rate stability,'' despite
growing pressure to devalue their currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials fear that a devaluation, while intended to keep
Chinese exports competitively priced with the goods of other Asian
nations, would greatly worsen the Asian financial crisis _ setting
off another round of currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to raise these matters directly when he
meets with Chinese leaders in Beijing this weekend. But already the
administration is praising China for its restraint, and the Chinese
are hoping to parlay their resolve not to devalue into some kind of
diplomatic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said further Wednesday that the International Monetary
Fund was on the verge of another economic agreement with Indonesia
_ its fourth, but the first since President Suharto's resignation.
While details of the accord are skimpy, it will enable the IMF to
resume aid to Jakarta at a time when economic projections for the
country are growing considerably more dire.
</P>
<P>
   The country is suffering what U.S. officials call a food crisis,
with increasing reports of malnutrition in outlying islands, after
years in which Indonesia boasted of self-sufficiency in food
production. The number of Indonesians living below the poverty line
may increase by almost 80 million this year, or nearly 40 percent
of the population, the World Bank warned several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   American officials fear that such distress would worsen attacks
on ethnic Chinese in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Summers made an oblique reference to such attacks Wednesday. He
said that when he met with Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie,
in Jakarta on Monday, he told him ``it is essential that all of
Indonesia's people, rich and poor alike, enjoy a sense of security
that their homes, their businesses and their futures in the country
are secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Summers' testimony Wednesday, though, was on Japan,
and he repeated the theme that the Japanese had only a brief
``window of opportunity'' to act.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, many at the Treasury and the White House are
skeptical about how much Japanese leaders will be able to deliver
before Hashimoto visits Washington on July 22 _ a visit that was
intended in part to keep pressure on Japan and in part to appease
it after Clinton's lengthy visit to China, which begins in Xian on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Japan is a source of very considerable
concern,'' Summers said Wednesday. ``Growth has turned negative;
the banking system is increasingly stressed. While the passage last
week of a significant stimulus package is a welcome step, we remain
very concerned about Japan's economic and financial situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pivotal moment for Asia and the global economy,'' he
added. The weakness in Japan is now having a clear impact on the
other troubled economies in Asia.''

PARCELLS SIGNS TESTAVERDE, DUMPS O'DONNELL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ Bill Parcells, claiming he has learned from
great sports franchises to be aggressive, officially dumped
quarterback Neil O'Donnell Wednesday and signed Vinny Testaverde,
but gave Glenn Foley the ``benefit of the doubt'' as the Jets'
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus six months of an involved financial struggle between the
Jets and O'Donnell, and a personal struggle between O'Donnell and
Parcells, ended with the onetime Super Bowl quarterback looking for
a job. Both sides voiced their disappointment over their brief
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell started a mere 20 games over two seasons as the
centerpiece of an aggressive splurge for free agents in 1996,
before the Parcells era began. He earned almost $12 million for
those appearances, including a $7 million signing bonus. Because
his contract was not guaranteed, he will not earn any more from his
highly publicized $25 million, five-year package. In fact, he will
have to return the $3.75 million he received earlier this year as
an advance on his 1998 pay; he did pick up about $50,000 in
interest, though, according to his agent.
</P>
<P>
   For Testaverde, the Long Islander whose childhood bedroom was
papered with Jets photographs, and who won a Heisman Trophy at
Miami in 1986, ``this was a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident I'll be the starter,'' said Testaverde, 34, who
has thrown 175 touchdowns against 183 interceptions while amassing
almost 30,000 yards in his 11-year pro career. He signed a one-year
deal for $1.5 million, and the Jets have an option for a second
year for $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells said Testaverde is not the starter. At least not
yet. The $1.5 million a year is backup quarterback money. If he
does become the starter and meets a list of incentives, he can
swell his salary to as much as $5 million. Only two years ago he
was in the Pro Bowl, but the Baltimore Ravens, his third pro team,
cut him three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell was to earn $4.2 million this year, a sum Parcells was
unwilling to pay and which O'Donnell was unwilling to slice.
Finally, Parcells said, he decided to make a move. As his model, he
said he used pro-active franchises such as the Cowboys and the
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said: ``I was looking forward to showing everyone I
could be the starter. It just ended a little quicker than I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed he put the negotiations in the hands of his agent,
Leigh Steinberg. But Steinberg has suggested it was O'Donnell who
did not want to take a pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets went 9-7 last season, mostly behind O'Donnell, a
remarkable turnaround from 1-15 in 1996. But O'Donnell was yanked
in consecutive games in midseason and the Jets won behind Foley,
who had the knack of putting the team in the end zone. Foley became
the starter, but lasted only two games before a knee injury ended
his season. The Jets scored one touchdown for every four drives led
by Foley _ twice as often as they scored for O'Donnell. Still,
Parcells has expressed concern for Foley's staying power.
</P>
<P>
   So who is the Jets' starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Vinny that right now, Glenn gets the benefit of the
doubt,'' Parcells said. But Parcells, speaking at the Cadillac NFL
Golf Classic, in which the three quarterbacks competed, added that
he told Testaverde that ``if he performs at a level that's
obviously better, then he'll be the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, a former Boston College star, does not have a
complete-game victory in the NFL: he has won games coming in as a
backup, and he has won games as a starter that he did not finish.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley is much larger now in his upper body, having put on 15
pounds and weighing 225. He is not surprised, he said, that
Parcells has given him ``the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See how the vote of confidence has many faces,'' Foley said
after learning what Parcells had said. Foley was in a jovial mood
Wednesday, shooting a three-over par 75. O'Donnell came in 12 over
while Testaverde was 11 over.
</P>
<P>
   Foley claimed that neither O'Donnell's up-in-the-air status nor
Testaverde's signing bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the stuff going on the last year, I've been
steeled,'' Foley said. ``It really doesn't affect me either way.''
</P>
<P>
   What has affected him, he claimed, was the fact that he was the
main quarterback through a winter and spring of conditioning at the
Jets' training complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The off-season camp did wonders,'' he said. ``It was nice
being in charge and running the offense. It was my show.''
</P>
<P>
   On the course, the three quarterbacks, who were in different
pairings, were mobbed after finishing each hole. After putting out
at one of them, Foley told a group of youngsters: ``Let's go over
here so we don't get hit by any balls. O'Donnell's behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell heard words of encouragement from fans, including one
who said, ``Good luck wherever you play next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the ropes that restrained the crowds, Al Testaverde
was happy for his son. But he didn't want to get too close to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to the games, on advice of my doctor,'' he said.
``I've got a bad heart. I get too excited. I'm very selfish. I wish
he would retire so I could sleep better.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde sleeps fine, and he doesn't even worry about
money any more. He turned down $1 million more from Cincinnati for
the opportunity to play for the Jets, who he claims could make it
to the Super Bowl. The main attraction to New York, he said, wasn't
coming home as much as finding what he described as ``a Super Bowl
contender.''

   SHANGHAI, China _ Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as Communist Party
chief at the time of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989, has
challenged the nation's leaders to admit that the incident was not
only reprehensible, but also an immense political blunder.

his new job in March, Zhu was asked about the Tiananmen incident.
He appeared to offer the party line in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, every major meeting of our party and
government has drawn a correct conclusion regarding that matter,
and that conclusion can not be changed,'' Zhu said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet careful listeners noticed that, inadvertently or not, Zhu's
comment revealed that at ``every major meeting,'' the Tiananmen
incident had to reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, only if an issue is raised will it be
reaffirmed,'' said Bao. ``That means there are different views.
Otherwise there would be no need to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zhao's letter, he uses the issue of China-U.S. relations to
call for a reappraisal of the June 4 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's visit to China marks a turn for the better
in Sino-U.S. relations,'' Zhao wrote. ``But the United States and
the whole of the West have again and again raised the issue of June
4 and the issue of human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than let it become an obstacle to international
relations, it would be better to resolve the issue of June 4
ourselves, voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the Tiananmen crackdown ``one of the biggest human
rights issues in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao, speaking in a telephone interview from his home in Beijing
late Wednesday night, said, ``I have not seen the letter, but it
sounds like it would be in line with Zhao's thinking.''
 &UR; STORY MAY TRIM HERE &QL; 
 &LR;  Bao is a telling case of political persecution himself. As Zhao's
chief aide and secretary to the Politburo, Bao was one of the most
powerful people in China's leadership before his boss fell from
favor and he was suddenly taken into custody on May 28, 1989, just
days before the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bao was found guilty of subversion for leaking information about
internal party debates in the days leading up to the crackdown,
apparently in a desperate attempt to stop it and save his boss'
career, and his own.
</P>
<P>
   By an odd quirk of China's legal system, Bao recovered his
rights to speak freely on May 28, nine years to the day after his
detention. After granting a few interviews to international
reporters, Bao was again silenced by public security officers who
warned him that in the sensitve days before the June 4 anniversary
this year, keeping quiet would be ``healthy and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know exactly what they meant by that,'' Bao
said, chuckling. ``But today I am speaking to you because I feel
strongly that Chinese people should show President Clinton during
his visit that we have respect for a constitution that guarantees
freedom of speech.''

THAT'S E! FOR ENTERTAINMENT _ AND EROTICA?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WARREN BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be disgraced or disrobed to get a starring
role on E! Entertainment Television. But lately it does seem to
help.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, E! has been steadily churning out sordid tales
of young Hollywood stars _ Christian Slater, Charlie Sheen, Robert
Downey Jr. et al. _ plagued by sex scandals, drug addiction and
other misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, E! has begun recycling old tales of Hollywood
murder, mayhem and sexual deviance as part of its new ``Mysteries
and Scandals'' series.
</P>
<P>
   But a channel can't live by mug shots alone. For more uplifting
fare, E! has taken to presenting specials like ``Women of the
Net,'' profiling pornographic-film actresses who've set up their
own X-rated Web sites, and presenting ``Playmates of the '90s,''
which probably requires no plot explication.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way for a basic cable channel _ one partly owned by
the Walt Disney Co., incidentally _ to carry on? How did the
channel stray from its mission to cover the entertainment industry
better than anyone else? Has someone let Jerry Springer sneak into
the programming booth?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the latter question is no (though Springer is a
formidable presence on E!, which runs many clips of his show and
recently produced a curiously positive behind-the-scenes special
about it).
</P>
<P>
   E!'s actual program director, Fran Shea, a senior vice
president, maintains that the channel _ heretofore known for
showing movie trailers, fawning celebrity interviews, exhaustive
movie-award-show coverage and the quirky roundup of talk show
highlights (or lowlights) called ``Talk Soup'' _ is simply
broadening its definition of entertainment and giving viewers what
E!'s focus groups say they crave. That seems to be either scandal
or skin, with a thin layer of fashion in between.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the channel has escaped the kind of criticism recently
leveled at Springer's syndicated talk show and Comedy Central's
``South Park,'' which have been accused of being lurid or coarse.
(The relative silence regarding E!'s racy shows raises questions
that are perhaps more troubling for the channel: Is anybody
watching? Does anyone care?).
</P>
<P>
   Still, a perusal of E!'s evening fare over the last couple of
weeks suggests that there is now not just a show but an entire
channel dedicated to pushing the boundaries of good taste.
Watchdogs of television decency (and the rest of us voyeurs) may
want to take note.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of E!'s new programming strategy seems to be the
newly expanded ``E! True Hollywood Story,'' a series best described
as ``Biography'' meets The National Enquirer. With a portentous
voice-over, it chronicles the rise and fall of stars who, in some
cases, hardly ever rose to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   (One recent episode told the life story _ including a battle
against drug addiction _ of the obscure and irritating teen-age
actor Corey Feldman, whose past films include ``Stepmonster'' and
``Meatballs 4''). Presumably because there aren't enough
scandalized current stars available, the channel has begun
searching decades into the past for old scandals that can be
presented anew.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, on E!'s ``Mysteries and Scandals,'' the 1940s murder
of the woman known as the Black Dahlia was recounted one more time,
with repeated flashings of old photographs of the Dahlia's severed
nude torso, along with some cheesy ``re-enactment'' footage
involving what looked like a department-store mannequin sawed into
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   It gets uglier. Earlier this month, a gaunt-looking Charlie
Sheen was caught in E!'s harsh spotlight. For some reason, Sheen
agreed to participate in a documentary that was essentially about
his own demise; he squeezed in a studio interview between a recent
court appearance and a more recent trip to a hospital emergency
room.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to discuss his spate of personal problems, Sheen only
made things worse. He explained, in a bit too much detail, the
reasons he enjoyed the company of prostitutes. And he complained
about the press because, as Sheen blurted, ``They take the fun
stuff _ the drugs, the whores _ and boom, it's, like, headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen may not have been particularly impressive in his E!
appearance, but at least he was fully clothed. That is more than
can be said for the stars of recent E! original-programming
specials like ``Playmates of the '90s,'' ``Sex on the Riviera,''
``Secrets of Victoria's Secret'' and ``The Girls of Hawaiian
Tropic.''
</P>
<P>
   These one-hour shows, complete with innuendo-drenched narration,
travel to various locales (the South of France, Hugh Hefner's
mansion, the X-rated corners of the Internet, assorted dressing
rooms) to examine the hopes, the dreams and primarily the anatomies
of topless sunbathers, beauty pageant contestants, adult movie
stars, cheerleaders and lingerie models.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   E!'s cheesecake specials may be the closest thing to soft-core
pornography on basic cable. However, unlike Showtime, the Playboy
Channel and other premium channels, E! technically abides by
certain basic-cable practices; for example, it does not show
nudity. But by employing state-of-the-art film technique in which
blurred-image patches are placed in just the right spots, E! is
able to achieve an effect that could be described as 98 percent
nude.
</P>
<P>
   The naughty bits may be covered up, but the promotional plugs
can be painfully obvious on some of these shows. ``The Girls of
Hawaiian Tropic,'' ostensibly a beauty pageant, also serves as an
hourlong promotion for a suntan oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The channel has produced a couple of shows involving the
Victoria's Secret lingerie company, and in each case the scenes of
underwear models are interspersed with self-serving comments by
marketing and publicity executives from the company (which also
happens to be an E! advertiser).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps worst of all is ``Playmates of the '90s'' (a special so
nice they made it five times, one for each decade since the '50s),
which comes off like a Hefner training film for future centerfolds.
The special is full of boosterism by Hefner and his models, one of
whom points out that posing in the magazine ``has helped launch a
lot of careers, and it's definitely a vehicle to get to where you
want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shea defends the channel's more risque shows, saying they
are ``in the same category as what the nightly news does during
sweeps where there's always a bikini story and a supermodel.'' The
sexy shows, she says, are ``a small piece of what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Women of the Net' is not necessarily all sex-oriented,'' she
added. ``What we're doing is just covering women who are on the
Net, and there's been a lot of interest in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving just as E! was being reintroduced in 1990 (the channel
had earlier been known as Movietime and showed mostly film
trailers), Ms. Shea presided over the channel's early forays into
original production, which included the introduction of ``E! News
Daily,'' a half-hour news program that continues to provide some of
the most in-depth coverage of Hollywood found on television.
</P>
<P>
   The channel also scored its first breakout hit with ``Talk
Soup,'' the series that mixes video clips from talk shows with wry
commentary from the host (originally Greg Kinnear, now John
Henson). E! has drawn solid ratings with its exhaustive coverage of
movie-awards shows, including exclusive live coverage of the Cannes
Film Festival, as well as offbeat features like Joan Rivers'
acerbic critique of the clothing worn by stars at the Academy
Awards. And the channel still shows trailers in its weekly ``Coming
Attractions'' show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the channel has tried to expand its niche beyond Hollywood
coverage. Beginning a few years ago, it began to develop a slate of
fashion series like ``Fashion Emergency'' and ``Model.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stern's often crude and sexually explicit late-night talk
show, which made its debut in 1994, quickly became E!'s
highest-rated series and may have provided the impetus for the
channel's subsequent movement toward more sensational and
occasionally lurid programming. (Although Stern will soon have a
weekly series on CBS, he will continue to do his daily show on E!.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the formula seems to be working. Ms. Shea notes
that ``The E! True Hollywood Story'' is doing particularly well in
the ratings, as are most of the sexy specials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following what the audience is interested in,'' she
said, ``and we're expanding the genre of entertainment
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is always the possibility that the channel's
increasingly provocative programming will eventually catch the eye,
and raise the ire, of media watchdogs or perhaps worried Disney
executives. And if that happens, the channel may find itself in a
similar position to some of its ``True Story'' subjects: red-faced
and in need of detoxification.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL PATIENTS` RIGHTS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

(ps) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans unveiled a long-awaited proposal
on Wednesday to define patients' rights and set uniform nationwide
standards for health insurance, especially health maintenance
organizations. The insurance industry immediately denounced the
proposal, saying it would increase costs for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the House Republicans, who have been working behind closed
doors for four months on legislation to address voters' anger at
the constraints of managed health care, found themselves in the
same position as President Clinton four years ago: in the
cross-hairs of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican proposals would guarantee coverage of
emergency medical care, assure open communication between doctors
and patients, and allow women in an HMO to go directly to
obstetricians and gynecologists, without getting prior approval.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in the Senate and House said the House
Republican plan did not do nearly enough to protect consumers, but
the reaction from the White House was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to President Clinton, said, ``The
House Republican proposal is a pleasant surprise coming from the
very people who said just six months ago that we'd get a patients'
bill of rights over their dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ``We are pleased
that the Republican leadership has recognized the need for federal
action,'' though she added that Democratic bills were superior.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure whether any of the proposals will become
law. But there is plenty of common ground if members of the two
parties want to strike a compromise. More and more Republicans say
they want to be able to respond in some way to the concerns of
voters, and to the daily attacks by Democrats on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert, R.-Ill., chairman of the 15-member group
that drafted the House Republican proposal, said, ``It was pretty
evident in listening to our constituents collectively that there
was concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, interest in legislation to regulate HMOs has been
bubbling for months in both parties. But conservatives like Sen.
Don Nickles, R.-Okla., the party's assistant leader, express grave
doubts about new federal requirements of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican plan would also enable consumers to
challenge the denial of medical services by filing appeals with an
an independent panel of medical experts. Patients could not
necessarily sue an HMO for damages, but they could get quick
assistance from the courts _ much more than is now available _ if
an HMO or an insurance company improperly denied benefits that had
been promised to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans would have to pay a monetary penalty for each day
they refused to pay a claim or provide a service to which consumers
were entitled under the terms of their insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and lawmakers of both parties are clamoring for
federal standards to protect patients. But Bill Gradison, a former
Republican congressman who is president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said on Wednesday, ``The public would be
better served by no congressional action.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradison described the House Republican proposals as ``a
mishmash of cobbled-together ideas that are guaranteed to raise
consumers' costs, reduce choice and generate more federal
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising statement, Gradison said ``we are equally
opposed'' to the three major patient-protection bills: the House
Republican measure; a Democratic bill written by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, and a
bipartisan measure drafted by Rep. Charlie Norwood, a Republican
from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood endorsed Hastert's bill, saying he had gotten 75 percent
of what he sought. Norwood, like many Democrats, wanted to do more
to let consumers sue HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents HMOs, offered a more nuanced assessment
than Gradison. She said the House Republican plan ``moves in a
better direction than what has been discussed thus far on Capitol
Hill'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While less onerous than the Kennedy-Dingell proposal or the
Norwood bill, this proposal still tilts toward a reliance on
government mandates,'' she said of the House Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gradison said that the insurance industry was not planning
anything like the $15 million ``Harry and Louise'' television
advertisements that helped kill Clinton's plan to guarantee
coverage for all Americans in 1994. But Gradison said, ``I would
not accept the idea that there will be legislation enacted this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical Association,
said, ``The Hastert task force represents a step in the right
direction, but it does not go far enough'' in making HMOs
accountable for the clinical decisions they make.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care in Santa
Monica, Calif., said patients would not be fully protected until
they could sue HMOs and recover damages for injuries caused by the
denial of medically necessary care. Another consumer advocate,
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said the
Republican proposal was ``an election-year stunt, a ploy to enable
some members of Congress to claim they did something on managed
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, the chief deputy whip for House Republicans, said he
was not worried by such negative reaction. ``We tried not to pander
to any one group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans provided a detailed description of their
proposals on Wednesday and said they would introduce a bill soon
after the Fourth of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   HMO lobbyists, while not thrilled with the prospect of federal
regulation, are pragmatic. They said they were willing to negotiate
with Congress, to fend off what they see as the most onerous
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican initiative includes these elements:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs and other health plans would have to pay for emergency
care in any situation that a ``prudent lay person'' would regard as
an emergency. Democrats agree on this.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs could not interfere with doctors' ability to tell
patients about any treatment option, regardless of whether the
health plan offers or pays for such services. Democrats support
this idea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents could choose pediatricians, rather than family
doctors, to coordinate care for children in an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers could, for an extra premium, buy coverage allowing
them to use doctors outside the network of physicians formed by an
HMO. Democrats say they too want to expand choices for consumers,
but would do it differently.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are also proposing several devices to expand
the number of people with health insurance. Under one proposal,
small businesses and self-employed people could band together and
buy insurance through trade associations and professional
organizations. Another proposal would create regional supermarkets,
or ``health marts,'' where families could shop for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   State officials generally oppose such purchasing pools because
the new arrangements would be exempt from many state laws and
regulations, including requirement to cover of specific conditions
like maternity care or cancer screenings. Moreover, Glenn Pomeroy
of North Dakota, president of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, said the health marts could recruit healthy people
and avoid sick people by operating in certain geographic areas or
by refusing to cover services needed by people with costly
illnesses like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they could not accept a
House Republican proposal to set a $250,000 limit on damages for
pain and suffering in medical malpractice lawsuits. The House has
passed several bills to set such limits, but the Senate has
repeatedly refused to go along.

CHINA'S MAIN GOAL: RECOGNITION AS A MAJOR PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China would love President Clinton to announce here
this week that Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province,
will get no more U.S. weapons, that China's application to join the
World Trade Organization is near approval and that the economic and
military sanctions the United States imposed after the 1989
crackdown on student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square will be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, as the Chinese leaders already know, China will get
few if any of the policy changes it wants during the state visit
that begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, China's leaders and people are ecstatic about the
visit, the first by an U.S. president in nine years and one that is
already being hailed in China as a great step forward in diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   This summit meeting is important to China for both symbolic and
practical reasons. Symbolic, because the Chinese clearly feel that,
by his very presence, Clinton, leader of the world's foremost
economic and military power, will confer new status on China as a
major international player.
</P>
<P>
   Practical, because China's leaders are convinced that friendly
ties with the United States are crucial to their ambitious goal of
creating a more market-oriented and prosperous economy.
</P>
<P>
   What China seeks most right now, one senses here, is not so much
the things that get discussed at meetings, like trade or security
or even a cave-in on Taiwan. It is, in a word, respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese wear their country's painful history on their
sleeves and invariably bring it up in discussions of foreign
policy. After the humiliating foreign incursions of the 19th and
early 20th century, decades of terrible civil war and then the
destructive chaos of Mao's political campaigns, culminating in the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, China feels it is finally on its feet.
Its economy has surged, its leadership is stable and China is more
than ready to take what it believes to be its rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit means that China finally has been noticed by the
world,'' said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College in
Beijing. ``The American administration is recognizing the
importance of China.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the first visit by a U.S. president since 1989, and
the leaders here hope that it will mark, if not an end to world
disapproval of that year's massacre of hundreds of civilians around
Tiananmen Square, at least tacit agreement to push the lingering
ghosts to the side.
</P>
<P>
   For Chinese President Jiang Zemin personally, to again stand
beside the U.S. president, following his touted tour of America
last year, may cement his stature as a statesman able to take up
where the late Deng Xiaoping left off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a more practical level, friendly ties with the United States
are seen as vital to Beijing's domestic aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramount goal of China is to modernize, and to do that we
need a durable, peaceful environment,'' said Yan Xuetong, a foreign
policy expert at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary
International Relations. ``If we get on bad terms with the United
States, we'll never get the right environment.''
</P>
<P>
   China has embarked on two major, precarious transitions, said
Jia Qingguo, a professor of international studies at Beijing
University: a shift in politics from personal, charismatic
leadership toward more bureaucratic and technocratic rule and a
shift in the economy from rigid socialism toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need stability to carry out these reforms,'' Jia said.
``And we need all the support we can get to help China through this
difficult period.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese scholars said that while the outside pressures and
criticisms that come with deeper contacts will be controversial
here, China badly needs more foreign trade, more foreign
investment, more advanced technologies as well as more cooperation
in developing energy sources, fighting air and water pollution and
other technical areas. For all these things, leaders here believe,
the United States is the primary source.
</P>
<P>
   China, though its military power is growing, wants to avoid
costly confrontations in Asia. It has an almost willful naivete
about the fear its rising military capability inspires among its
neighbors. China, despite its past support for Pakistan, is working
with the United States to contain a nuclear arms race in South Asia
and peacefully resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is also
wary of the recently affirmed Japanese-U.S. security alliance and
suggestions that even Japan could support the defense of Taiwan in
a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, as officials in Beijing never tire of saying, remains
the ``core issue'' in Chinese-U.S. relations. There seems little
doubt here that in the event of a serious step toward independence
by Taiwan, China would risk all its gains by resorting to military
force if necessary, possibly forcing America's hand in turn.
</P>
<P>
   But many Chinese foreign policy experts also recognize that
Clinton has little political space to maneuver on Taiwan. So long
as he strongly reiterates U.S. support for ``one China,'' the
Chinese leaders seem ready to let the matter ride for now, though
they maintain the right to use force and harshly criticize U.S.
sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan. They also know that closer
Chinese-U.S. ties implicitly pressure Taiwan to tread carefully in
any moves toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The post-1989 sanctions barring U.S. government export loans and
restricting exports of arms and certain high-technology items, such
as satellites and advanced computers, definitely rankle Chinese
pride and they also impede the high-priority quest for superior
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent comments by Chinese officials on the sanctions
have sounded more resigned than angry.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation,
Shi Guangsheng, was asked whether a case-by-case rather than
general easing of sanctions would do. ``China welcomes any action
that will result in the relaxation of export restrictions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance into the World Trade Organization, in which all the
Western countries and Japan as well as many developing countries
set trade rules, has been a prime political and economic goal. .
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Chinese leaders have swallowed their pRide as U.S.
negotiators declared that the country is far from satisfying
requirements for access to China's markets. Monday, Shi, instead of
lashing out, noted that ``we don't have any timetable,'' and
expressed the hope of further progress this week.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Clinton visit, and more generally ties with the
United States, have been invested with so much meaning here, some
Chinese who know both countries well fear that dangerously
unrealistic expectations are being created, with the potential to
create a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Chinese specialist in American affairs, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, worried that China underestimates the force
and staying power of issues like human rights or the concerns in
Washington about transfer of sensitive technologies and possible
illegal political donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disastrous misperception of the United States is that
Americans are purely pragmatic, practical people who only care for
money, and don't have strong inner political and spiritual
values,'' the scholar said.
</P>
<P>
   If the two countries can weave mutually advantageous strategic
and economic ties, the scholar said many Chinese mistakenly think,
then irritating U.S. concerns like human rights or the status of
Tibet will recede.
</P>
<P>
   Suisheng Zhao, a Chinese-born political expert at Colby College
in Maine, who recently visited Beijing, expressed concern that the
Chinese are reading too much into the U.S. relationship _ some
businessmen even predict it will boost China's stock market _ and
will be in for a rude surprise once things turn sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of this summit is very different on the two sides
of the Pacific,'' Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
   But Xiong, the dean of the Foreign Affairs College, felt a more
realistic view was spreading _ that more Chinese realize that
relations between major powers will have ups and downs, that
countries are not all friend or enemy. ``We know it won't always go
smoothly,'' he said.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, June 28,

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AIX-OPERA-FESTIVAL (Aix-En-Provence, France) _ Amid Europe's
ever more crowded calendar of summer musical happenings, the slow
demise of the opera festival in this bucolic southern French city
went largely unnoticed. In its heyday, in the 1950s and 60s, when
it reintroduced Mozart to France, le tout Paris would flock here
every July. But in recent years, even for dedicated opera lovers,
Aix was increasingly overshadowed by Salzburg, Bayreuth,
Glyndebourne and other festivals more offbeat, glitzy or
crowd-pleasing. By Alan Riding. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KAUFFMANN-FILM-CRITIC (Undated) _ Sixteen years into his
marathon run as the film critic for The New Republic, Stanley
Kauffmann sat down in 1974 to write an essay to answer the two
questions he was most often asked: How many films do you see in a
week? And don't you get bored? Zero to 12 and no, Kauffmann
answered in that essay, ``Why I'm Not Bored.'' A film may be
boring, but the idea of going never is. Boredom is incompatible
with hope, Kauffmann wrote, and hope is more of a constant in film
than in virtually any other art in America. By Janny Scott.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PETER-BROOK-THEATER (Aix-En-Provence, France) _ Peter Brook was
explaining over lunch that no one should ever be held to opinions
voiced in the past, which seemed fine as, well, a fresh opinion.
Yet it was not quite enough to explain why, having turned his back
on mainstream opera, the legendary theater director was now to be
found rehearsing a new production of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' that
will open next month's international opera festival in
Aix-en-Provence. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SILVER-PLAYWRIGHT (Undated) _ In this essay, the playwright
Nicky Silver, author of ``Raised in Captivity,'' ``The Food Chain''
and ``The Maiden's Prayer,'' among others, talks about Thornton
Wilder's effect on his own writing. By Nicky Silver. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   X-FILES-FILM (Undated) _ The ``X-Files'' film has brought us two
things that the television show had not: the Barbie-as-Scully and
Ken-as-Mulder collectible dolls, each with its own little FBI
badge. Merchandising has nothing to do with the film's many
convoluted plots, but money has everything to do with what happened
to ``The X-Files'' in its leap from television to the movies. By
Caryn James. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GONE-WITH-THE-WIND (Undated) _ ``Gone With the Wind'' is still
generally accepted as the most widely seen motion picture ever to
come out of Hollywood. When its estimated income is adjusted to
reflect the increase in ticket prices over 59 years, it is still
one of the biggest-grossing movies in history, topped only by a
handful of others, including the newest champion of champions,
``Titanic.'' By Vincent Canby. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL-SWEDISH-BALLET (Undated) _ The Royal Swedish Ballet,
celebrating its founding in 1773, held a highly successful 225th
anniversary festival this month. This showcase of performances in
Stockholm, was enhanced by an international lecture series. By Anna
Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PILOBOLUS-DANCE (Undated) _ The Pilobolus Dance Theater holds an
open audition. A look at the process to find new dancers. By Terry
Teachout. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA-BROWN-OPERA (Brussels, Belgium) _ Trisha Brown, at age
61, is an internationally renowned choreographer, acclaimed for the
subtle and complex style of dance that she has developed with her
eponymous company. From experimental beginnings in the 60s, she has
moved toward the status of an institution: she has performed in
famous opera houses, danced with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Bill T.
Jones, received prestigious awards, and last year celebrated the
Trisha Brown Company's 25th anniversary with a three-program season
that drew from her substantial repertory. Yet Ms. Brown recently
put herself in the position of a novice once again by seeking out
and accepting the chance to direct an opera, ``Orfeo,'' a role that
had her working for the first time with singers and musicians as
well as her own dancers. By Roslyn Sulcas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TANGLEWOOD-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ The Tanglewood Music Center in
Lenox, Mass., the most prestigious summer training institute for
young musicians in the United States, has just begun its 49th
season, and much attention will be focused on Seiji Ozawa, who, as
music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, oversees artistic
matters at the center. Over the last two summers, Ozawa fomented a
shakeup, which provoked angry, noisy resignations from respected
leaders of the center: the pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher, who
had been artistic director for 12 years, and the pianist Gilbert
Kalish, who had served on the faculty for nearly 30 years, the last
12 as chairman. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-CONCERT-MUSIC (Undated) _ A venerable article of faith
holds that American concert music ``came of age'' after World War
I. Previous American composers, we are told, were second-rate
clones of German teachers. Virgil Thomson called the music of
George Chadwick, Edward MacDowell, John Knowles Paine, Amy Beach
and other prominent turn-of-the-century Americans ``a pale copy''
of ``Continental models'' and reckoned their scale of achievement
``a sort of adolescence.'' By Joseph Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   OPERAS-80s (Undated) _ The scarcity of good new operas in the
present decade _ unless something remarkable happens more than once
during the next year and a half _ makes all the more striking how
much was achieved in the 80s. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRANDY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The appeal of ``Never Say Never,'' the
second album by the teen-age rhythm-and-blues singer Brandy, lies
not in her inventing anything new but in her delivering familiar
pleasures with all the accessories. And she can really sing. For a
performer who just turned 19, Brandy seems to have a grown-up
control freak's attention to detail, and it has served her career
well. By Dimitri Ehrlich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM-CONGDON-ART (Milan, Italy) _ Taking the measure of
William Congdon, who died April 15 on his 86th birthday, proves
tricky. As a painter associated with the New York School, the
cluster of Abstract Expressionists who shook up the art world in
the late 1940s and 50s, Congdon distinguished himself with his
spirited cityscapes of New York and Venice, often rendered in thick
strokes of black and gold. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PATRICK-HERON-ART (London) _ Patrick Heron, 78, the British
painter and art critic whose retrospective exhibition opened at the
Tate Gallery on Thursday, is accomplished in many things, but
following orders is not among them. A pacifist and conscientious
objector during World War II and a crusader for environmental
causes in Cornwall, where he has lived and worked for most of his
life, Heron has rarely taken pointers about his art from anyone, no
matter how influential. By Martin Filler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-ART-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ For some, the ``culture
wars'' between liberals and conservatives have been at best a
sideshow. The main event (it's been going on since the Renaissance)
has been the struggle between artists and politicians. Artists
understand that creativity invites destruction. Politicians prefer
to snack on sweetness and light. Victoria Newhouse's new book,
``Toward the New Museum'' (The Monacelli Press), offers a shrewd,
biting account of one of the most conspicuous fields in which this
struggle has been joined in recent decades: the architecture of art
museums. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AMERICAN-DREAM (Undated) _ The American dream is about rise
and fall and evolution,'' Anthony Geffen said from his London
office. ``It's true that as an outsider you tend to assume there's
a lack of meritocracy in America. But after a while, you realize
that there is a kind of hierarchy that evolves, based not on your
family but more on money _ and the power it wields.'' In ``American
Stories: The American Dream,'' he traces this evolution through 3
generations of 10 families in their quest for betterment. By
Kathryn Shattuck. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-E!-ENTERTAINMENT (Undated) _ You don't have to be disgraced
or disrobed to get a starring role on E! Entertainment Television.
But lately it does seem to help. In recent weeks, E! has been
steadily churning out sordid tales of young Hollywood stars _
Christian Slater, Charlie Sheen, Robert Downey Jr. et al. _ plagued
by sex scandals, drug addiction and other misfortunes. By Warren
Berger. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-BOOKS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ In addition to providing
intellectual and visual pleasure, art exhibitions can engage the
imagination the way adventures do. ``Verdant Riches Revealed: A
Selection From the Treasures of the LuEsther T. Mertz Library at
the New York Botanical Garden,'' offers a case in point. On the
surface, the 80 illustrated books, neatly arranged in showcases at
the Grolier Club in Manhattan, are a fine collection, featuring
botanical prints and early garden designs. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CIVIL-RIGHTS (Undated) _ Museums of a movement. By Kevin
Sack. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SENECA-FALLS (Seneca Falls, N.Y.) _ In this park, the
views span generations. By Amy Waldman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PHILADELPHIA (Undated) _ For the Liberty Bell, a move
with a view. By Michael Janofsky. (Moved).

   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Walking tours run out fast. By
Betsy Wade. (Moved).

GOING OUT WITH A BANG: FOUNDATION GIVING AWAY $30 MILLION BEFORE
DISBANDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A foundation set up by two brothers four decades ago
will go out of business in a blaze of glory by giving away $30
million to six New York City institutions, including the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Central Park Conservancy and the
New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Uris Brothers Foundation will announce the gifts Thursday. The
Metropolitan and the Central Park Conservancy will each receive $10
million, and the Public Library $3 million. The foundation will
also give $3 million to Thirteen-WNET, $2.5 million to Carnegie
Hall and $1.5 million to the New School for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is believed to be one of the largest to support the
operations of institutions in New York City. The $30 million total
exceeds the $18 million given earlier this year to Baruch College
of the City University of New York by Lawrence and Carol Zicklin,
the $25 million given last year to the Columbia University School
of Engineering and Applied Science by the Fu Foundation, and the
$20 million in 1990 from the estate of actress Paulette Goddard to
endow professorships at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In size, it's a significant event,'' said Barbara Bryan,
president of the New York Regional Association of Grantmakers, a
nonprofit consortium in Manhattan. ``That's a lot of money for a
small foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the Uris Brothers Foundation has given away
more than $35 million to recipients in the New York metropolitan
area. It was created in 1957 by two real estate developers, Percy
and Harold Uris.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million given to the Metropolitan is the largest the
museum has ever received exclusively for educational programs,
``and will strengthen dramatically the museum's outreach to the
young people of this region, and their families,'' said Philippe de
Montebello, the museum's director.
</P>
<P>
   The grant will enable the Met to spend about $550,000 a year to
finance three major new efforts to bring visual arts programs and
activities to 25,000 children each year. They include family
workshops, the distribution of written museum guides and online
information for families on the museum's Web site,
www.Metmuseum.org.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deaths of the two brothers, Harold Uris' three
daughters have managed the foundation. They are Susan Halpern,
president, and Jane Bayard and Dr. Linda Sanger, vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a low visibility foundation that doesn't seek to
publicize its grants,'' said Ms. Bryan of the grantmakers
association. ``The foundation has a history of doing things that
need to be done, not necessarily with their name attached.''
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million is the foundation's final gift before it
disbands. ``We're going public now because we want this final gift
to be a celebration of the Uris brothers,'' said Ms. Halpern.
</P>
<P>
   The large grants come as institutions are finding it more
difficult to raise money for mundane needs, from security to worthy
but unglamorous educational programs. In its focus on such
operations, the Uris grant is unusual ``in that it is doing the
gritty things that other givers might not be interested in,'' Ms.
Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The three Uris daughters said they would continue charitable
giving by starting foundations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million gift to the Central Park Conservatory will
create an endowment for the maintenance of the 1.58-mile running
track at the reservoir, which is being renovated through a $500,000
gift from another donor. The Uris grant will also pay for
renovation and preservation of the landscapes surrounding the
reservoir, as well as provide funding for outreach programs at the
Central Park Visitor Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth of the gift's impact will reach all park users,''
said Karen Putnam, president of the conservancy, ``from weekend
strollers out to enjoy the park's esthetic beauty, to the
schoolchildren learning about the park's wildlife habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million gift to the New York Public Library will create
an endowment to purchase about 12,000 children's books a year for
85 library branches in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   At Thirteen/WNET, the $3 million gift will provide educational
materials and videos and finance programs that train day care
workers and parents to make better use of the television station's
programming for preschool children.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 million gift to Carnegie Hall will support the New
Theater project, which will add educational programs and performing
space to the hall.
</P>
<P>
   At the New School, the $1.5 million grant will create an endowed
professorship in urban policy and management at the Milano Graduate
School of Management and Urban Policy. The chair will be named in
honor of Henry Cohen, who founded the school and served as its dean
for 15 years.

Paraguay extends ride 
with win over Nigeria
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAINT-ETIENNE, France _ The Bulldog growled and snarled and barked.
</P>
<P>
   He raged from sideline to sideline. He practically frothed at
the mouth at the incredible opportunity facing his small,
overshadowed and economically torn nation.
</P>
<P>
   He was kicked and pushed. He jumped and dived at all angles. He
wagged his tongue and his arms wildly, sometimes to get the crowd
going, sometimes to get his teammates rolling.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, the
mad bulldog of a personality, clamped his jaws around this World
Cup tournament with authority.
</P>
<P>
   After another stunning effort by Chilavert in a 3-1 win over
explosive Nigeria on Wednesday, the only question is, How far can
Chilavert and inspired Paraguay take this wild world ride?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a sensational time of it,'' Paraguay coach Paolo
Carpeggiani said. ``This is a great party we didn't fully expect.
We worked for it and dreamed of it, but we didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Paraguay can celebrate its team's berth in the second round
of the World Cup and a date Sunday against France in Lens. But what
Paraguay's berth means for Spain is a quick exit for one of the
tournament favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Spain whipped Bulgaria 6-1 in what proved to be a meaningless
match in Lens, while Paraguay and Nigeria battled in Toulouse.
Earlier, France beat Denmark 2-1, setting up Sunday's game against
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, most experts will favor France in the elimination game.
But then, most believed Paraguay would get an early ticket home out
of Group D _ the so-called ``Group of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. And the spectacular Chilavert was the biggest reason,
shutting out Spain and Bulgaria and turning back numerous
point-blank shots by Nigeria in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this game very much,'' Chilavert said. ``We wanted
it for Paraguay.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Chilavert is the player of the tournament thus far and
Paraguay is the most surprising team.
</P>
<P>
   The win also came thanks to a suddenly wide-open offense
stepping up the attack and getting several shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, which won its first two games, had clinched the top
spot in the group before Wednesday's games. But the Super Eagles
conceded nothing in the entertaining match with Paraguay, trying
all night to beat Chilavert but converting only once.
</P>
<P>
   Chilavert turned aside four scoring chances by Nigeria in the
first half, when the game was tied at 1 after an early header by
Paraguay's Celso Ayala and Wilson Oruma's 11th-minute equalizer
Chilavert barely missed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest plays offensively for Paraguay came midway through
the second half, when it pressed the ball forward and finally
converted on a booming, curving 25-yard kick by Miguel Benitez in
the 59th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was one of the more spectacular of the tournament, with
Benitez freeing himself from Nigerian stopper Taribo West,
spinning, then firing a rocket past keeper Peter Rufai.
</P>
<P>
   The terrific shot typified play on this hot, humid night, when
the Nigerians turned on the offense with slick moves and lightning
runs and Paraguay answered with its most wide-open effort in the
must-win game.
</P>
<P>
   There were bicycle kicks, 40-yard crossing passes, quick shots
from all angles and the ever-present Chilavert even roaming out of
the box to start attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed that we can be dynamic and have speed in the
attack,'' Carpeggiani said. ``We were outstanding with our
forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay sealed the game and set the celebration in motion for
its fans when defender Jose Cordoza came up with his team's third
goal on a low shot that beat a diving Rufai inside the far post.
</P>
<P>
   At the final whistle, the Paraguayans' jubilation was clear,
many players dropping to their knees, some screaming and hugging,
others crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day for Paraguay,'' Carpeggiani said. ``Now, we
have to face the French. We're going to need this same kind of
game, or a better one. You never know.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time, during the worst of the AIDS
epidemic, when Gary Miller, a founder of the New York City Gay
Men's Chorus, would begin rehearsals by asking if anyone needed a
stool to get through. This was at Carnegie Hall. There were a lot
of musicians' stools there, and still there were never enough for
everyone who was sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choir was divided into four sections,'' Miller says.
``From where I was standing, as conductor, half of the bass section
was decimated. There was a weekend I'll never forget. We did three
memorial services in two days. Two Saturday, one Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   It's morning in the dark, walnut-paneled living room of Miller's
small apartment on the Upper West Side. There are leaded-glass
windows, a fireplace, a dozen pink roses on the little Wurlitzer
piano. The roses are tribute: Monday evening was Miller's farewell
concert in New York. He will resign as music director after a
European tour. It's time for a change, he says. There are floral
gifts all around the room. Miller, who is 51 and wears a wedding
band, talks about death.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we lost someone, at the next rehearsal we would always
sing a song for that person,'' Miller says. ``Sometimes it would be
a song that was special to the person, a lot of the time it was a
song called `Love Lives On.'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller plays a recording of the song. ``The truth of love will
never die, our spirits will shine strong long after we're gone, and
so our love lives on. ''
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 years Miller has worked with the Gay Men's Chorus, 90
members have died. Miller himself is HIV positive. Hearing the
song, he gets up from the sofa, fusses with papers at the back of
the room and cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece, believe it or not, is from an awful movie, `Harry
and the Hendersons,''' he says. ``It came out in '87. But clearly
the lyrics touched us. The person who brought this song to me was
the arranger, Mark Riese, a dear, dear friend of mine and a member
of the chorus. This was the last piece he arranged for us before he
died of AIDS in 1989. As you can observe, this has been a very
emotional week.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how it started for Miller: growing up in York, Pa., ;
fighting with his father, a maintenance machinist, who couldn't
understand a son who loved music and had no interest in sports;
dating a girl he planned to marry in college at the same time he
was sleeping with a boyfriend; unaware there could ever be a
community of men like himself. Miller received a bachelor's degree
in music education from Lebanon Valley College and a master's
degree in choral conducting from the University of Michigan, moved
to New York and taught in public school.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Miller discovered the fledgling New York City Gay Men's
Choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen of the chattiest young men,'' Miller says, laughing.
``But so welcoming, so funny. We sang, `Standing on the Corner' _
our version, `watching all the boys go by' _ and `Stouthearted Men'
_ all that glorious trash. Three weeks after I started, the poor
man who tried to lead us threw in the towel. He was a very serious
young man _ this will sound like I'm not _ and as I was the only
one who knew how to wave my arms around in front of this group,
they promoted me. ''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1980, the group merged with the Big Apple Gay Men's
Chorus
</P>
<P>
   Was there a political goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, a mission statement,'' Miller says. ``I used to be
able to quote it. As gay men we wanted to make music for the
education and enrichment of the community. It was to be equal parts
music, social and political.''
</P>
<P>
   One month before the group's first concert, a former transit
policeman opened fire on a gay club called the Ramrod in Greenwich
Village, killing two men. The chorus performed at a memorial
service, singing, ``He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother'' and ``We Kiss
in the Shadows.'' It was not difficult for Miller to relate to the
victims _ he had been beat up twice by men who called him a fag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ramrod galvanized us,'' Miller says. ``Not just as a
choral group, as a family. It was apparent we had a role in the
healing process that had not existed before. Two years later, with
AIDS, it was the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Working full time as an artist's manager and later as a music
teacher, Miller worked for the chorus for a salary he cheerfully
characterizes as ``a pittance.'' When the American Choral Directors
Association refused to mention the name of the group in their
program in the early '80s because they did not care to include the
word ``gay,'' Miller brought in the American Civil Liberties Union
and mounted a successful suit. He commissioned 40 pieces. Under his
direction, the New York City Gay Men's Chorus became the first gay
musical ensemble to receive a recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Miller teaches music at the Ethical Culture School and
lives with the man with whom he exchanged wedding rings, Daniel
Starr, the chief librarian at the Museum of Modern Art. There was
no marriage ceremony; the men exchanged rings as Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The changes Miller sees in the chorus since the bad times in the
'80s?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a baby boom,'' Miller says happily. ``There are a
number of fathers in our chorus. Two men just adopted their second
child.''

GM ACCUSES AUTO WORKERS OF STRIKING ILLEGALLY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ General Motors said Wednesday that two strikes in
Michigan that have crippled its car and truck production were
illegal, taking an unusually hard stance against its national union
over local walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in a statement that it would seek to take the
United Automobile Workers to expedited arbitration and wanted a
response from the union within 48 hours. The company also plans to
block payments of unemployment benefits to idled workers. GM tried
a similar tactic in a 1996 strike in Dayton, Ohio, but almost all
states granted unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not have to support a strike against ourselves,''
said Gerald Knechtel, vice president of GM in charge of personnel
for the company's North American operations. ``We will vigorously
pursue this action in all of the states in which we have affected
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's latest stance was communicated in a letter to
Richard Shoemaker, the union's point man in negotiations with GM,
and was disclosed as UAW leaders at a convention here continued to
forecast a long summer of heated labor battles with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said Wednesday that the letter accused union
negotiators of thwarting management efforts to settle the local
issues that set off strikes by 9,200 workers at two parts factories
in Flint, Mich., and also accused them of essentially waging a
national strike. The two strikes have idled more than 140,000 GM
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker dismissed the letter's accusations as ``theatrics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve and I met with Jack Smith and other GM executives. If
their charges were valid, that would have been the time to bring
them up, not while we're trying to have serious negotiations,'' he
said in an interview. ``Someday they're going to have to start
taking this strike seriously and begin to work toward a solution
instead of wasting time twisting perception.''
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has maintained that its members are on a strike because
of hundreds of health and safety grievances, including hazardous
leaking fluids and dangerous noise levels, issues that UAW locals
are allowed to strike over. But many striking workers have openly
focused their anger at a series of broken commitments concerning
investment at the plants. The two sides will have to meet with an
arbitrator before going before a judge. Shoemaker said he saw
little chance that the letter would end the work stoppage or deter
future strikes by union locals in Dayton, Indianapolis and at a
Flint car factory scheduled to be closed next year. A strike at the
brake factories in Dayton alone would cripple GM, just as one did
for 17 days in 1996. And all the local skirmishes could ignite an
even larger showdown during next year's national contract talks
with GM.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Knechtel of GM said, ``Our contention is that
the strikeable issues identified by the union are contrived and
that the real issues that led to these costly disputes are ones
that the unions have agreed to be nonstrikeable issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Buck, a Cleveland lawyer who represents the management of
many auto parts companies during labor disputes, said that GM could
seek a court injunction demanding that the union return to work or
even ask that the UAW cover GM's losses during the strike, which
analysts estimate at close to $1 billion. ``It's pressure General
Motors can bring to bear,'' he said. But federal laws limit when
courts can intervene in labor disputes, making it likely that GM's
latest action is aimed mainly at forcing a settlement with the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Brickner, professor emeritus of labor and industrial
relations at Michigan State University, views the legal fight as a
risky strategy for both sides. He said GM would have to explain why
it was challenging the Flint strikes as a national dispute while it
did not do so in more than a dozen similar local strikes over the
last three years. The union, meanwhile, would have to prove that
its fight is truly based on health and safety issues at the
striking plants.
</P>
<P>
   GM's latest action was largely overshadowed here Wednesday by
the re- election of Stephen P. Yokich to his second and final term
as president of the 61-year-old union. Yokich did not even comment
on the letter, though people close to him say it has intensified
the union's resolve not to capitulate to GM, which employs 220,000
of its 750,00 members.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the 62-year-old Yokich has more important issues to
deal with regarding the union's future. He wants to be known as the
president who expanded the union's power base outside the nation's
Big Three auto makers. The UAW has been under pressure for decades
to stem a precipitous decline in membership, which has dropped to
750,000 from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979, and to bring small
parts shops and foreign auto giants such as Honda, Toyota and
Nissan into the UAW fold.
</P>
<P>
   As for GM, Yokich has largely left the tedious negotiations to
Shoemaker, a savvy negotiator who has drafted some of the union's
most complex agreements. He said further labor strife with GM was
almost assured because the auto maker was in such a race to expand
its global presence that it was disregarding input from workers and
overlooking the long-term effects of breaking investment
commitments in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is a fact of life, and we recognize that General
Motors just like every other auto maker has to be a player in that
worldwide market,'' Shoemaker said. ``But that doesn't mean GM can
forget the agreements it's made here in America with local unions.
If we can't convince them to address these issues in a rational and
honest manner, then these kinds of confrontations will continue.''

SILVER CHARM'S FEVER SPOILS DREAM RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anticipated matchup between the nation's three best older
horses has been postponed yet again. Silver Charm, last year's
champion 3-year-old colt and the Kentucky Derby winner, Wednesday
morning was declared out of Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup
because he came down with a slight fever, according to his trainer,
Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's withdrawal prevents him from meeting Skip Away
and Gentlemen for the first time. Gentlemen and Skip Away have met
once previously _ when Gentlemen captured last year's Pimlico
Special _ but Hollywood Park management was hoping to be the first
to get all three in the same race.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Silver Charm had a temperature of 102 degrees _ two
degrees above normal for a horse _ Wednesday morning in his stall
at Santa Anita. The colt had worked out at Santa Anita on Tuesday
morning, just two days after returning from Kentucky, where he
raced 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got something there, so we can't afford to take a
chance,'' Baffert said. ``If I ran him, and he got pneumonia or
something like that, I couldn't live with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Baffert, he suspected something was amiss when
Silver Charm did not eat his entire morning meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually dives right into the bucket,'' Baffert said.
Referring to Rudy Silva, he added: ``His groom said he didn't even
go for the grain. He said he went right to the corner and just put
his head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert did not know when Silver Charm would be able to resume
training or race again.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in less than four months that a minor
setback has kept Silver Charm out of a major race. In March, he
bruised a foot on the eve of the Santa Anita Handicap and was
scratched. Three weeks later, however, he was flown halfway around
the world and won the $4 million Dubai World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In his only start since then, Silver Charm was upset as the
odds-on favorite in the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs
on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Entries for the Gold Cup will be taken Thursday morning. Skip
Away is scheduled to arrive at Hollywood Park Thursday after a
flight from New York. Gary Stevens, who had been scheduled to ride
Silver Charm, has regained the mount on Gentlemen. &QL;

&HT;        RESETTING CLOCKS IN THE NAME OF EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Anita Thakkar  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 24 -- Zzzzzz. That's the sound of students
snoring during their classes. And that sound is what prompted Rep.
Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, to introduce legislation Wednesday which
would change school schedules -- to accommodate the natural sleep
cycles of teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing a study in the newspaper that reported biological
clock changes in children during puberty, and noticing that she had
a hard time waking up her own kids before school every morning,
Lofgren came up with a plan to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know why the school day got earlier and earlier,''
Lofgren said. ``When as kids get older, they need more and more
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren said she was relieved to read the study results, and
said: ``Thank God my kids are not lazy!''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the ``Z's to A's Act'' aims to increase academic
performance and safety, and decrease after school crime.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would urge school districts to move up their starting
time to at least 9 a.m., allowing students to get adequate sleep at
night in order to be fully alert during their school day. The bill
would provide $25,000 federal grants to schools will be a big
incentive for the schools to change their hours to be in sync with
teenagers' body clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also supported by the National Sleep Foundation
(NSF), a nonprofit organization that supports sleep-related
education, research and advocacy to improve public health and
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren added that the bill would help working parents because
``when school starts later, it also ends later.'' Under her plan,
kids would still be in school between three and six p.m. -- the
time when the juvenile crime rate is at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   William Dement, a sleep researcher at Stanford University, said
that lack of sleep affects mood, ability to learn, and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation officially recognizes what parents and
teachers have known for years,'' Dement said. ``That students in
our nation's schools are walking zombies trying to cope with the
stresses of school, work and social activities that may literally
be putting their lives in peril.'' He also noted that the average
ten year-old needs ten hours of sleep each night. Contrary to
popular belief, however, the hours of sleep needed does not
decrease as kids get older. This creates a problem because most
teenagers don't get to bed by 9 p.m. every night.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren bill, however, lacks provisions for after-school
activities, such as sports, music and academic clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren said ``there's no magic'' to the after-school activities
problem. She said that activities like tennis matches and football
games should simply be played before school. But she added that
``there is nothing more important for students than to be
successful academically.''

 &HT;    High-wire act: AT&AMP;T cable move is perilous
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There's $48 billion at stake in this roll of the
dice.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling that it can conquer Internet and local telephone
service, AT&AMP;T has agreed to pay that price to buy cable TV operator
Tele-Communications Inc. It's a move that promises to shake up the
online and local telephone industries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, AT&AMP;T will combine its consumer
long distance, wireless and Internet services with TCI's cable,
telecommunications and high-speed Internet business to create a new
subsidiary _ AT&AMP;T Consumer Services.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the unit will significantly accelerate its
cable infrastructure to provide digital phone and data services, as
well as digital video services, to consumers by the end of 1999.
TCI has 10 million cable TV subscribers. In Georgia it serves 23
communities, including Columbus and Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, in stock and assumption of debt, confirms again
what the cable TV industry already believes: that its growing fiber
optic network is the telecommunications superhighway of the future.
AT&AMP;T joins Atlanta-based Cox Communications and other cable TV
operators attempting to bring consumers a range of services.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, the deal, which is expected to close in the first half
of 1999, is a move boldly out of character. The country's leading
long distance carrier has sought a new identity since it was forced
to divest local telephone service to the Baby Bells more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a move fraught with danger. There is no guarantee
consumers will flock to cable as their primary ramp to the
Internet. Only about 200,000 of the country's 68 million cable
subscribers have cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Bells such as Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. aren't going to
let this new market go uncontested. They will likely accelerate
their plans to offer high-speed Internet access over phone lines.
For TCI, the country's second largest cable operator, the deal,
which came together in eight days, is a bonanza.It will help the
Denver-based company catch up with the other operators that have
taken the lead in building two-way digital systems.

EARLY REVIEWS LOOK POSITIVE; CLOSE SCRUTINY IS A CERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: AT&AMP;T-TCI, AT&AMP;T-ASSESS, AT&AMP;T-EXECS) 
(th) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While federal regulatory officials expressed
initially favorable views of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s proposed acquisition of
cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc., they said
Wednesday that they would closely examine the impact the deal would
have on creating competition in local phone markets and increasing
home access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to learning more about this transaction,''
William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
said in a speech Wednesday afternoon. ``But if it means that these
companies will make a real commitment to building facilities to
bring residential voice and high-speed Internet service to
America's homes, then this merger is eminently thinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said the commission could be expected to grant
approval if the two companies showed that their merger increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, the two
agencies that share responsibility for enforcing antitrust laws,
have not yet decided among themselves which agency will handle this
case. But both generally apply the same test: If competition is
harmed, the merger receives critical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Most mergers, by their very nature, reduce competition. But in
some ways, the officials said, this one could be different. Through
TCI, AT&AMP;T intends to introduce significant new competition in the
telephone and Internet service markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a few small markets, cable companies have been offering local
telephone service. But once it acquires TCI, AT&AMP;T plans to move
aggressively into that business, giving the local telephone
companies their first significant competition since the breakup of
AT&AMP;T. Kennard indicated he would like to see that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Greater competition in local telephone service could also open
up long-distance competition. The regional Baby Bell telephone
companies have tried to move into the long-distance market but have
been rebuffed because they face so little competition locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of this happens as is being discussed,'' a senior FCC
official said, ``this could take some of the issues off the table
that have prevented the Baby Bells from moving into long-distance
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cable-television industry has been slow to offer
Internet services, even though using cable modems gives customers
far faster access to the Internet. But AT&AMP;T is a major Internet
server and is expected to ramp up TCI's presence in that market _
bringing a significant new competitor into that business too.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of Congress with responsibility in this area said
they were grappling with the same questions. Ken Johnson, an aide
to Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House
Telecommunications subcommittee, said, ``We're going to take a good
hard look, but I think a lot of good could come from this. It will
give consumers one-stop shopping for the Internet, cable and
telephone services. But we do have to see what impact this will
have on cable TV competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, complained that the 1996 Telecommunications Act
was supposed to increase competition, thereby reducing the need for
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach ignores marketplace realities and forces
companies that are forestalled from competing to take the simpler
route of merging,'' McCain said. &QL;

PAUL O'DWYER, 90, NEW YORK'S CHAMPION OF UNDERDOGS AND OUTSIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Dwyer, a spirited liberal voice in New York
politics from his immigrant days in the Democratic clubhouse to his
glory years as a fiery anti-Vietnam War insurgent, died June 23 at
his home in Goshen, N.Y. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer had been in failing health from the effects of a stroke
and died quietly in his sleep, according to his nephew and law
partner, Frank Durkan.
</P>
<P>
   To his deathbed, Paul O'Dwyer, a white-maned, fiercely browed
advocate, embraced a raft of minority causes, identifying with
indigents and immigrants, progressives and underdogs well beyond
America _ from the guerrilla fighters for a Jewish home state to
the diehard rebels of his beloved Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer was an enduring if rarely elected politician who
impressed successive generations as an eloquent battler in the name
of conscience. Arriving in America at age 18, he labored up from
dock work and garment packing to become one of New York's leading
defenders of the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideals should always come first,'' O'Dwyer counseled in a
long public life steeped in voluntary civil-rights battles and
vociferous challenges of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Elected twice to the New York City Council, he seemed more at
home in the politics of the outsider. As an Irishman who had lived
under British occupation, he heartily joined the ongoing American
struggle against prejudice suffered variously by Jews, blacks,
women and the very latest immigrant wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is the only machinery around on which you can really
straighten things out,'' he said in his softly unyielding brogue.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet, unapologetic gadfly, Paul was the antithesis of his
older brother William, who rose from the police force to become an
urbane master of machine politics as mayor of New York from 1946
until 1950, when scandals shook his administration. The O'Dwyers
moved separately on the crest of Irish-American political power
before it faded in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Dwyer far outlasted his brother ``Bill-O'' in public
life, fighting for the labor movement and embattled immigrants in
the 1940s, against McCarthyism and racial segregation in the '50s,
and against the Vietnam War in the '60s. In the antiwar movement,
he stood as a patriarchal exception in the eyes of young pacifists
intent on trusting no one over 30.
</P>
<P>
   An ally of Sen. Eugene McCarthy in the anti-war challenge to
President Lyndon B. Johnson's renomination in 1968, O'Dwyer scored
an upset victory himself in the New York Democratic Senate primary
that year, but lost in the November election to Sen. Jacob Javits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taking a country engrossed in an immoral war,'' he
declared afterward, pounding the arm of his chair in celebration of
that struggle. ``We were changing this nation. By God, we did it.
We did do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He could make a rampart of a legal brief, too, successfully
litigating a landmark 1951 fight against the powerful Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. That suit opened the way for blacks to live in
Stuyvesant Town, a huge Manhattan housing complex, and presaged an
era of desegregation across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer honed his courtroom skills suing insurance companies in
negligence cases. But his outside interests were his larger life:
He successfully defended Kentucky miners accused of blowing up a
bridge in a union dispute, just as he won acquittal of a black
teen-ager accused of homicide in a New York City riot in the
mid-'60s. He sued City Hall to force more budget money into public
transit for the working class, just as he defended an unpopular
union chief during a city garbage collection strike.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, he joined with Eleanor Roosevelt and former Gov.
Herbert Lehman to found the Committee for Democratic Voters, the
state party reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   But his outspokenness for minority causes helped deny him a
mainstream role in politics. As president of the New York chapter
of the National Lawyers Guild, O'Dwyer was denounced as a radical
for angrily challenging red-baiting assaults on civil liberties by
politicians who were intent on searching for Communist leanings
among teachers and other government workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come from the period of, first, the Depression and
then the McCarthy era,'' he explained, ``if you survive that, then
you're less likely to be cautious expressing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Dwyer was among the first volunteers litigating in Deep
South integration struggles. ``It was like a present on Christmas
morning,'' he enthused about his participation. He was also gladly
troublesome as a delegate to the 1964 Democratic National
Convention, leading the fight to see the black Freedom Democratic
party of Mississippi represented.
</P>
<P>
   Personally close to a generation of black politicians, O'Dwyer
managed the campaigns of several. He was credited by Mayor David
Dinkins with salvaging his career by coaxing him back into public
life after Dinkins had earlier been forced to resign a city job
because of his failure to file income tax returns from 1969 to
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young person, impressionable, I almost forgot who I was,
as the Irish often do here,'' O`Dwyer once commented on the roots
of his desegregation fervor. ``Because you are white you think you
will be treated equally. I was corrected by my brothers, who were
here ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   He rued the fading of an era when ``Irish Catholic'' was
synonymous with ``liberal Democrat,'' and told the joke about a
tenement clubhouse boss scandalized at the news that O'Brien had
turned Republican. ``That's a damned lie,'' the boss thundered. ``I
saw O'Brien at Mass last Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   As a civil libertarian, O'Dwyer tapped into vivid memories from
his Irish childhood of insurrection against British occupation
forces. ``The Black and Tans used to drive through the town,
shooting it up,'' he said, recalling the rampages of the British
auxiliary police. ``It wasn't too different from Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   A florid-faced, articulate bantam, O'Dwyer successfully argued
before the Supreme Court for the right of mainland Puerto Ricans to
take their voter literacy test in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he stood in defense of a pacifist group called the
Harrisburg Eight, led by the Rev. Philip Berrigan, and won them a
mistrial on charges of an anti-government plot against the Nixon
Administration during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   No less fervidly did he represent uncelebrated sandhogs, hod
carriers and warehouse clerks in formative trade union years when,
he recalled, ``strikebreaking and union-busting remained widespread
and brutal.'' He carried a union card in Local 975 of the
International Longshoremen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he declined to cross a wildcat picket line outside a
television studio when he was a Senate candidate, telephoning the
apoplectic interviewer to explain, ``These are my people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer accepted the role of the city's commissioner for the
United Nations during the Dinkins administration. But soon he was
boycotting the U.N. cafeteria for its anti-unionism, and finally
resigned so he could speak out against human rights abuses by some
of the nations he was supposed to be welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 29, 1907, in the village of Bohola, County Mayo, in
western Ireland, Peter Paul O'Dwyer was the 11th and last surviving
child of Patrick and Bridget McNicholas O'Dwyer. They were
schoolteachers who raised their family in Ireland's grim potato
economy, packed into a rude house without plumbing. He later
endowed a home for the handicapped on his family home site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sprang from the `shabby genteel,''' he once said with a
smile, using Eugene O'Neill's qualification for the striving Irish
poor. Paul O'Dwyer counted himself fortunate for the high school
education he received before having to follow four older brothers
to New York in the age-old immigration of young Irish to
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   He soon picked up on the politics of Jefferson and Paine after
finding clannish lodgings in Mrs. Maguire's Irish boarding house at
West 103rd Street and Columbus Avenue in Manhattan. Landing a
paying job within two days _ a touch of clubhouse patronage via
brother ``Bill-O'' _ he moved fast on the classic immigrant's route
to betterment through night school, first at Fordham University,
then at St. John's Law School in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   So fast did he move that he had to obtain special permission
from Chief Judge Benjamin Nathan Cardozo of the New York Court of
Appeals to take his bar exam in 1929, four years after arriving
from Ireland and two years before he could receive citizenship. In
1931, Paul O'Dwyer became America's newest citizen-lawyer, ringing
with the impulses of Thomas Paine. ``He sounded simple and logical
to my young mind,'' O'Dwyer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism in college fraternities had bonded him to Jewish
friends, he recalled in his 1979 autobiography, ``Counsel for the
Defense.'' ``And the Kings County Young Democratic Club
thenceforward was made up of 35 Jewish classmates and me,'' he
noted proudly.
</P>
<P>
   It followed naturally that he was involved in the cause of a
Jewish homeland in 1946 by arranging for the illegal entry of
Holocaust survivors to Palestine and by aiding the gun-running
operations of the Irgun militants fighting the British in the Holy
Land. The next year, as chairman of the Lawyers' Committee for
Justice in Palestine, he pleaded at the United Nations for Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Successfully defending an admitted Jewish gun-runner in New York
in 1948, O'Dwyer told the court, ``He was only doing what every
other freedom-loving person would be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer, O'Dwyer became a principal in one of the city's
flagship immigrant law firms, O'Dwyer &AMP; Bernstien. He began as a
clerk to Oscar Bernstien and worked his way to senior partner. From
the firm's offices in the financial district, O'Dwyer helped build
the business but found time for assorted challenges to social
injustice, typically without fee. He soon was respected as one of
the city's sharper-tongued liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought at the end of the year that all I did was make a
living, I'd regard it as a pretty incomplete year,'' he said of his
rich life as an agitator within the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've had any success at all, it's been in large measure
from listening to young people,'' said O'Dwyer, whose eagle-like
visage _ a dark-eyed glare and shock of prematurely white hair _
stood out in the thick of any battle.
</P>
<P>
   Even in decline he stayed keen for political justice. In 1994,
he beamed from a wheelchair and led the welcoming cheers when Gerry
Adams, the Northern Irish republican political leader, was finally
allowed into the United States to plead his grievance against
Britain. O'Dwyer was the national coordinator for the American
League for an Undivided Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He ran 12 times for elective office in campaigns noteworthy for
threadbare war chests and left-liberal agendas, daring to call for
decriminalizing drug addiction in one. His two successes were in
1963, as councilman at large in Manhattan, and 1973, as City
Council president, a post in which he made sure to alter the city's
official founding date from 1664, when the British landed, to 1625,
when Dutch settlers arrived. In six total years in office, he
instigated numerous causes, including an uphill battle in 1965 to
raise the city's minimum wage to $1.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer's abiding comfort was in the good fight. Losing to Carol
Bellamy in a 1977 bid to remain Council president, he said, ``I
fought for a lot of civil rights 25, 35 years ago, including
women's rights, and I'm in poor shape to complain if I find myself
in the way of the machinery that I myself helped set in motion.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered a decidedly Irish smile of bemusement when critics
focused on his anti-war activity and tried to dismiss him as a
single-issue politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one issue is fair play over the period of a lifetime,''
O'Dwyer amended.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 45 years, the former Kathleen Rohan, died in 1980.
In 1984 he married Patricia Hanrahan, then the upstate chief of
Gov. Mario Cuomo's women's division. She survives him, along with
four children from his first marriage: William, of Albany; Rory, of
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Brian, of Manhattan, and Eileen O'Dwyer
Hughes of New York. He had eight grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer long tried to persuade his wife, Patricia, to restake
the family flag in elective politics. She finally agreed this year,
and he lived to see her running for the 95th state Assembly
District in Orange County, true to his favorite line of Yeats:
</P>
<P>
   ``That I may seem, though I die old,
</P>
<P>
   A foolish, passionate man.''

ARMSTRONG AND MALONE: EXECUTIVES WITH DIFFERING CAREER GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: AT&AMP;T-TCI, AT&AMP;T-ASSESS, AT&AMP;T-FCC) 
(th) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong and John Malone have arranged a very modern
marriage. In the proposed $48 billion merger of AT&AMP;T Corp., the
nation's biggest long-distance phone company, and
Tele-Communications Inc., the second-largest cable-television
company, theirs will be a partnership of equals pursuing starkly
different career goals.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chief executive since last November, will
throw all his energies into integrating AT&AMP;T's telephone services
with TCI's cable wires in a drive to offer local phone service to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who built TCI from a scrappy West Coast cable company
into an industry behemoth, will hardly be a passive partner in that
endeavor. Indeed, he will become one of AT&AMP;T's biggest individual
shareholders and will sit on its board.
</P>
<P>
   But he will spend most of his time doing what he enjoys most _
cable deals. By retaining control over Liberty Media, TCI's
separately traded programming unit with stakes in such properties
as QVC Inc., Home Shopping Network, TV Guide, the Discovery
Channel, Encore Media and Liberty Fox Sports, Malone will in effect
have his own sandbox to play in.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, both men stand to make a lot of money from the
deal. Armstrong could get rich and Malone a whole lot richer than
his current $2.4 billion net worth.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint press conference Wednesday, the 58-year-old Malone
said he thought his ownership of some 25 million TCI shares was
worth about $1.2 billion, though he added that he was so optimistic
about the ramifications of the merger that earlier in the day he
had bought another $240 million in TCI stock at market prices _ or
roughly five million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his wealth is mostly tied up in Liberty and a third
company, TCI Ventures, that will be folded into Liberty. He will
ultimately be able to swap the TCI stock for AT&AMP;T shares, tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have John's problem,'' Armstrong joked Wednesday,
referring to Malone's wealth and his seeming uncertainty about its
value.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but he isn't doing too badly. According to an AT&AMP;T
proxy filed in March, he received a $14.9 million stock package
when he left Hughes Electronics Corp. to join the phone company. He
also got a $1.4 million salary, a comparable bonus and
performance-related stock designed to match his salary this year
and next.
</P>
<P>
   If Armstrong can make this merger work, of course, he is likely
to benefit from huge option grants that could push his long-term
compensation into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ted Turner, the Time Warner vice chairman, who sold his
Turner Broadcasting System to Time Warner and did not retain a
separate power base, John Malone will continue to run his own
fiefdom at Liberty Media.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been an avid dealmaker, and in overseeing Liberty,
which will have relatively little debt, he will have ample
opportunity to buy and sell and negotiate. ``He wants to build
asset value,'' said Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Painewebber
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That role should suit Malone's impatient personality well. Since
Liberty is generally a minority investor or partner in
cable-programming holdings, he will not be required to get involved
in day-to-day operating duties, a task that has never particularly
interested him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complexity of the deal, however, it is not yet clear
what the final structure of AT&AMP;T will be. Armstrong and Malone said
Wednesday that while the first step is for AT&AMP;T to acquire TCI, a
second step is to spin off AT&AMP;T's consumer businesses together with
TCI's cable systems into an AT&AMP;T ``tracking stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks represent ownership in certain, specific assets
of publicly held companies and rise or fall with the fortunes of
those assets. Investors in such stocks have no voting rights,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of a tracking stock for the issuing company are
twofold: It retains full control of the underlying assets, and it
is subject to fewer tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is already taking advantage of the tracking-stock
structure to sell back shares of AT&AMP;T that TCI received when it
sold a stake in Teleport, a company that provides local phone and
data services to businesses, thereby pumping up Liberty's cash
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   TCI will also sell its shares in At Home, an Internet access and
information services company that operates over cable networks, to
AT&AMP;T for cash. Those shares are held by Liberty and TCI Ventures
respectively, both of which are tracking companies of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Malone sees the new Liberty as a sort of General Electric
Capital Corp., he said Wednesday, because it will have the capital
to make leasing investments in such technologies as digital cable
set top boxes, which could help AT&AMP;T grow.
</P>
<P>
   But before any of that can happen, Liberty said Wednesday that
it would merge with TCI Ventures, which has a wide range of
holdings, in a stock deal with Liberty offering 0.52 shares for
each share of TCI Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The merged Liberty-TCI Ventures _ which will retain the Liberty
name _ will be an unusual form of tracking stock because AT&AMP;T,
though it will swap a new class of its shares for the Liberty
shares, will not have a direct financial interest in Liberty.
Liberty will be owned by Malone, other TCI and Liberty executives
and the public. &QL;

HAMAS SHEIK BACK IN GAZA AFTER TOURING ARAB CAPITALS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder and
spiritual leader of the militant Islamic movement Hamas, returned
to Gaza on Wednesday night after a medical trip that turned into a
triumphant and reportedly lucrative four-month tour of Arab
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Islamic cleric, a quadriplegic with failing
eyesight and hearing, was released from an Israeli jail last
October in exchange for Israeli agents seized after a botched
attempt on the life of a Hamas official in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   At his home in Gaza City, the sheik's motorcade was greeted with
festive gunfire from Hamas bodyguards and a placard reading: ``The
Islamic nation is proud of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who returned to the
nation its dignity and glory, and from his wheelchair moved the
whole nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement to about 100 followers, the sheik said he
was returning to ``Gaza, to my Palestinian homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to continue the struggle. We will never
accept the occupation of our homeland, and we will use all our
means until we remove the occupation and our people go back home,''
the sheik said.
</P>
<P>
   His return had been a matter of some suspense. Israel debated
whether to allow him back in after a tour in which he issued
militant statements and reportedly netted tens of millions of
dollars for his movement, which adamantly opposes the Palestinian
peace agreements with Israel and whose secretive military wing is
responsible for most of the suicide bombings in Israel in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Israeli government concluded that Sheik Yassin
was more dangerous abroad than in Gaza, where he must deal with a
leery Palestinian Authority and a Hamas leadership considered more
moderate than its counterpart in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Hamas leaders and followers had waited at the
Rafah crossing point from Egypt all afternoon. But by the time the
sheik crossed at 11 p.m., after traveling overland from Cairo, most
had left. Imad Falouji, the only member of the Palestinian
Authority who came to greet Sheik Yassin, said that Hamas, the
Palestinian Authority, Israel and Egypt had all agreed to have the
sheik cross late in the day to prevent a potentially rowdy
reception.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority of Yasser Arafat in particular has
tried hard to downplay the sheik's grand tour, which confirmed on
Hamas the status of a rival movement to Arafat, and by extension
demonstrated the frustration of the Arab world with Arafat and his
perceived failure to deliver on the promise of the peace he made
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The length and effect of Sheik Yassin's voyage came as a
surprise not only to Israel and the Palestinian Authority, but
apparently to Hamas leaders as well.
</P>
<P>
   It began Feb. 19, when the sheik traveled to Cairo for medical
treatment. Soon after, he was invited to Saudi Arabia to make a
pilgrimage to Mecca, and was feted by King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a wave of new invitations and visits _ to Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Yemen, Syria, Iran and the Sudan.
The visits were prominently reported in the Arab press, and the
sheik was repeatedly interviewed on Arabic cable television
stations _ though Palestinian newspapers, evidently on direct
orders from Arafat, gave the tour only perfunctory coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In some of his interviews, the sheik issued stinging calls for
struggle against Israel. ``The so-called peace path is not peace,
and it is not a substitute for jihad and resistance,'' he declared
in Kuwait, using the Arabic word for holy war. ``The first quarter
of the next century will witness the elimination of the Zionist
entity and the establishment of the Palestinian state over the
whole of Palestine,'' he said in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Reports also surfaced that Sheik Yassin was pledged tens of
millions of dollars by the leaders he met, though neither he, nor
his hosts, nor Hamas leaders in Gaza ever confirmed any donation.
</P>
<P>
   The sheik's warm reception in moderate Arab capitals, especially
those like Saudi Arabia or Kuwait that have friendly relations with
the United States, was likely to make it more difficult for the
United States or Israel to portray Hamas solely as a terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip is a ground-breaking one in terms of exposing the
Hamas founder and his mystique to the Arab world,'' said Ziad Abu
Amr, an academic specialist on Islamic affairs and a Palestinian
legislator. ``Equally important is the exposure of Sheik Yassin to
this environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his release, the sheik has avoided any direct challenge to
Arafat's authority. Arafat, for his part, has tried alternatively
to cajole or squeeze Hamas.

NASA OFFICIAL CONCEDES FUTURE DELAYS, COST OVERRUNS MAY HIT SPACE
STATION 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA administrator Dan Goldin told a congressional
committee Wednesday that his agency is preparing contingency plans
to expand its role in launching and assembling the orbiting
laboratory, if the space agency's Russian partners cannot meet
their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin conceded the project _ already over budget and behind
schedule _ probably faces future delays and cost overruns, but he
brushed aside sharp criticism from committee members and offered
few specifics about how much additional funding the agency might
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA does not want and does not need a blank check from
Congress,'' Goldin told the House space subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency chief said the Russian government is about $240
million behind in its commitment to the space station and has until
July 1 to fulfill its obligations. At that point, Goldin said, he
will make a recommendation to the White House and Congress based on
alternative measures being considered by NASA planners.
</P>
<P>
   A key concern is whether Russia will complete, as planned, a
propulsion module to keep the space station in proper orbit. Among
the options being considered, Goldin said, is use of the space
shuttle to essentially push the station into the correct orbit
during resupply mission. Also under consideration by NASA is
building a propulsion module largely from parts that might
otherwise be used to build another space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is in big, deep trouble and we need to have some
alternatives to keep the program going,'' Goldin said. Sixteen
countries are participating in the space station, and Goldin said
all but Russia are meeting their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by committee members, the NASA chief conceded that if
Russia falls short of its goal he might have to ask the White House
and Congress to increase the NASA budget for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. share of the space station, as currently designed, was
to cost an estimated $17 billion and be completed by June 2002.
NASA has revised that cost figure to $21.7 billion. An independent
task force early this year estimated the cost would top $25 billion
and the orbiting lab would not be operational until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   When urged by space station supporters in Congress to help find
the money to cover the overruns, the White House responded recently
that NASA should get no money above the $13.5 billion in the
president's 1999 budget request. Any additional money, the White
House said, should be shifted from other NASA projects such as the
space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion drew an angry response Wednesday from members of
the House space subcommittee and renewed a call by some members to
scrap the space station project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses are letting you down big time,'' Rep. David
Weldon, R-Fla., told Goldin. ``What is it going to take to get the
administration to concede that this (partnership with Russia) isn't
working out and we need to put resources behind making it happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Roemer, an Indiana Democrat and leader in efforts to
scrap the international project, renewed his call to pull the plug
``before the slow, bloated and out-of-control space station
cannibalizes the rest of the worthwhile, admirable projects at
NASA.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments supported by Texas Democratic Reps. Sheila Jackson
Lee and Nick Lampson, Goldin said canceling the space station would
be ``devastating'' and essentially end the United States' human
space flight program.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question from Lampson, whose district includes
the Johnson Space Center in far south Houston, Goldin said the
project is ``the future of our space program'' and without it the
space shuttle has ``no place ... to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the shuttle to spend another 17 years going up and down
for 7 days to 14 days at a time makes no sense,'' Goldin said. ``If
we cancel the program, we will be a second-class power and there
would be international repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee said dipping into other NASA accounts to keep the
project moving is ill-advised. ``We need a plan that solidly speaks
to the needs of the space station,'' Jackson Lee said.

HOUSE EXEMPTS WHEAT SALES FROM SANCTIONS AGAINST PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sale of Northwest wheat would be exempt from
sanctions imposed on Pakistan under a $56 billion agriculture
spending bill approved overwhelmingly by the House Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption can not come soon enough for Washington state
wheat growers, whose largest market is Pakistan. Wheat farmers were
already reeling from low prices and an overabundant harvest when
India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons last month, triggering
automatic sanctions that included a ban on the agricultural credits
Pakistan uses to buy about 37 percent of the wheat grown in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state's congressional delegation, led by Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., has been
pushing to change the sanctions law to exempt agricultural export
credits from the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is insane that our country would impose unilateral
sanctions on the industry that is there to provide food and fiber
and assistance to people who are hungry, not only in our country
but in all countries of the world,'' Nethercutt said in debate on
the House floor. ``(Pakistan) is a huge market for us, and for the
law to impose unilateral sanctions seems to me wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual agriculture appropriations bill, which passed 373-48,
increases spending by $6.1 billion over last year. The bill
contains money for the Department of Agriculture, tobacco support
programs, food safety inspections and farm loans.
</P>
<P>
   The House defeated an effort to reduce the subsidy for sugar
processors and approved an amendment that bars the FDA from using
any funds to study, develop or approve for manufacture any
abortion-inducing pill. The Senate, which has not yet taken up the
farm bill, often defeats or softens anti-abortion measures backed
in the more militant House.
</P>
<P>
   The wheat exemption was controversial when it was first
introduced in a subcommittee by Nethercutt, because it became
ensnared in a larger debate over the wisdom of U.S. sanctions
policy. But no opposition was voiced during two days of debate over
agriculture programs on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the gentleman from Washington (Nethercutt) brought up the
proposal that is now incorporated in the bill that dealt with
lifting agriculture from the sanctions mandate in Pakistan, there
was give-and-take on the committee,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptur of
Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the agriculture appropriations
subcommittee. ``Members did not agree, but ultimately, by the time
we got to the floor, we were able to work out our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members expressed support for the wheat farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution of this issue is vitally important to American
wheat farmers since Pakistan is the third largest wheat market in
the world, accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. wheat exports, and
relies on the (export credit) program for nearly all of its U.S.
wheat imports,'' said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. ``Farmers on the
Upper Great Plains are already struggling with miserably low market
prices, adverse growing conditions, and devastating crop disease.
... At a minimum, we should not surrender hard-fought and hard-won
foreign markets through unilateral sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is not expected to take up its version of the
agriculture budget until it returns from the July 4 recess, and
then any differences between the two budgets must be reconciled.
But thus far, the change sought by wheat farmers has not been
controversial in the Senate, and it was unanimously added to the
bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton several times has voiced his support for
changing the sanctions law to help wheat farmers. Clinton has said
that without a change in the law, he has no choice but to ban
Pakistan from using agricultural export credits under the Arms
Export Control Act, which requires sanctions on countries that test
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protect our exports by passing the legislation ... to
allow our farmers to continue to export wheat to Pakistan and
India,'' he said Tuesday. ``It was never intended, I don't believe,
to use food as a weapon in foreign policy even in this extreme
circumstance. And I strongly support that legislation and believe
we have big bipartisan support for doing something about it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The wheat industry welcomed the House action. Wheat prices in
Portland have fallen from $3.37 a bushel to $2.93 a bushel since
Pakistan detonated its weapons last month. Wheat experts attributed
some of that price drop to the expectation that sanctions would
eliminate a major market for Northwest white wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news that the House passed it, but now we have to
see whether it will get through the Senate, and whether so many
things get attached that it gets killed,'' said Glen Squires, an
analyst at the Washington Wheat Commission. ``And hopefully the
other impacts (of sanctions) won't cause Pakistan's
creditworthiness to be lessened and negate the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan imports about $500 million worth of wheat annually,
about half of which comes from the Northwest. The main competitor
for the Northwest is Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was approved by the House after two days of debate
over various subsidies. Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., has been trying
for several years to eliminate tobacco subsidies, but Wednesday she
agreed to withdraw her proposal in exchange for a promise by
Republican leaders to include such a ban in the tobacco bill they
intend to propose this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, tobacco interests muscled their way to defeat the
amendments by less than 12 votes,'' Smith said. ``Today, with this
agreement, tobacco subsidies and big tobacco interests are on their
way out.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of the House tobacco bill, which is expected to be
much more restrained than the sweeping measure rejected by the
Senate last week, remain uncertain.

FOR ATT, A QUICK ENTRY INTO 22 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They call it ``the last mile,'' the biggest
challenge to telecommunications companies hoping to capture a piece
of the billions up for grabs in the new information era.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have already crisscrossed the country with
sophisticated networks that for the first time can carry phone,
cable television and new high-tech services over a single wire. But
running those lines from operations centers to the nation's 100
million homes is proving to be hugely expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as AT&AMP;T Corp. confirmed its $31.9 billion acquisition
of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's No. 2 cable operator, it
said a major factor driving the deal was the need to travel that
last mile to connect to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T does not own any wires into homes now, but TCI's cable
lines now reach 22 million households. Together, the two companies
promised to upgrade TCI's cable system to offer an array of
information services, including speedy Internet access and
movies-on-demand.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, the companies said they would offer local
telephone service, entering a market where competition is slim, the
Baby Bell monopolies still rule and prices are higher than many
critics say they should be. Phone service ``is probably a year to
18 months away,'' John Malone, chairman and chief executive of TCI,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of local phone competition was enough to cheer some
consumer advocates who had condemned many of the other
billion-dollar mergers sweeping the phone and cable industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color us `tentatively optimistic.' We like what we've heard,''
said the Media Access Project, a Washington public interest group.
US Representative Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who
specializes in telecommunications issues, said the deal might
``jump-start'' local phone competition nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also prompted speculation that other phone companies
would sell cable partners to keep pace with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T dominates the $75 billion-a-year long-distance industry but
has been locked out of the $110 billion market for local phone
service. The main reason is that the government forced AT&AMP;T in 1984
to give up its wires into US homes, along with switching equipment
that makes local phone service possible. Those assets formed the
core of the local Baby Bell phone companies, such as Bell Atlantic
Corp. in New England.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It would cost AT&AMP;T billions of dollars to lay new wires, as
much $2,000 per home by some estimates. AT&AMP;T had considered renting
existing lines controlled by the Baby Bells but said it could not
reach acceptable terms.
</P>
<P>
   That is why AT&AMP;T turned to TCI, which has made a huge investment
in wiring homes and businesses. By adapting TCI's cable lines, AT&AMP;T
can cut the cost of establishing local phone service to $400 or
$500 per home, AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are beginning to answer a big part of the question
about how we will provide local service to US consumers,'' said
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   But huge technical and financial hurdles remain. The combined
company's goal isn't just to own a wire into businsses and
residences. It is to build a ``full-service network'' that can
handle voice, video, e-mail and other data with ease.
</P>
<P>
   That requires the company _ and every other cable and local
phone company _ to spend huge amounts to upgrade networks, said
William Bane, a vice president and telecommunications specialist
with Mercer Mangement Consulting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of copper phone wires or coaxial cable used to deliver
cable TV, the new networks will use fiber-optic lines, which are
less vulnerable to rain, lightning, hungry squirrels, and other
types of interference, and which can carry vastly greater amounts
of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and TCI have a long way to go to build this kind of
network, said Jim Wahl of the Yankee Group, a Boston research and
consulting concern. ``They've got the least-updated plant of the
big cable operators,'' he said of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   The poor condition of TCI's network was one of the
less-publicized reasons that a proposed 1993 merger with Bell
Atlantic collapsed, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   TCI had annoucned plans to fully upgrade its network by the year
2001, ``but from our perspective, that was extremely aggressive,
and we were skeptical that they could meet that goal,'' Wahl said.
Now, with AT&AMP;T's cash and expertise, ``it is more likely they can
meet their goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts Wednesday questioned the cost that AT&AMP;T would
incur. ``I'm really worried about AT&AMP;T funding the upgrade of those
networks,'' analyst Blake Bath of Lehman Brothers told Bloomberg
Business News. ``It's going to take a number of years to get these
networks up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   But for AT&AMP;T, moving into local phone service could be a matter
of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, when Congress approved a sweeping overhaul of
telephone and cable laws, long-distance firms and the Baby Bells
were barred from entering each other's businesses. Now those
barriers are gone. But for legal and technical reasons, the Baby
Bells are likely to start selling long-distance service before
carriers like AT&AMP;T move into local service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's share of the long-distance market, which is already
eroding under pressure from MCI and Sprint, is likley to fall
further before the company generates new revenues from the local
telephone business. The deal with TCI could cut the time that it
remains vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the TCI deal will not bring local phone competition fast
enough for some consumer advocates, including Mark Cooper,
economist for the Consumer Federation of America. ``In five years
or 10 years they'll get it ... I need an effective way for someone
new to get into local service in the next year or two. This ain't
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the only effective way to bring competition to the local
phone market is to force Bell Atlantic and the other Baby Bells to
share their networks on fair terms. Congress attempted to set those
terms in the 1996 legislation, but the Baby Bells have challenged
them in court.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some consumer advocates who praised the deal for its possible
impact on local phone service cautioned that it could dampen
competition in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Access Project warned that TCI could use AT&AMP;T's cash
and clout to ``destroy'' the satellite TV industry, a burgeoning
competitor to cable. And Markey warned that the deal could help TCI
skirt rules that require it to sell its TV programs to other cable
operators, which would be a setback to companies setting up rival
cable service in TCI service areas.

BILL PROPOSED FOR AUTISM RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many parents of autistic children haven't been
happy with Sen. Slade Gorton since he proposed making it easier for
teachers to suspend from school unruly disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, R-Wash., isn't backing off his position that
schoolteachers need more disciplinary tools to restore order in the
classroom, but Wednesday he took another step that drew praise from
families of autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by ``ER'' star Anthony Edwards and former Seattle
Mariners pitcher Bill Krueger, Gorton and Rep. James Greenwood,
R-Penn., said they would introduce legislation to focus more money
and attention on autism research, much of which is conducted at the
University of Washington. The bill would set up five centers for
autism research around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those supporting the bill have been touched by autism in
some way. Gorton Wednesday for the first time mentioned publicly
that he has an autistic grandson; Edwards has an autistic nephew,
Krueger an autistic daughter, and Greenwood worked with autistic
children as a social worker before he was elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Infantile autism is a severe neurological disorder appearing in
childhood that is characterized by an inability to relate to
others, highly repetitive play, and language impairment. Autism is
the third most common developmental disorder among children. An
estimated 400,000 people in this country suffer from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton called autism ``one of the most common disabling
conditions with which children are afflicted, but one that the
physicians and the scientists and the researchers tell us can in
fact be cured, and is not something that we simply must accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very significant amount of fine research has already been
accomplished, much of it at the University of Washington, and what
we would like to do is expand that research across the country, see
to it that the researchers are able to work together and share
their results, and to try to see that they have sufficient amounts
of money and facilities with which to conduct it,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   The University's Center on Human Development and Disability,
funded in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, is conducting research aimed at early detection of
autism and at understanding the role of genetic factors in autism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the autism research centers, the bill would
create a greater role for parents in the National Institutes of
Health funding decisions, a gene and tissue bank of autism
materials, and a national autism awareness program. The bill, which
sets aside $40 million for autism research over the next year, was
pushed by an organization called Cure Autism Now, which was started
by Jonathan Shestack, the producer of ``Air Force One,'' and his
wife, Portia Iversen.

AT&AMP;T INTENSIFIES LOCAL PHONE BATTLE WITH PLAN TO BUY TCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking direct aim at the local telephone monopolies of Bell
Atlantic and the other Bell companies, AT&AMP;T Corp. Wednesday
unveiled plans to acquire cable television giant
Tele-Communications Inc. for $31.9 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would allow AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long distance
phone carrier, to eventually offer local phone service and
high-speed Internet access to millions of Americans using TCI's
cable lines. As a result, AT&AMP;T, with long-distance and cellular
phone services already, would take a giant step toward providing
consumers one-stop shopping for telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout would also permit AT&AMP;T to bypass local phone
companies _ and the ``access'' fees they charge _ when providing
long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal sent tremors throughout the communications
industry. Shares of local phone companies fell as investors worried
that AT&AMP;T would steal their customers. Shares of cable TV companies
rose on speculation that ATT&AMP;T-TCI combination would trigger
similar deals. And the blockbuster announcement also raised
questions about the local phone strategies of MCI and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of multibillion-dollar telecommunications deals
ushering in an era of sophisticated communications services, AT&AMP;T
had been searching for a master stroke to move it closer to the
goal of offering all-in-one services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand for broadband (cable and Internet services) is apparent
and the time was closing in on us,'' explained C. Michael
Armstrong, the 59-year old AT&AMP;T chairman who had expressed
frustration in trying to enter the local phone market that the Bell
companies dominate.
</P>
<P>
   However, AT&AMP;T is entering a large but geographically limited
market. TCI, based in Englewood, Colo., and its affiliates have
about 22 million cable customers. Those customers, plus another 11
million with potential access to TCI networks, represent about
one-third of the nation's households with access to cable.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move was major gamble by Armstrong, who joined
the company last year from Hughes Electronics. By acquiring TCI,
AT&AMP;T is betting that it can crack the $100 billion local phone
market using cable technology rather than phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big gamble. This was a necessary yet desperate move
by AT&AMP;T,'' said Mark R. Bruneau, president of global communications
and computing at Renaissance Worldwide Inc. of Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T shares fell 5 3/8 to close at 60, while TCI class A stock
rose 1 1/6 to close at 39 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, AT&AMP;T will buy TCI's cable operations with
$26.4 billion in newly issued AT&AMP;T stock. It will also spend $5.5
billion in cash to buy back TCI's stake in Teleport Communications
Group, a local phone provider to businesses that AT&AMP;T agreed to
acquire earlier this year, and TCI's share of AtHome Corp., a
provider of high-speed Internet access. In addition, AT&AMP;T will
assume $11 billion of TCI debt.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media Group, a programming company spun off from TCI, is
not part of the deal and will continue to be operated independently
by John C. Malone, TCI chief exeuctive.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal, which would rank among the top 10 in history,
will create a behemoth with projected revenues of $69 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal, AT&AMP;T will be split into two companies, each with
its own stock. The parent company, AT&AMP;T, will focus on business
customers, the long distance phone system and a wholesale phone
business. It will have 90,000 employees and $36 billion in annual
revenue. The other company, AT&AMP;T Consumer Services Co. will include
local, wireless and long distance phone services to residential
customers as well as cable television and Internet services to
homes. The second company will have &UR;  &LR; annual revenue of $33 billion
and 60,000 employees. Some antitrust experts predicted the deal
would clear regulatory review. But the deal is sure to receive
intense government scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AT&AMP;T and TCI make a strong commitment to bring residential
consumers more choice in local telephone and high-speed Internet
access services, then this proposed merger is eminently
thinkable,'' said William Kennard, Federal Communications
Commission chairman, in a statement.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Attorney General Janet Reno made clear that the government
will review the merger, but she said no final decision has been
made whether it would be handled by the Justice Department or the
Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of both companies must also approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcement gave some regional Bell operating
companies ammunition to press for quicker government approval to
enter long distance markets. Under the 1996 Telecommunications
Act, &UR;  &LR; the regional phone companies will be allowed to start
offering long distance service only after AT&AMP;T and other
competitors get access to local phone markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Bell Atlantic said the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal is a
``wake-up call that markets are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal is an example of
Armstrong's frustration in dealing with the Baby Bells. AT&AMP;T, which
already has been trying to enter the local phone markets, currently
must pay the Baby Bells access fees to connect long distance calls
to local networks. But AT&AMP;T has complained that the access fees are
too high and that the Baby Bells are foot-dragging in lowering
them.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also is expected to boost the cable industry's fortunes
and legitimize cable as a conduit for phone service. The stock
prices of leading cable companies rose Wednesday. ``This deal is a
harbinger of things to come. Cable will provide real competition to
local phone companies,'' said Paul Cianelli, president of the New
England Cable Television Association in Braintree, Mass.

SPORTS COLUMN: FREE AT LAST. FREE AT LAST?

<P>
   MONTCLAIR , N.J. _ Jets fans who have been listening for signs
of great things from their team must have been filled with pride
and hope Wednesday as Bill Parcells outlined his vision of an
aggressive organization plunging toward a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have watched these organizations of the '90s build
themselves _ the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers _ and they
have all been pro-active in the personnel area,'' he said as the
Jets waved goodbye to one quarterback, Neil O'Donnell, and welcomed
another, Vinny Testaverde. ``They have not been, `Sit back, lay
back, we'll improve by the draft.' None of those teams relied
totally on one aspect to improve their team. I've become educated
that way, I've seen champions built that way and we're going to be
a proactive organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was saying that the Jets, cautiously regarded as a
rising power in the American Football Conference East, will be
aggressive in building the foundation of a championship team. The
worrisome thing about the comments was the context in which they
were being made: a hastily called news conference to announce that
the Jets had effectively erased a major mistake. The overpriced
O'Donnell was being waived, freeing up substantial salary cap
money; the priced-to-sell Testaverde was being signed.
</P>
<P>
   This was the final resolution of Parcells' shattered
relationship with O'Donnell, and of the six-month game of financial
chess between O'Donnell and the Jets. This can be traced back to
the bizarre season-ending game in December when Parcells, in a feud
of ego and principle with O'Donnell, pulled his quarterback and
opted to use the untested Ray Lucas and a rookie running back to
throw passes in crucial situations with the Jets on the edge of the
playoffs. As much as anything, that led to Wednesday's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   There was the slightest hint of contrition Wednesday as Parcells
spoke about O'Donnell. ``I'm disappointed in part of the way this
has gone on,'' he said, ``because I do have a high regard for him
personally. If someone came in and tried to cut my salary, I
probably wouldn't like it either. He's been a good quarterback in
this league. But looking at the big picture for us, I just felt
that this was a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fine young man, but sometimes, things just change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes are part of life, certainly part of the business of
picking personnel in sports. The tragedy of the Jets' mistakes is
that they have tended to resonate so deeply into the future: Hiring
a bad coach and then staying too long with that coach; allowing the
front office to spend far too much money on a player. The Jets
signed O'Donnell for $25 million and everyone _ except the Jets _
knew that the organization had made a costly blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame O'Donnell; if he was being greedy, the Jets fed him.
O'Donnell was good enough to take a very good Pittsburgh team to
the Super Bowl, and he could have been exactly what the Jets
needed. They simply paid far too much for it, and tied up all the
money they needed to fit more pieces into the puzzle. Except that
they didn't see a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after two dismal seasons, the Jets effectively asked
O'Donnell to help them rectify their mistake by taking a pay cut.
He said no, and the Jets found themselves in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Parcells said that he wasn't interested in
Testaverde. Wednesday he said that at the time, Testaverde was
under contract. The problem with that is that the Ravens had given
Testaverde permission to talk with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is a 6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound escape hatch. The Jets
go into the season with Glenn Foley, Testaverde and either Lucas or
Chuck Clements at the crucial quarterback position. Foley is a fan
favorite, though there are serious questions _ doubts, actually _
about his durability.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked a question that implied that Foley is the
Jets' starting quarterback, Parcells barked, ``I said Foley was
going to get the benefit of the doubt, don't put words in my
mouth.'' Parcells said he told Testaverde that if he performs at a
level ``that's obviously better,'' the job is his.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference finally broke up, and Parcells went back to
what was left of his vacation with a considerable weight off his
shoulders. The Jets are free of O'Donnell's salary, saving $2.75
million against the salary cap; O'Donnell is free from Parcells.
The new quarterback is happy to be liberated from his own unwanted
freedom. For now, everyone _ except perhaps Jets fans _ can breathe
a little easier.

APPELLATE RULING WON'T DETER MICROSOFT FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Antitrust regulators say they are proceeding at full
steam in their litigation against Microsoft Corp., despite an
appeals court ruling Tuesday that some believe delivered a torpedo
below the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate decision came in a narrow case filed last fall,
the regulators pointed out, not the broader one they filed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The newer case, which invokes the Sherman Antitrust Act and is
scheduled for trial in September, raises issues such as Microsoft's
allegedly anticompetitive dealings with computer makers and online
content providers that are separate from those discussed in
Tuesday's ruling, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein Wednesday reiterated his
confidence in the strength of the Sherman Act case and stressed
that it was distinct from the narrower dispute that prompted
Tuesday's ruling, spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.
</P>
<P>
   New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, among the leaders of a
parallel effort by 20 states and the District of Columbia, took a
similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a substantial development,'' Vacco spokeswoman
Mollie Conkey said. ``But we really believe it will not have a
significant impact on our case ... it isn't affecting anything
we're doing, as far as forging ahead toward the Sept. 8 trial
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Key competitors of Microsoft tried to hammer home those points.
One, Oracle Corp. chairman Larry Ellison, dismissed the ruling as
``a little tactical decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision came in a dispute that began last fall when
the Justice Department accused Microsoft of violating a 1995
consent decree by ``tying'' its Internet browser software to its
Windows operating system. Computer makers had no real alternative
to Windows, the government said, so tying the products together
amounted to an abuse of monopoly power. Microsoft said it had
``integrated'' the two products to better serve consumers, as the
consent decree specifically allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled on Tuesday that U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson had made both procedural and substantive
errors in December when he referred the case to a special master
and ordered Microsoft to offer computer makers a browserless
version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The panel looked closely at the integration issue and said that
what Microsoft had done appeared not to violate the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, it also examined the integration issue in light
of antitrust law and made numerous points that many observers read
as undermining the broader case as well.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agreed. Buoyed both by the ruling and
today's retail release of Windows 98, the latest upgrade to
Microsoft's pervasive operating system for desktop computers, they
bid the company's shares to a record high for the second straight
day.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Wednesday at 104 15/16, up more than 9 percent
from Monday's closing price of 95 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newer lawsuit's allegations are claims that Microsoft
abuses its Windows monopoly by denying computer makers
opportunities to customize their products and by driving bargains
with online content providers and Internet service providers that
squeeze out competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists it has done nothing wrong, but has nonetheless
granted some business partners more leeway in the last few months
in the face of mounting legal and political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling prompted speculation that Microsoft could
reassert its hard-nosed attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But Dataquest analyst Chris LeTocq considers that unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Microsoft realizes those issues are still on the
table,'' LeTocq said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts suggested it would risk squandering the strategic
and public relations gains made with Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, asked why the company's business practices should still
be litigated if Microsoft has already eased its stance, said the
lawsuit could both clarify what the company had actually done and
impose enforceable restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we believe that Microsoft has eased contractual
restrictions on Internet Service Providers and online providers as
a result of the states' and Department of Justice's investigations,
it is not clear how far Microsoft's changes actually go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additionally, absent an injunction, it is possible for
Microsoft to revert to its former practices if the investigation or
litigation is terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many observers agreed with Giga Information Group analyst
Rob Enderle that the appellate ruling undercuts one of the pillars
of the government's case, an argument without which ``it's hard to
justify a federal case of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors haven't yet found a ``smoking gun'' in the case
_ such as evidence of harm to consumers, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a lot of allegations, some hearsay and some
documentation,'' he said, ``but almost a complete lack of credible,
independent witnesses.''

QUEENS FIRE DISRUPTS NEIGHBORHOOD OF SMALL SHOPS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph Palmiotto stood outside his water-damaged
insurance agency with worry etched into his face _ not for his own
losses but for those of the six shopkeepers to the south whose
livelihoods were destroyed by fire early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problems are minor by comparison,'' he said, almost
embarrassed by his relative good fortune. ``These people are my
family,'' he said of his neighbors. ``I get goose bumps just
thinking about what they're going through right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-alarm fire destroyed the six stores and caused heavy
water damage in Palmiotto's shop and two other businesses along the
retail strip at the intersection of Francis Lewis Boulevard and
26th Avenue in Whitestone, Queens. It took four hours and more than
200 firefighters to put out the fire, which began at about 3 a.m.
and left seven firefighters with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The only fatality was Ziggy, a parrot at the Pet Doctor, a
grooming and boarding shop for pets, but the fire did immeasurable
damage to a small but bustling strip where the atmosphere is more
small town than big city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Miracle Mile,'' Palmiotti said. ``This is
working people and these are our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials were unsure where or how the fire started, but
they said it raced quickly up the street through the one-story
shops' cocklofts _ the space between the ceiling and the roof _
until a fire wall on the north side of the local Chinese takeout
restaurant stopped it from spreading further.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses that were destroyed were the Chinese takeout
restaurant, run by a man everybody knew as Mr. Wong; Murder Ink, a
tattoo parlor that opened just six months ago; a baseball card
shop; the pet grooming store; Egizia Tile, which moved to the block
from another spot in Whitestone just about a year ago, and Il
Mercantino, a corner grocery, the sort of convenient focal point of
neighborhood traffic where folks would stop to pick up a quart of
milk on the way home.
</P>
<P>
   The three businesses that suffered water damage were Palmiotti's
insurance business; D'Elar Jewelers, which has been in the
neighborhood as long as anyone can remember, and the Candy Store,
which is actually a store that serves other neighborhood needs _
children run in for a candy bar, and adults with hopes of someday
hitting it big pick up their daily lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to go somewhere else to get my numbers,''
said an elderly man who would give his name only as Nicky.
</P>
<P>
   Last names are often an afterthought in the neighborhood strip,
a place where everybody is known only by a first name. Paul at the
paint store on the other side of the street offered space in his
store to anybody who needed to make phone calls. Grace Ann at the
beauty parlor across the street took people in for coffee. And
everybody was worried about Maria Nicolosi, the tile store
operator, who is practically an institution in Whitestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Maria for many, many years,'' said Anita Deklich, a
Whitestone resident who was on her way to Il Mercantino Wednesday
morning for groceries when she saw the fire's devastation.
``Everybody knows her. I got all my tile for my kitchen and my
bathrooms, and all my friends did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Staring at the empty shell of Mrs. Nicolosi's tile store, Mrs.
Deklich was saddened. ``It gives you a real sad feeling to see
because it's not just about rebuilding, it's about people out of
work,'' she said. ``How is she going to pay her bills?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nicolosi's daughter, Maria Rosa Nicolosi, said her mother
has had the tile business for more than 21 years. Sitting in her
own shop, Total Impact, a cellular phone and pager store in the
next block, she said she, too, was concerned about her mother.
``We've kept her home because it's going to be devastating to
her,'' she said. ``We're not letting her see the damage, not until
she's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was also worried about Richard Belner, the operator
of the Pet Doctor. ``I love Richie,'' she said. ``He's always been
there for my mother, helping her open the gates in the morning. Any
time he could he'd lend a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Belner was visibly shaken by the loss of his business and the
death of Ziggy. ``He was an African gray parrot and he had a
200-word vocabulary and he would give commands to a pet Rottweiler
that he used to sleep on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the landlord, who owns the entire strip of stores and
carried insurance, had already promised to rebuild. ``Hopefully,
everything will be replaced in six months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of neighbors stopped by to check on Concetta Insalata,
an 85-year-old Italian immigrant who has lived in the two-story
home next to Il Mercantino since 1948. Mrs. Insalata was fine, but
smoke permeated her home, and water had poured into her house and
was still coming out her light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little upset,'' she said, because she will have to move
in with her 67-year-old son who lives across the street. But she
was even more concerned that she wouldn't be able to shop at the
corner store for a while and instead would have to rely on her son
to drive her to a supermarket a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very bad, what do you think?'' she said.

AT&AMP;T TO ACQUIRE TCI, NATION'S SECOND BIGGEST CABLE PROVIDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's formal announcement Wednesday that it had agreed to
acquire TCI, the nation's the second biggest cable company, drew an
initially positive response from government regulators but
ambivalence on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for $31.8 billion in stock is the most ambitious
product yet of the 1996 deregulation of the telecommunications
industry by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they wanted to begin selling digital
phone and data service over the cable system by the end of next
year but would not commit to a firm timetable on that. The
companies said they would begin to bundle and jointly market each
other's existing services as soon as possible, even before the deal
closes.
</P>
<P>
   The hectic pace of communications mergers has raised hackles on
Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission. But the
commission's chairman, William Kennard, approached the AT&AMP;T
announcement with an encouraging attitude on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies bring some synergies that are quite
compelling,'' he said in an interview. ``They're not direct
head-to-head competitors but both of them have said in the past
that they want to offer a package of services to consumers. If
through the combination they are able to bundle services and be
more competitive with the incumbent providers, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors were less enthusiastic. AT&AMP;T's shares fell $5.375
Wednesday, to $60, on fears that the company's stock would be
diluted in the deal and on concerns that AT&AMP;T may be moving rashly.
Investors were also turned off by the complexity of the deal and by
the fact that many financial details remained undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will assume TCI's debt of about $11 billion and will pay
$5.5 billion in cash to repurchase shares it issued to TCI in a
previous transaction. AT&AMP;T will also acquire TCI's interest in a
venture that delivers Internet data over television cables. That
gives the deal a total value of about $48.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combining AT&AMP;T's financial muscle and nation-spanning
communications network with TCI's wires into millions of homes
would create a communications behemoth with a reach unrivaled since
AT&AMP;T spun off its local phone operations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, behemoths in general are not what they used to be in
the communications industry. Since the Telecommunications Act of
1996 was signed two years ago, huge mergers have become almost
common in the industry, with the seven Bell local phone companies
agreeing to become four and MCI Communications Corp. making a deal
to be acquired by Worldcom Inc. for $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal between AT&AMP;T and TCI could be the first to make a
concrete difference in how everyday consumers purchase and use
communications services. By giving AT&AMP;T an electronic path into
millions of homes and apartments, the acquisition could create
vibrant competition in the market for local telephone service for
the first time since AT&AMP;T's predecessor was led by Alexander Graham
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   TCI and its affiliates have run wires past about a third of the
nation's households. So even after acquiring the cable giant, AT&AMP;T
would not have a clear path into the local market for most of the
nation's consumers. And it is not entirely clear how difficult and
expensive it will be to adapt TCI's cable networks, which are
generally designed to transmit information in only one direction,
for use in two-way data and voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what C. Michael Armstrong, who took over as AT&AMP;T's
chairman just last November, intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't deliver on the promise of the telecom act of
'96, I've just missed my bet,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
Armstrong said he was sending a message to the Bell companies,
which dominate the local phone business: ``We intend to show up.
Also, many in Washington had some doubt that AT&AMP;T was serious about
pursuing the $110 billion local exchange business, and this mutes
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the FCC, Kennard added that his review would hinge on the
details of the companies' plans, which he had not yet seen. But his
positive comments were very different from the reaction AT&AMP;T
received the last time it tried to break into local markets through
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   After news emerged last summer that AT&AMP;T was negotiating to
acquire SBC Communications, the Bell company that provides local
phone service in much of the West, Reed Hundt, then the
commission's chairman, called such a deal ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI had a preliminary agreement to be acquired by Bell Atlantic
Corp. in 1993, but those talks fell apart amid antitrust concerns.
The two common communications pipelines into homes are the phone
wire and the cable television wire. By acquiring TCI, Bell Atlantic
would have eliminated a potential competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has minimal presence in local markets, and by acquiring
TCI it could potentially become a more formidable competitor
against its former subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group, said the deal held
promise but added a note of skepticism about AT&AMP;T's intentions of
competing for local phone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deal that is the make-it-or-break-it for the
telecom act,'' he said. ``This is the first proposal for
cross-industry competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Using industry shorthand for telephone calls, he added: ``Every
effort to use the cable wire for telephony has been less than
successful. I'm concerned that AT&AMP;T maybe is buying the cable cash
cow and milking it for profits and hoping _ hoping _ that it can be
used for telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI is in the first phase of a $1.7 billion project to upgrade
its networks to offer advanced service. But Malone said that TCI
had little chance to buy the asset it needs most for the future: a
widely recognized brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a strong, well-established communications brand our
penetration with these sorts of services would be adversely
affected,'' Malone said. ``It would be virtually impossible for my
company to construct a brand on our own to enter that space.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why all TCI services will be sold under the AT&AMP;T name.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, holders of TCI Series A stock would
receive .7757 shares of AT&AMP;T. Holders of the cable companies'
Series B stock, including Malone, would receive .8533 shares of
AT&AMP;T stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T expects to finish the deal in the first half next year. The
company said the acquisition would dilute its earnings for the
first two years after the deal's completion and add to its earnings
after that.

<P>
   Malone would join AT&AMP;T's board and remain chairman of Liberty
Media, TCI's programming wing, which would remain under his control
even as its stock became a so-called tracking stock of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would fold TCI's cable assets into its consumer business
and spin off that unit as another tracking stock. John Zeglis,
AT&AMP;T's president, would become chairman of the consumer unit while
Leo Hindery, TCI's president, would become the unit's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong would remain at the helm of the AT&AMP;T parent company,
which would retain the company's network operation and the units
that sell services to business customers and other communications
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a AT&AMP;T and TCI combination started last November
when Armstrong visited Malone to discuss ways the two companies
could work together, the two men said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies began final negotiations just last Tuesday,
they said. Several days ago, a small team of executives from both
companies holed up with their advisers to hammer out the details of
an agreement, said a person close to those talks. By Monday,
Armstrong and Malone were spending long hours at the offices of
AT&AMP;T's law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, in face-to-face
meetings hashing out the final details.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month AT&AMP;T held preliminary discussions with
America Online Inc., the No. 1 provider of access to cyberspace,
about a merger between the two companies, but America Online was
not interested in such a deal.

OPEC AGREES TO CURB OIL OUTPUT TO FORCE PRICES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Overcoming a serious political dispute that
split the Iranian delegation and threatened the final agreement,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced late
Wednesday that it planned to reduce its oil production by more than
1.3 million barrels a day, or nearly 5 percent, in the latest
attempt to push up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 members of OPEC and other producers have been facing a
severe crisis since oil prices began a sharp decline in November,
falling below $12 a barrel last week to the lowest level in more
than a decade. Two earlier moves to reduce production, including
sharp cutbacks pledged in March, have failed to keep prices from
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated agreement was announced at the meeting of
OPEC oil ministers here near the close of the oil markets in New
York on Wednesday. The dispute involving Iran had sent oil prices
dropping during the day, wiping out an early rally in European
markets after reports that a deal was imminent. But prices ended
the day little changed, with crude oil for August delivery settling
up 8 cents, at $14.60 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The split among the the Iranians, as well as OPEC's reputation
for being unable to maintain production cutbacks, left some experts
questioning how long the agreement would hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fragile agreement by its very nature, as it depends on
the pledge of each country to cut its production,'' said Fadhil
Chalabi, a former undersecretary of OPEC. He added that some
countries might once again be tempted to increase production if
prices rise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deal was nearly scuttled early Wednesday evening, shortly
before it was first to have been announced, when Iranian Oil
Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who represents the moderate views of
President Mohammad Khatami, engaged in a public dispute with
Kazempour Ardebilli, a senior figure in the Iranian government who
tends to reflect the views of the Revolutionary Guards and other
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials argued loudly over who had the authority to
speak for Iran during the final negotiations over the
oil-production accord. Several OPEC oil ministers who attended that
meeting said privately afterward that they feared the dispute would
deflate any rally in oil prices the agreement might otherwise have
brought.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the session, according to several officials
who were present, Nigerian Oil Minister Don Etete raised his
walking stick in anger at the two Iranian officials, proclaiming
`'this is no way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two Iranians and several oil ministers stormed
out of the closed-door meeting, and OPEC was forced to delay the
announcement of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a senior member of the Iranian delegation disagrees with
his minister publicly, it poses a big question mark about what is
happening there,'' a senior Arab delegate said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Can you imagine what it would be like if
in our delegation the minister and the deputy minister argued over
who speaks for the country?''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said there were some benefits from bringing
the Iranian political dispute out into the open. ``It is good that
a misunderstanding has been aired here because last time when we
here in March, we left with two different Iranian interpretations
of a deal,'' said former Algerian Oil Minister Nordine
Ait-Laoussine, who is a senior adviser to his country's OPEC
delegation. ``This time, we are all clear as to where Iran
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing this time to cut their daily oil output by 1.3
million barrels, the 11 members of OPEC have pledged since March to
remove a total of about 2.6 million barrels a day from the market.
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC, which controls about 40 percent of the world's oil
production, can live up to those commitments, it could
significantly reduce the excess supplies of crude oil that have
sent prices plunging. But too often, oil producers both in and
outside OPEC have failed to meet all their pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Late in March, for instance, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, with
Mexico helping as an intermediary, led a coalition of oil exporters
that agreed to cut oil output by 1.7 million barrels a day. But
less than 1 million barrels is estimated to have actually been
taken out of production, and oil prices, which initially rallied,
resumed their decline.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a number of these countries have agreed to
cut a further total of 740,000 barrels, starting on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The production cutbacks announced by OPEC on Wednesday will
expand on the reductions planned for July 1 by more than 600,000
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest sacrifice in production is to come from Saudi
Arabia, which plans to reduce its output by 425,000 barrels a day,
beginning July 1. Venezuela promised to cut its oil output by
325,000 barrels, and the United Arab Emirates, by 100,000 barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
   After much negotiation, Iran agreed to cut back production
65,000 barrels a day instead of OPEC's request for a 95,000-barrel
cutback.
</P>
<P>
   Ardebilli, who is an adviser to Iran's foreign minister and the
oil minister as well as Iran's governor on the OPEC board, insisted
on the smaller cut, saying this quantity was what his government
had authorized. But Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, said he
would agree to a larger cut.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Arab official said the differences in these Iranian
positions reflected concerns over the rising production of oil by
Iraq, Iran's rival and wartime enemy in the 1980s. Over the last
year, the Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein has raised
its production of oil with United Nations permission to 2.2 million
barrels a day, of which it exports 1.7 million barrels, crowding
Iranian and Saudi oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   It does so under a food-for-oil agreement worked out by its
representatives with the United Nations, and if that production
should continue to expand, Iraq might reclaim its position as
OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, passing the
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the hard-liners in Tehran have insisted on
giving as little as possible. But Khatami's government, which is
eager to improve ties with the rest of the world, insisted on more
cooperation. Both tendencies are represented in Iran's OPEC
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   A number of non-OPEC countries that attended the meeting as
observers, including representatives of Mexico, Russia, Norway and
Oman, have made some production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, a non-OPEC member that reduced its output by 100,000
barrels a day at the beginning of April, plans to cut another
100,000 in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Norway, which has cut 100,000 barrels a day, has no plans
for further reductions. Russia pledged reductions this year of
80,000 barrels a day, and Oman offered a 50,000 barrel-a-day cut.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC officials acknowledged that it would take a while for the
market to verify that these pledges had ben fulfilled. And, there
is concern here that the Asian economic crisis, which has removed
about 1 million barrels a day of oil in demand, could grow worse,
making further production cuts necessary.

CLIPPERS SELECT OLOWOKANDI WITH FIRST PICK IN NBA DRAFT  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ His skill was hard to gauge
because he has played less than 55 games in his life. But his size
_ 7 feet 1 inch, 265 pounds _ made it impossible for the Los
Angeles Clippers to stubbornly choose a small point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Amid trade speculation that he might be dealt, Michael
Olowokandi of the University of Pacific was selected No. 1 by the
Clippers in the National Basketball Association draft at G.M. Place
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my hat on,'' the Nigerian-born Olowokandi said,
donning his Clippers cap. ``But it's on a little loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi becomes the first player drafted from Pacific since
John Gianelli, who played on the Knicks' 1973 championship team,
was taken by the Houston Rockets in the second round of the 1972
draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Grizzlies took Mike Bibby with the No. 2 pick and
were also said to be entertaining offers for the 6-1 guard. Denver
became one of several teams to pass on Kansas swingman Paul Pierce,
who fell to No. 10 into the laps of the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Nuggets took his teammate, power forward Raef
LaFrentz at No. 3. The Toronto Raptors selected North Carolina's
Antawn Jamison with the fourth pick and the Golden State Warriors
chose his Tar Heel teammate Vince Carter with the fifth pick. But
the Raptors, knowing the Warriors wanted Jamison all along, then
traded Jamison for Carter plus cash considerations to Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Robert (Tractor) Traylor, Michigan's trimmed down 6-7, 284-pound
forward, was taken sixth by the Dallas Mavericks and the Florida
point guard Jason Williams was selected seventh by the Sacramento
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took 19-year-old St. Louis shooting guard Larry
Hughes with the eighth pick and Milwaukee chose the German 6-11
forward Dirk Nowitzki at No. 9. Another rumored deal involved the
Bucks sending Nowitzki and their 19th pick to the Mavericks for
Traylor, but no announcements were made midway through the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   While Pierce tumbling out of the top five was surprising,
nothing was more intriguing than who would go No. 1 and why leading
up to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby was projected as the first pick for the last month until
the Clippers' phone began ringing incessantly about Olowokandi, who
learned the game in relative obscurity the past three years at
little-known University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's agent, David Falk, was so confident his client would go
No. 1 he only had the Arizona guard work out for the Clippers. But
Falk began to sweat on Tuesday, flying to Los Angeles to meet with
Clippers owner Donald Sterling with the notion of pleading Bibby's
case as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to give my opinion I think it would be because
Vancouver got a lot of offers from veteran teams who wanted to
trade up and get me, and they figured they could keep me and get
something better later on,'' Olowokandi said, reasoning why he was
taken No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Elgin Baylor said,'' he added of the Clippers' general
manager, ``there is a lack of available centers in the league right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi is the second straight center and college senior to
be taken with No. 1 overall pick, following Tim Duncan's selection
by San Antonio last season.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, meanwhile, got a rousing ovation from the Vancouver fans
as he stepped to the podium. Asked how he felt to be drafted by a
team he never worked out for, he smiled and said, ``It makes me
feel wanted, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Through trades, Orlando and Houston controlled the middle of the
draft. The Magic and Rockets had three picks apiece between Nos. 12
through 18. Orlando used its first two picks on big men - Utah's
6-11 Michael Doleac and Nevada Las-Vegas' Keon Clark, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 13 picks, not a single high school player was
chosen. Al Harrington, the 6-9 center from St. Patrick's High
School in Elizabeth, N.J., was expected to be chosen near the end
of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Parade Magazine's National Player of the Year, Rashard Lewis of
Alief Elsik High School in Alief, Texas, was also expected to be
taken in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rumor that Olowokandi would be dealt to Phoenix in a
three-way deal involving Minnesota's Stephon Marbury and the Suns'
Steve Nash. In such a scenario, the London-bred post prodigy would
go to the Suns. Phoenix would send Nash to Minnesota, who would
move Marbury to the Clippers to complete a deal and add spice to
what began as one of the blandest draft days in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves shot down the deal, and there was no immediate
indications from the Clippers that they would trade Olowokandi.
Marbury would be a free agent next season, and the thinking was
that Minnesota would not be able to pay the point guard a contract
worth more than $100 million after committing $126 million to Kevin
Garnett.

A HITCH IN THE AT&AMP;T-TCI HITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: AT&AMP;T-TCI, AT&AMP;T-ASSESS, AT&AMP;T-FCC, AT&AMP;T-EXECS)

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Widows and orphans, hold onto your hats.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the merger between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc.,
millions of AT&AMP;T shareholders, many of them individual investors
who own the stock for its relative safety and high dividend yield,
are about to become holders of one of Wall Street's sexiest and
most complex inventions, so-called tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   True, AT&AMP;T's stock _ which was divided into long-distance and
local operating companies in the 1984 breakup and then split three
ways more than two years ago o create separate equipment, phone
and computer companies _ is no longer held mostly by the proverbial
widows and orphans of old. But its shareholders, even the most
sophisticated among them, will be puzzling over this latest deal
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   What is a tracking stock? It is a security typically issued by a
large conglomerate with interests in a wide variety of businesses.
Because the security is designed to track a narrow segment of the
company's far-flung operations, issuing it is a good way for a
company to put a discrete market value on those operations alone.
The stocks are likewise bought by investors interested in whatever
aspect of the business the stock tracks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a big difference between common stocks and tracking
stocks, however. In most cases, ownership of tracking shares does
not represent direct ownership of the business' underlying assets,
as common stock ownership does.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying assets are still owned by the issuing company,
but in a tracking stock the issuing company agrees to parcel out
the economics of the business, as it were, giving its shareholders
a stake in the entire operation while its tracking stockholders can
concentrate their bet.
</P>
<P>
   Although tracking stocks have been around for about 15 years,
only about 15 companies in the United States have issued them.
These companies range from household names such as General Motors,
USX and Georgia-Pacific to smaller companies like Seagull Energy,
the electronics retailer Circuit City and Genzyme Corp., a
biotechnology concern.
</P>
<P>
   Why is staid AT&AMP;T going the tracking stock route? The heads of
both companies are big believers in the concept. John Malone,
chairman of TCI, has a tracking stock, called Liberty Media Group,
that represents the performance of the company's cable programming.
And C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chief executive, came from GM's
Hughes Electronics division and is comfortable with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   By issuing a tracking stock, AT&AMP;T can accomplish objectives
generally achieved in a corporate spinoff without incurring any of
the negatives, such as having to meet some fairly stringent tax law
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   To make a spinoff tax-free to shareholders, for instance, the
parent company would be prohibited by the Internal Revenue Service
from having dealings with the new company once a spinoff had taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also gives up some of the advantages of a clean
spinoff, which means investors are not likely to place as much
value on the tracking stock as they would on a new spinoff owning
the same assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People recognize that a tracking stock is not the same as
outright ownership, so they do trade at some discount'' to what
they would have fetched in a spinoff, said Robert Willens, a tax
and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company gains a lot from issuing a tracking stock.
Once a company has issued one, it can count on being able to raise
capital at the higher valuations that it expects investors to
assign to that particular aspect of the company's business. It can
use that money for either acquisitions or capital investments in
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, for example, was the first company to float a
tracking stock. It issued two, one to cover its now-divested
Electronic Data Systems subsidiary (so-called ``E'' shares) and
another (``H'' shares) to track its Hughes Electronics division.
</P>
<P>
   Both were higher-growth businesses than GM's more predominant
automotive operations, and so investors were more eager to own
them. GM's ``H'' stock, for example, now trades at around 36 times
what Hughes Electronics earned over the last 12 months, while GM
trades at a price/earnings multiple of 8.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the AT&AMP;T merger, the company will offer
0.7757 share of its common stock for each share of TCI Group series
A and 0.8533 share of AT&AMP;T for each share of TCI's series B stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T expects to issue 440 million shares in the transaction. The
existing TCI tracking stock, in a modified form, will be reissued
by AT&AMP;T and therefore will remain as a separate, publicly traded
security after the merger. Malone holds a controlling interest in
Liberty Media Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although AT&AMP;T will acquire title to Liberty Media Group in the
deal, it has agreed to pass along all the benefits of ownership to
the holders of the tracking stock. If Liberty Media Group were to
be sold, for example, all the proceeds would go to its tracking
shareholders, none to AT&AMP;T. Shareholders of AT&AMP;T will not receive
shares of Liberty Media Group as part of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T didn't stop there. The company will also issue a new
tracking stock of its own in the merger. This stock will represent
the activities of AT&AMP;T Consumer Services, a new subsidiary that
will result from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary will include AT&AMP;T's interests in residential
long-distance, wireless and Internet services and TCI's cable and
telecommunications businesses. The company expects AT&AMP;T Consumer
Services to have revenue in 1999 of $33 billion and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not included in the new AT&AMP;T tracking stock will be the products
and services AT&AMP;T offers to business customers, including Internet
access, long-distance and wireless services and high-speed data
offerings. These operations are expected to generate revenue in
1999 of at least $29 billion and earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of $12 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who own AT&AMP;T common stock will have a claim on both AT&AMP;T's
business and consumer operations, while the tracking stockholders
will trade exclusively in a piece of paper focused on the consumer
side of the business. Also excluded from the tracking stock will be
the assets of the AT&AMP;T network and AT&AMP;T's wholesale business, in
which the company generates revenue of about $2 billion selling
long-distance time on its lines in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes for one complicated deal. Indeed, confusion
surrounding the merger may have contributed to the 8 percent
decline in AT&AMP;T stock Wednesday. Tepid action in TCI Group's
shares, up $1.0625, to $39.75, also seemed to indicate investor
confusion and doubt about whether or not the deal will go through.
</P>
<P>
   The merger poses two major risks that may contribute to the
doubt. One is that federal regulators will not approve it. Another
is that TCI's chairman, Malone, will change his mind and walk away
from the proposed merger as he did five years ago when Bell
Atlantic offered almost $17 billion for TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Are tracking stocks riskier than investing in the parent
company? Only in the sense that their lack of diversification makes
a bet that much more narrowly placed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, CMS Energy Group, a gas and electric utility and
energy concern in Dearborn, Mich., has a tracking stock, CPG, that
reflects the performance of its gas distribution subsidiary. If gas
prices plunged, the tracking shares would probably be hurt more
than the shares of the more diversified parent.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fact that tracking stocks have no assets
underlying them? This has not presented a problem to shareholders
because none of the companies that have issued these shares have
experienced financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   When can AT&AMP;T shareholders expect to get their new tracking
shares? That is unclear. According to Willens, the tax and
accounting analyst, tracking stocks are typically issued to
shareholders either in the form of a stock dividend alone or
combined with an initial public offering of the subsidiary's
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Connolly, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman, said the company had not
decided how it would get the Consumer Services tracking stock into
investors' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said that a portion will be held by the public,'' she
said, ``but we have not said how that will be achieved.'' &QL;

YESHIVA UNIVERSITY ACCUSED OF DENYING HOUSING TO GAY STUDENTS WITH
PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Canada)  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American Civil Liberties Union filed a
discrimination lawsuit Wednesday against Yeshiva University for
allegedly denying campus housing to lesbian and gay graduate
students who want to live with their domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in state court by the ACLU's Lesbian and
Gay Rights Project on behalf of two medical students, Sara Levin
and Maggie Jones, and the Einstein Association of Gays, Lesbians
and Bisexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin, 26, a third-year medical student from San Francisco,
and Ms. Jones, 23, a first-year medical student from Halifax, Nova
Scotia, both attend Yeshiva's Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in the Bronx. Each was denied shared housing with her nonstudent
partner because they are not married.

   ``I walk each day among families who fill the playground and the
courtyard in the late afternoons knowing that my family is not
entitled to the same respect,'' said Ms. Levin, speaking at a news
conference Wednesday at the ACLU's headquarters in lower Manhattan.

<P>
   Michael Adams, the ACLU's lead lawyer, said: ``New York City and
state law simply does not allow this type of discrimination against
lesbian and gay couples.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical school denied discriminating against gay and lesbian
students in a terse statement, saying ``our housing policy is
applied equally to all applicants for student housing without
regard to their sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's lawsuit seeks a reversal of Yeshiva's housing policy
and damages for emotional distress and the extra cost of housing
and commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones said that she had been fortunate to find a studio
apartment in Brooklyn for $825 a month but that comparable living
space at the university costs only $300 to $400 per month. ``In
addition,'' she said, ``I have a three-hour commute.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeshiva University provides housing for all undergraduates. Of
the university's six graduate schools, only the medical school
offers students housing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several colleges and universities, including
Stanford University and Columbia University, have granted same-sex
couples benefits already available to married students. The
University of Chicago adopted such a policy in 1993 after being
challenged by the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New
York-based national gay rights legal organization.

<P>
   Scott Emmons, a professor of molecular genetics at Einstein,
said that the medical school's faculty senate has for years
supported equal access to housing and other benefits for same-sex
domestic partners but that the administration has ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   When, as a member of the Einstein Association of Gays, Lesbians
and Bisexuals, he met with the Yeshiva president, Norman Lamm, to
discuss the issue, Emmons said Lamm told him that Yeshiva ``will
not be on the cutting edge of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamm said Wednesday he would have no comment about that meeting.

REPORT SAYS 61 STUDENTS GOT DIPLOMAS IMPROPERLY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly a quarter of the 277 students who graduated
from a Brooklyn alternative high school in 1996 and 1997 failed at
least one state test or took too few courses but received their
diplomas anyway through an elaborate extra-credit system overseen
by the school's acting principal, according to a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them even received credit for running personal errands
for administrators, trading baseball players in a rotisserie league
and answering phones at a travel agency, according to the report by
Edward Stancik, special investigator of the city schools.
</P>
<P>
   The students, all of them graduates of Senior Academy, a
mini-school within the former Eastern District High School, have
since had their diplomas rescinded and their high school
transcripts invalidated, Stancik said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are now trying to reach the 61 affected
students, some of them already in college, urging them to complete
their courses and retake tests. But so far only 14 have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik said that the acting principal at the school, Marcia
Brevot, had permitted the students to satisfy their outstanding
requirements through questionable internships (one student who
worked as a secretary at a travel agency for 12 weeks received
credits in English, social studies, health and music) and specially
designed courses (one course, titled ornamental horticulture,
involved the creation of centerpieces to satisfy requirements in
English, math and health).
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, Stancik said, Ms. Brevot granted a diploma to a
39-year-old former Eastern District student who had dropped out in
the 1970s, six credits shy of a diploma. Though the former student
had done no additional work, Ms. Brevot acted after the man's
sister-in-law, a leader of the parents' association at the school,
intervened on his behalf, Stancik said.
</P>
<P>
   Through her lawyer, Ms. Brevot said Wednesday night that she had
done nothing wrong and that she was being singled out only to
weaken the alternative school movement, which Schools Chancellor
Rudy Crew has sometimes criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a political hit,'' said Ms. Brevot's lawyer, Richard
Bellman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brevot, a retired Manhattan high school principal who was
working at Senior Academy as a consultant, left the school system
after her contract expired last summer. Chiara Coletti, a
spokeswoman for Crew, said that officials had decided not to renew
Ms. Brevot's contract in the spring of 1997 after questions about
student credits first surfaced. Because Ms. Brevot is no longer a
school employee, Stancik said, it does not appear she can be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they began their investigation in the
spring of 1997 and eventually determined that Ms. Brevot had set up
what was effectively an alternative credit system. The goal, they
said, was clear: to get as many students as possible at the failing
school to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state-ordered reorganization of Eastern District,
which was among the state's lowest-performing schools, Senior
Academy had already been designated to close at the end of the
current school year, and Ms. Brevot was hired as a consultant to
preside over its dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik contended that Ms. Brevot had ``relaxed the curriculum
and restructured the system of awarding credits in a manner that
made it easier for students.'' Stancik said, for example, that
students in so-called interdisciplinary courses _ like one that
replicated a sports rotisserie league, in which students bought and
sold professional players in a simulated free agent market _ could
gain credits in math and social studies, depending on their need.
</P>
<P>
   Bellman, Ms. Brevot's lawyer, said that some of the students had
been passed as a result of a ``clerical error'' and that Ms. Brevot
had written them letters instructing them that they would have to
take the regents test after all.
</P>
<P>
   Of the courses questioned by Stancik, Bellman said that the
investigator had not sought to go below the surface of the work
done. A course on how to repair and build a bicycle, for example,
which gave students credit in English, science and art, involved
the writing of reports and travel logs, as well as a cross-country
trip, Bellman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing at all wrong with that,'' he said.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook
 &HT;    By Tom Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- John Schuerholz has heard what you've heard. The
Braves are haggling with Toronto to acquire closer Randy Myers,
with Baltimore for second baseman Roberto Alomar, with Montreal for
handyman Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw them in the toilet with the rest of them,'' Schuerholz
says of the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Russ Springer to the bullpen might not be the
last adjustment the Braves make to their roster this summer, but
their general manager said Wednesday that no other deal will be
forthcoming immediately. Keep in mind that four of the six
relievers the team broke spring camp with _ Adam Butler, Brian
Edmondson, Alan Embree and Mark Wohlers _ are not with the team
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our bullpen for now. Learn to love it,'' Schuerholz
said. ``These are our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Springer deal came together gradually, after a series of
scouting reports all corroborated that Springer was pitching as
effectively as he ever had in his career. His arrival, in addition
to the eventual return of Wohlers, is all the club has planned for
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised between now and the end of the season
(that) we made a couple more moves to strengthen the club,''
Schuerholz said. ``I have no idea what they'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief for Smoltz?
</P>
<P>
   Although John Smoltz was receptive to the suggestion that he
move to the bullpen with the possibility of closing, management is
not exploring the idea. In fact, management doesn't think much of
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Schuerholz said. ``(Smoltz) is a very
valuable starter, and who knows how any of us think if it becomes
an emergency situation? I know John would be willing to do
something like that, but would it make sense to diminish a strong
starting staff to end up with a strong closer? I don't think so. I
don't think it would make sense, especially when we think Mark
Wohlers can come back. There's no reason to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The club receives daily reports on Wohlers from special
assistant Guy Hansen, who is working at the club's training complex
in Orlando with Wohlers. He is working on altering his windup, has
yet to face any hitters and might not do so until he is sent to
Class AAA Richmond at a date not yet determined.
</P>
<P>
   Relief for Capitol Avenue
</P>
<P>
   Pregame traffic was predictably thick, but access to the Braves
parking lots was somewhat smoother after the Braves and Atlanta
police reached an agreement. Police restored the two-lane turn
policy into the color-coded lots after meeting with team officials
Tuesday. Over the previous homestand, access to the lots had been
restricted to one lane, causing tie-ups of 30 minuter or more just
to park.
</P>
<P>
   Now starting
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga was a late scratch from the lineup because of a
stiff back, and was replaced by Ryan Klesko, who made his first
start of the year at first base. Galarraga, who went hitless in
eight at-bats in New York, missed his first start as a Brave.
Klesko, whose last start at first base came July 23 last season in
Chicago (0-for-4), now has logged 43 games at first and entered the
game with two errors in 160 total chances. Taking Klesko's place in
left field was Curtis Pride, making his eighth start.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle, originally set to appear in this afternoon's
Braves Foundation luncheon at the Hard Rock Cafe, has had to
cancel, because he is the team's starter tonight. Scheduled to
appear in his place are Klesko, Andruw Jones, Michael Tucker and
Gerald Williams. Tickets are $20, and all proceeds benefit the
Braves Foundation. ... Scott Boras, the most controversial agent in
baseball, will be Fastball's guest, today from 3-4 p.m. He will
appear at Fastball's Dugout Chatter. ... The Braves sold ticket No.
3 million this week. The team drew nearly 3.5 million last year.

 &HT;    Springer could get call to close
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Russ Springer wants to make one thing clear. He's no
miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at myself as a setup guy,'' said the newest edition
to the Braves bullpen. ``I think every reliever at some point of
his career wants to be a closer. I think I can close games, but the
optimum thing for this club would be for Mark Wohlers to come back
and be at his best.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no guarantee that will happen, and Springer is the
freshest arm in what has been a erratic bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will get right in the thick of things,'' said pitching
coach Leo Mazzone of Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Traded for left-hander Alan Embree, the 29-year-old right-hander
comes to the Braves from expansion Arizona with a career 14-26
record and 5.24 ERA in 199 games. He was 4-3 with a 4.13 ERA with
the Diamondbacks this season. But he struck out 37 in 32 2/3
innings and the Braves desperately need a reliever that can come in
with runners in scoring position and get a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very live arm,'' Mazzone said. ``This could turn out
to be real good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz said, ``I had three different
scouts recommend Russ after they saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Braves are unsure what role Springer will have.
With Wohlers down in the rookie league trying to find his control,
the Braves are going bullpen by committee and, for now, Springer
could find himself in a few save situations. Last year when he was
with Houston, Springer found himself closing games in September
when closer Paul Wagner was struggling. He responded with three
saves in four opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby (Cox) told me to be ready any time the phone rings down
in the pen,'' Springer said. ``It could be to come in and get (out)
batter in the sixth, or in the seventh, eighth or ninth. I'm not
looking to come in here and become the big guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer throws four pitches _ fastball, curve, a cut fastball
and forkball, using the latter two pitches mainly against
left-handed hitters. Interestingly, his first appearance in a
Braves uniform might come against the team he started with, having
been a seventh-round pick of the Yankees in the 1989 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough getting traded during the middle of the season,''
he said. ``I liked Arizona. They are a class organization. But
other than that, you take care of your family first and then your
second priority is to win. I will get that chance here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wohlers works out in Orlando and may pitch in an
intersquad this weekend. ``He's just pitching on the side right now
and trying to get his mechanics sound,'' Schuerholz said.

 &HT;    Safety Is Independence Day Message
 &HT;    By Harry Thomas
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ With the impending arrival of Independence Day set
against a backdrop of continued drought, a parched Central Texas
istaking precautions to celebrate safely. Fire control officials at
the city and county levels are on high alert as the traditionally
fireworks-laden holiday in the baked-dry area approaches. Fireworks
bans are being strictly enforced, officials said. ``We understand
that fireworks are a traditional part of the Fourth of July
holiday, but the danger is simply too great,'' said Austin Fire
Chief Gary Warren. ``The fun. . .is not worth the risk to yourself,
your home or your neighbor's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, sparklers are the one exception to the city's ban on
fireworks, but this year even sparklers are off limits. Anyone
possessing or using any type of fireworks within the city limits
faces a $248 fine.
</P>
<P>
   County fireworks merchants are echoing Warren's calls for
caution. The dry conditions in Bastrop and Travis Counties have
caused county officials to team up with fireworks wholesalers and
distributors to encourage a voluntary no-sale, no-use ordinance on
aerial and missile style fireworks. ``They're a good portion of our
business,'' said Chester Davis, owner of American Fireworks in
Bastrop. ``But we know it's dry. We just want people to have a safe
and happy Fourth _ without fires.'' Missiles and aerials are the
most common causes of fireworks-related grass fires because they
launch after ignition, said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock Fire Department battled a fire early Tuesday
night off of McNeil Road in the Robinson Ranch area that was caused
by a bottle rocket, the department said. Between 2 1/2 and 3 acres
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors appeared to be complying with the voluntary ban
Wednesday. Several fireworks booths located at Austin's city limits
did not have aerials or missiles on display.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the voluntary ban and officials urging caution,
fireworks merchants remained enthusiastic about seasonal sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth is on a Saturday this year and we're planning on
making up sales because of that,'' said Buddy Stratton, the
operator of an American Fireworks Factory Outlet just outside the
city limits on U.S. 290 West. ``Lots of people are off all weekend,
so they buy more of the bigger fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratton said that between 10 and 20 percent of his business
typically comes from sales of aerials and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks from a passing Union Pacific train caused at least eight
grass fires Wednesday afternoon along the train tracks on the
eastern side of Mo-Pac from south of Northland Drive to Steck
Avenue, said Klint Cummings, a battalion chief for the Austin Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from the fires billowed onto the highway and caused a
collision between an 18-wheeler and a car on the northbound Mo-Pac
overpass at Northland Drive, Cummings said. No injuries were
reported. The fire department was notified about the fires at 4:34
p.m. and had them under control in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A southeast wind kept the flames from spreading to nearby
houses, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service has recorded over 3,000 fires in the state
from May 1 to June 20. Approximately 250 homes were threatened by
fires in Jeff Davis County last weekend. Five wildfires have
charred at least about 5,000 acres in the Panhandle.

SAKS FIFTH AVENUE SAID TO BE FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: This was budgeted earlier as RETAIL-ACQUIRE)  
(lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saks Fifth Avenue, one of New York's oldest and most
esteemed names in retailing, is on the selling block, executives
who have been briefed on the effort said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The majority owner of the 97-store Saks, Investcorp
International, a Bahrain-based investment bank, has richly profited
from investing in other luxury retailers like Tiffany and Gucci and
selling them to the public. The company has been seeking a similar
way to profit from Saks.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers tend to fetch one to 1.5 times revenue, which would
mean Saks could be priced at between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Saks was bought by Investcorp in 1990 for $1.6 billion, and the
company sold 20 percent of Saks to the public in 1995 for $25 a
share, or $425 million. Although the stock soared in its early days
of trading, it has since failed to post the kinds of returns that
Investcorp enjoyed with Tiffany &AMP; Co. and that Gucci Group rewarded
Investcorp with. On Wednesday, shares of Saks closed at $24.825,
down 43.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Investcorp has a longstanding practice of acquiring companies,
providing capital and other resources for growth and then selling
them in the public marketplace or to private investors. But the
decision to sell Saks was initiated by the retailer's board, the
executives who have been briefed on the matter said. The board has
retained outside investment bankers to assist with a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Saks and Investcorp declined to comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, Saks has performed well. The company's
earnings rose 95 percent in its last fiscal year, to $55.8 million
on sales of $2.2 billion. Sales have been growing at a compound
rate of 15.6 percent since 1994. And sales at stores open at least
one year, the best measure of a retailer's health, rose 3.8 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has significantly reduced its debt load, which was a
terrible drag on it in the early part of the decade. Its most
recent quarter was especially stellar.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been stymied by inconsistent sales, especially in its
Off Fifth division, its outlet shops, where same-store sales fell
6.5 percent last year. Those weak sales, and a weakness in the
market for lower-priced apparel, known as bridge wear, pushed the
cost of goods sold up 13.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the company has a merchandising management
problem. Last fall, Rose Marie Bravo, the company's president,
resigned to become chief executive officer of Burberrys Worldwide.
The company was unable to find an adequate replacement, and chose
instead to appoint an executive vice president of merchandising,
Jeanne Daniel, from Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Saks has one of the most famous names in the universe of
retailing, and a strong crop of managers, most notably Brian
Kendrick, the company's chief operating officer, who has earned
much respect on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is: Is there a retailer left to make the
purchase? The industry has consolidated greatly over the last
decade, leaving few independent luxury chains looking to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Among its competitors, Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt
General, is an obvious candidate, as are LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis
Vuitton, the luxury holding company based in Paris that owns a
number of the high-end brands found on the store's floors, and
Dickson Poon, which is looking to have a presence in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those companies, however, have been badly hurt by Asia's
economic crisis. The closest thing Federated Department Stores has
to a Saks is Bloomingdale's; it is considerably less fancy than
Saks, which has courted an even wealthier customer base in the last
few years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, retailers are always looking for new ways to gain
economies of scale; indeed, last year Saks made a bid for Barneys
New York, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, for $290 million for the company. The offer was
rebuffed by Barney's creditors, and Saks later said it would offer
no more. LVMH and Dickson Poon also looked at Barneys last year.
</P>
<P>
   Saks was founded in 1867, and as a privately held company
operated as a division of Gimbel Bros. Inc., the now defunct
department store. In September 1924, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel
opened the landmark Fifth Avenue store, which today accounts for
roughly 20 percent of the entire company's sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Saks &AMP; Co. was acquired by BAT Industries PLC through
its acquisition of Gimbel Bros. Investcorp bought the company in
1990 from BAT.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Saks Holdings, the holding company for the retailer,
operates 41 full-line stores, five main-street stores in smaller
cities and eight small stores catering to resort regions. Its
off-price store, Off Fifth, is in 43 locations.
</P>
<P>
   In its 131 years, Saks has seen its competitors fade away. In
New York City, the retail capital of the world, there is no B.
Altman anymore. There is no Bonwit Teller. And Henri Bendel is a
shadow of its former self. Saks is in many ways in a rarefied class
by itself.

IMMIGRATION HEARINGS POSTPONED FOR CHINESE MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ Honoring a government request for more time to
investigate how 23 Chinese men illegally landed on a New Jersey
beach last month, two immigration judges postponed hearings
Wednesday on whether the men should be released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Feldman, an assistant district counsel for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, said that agency investigators would
need two more weeks to gauge whether any of the 23 would be needed
as witnesses in a criminal investigation into human smuggling. Bond
hearings had been scheduled for about half the immigrants
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a concern for the safety of the individuals,''
Ms. Feldman said, suggesting that they might be harmed by the
smugglers if they were released.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers did not oppose the motion, saying it would be
pointless: government officials had already obtained court orders
to detain the 23 men as witnesses regardless of the outcome of the
bond hearings. As a result, Judges Esmeralda Cabrera and Mirlande
Tadal granted the motion, and bond hearings were set for the week
of July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Porges, a Manhattan lawyer representing all but two of
the 23 men, said he doubted that the immigrants could offer much
information about the smugglers behind their voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can describe what happened to them,'' Porges said. ``But
I doubt they can give a lot of information as to how these people
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   The postponement of the bond hearings came on a busy if
anticlimactic day in the government's case to deport the men back
to China. Among other actions, lawyers for the men submitted
several applications for political asylum, and the judges scheduled
several asylum hearings in August and September. The same routine _
delaying bond hearings and scheduling asylum hearings _ is expected
on Thursday for the rest of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday's proceedings, there had been an air of
anticipation because of the prospect that some of the 23 would be
reunited, if only briefly, with some of their relatives in the
United States. The relatives were scheduled to offer testimony to
support the men's release on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men's relatives, New York residents, remained in a
reception area all morning, outside the courtrooms. They were later
told to return in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives _ one a young man with a crew cut who spoke little
English, the other an elderly woman with the demeanor of a
concerned aunt who could only speak the Fuzhou dialect spoken by
the detainees _ politely declined to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the only public comments to date made by any of the 23 men,
one 25-year-old man from the small farming community of Minjiangko,
not far from the city of Fuzhou in Fujian province, described parts
of his journey to The New York Times last week. He said the men had
spent considerable time in a South American country, waiting with
perhaps 200 other men to make a voyage to the United States.
Newspaper reports have indicated that the country was Suriname.
</P>
<P>
   The men left South America two or three months ago, squeezing
onto a large vessel for the trip north in the Atlantic. But on May
30, after the 23 men were transferred to a smaller boat, the Oops
II, the smaller boat ran aground in dense fog near the affluent
shore town of Bay Head, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   They have since been held in a detention center here, not far
from the New Jersey Turnpike.  &QL;

WHITE HOUSE CITES `MINIMAL' DAMAGE IN LOSS OF CODED CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Wednesday tried to clarify an
intelligence assessment of damage to national security from the
disappearance of a sensitive, encoded circuit board after a failed
launch of an American communications satellite in China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials Wednesday sought to play down the
episode, saying that the Pentagon concluded that the loss of the
encoded chips would pose only ``minimal impact'' to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that the Defense
Department suspected that Chinese officials may have stolen the
militarily sensitive device, which would be a violation of an
agreement between Beijing and Washington on technology safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said Wednesday they still could not
determine if the United States had ever demanded or received an
accounting from China about the missing circuit board, which tells
an orbiting satellite which way to point to receive and transmit
signals.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said Wednesday that military
authorities responsible for preventing the transfer of sensitive
satellite technology were not alerted by military technical experts
that the circuit board was missing from control box recovered from
the wreckage until ``many months'' after the failed launch on Feb.
15, 1996. Chinese authorities barred American monitors from the
crash site for five hours, purportedly for their own safety.
</P>
<P>
   At issue now is a statement provided last week to Rep. Curt
Weldon, R-Pa., a senior member on the House National Security
Committee, by the Pentagon's National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing last week, three senior officials from the Defense,
State and Commerce departments could not answer some of the
questions Weldon asked about the failed launch, which destroyed a
$200 million satellite built by Loral Space &AMP; Communications and
Hughes Electronics. Weldon later put the questions directly to the
NSA.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-sentence response, to which Weldon referred at
another hearing of the National Security and International
Relations committees on Tuesday, the agency concluded: ``If the
encryption board was reversed-engineered, the knowledge gained
could be used to strengthen adversaries' knowledge'' of the devices
the United States uses to safeguard its communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   But after The New York Times reported this and other aspects of
the hearing in a front-page article Wednesday, the White House's
National Security Council asked the NSA and other government
agencies to provide a more detailed accounting of the missing
circuit board's significance.
</P>
<P>
   In the resulting two-page statement, which the White House
provided to reporters Wednesday, the government qualified its
original damage assessment: ``If the encryption board was
reverse-engineered at the chip level (a difficult process), one
could determine the state of our research and development
sophistication 20 years ago, and the knowledge gained could be used
to strengthen one's knowledge of communications security
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The original statement given to Weldon also said that since the
failed February 1996 launch, the NSA had ``adopted new space
encryption algorithms.'' Algorithms are the encoded set of
instructions in the circuit board.
</P>
<P>
   The revised statement added the following detail: ``The
technology and algorithms on satellites now being launched is no
longer the same as a result of the normal process of technology
upgrades. These upgrades are unrelated to the loss of the devices''
on the failed February 1996 launch.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the NSA said the agency decided in October
1995 to adopt new encryption codes as part of a regular, 20-year
upgrade schedule. The spokeswoman said new codes were not installed
on the satellite that was destroyed in February 1996, and she did
not know when the new codes were actually employed.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials blamed the super-secret National Security Agency,
the government's codemakers and codebreakers, for lacking the
political savvy to provide the more detailed answer to Weldon in
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you great confidence, doesn't it?'' said one senior
administration official, who complained that the NSA did not tell
other government agencies about the statement to Weldon.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon expressed exasperation Wednesday at the administration's
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wasn't this information made available yesterday?'' Weldon
said in an interview. ``This is a joke.'' &QL;

MAYFIELD, WALTRIP AMONG RIVETING NASCAR TALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the more compelling ``people stories'' in NASCAR Winston
Cup racing have roots in Owensboro, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Which rates as the bigger tear-jerker?
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Jeremy Mayfield's breakthrough victory Sunday at
Pocono Raceway? Or the recent resurgence of three-time series
champion Darrell Waltrip?
</P>
<P>
   There is no wrong answer here, whether you live in Owensboro or
merely appreciate the latest twists of fate emanating from NASCAR's
50th anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the first victory of his Winston Cup career,
Mayfield drove around his homegrown Owensboro hero, Waltrip, who
was leading the Pocono 500 with 21 laps remaining. Waltrip, who has
not won a Cup race since 1992, hung on for a proud sixth-place
finish after leading nine late laps.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's elder statesman at 51, Waltrip graciously joined
those congratulating Mayfield. Waltrip gave the 29-year-old
Mayfield his official blessing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident he'll be the Winston Cup champion this
year,'' Waltrip declared, a vote that should drive reigning
champion and Waltrip favorite Jeff Gordon to distraction. ``I'm
also going to pass the torch to Jeremy. He can carry the Owensboro
torch for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has been hauling the torch since 1972, the second year
of NASCAR's ``modern era.'' His Cup championships in 1981, 1982 and
1985 and 84 career victories _ the most during the modern era and
tied for third all-time with Bobby Allison _ earned Waltrip a spot
among NASCAR's 50 greatest drivers this season.
</P>
<P>
   That honor was one of the few bright recent moments for Waltrip
until he opted to sell his struggling team to Texas businessman Tim
Beverley. The deal was announced during a double-barreled news
conference at Bristol Motor Speedway in March. In addition to the
sale of his Cup and NASCAR Craftsman Truck teams to Beverley,
Waltrip and seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt spelled out
details of their relationship as teammates until the return of
injured rookie Steve Park in August.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip said then that removing the burdens of ownership would
free him to drive the wheels off of Earnhardt's Chevrolet. It would
allow the new team assembled for Park to learn various tracks and
chassis setups from an experienced driver. And the downtime would
also allow the No. 17 team owned by Beverley to assemble personnel
while hunting for almighty sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of mounting criticism from fans and news media,
Waltrip promised a win-win-win scenario. And all parties have
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My racing was terrible, and I knew it was terrible,'' said
Waltrip, who lost face with major sponsors Western Auto and Sears
DieHard in 1997. ``I felt defeated. I felt I was a loser. I came to
the conclusion the only way I could get out of this was to sell my
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see it work out and be the way I thought it would, it's
just great. Because when I walked in the door \Rat Earnhardt's
shop\S the first time, I was very skeptical what we could or could
not accomplish. I looked at it as a job. But it's been a great
relationship, a great opportunity to go out and do my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has recorded six top-20 finishes in the past seven races
_ not awesome, but decent. Before climbing into the No. 1 Pennzoil
Monte Carlo, Waltrip had not finished better than 30th in his
Chevys. He has moved from 40th in Cup points to 24th during that
span, silencing a number of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Or those whose memories date to about 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people don't appreciate what you've accomplished, or
don't know what you've accomplished _ and when people say or write
bad things about you _ it hurts,'' Waltrip said. ``I realize my
career is short. I don't have much time left. And I don't want to
live off of my past. I think I still bring an awful lot to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   And as they say in Owensboro _ just bring it on.
THE BUZZ NASCAR
</P>
<P>
   First-time Winston Cup winner Jeremy Mayfield figures he will be
walking about a foot off the ground in the garage area at Sears
Point Raceway beginning tomorrow. ``It feels really nice walking
into the garage as the points leader, so I imagine it's going to
feel pretty good walking in as a race winner,'' said Mayfield, who
won the Pocono 500 and will be the prerace focus for the Save
Mart/Kragen 350K. ``People have been great. You wouldn't believe
the telephone calls and stuff we've gotten. The Pocono race ended
about 6:30 \REDT\S Sunday night and we got home \Rto Davidson,
N.C.\S about 12:30 that same night. There were 71 messages on the
answering machine at home _ 71 messages. We're not sure if we got
more, because I think the thing got filled up. The phone rang off
the hook Monday, people calling to congratulate us.'' ... Mayfield
said that before Sunday he was getting a little tired of reading
headlines proclaiming that he was the Cup points-leader, but had
yet to win a race. ``I wanted to do something so the story was
going to have to change,'' said Mayfield, who made his 125th career
start at Pocono. ``Then I had a newspaper guy joke after the race
Sunday that the headline was going to be, `When's Jeremy going to
win again?' '' ...
</P>
<P>
   Cup regular Ken Schrader has spent the week resting in the wake
of his crash in Turn 3 at Pocono, after he was tagged by Dale
Earnhardt. Schrader reported soreness in his neck and some bruising
of his arm. He has been fitted with an electro-therapy device that
minimizes pain. Meanwhile, car owner Andy Petree, who dissed
Earnhardt's post-wreck apology, has been forced to retire the No.
33 Skoal Bandit Chevy named ``Jesse James'' because of severe
left-side damage. ...
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Jet Motorsports and new team owner Tim Beverley are
scheduled to make their Cup debut this weekend at Sonoma, Calif.
Former NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion Ron Hornaday Jr., a
three-time winner in that series this year, will drive the No. 17
NAPA Auto Parts Monte Carlo. Hornaday will work with crew chief
Phil Hammer, formerly of Hendrick Motorsports. Meanwhile, the
team's No. 17 Chevy truck will again be driven by Toby Porter in
the DieHard 200 at The Milwaukee Mile on July 4. Porter finished
23rd in the truck during the Pronto Auto Parts 400K at Texas Motor
Speedway on June 5 in Fort Worth. ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Cup regular Robby Gordon is scheduled to drive the No. 96
Caterpillar Chevrolet owned by Buz McCall at Sears Point Raceway's
road course this weekend. ``I told the team to bring a few extra
sets of wheels, because I plan to drive them off the car,'' said
Gordon, who was a bust as a rookie Cup driver for Sabco Racing last
year. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sears Point Raceway, which like TMS is owned by Speedway
Motorsports Inc., has undergone a reconfiguration since last year.
The biggest change on the course is ``The Chute,'' an 890-foot,
high-speed straightaway that connects existing turns 4 and 7 on the
road course. The reconfiguration has trimmed the course length from
2.52 miles to 1.95. But it has also increased the lap-count from 74
to 112. The race distance, which had been 300 kilometers since its
inception in 1989, has increased to 350 kilometers. Speeds from 110
mph to 120 mph were recorded in ``The Chute'' during Cup testing
May 4-6.
CART
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Championship Auto Racing Teams stars launched a
three-day Goodyear tire test _ with an aerodynamic twist _
yesterday at Michigan Speedway. Newman/Haas Racing teammates
Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi, Marlboro Team Penske's
Al Unser Jr. and Gil de Ferran of Walker Racing are scheduled to
test the new Hanford Device adopted by CART to help reduce the
speeds of its Champ Cars on superspeedways. Designed by Mark
Hanford of Swift Engineering, the device is a winglike aerodynamic
piece fitted to the rear of the car with the intention of creating
drag and reducing downforce. ``We feel that by slowing the cars
down a bit we increase safety, as well as enhance our drivers'
ability to race and race comfortably,'' said J. Kirk Russell,
CART's vice president of competition. The Hanford Device is
scheduled to be used for the first time during the U.S. 500 at the
2-mile Michigan track July 26. It will also be utilized in the
FedEx Championship Series season-ending Marlboro 500 at the
California Speedway on Nov. 1. Testing of the Hanford Device by
Unser and Bryan Herta at California this month resulted in a
reduction of 17 mph to 23 mph from the world-record 240.942-mph
qualifying lap rung up by Mauricio Gugelmin last year.
FAST LAPS Ray takes a `holiday'
</P>
<P>
   Direct from his runner-up finish at Texas Motor Speedway, Greg
Ray of Plano will attend the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's New
England 200 this weekend as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and team owner Thomas Knapp, still without a full-time
primary sponsor, have opted to sit out Sunday's race on the
1.058-mile New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon, N.H.
Ray's sponsorship deal with AT&AMP;T Wireless Services was only for the
True Value 500K night race June 6 in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ray finished second to Billy Boat at TMS by 0.928-seconds, but
failed to cash in with a corporate backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with going to New Hampshire and not driving
right now because we're looking at the big picture _ to put myself
in position to win races and championships next year and the year
after that,'' said Ray, driver of the No. 97 Dallara/Aurora.
``There's a little bit of sacrifice. Because we had such a good run
at Fort Worth and such a good run at Indy \Rqualified No. 2
overall\S more people have taken notice.''
Nuts and bolts
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Jeremy Mayfield is the only driver to

STATE OFFICIALS UNVEIL TOUGHER SCHOOL EXAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Offering the first glimpse into how dramatically they
plan to raise high school standards, state education officials
Wednesday made public new, harder exams in English and math being
phased in for all students.
</P>
<P>
   In English, the new exam, which students now in the 10th grade
and below must take beginning next June, replaces a three-hour
minimal skills test. It will take six hours and be administered
over two days, making it the longest and most comprehensive high
school English test requirement of any state in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard of one that long,'' said Chris Pipho, a
spokesman for the Education Commission of the States, a Denver
group that tracks academic trends. Most states that have competency
exams for graduation require one or two essays, Pipho said; the
test in Georgia, for instance, allots 75 minutes for a writing
test, while Ohio allots two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are part of the state's effort to phase out the
minimal standards tests, called Regents Competency Tests, and
establish one bar for all. Students who do not pass the harder
tests, called regents exams, will still be able to get a
equivalency diploma by taking the less-stringent exams for a
general equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not to be measured against some low average,'' said the
state's education commissioner, Richard Mills. ``New York, in every
field, plays against the world's best. I believe, and the regents
believe, that these are the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   The new English Regents exam will ask students to write three
comparative essays based on several passages of text, and one essay
based on two works of literature that they read in class or at
home. The test also contains multiple-choice questions testing
grammar, punctuation and vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials have also revamped the math regents
test, to be required for all public school students beginning with
this year's ninth graders, to include more advanced algebra and
geometry as well as some trigonometry.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only those students bound for college take
college-preparatory regents examinations, and the state awards
regents diplomas to those who pass eight or more exams. Everyone
else can earn a local diploma by passing five Regents Competency
Tests.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules passed by the Board of Regents last year, all
students will have to pass at least five regents exams, in English,
math, American history, global studies and science. The tests will
be phased in over the next five years, beginning with English in
June 1999. To pass, students will ultimately have to score at least
65 percent, but for the first four years, school districts can set
the passing grade at 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials at New York City public schools welcomed
the tougher tests, while some education advocates worried about the
lack of resources to train teachers to teach for the higher
standards. Last year, about two-thirds of the state's high school
students took the English Regents exam, and only 56 percent passed
with at least a 65 percent mark; 63 percent scored 55 percent or
above.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when high school seniors in New York City
took a pilot exam, it became clear to city school officials that
many students, especially those with limited English skills, had
trouble writing the essays. All students who have been in a U.S.
school for at least three years will be required to pass the
English exam, though the state will offer the other tests in the
four most common languages spoken by immigrant students: Spanish,
Chinese, Russian and Haitian Creole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out we have work to do, obviously,'' said Dr.
Margaret Harrington, chief executive of school programs and student
support services at the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this fall, Harrington said, the board will provide
funds to reduce class size in all 11th-grade English courses to 25
students; currently, she said, most high school classes have 34
students.

GLOBE URGES RESCINDING OF COLUMNIST'S AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin has asked the American
Society of Newspaper Editors to rescind its 1998 Distinguished
Writing Award to Globe columnist Patricia Smith, after she admitted
fabricating parts of her columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although her entry of five columns in the ASNE Writing Awards
is apparently free of any fabrications, we feel that Ms. Smith's
admission of fabrications in other pieces makes reconsideration of
the ASNE award appropriate,'' Storin wrote in a letter to the
society dated Wednesday. ``While we recognize that the decision is
not ours to reverse, we urge the ASNE board to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ASNE executive director Lee Stinnett said he had received
Storin's request and was polling the 20-member board about how to
respond. The voting is made more difficult by the fact that four of
the board members are in Europe, Stinnett said, ``but we're hoping
for an answer soon.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ASNE has not withdrawn any awards since it began
granting them in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said Smith was notified of the Globe's action Wednesday
through her lawyer and agent, John ``Ike'' Williams, at the Boston
firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge. Smith did not return a call to her home.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, had written a twice-weekly Metro column for the Globe
since 1994. She resigned at the Globe's request last Thursday,
after admitting that she had invented quotes and characters in four
columns.

U.S. PLAYS FOR PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France --- They are playing exclusively for pride, but
that's not all on the minds of the United States' players as they
head into their final World Cup clash.
</P>
<P>
   As much as they declare otherwise, at least for the record, the
American camp is rocked with dissension over Steve Sampson's
personnel decisions and tactics, and it threatens to boil over
after tonight's finale against Yugoslavia at Stade de La Beaujoire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the U.S. players apparently plan to voice their
dissatisfaction with Sampson and his decisions, which they blame
for the U.S. failure in the Cup, after the final whistle has blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's ready to explode,'' defender Alexi Lalas told the
Washington Post. ``You can get ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The players evidently are angered over Sampson's lineup and
formation changes the past two months, which have sent several
veteran players --- including Lalas and Cerritos' Marcelo Balboa
--- to the bench; his fielding an inexperienced team in the 2-0
loss to Germany in the U.S. cup opener, then radically changing
players and tactics for the 2-1 loss Sunday to Iran; his decision
to drop captain John Harkes, a two-time World Cup veteran, from the
roster in April; and his criticism in the press of certain players,
primarily striker Eric Wynalda.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of dissension were sown two months ago with Harkes'
ouster and the switch to a 3-6-1 alignment using several
inexperienced players --- midfielders Frankie Hejduk, Chad Deering
and Brian Maisonneuve --- solely on the basis of a 3-0 rout of
Austria on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather nave to think that a team that has gone through so
much together can basically be rearranged and be expected to play
with any consistency and cohesiveness,'' Lalas told the Post. ``It
just doesn't happen, especially in soccer. ... The reality is
consistency comes from playing under a system for an extended
period of time and understanding the role you play in that system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was the master plan, good god, it was pretty
masterful. (Sampson's) got a weird definition of a master plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, the all-time U.S. scoring leader, was left on the bench
throughout the loss to Iran, then instructed by U.S. Soccer not to
speak to the media. He made his feelings known by slamming the door
to the ``mixed zone'' on his departure. Neither he nor Balboa would
talk to the media on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Soccer source told the Washington Post that Sampson
threatened, through assistant coaches, to send home Lalas, Wynalda,
Balboa and Ernie Stewart because of attitude problems following the
game against Germany. Of the quartet, only Stewart played against
Iran, as a second-half substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players came here to play, they didn't come here to sit on the
bench,'' Sampson, who may be coaching his final U.S. game tonight,
said Wednesday when asked about the players' criticism. ``It's
normal for players that don't see playing time to voice their
frustration. My opinion is this: Players have to be mature and
professional ad they have a choice whether to be mature and
professional or not. I've always been professional with them. ... I
will never criticize my players to the press, never communicate to
my players through the press. I hope they have the same approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson did criticize Wynalda following the Germany match but
wouldn't provide his reasons for not including him in the Iran
game, even when the Americans were desperately seeking goals in the
final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Iran eliminated the United States from second-round
contention, but the players, for the most part, have decided to
hold their tongues until tonight's game is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people have a lot of things to say once this
is over. I think I'll be one of those guys,'' said midfielder Tab
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   One player was willing to lash out, but only under a veil of
anonymity, according to the Post. He said the U.S. squad's failure
had ``nothing to do with the ability of the players here. The team
lost chemistry months ago. The reason we're upset is we got
(Sampson) his job. He talks about trust and sacrifice ... and he's
taking credit for all the things we accomplished as a group. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we worked for, everything we accomplished, is
thrown away not because of talent but because he wanted it to be
his show.''

   SCOUTING REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Today: United States vs. Yugoslavia
</P>
<P>
   Site/kickoff: Stade de La Beaujoire (Nantes), noon PDT
</P>
<P>
   TV: Channel 7. Radio: None.
</P>
<P>
   Probable U.S. (0-2) lineup: Goalkeeper Brad Friedel; defenders
Thomas Dooley, Eddie Pope and David Regis; midfielders Chad
Deering, Brian Maisonneuve, Cobi Jones, Frankie Hejduk, Claudio
Reyna and Tab Ramos; forward Brian McBride.
</P>
<P>
   Probable Yugoslavia (1-0-1) lineup: Goalkeeper Ivica Kralj;
defenders Slobodan Komljenovic, Nisa Saveljic, Sinisa Mihajlovic
and Goran Djorovic; midfielders Vladimir Jugovic, Slavisa
Jokanovic, Dragan Stojkovic and Dejan Stankovic; forwards Predrag
Mijatovic and Savo Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. outlook: The Americans are playing for pride in what might
be Steve Sampson's final game as head coach, but with no chance to
reach the second round, they may find it tough to get emotionally
prepared for the match. ``Is it difficult? Yeah, it's difficult,
but we have to go on,'' says Ramos. ``This is the World Cup ---
this is something we've worked four years for. Hopefully we can
leave with a good showing.'' Sampson has offered no clues as to who
will start, except that Friedel will step in for Kasey Keller in
the nets, but the demeanor of Eric Wynalda, Alexi Lalas and Marcelo
Balboa following Wednesday's practice at La Beaujoire suggest
they'll remain on the bench. McBride, who has scored the Yanks'
only goal in the Cup, brings a solid air game, but the Yugos are
strong everywhere on the field, and the key to U.S. success is
whether Reyna and, probably, Ramos can connect with the other
attacking players.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia outlook: The Yugoslavs have been going through a bit
of an injury crisis, not that it matters all that much. There is so
much talent here --- more than any other World Cup team's --- that
plugging one player in for another is fairly simple. Five players
are sidelined, including two regulars, defenders Zoran Mirkovic and
Zeljko Petrovic. Dejan Savicevic, who hasn't yet seen action, is
still out with what it being called a knee injury, although there
is great speculation in the Yugoslav press as to what is really
wrong. They key figures are defender Sinisa Mihajlovic, the best
free-kick specialist in the tournament; midfielders Dragan
Stojkovic, the captain, and Vladimir Jugovic, a Cup MVP candidate;
and forward Predrag Mijatovic, one of the world's top strikers. A
victory will send Yugoslavia to the second round, and it would get
through with a loss as long as Germany tops Iran. The real battle
is for the group title, with the Yugoslavs even with the Germans on
points but trailing by a goal on differential.

A COLUMNIST'S APOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attempts at sarcasm and wit are a part of a sports columnist's
repertoire. Sometimes, they backfire loudly.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a short wire story noted that a downhill
skateboarder preparing for the X Games in San Diego had been hit by
a dump truck. In full sarcastic mode, I wrote that I thought that
was one of the X Games' events.
</P>
<P>
   The wire story did not mention anyone being hurt. But it turns
out that Mark Golter, the 28-year-old skateboarder from Laguna
Beach, was seriously hurt. The dump truck that hit him rolled over
his right arm and hand, breaking his femur and severely damaging
all of the bones in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's mother, Lindsay Golter, said surgeons initially were
concerned that he might lose the use of his right hand. ``The
accident almost severed his hand,'' she said. ``But they were able
to reset the bones.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not enough words available to express my regret over
the flippant comment. I certainly would not have written it if I
had known someone had been hurt so severely.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the incident definitely draws more attention to
the nature of Mark Golter's sport and the way some people react.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Golter said her son was taking a practice run down
Soledad Canyon Drive. He was in the bike lane when a small truck
came up behind him, followed by a white dump truck.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the dump truck, she says, laid on his horn. Her
son grabbed the wheel well of his skateboard to slow down and
stayed in the bike lane.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the road expanded to two lanes, she said the driver
of the dump truck passed the other car on the right, swerved to get
in front of her son, and then hit his brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark hit the center divide of the street, flipped over and his
arm was ran over by the truck,'' she said. ``He got up right away,
but with his arm just hanging there.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the dump truck never stopped. The San Diego police
are still looking for him. If he is caught, he will face charges of
assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how people think about skateboards,'' said Lindsay
Golter. ``I've been dealing with it since the day he started. It is
what it is, an extreme sport. But my son wears the best gear there
is to protect himself and always is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son has spoken to the Laguna Beach City Council in support
of the city building a skateboard park to accommodate the sport and
its athletes, and take some elements of it off city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will make people think twice the next time they see
someone on a skateboard,'' said Ms. Golter.
</P>
<P>
   I know one person who will. My deepest apology goes out to Mark
Golter.

NOTHING LIKE CHILE RECEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BENNETT J. MINTZ  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTALEUFU, Chile _ The Montero was loaded down with two
fly-fishermen and their gear _ enough rods and reels to target the
trout they had long envisioned finning at the end of the earth in
Patagonia.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos was at the wheel, careful to get his passengers,
their luggage and supplies from town to the fishing lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Juan Carlos the driver is like calling the Taj Mahal a
building. Juan Carlos is the John Elway of the blacktop. The road
from Futaleufu is jokingly called the Evel Knievel Memorial
Highway. About three-fourths of the way to camp it is so dangerous
that passengers are required to get out and walk around paso
suicida for about 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   We already had flown from Los Angeles and Chile's Santiago and
Puerto Montt. Navigating a few more narrows along the ``highway''
seemed a minor hardship considering how far we had come and the
proximity of our goal _ the Futaleufu River.
</P>
<P>
   The Futaleufu begins in Argentina as the Rio Grande and comes
out of a huge dam not far from the Chilean border. It travels in a
southerly direction until it rolls into the Pacific a few hundred
miles away. There are sea trout and chinook and coho salmon in the
lower end. But it was the rainbow and brown trout in a 20-mile
mountainous stretch that we had come to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   After checking into the Futaleufu Lodge, Juan Carlos backed the
trailer and the rubber raft it carried down the launching ramp. He
called it a ramp. I called it a small cliff.
</P>
<P>
   We swung the craft into the current and began casting our 5- and
6-weight fly rods to some of the clearest water we'd ever seen. We
would hold the boat 30 feet or so from the bank and flip our flies
under the trees; other times we'd toss them into the many riffles
and runs. For bait we used a size No.10 grasshopper with green
beadhead caddis larvae on a dropper or a beetle pattern or
sometimes size 18 flying black ants.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the grasshopper would disappear in a silvery swirl
and the fight would begin. ``Keep his head up,'' cautioned our
host, Juan Carlos. ``Don't let him get into that fast water.''
</P>
<P>
   The trout ran from a foot to 25 inches. Most were in the 15- to
17-inch slot, brilliantly colored and tremendous fighters. It takes
good eyes, sunglasses that cut through the water's glare and
unwavering attention to the fly to hook them with any degree of
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   During their stay at the lodge, anglers explore different
sections of the river each day. If one is to float from the
Argentina border, he or she must drive that awful road back into
town, then another five miles to the so-called boat ramp. Other
destinations are accessed by horseback. One trip takes you down
river through neighboring ranches to a swinging suspension bridge
with rusted cables that is a symbol of ``the Futa.''
</P>
<P>
   I was in the boat's bow seat when Matt Henderson _ who guides
anglers out of Missoula, Montana, by summer and Chile by winter _
spotted a fat fish flush against a rock outcropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll only get one shot at that baby, so make it good,''
Henderson whispered. I cast a grasshopper imitation 45 feet and was
rewarded with a drag-free drift that enabled the fly pattern to
make a natural-looking run downstream. The big rainbow gulped down
the 'hopper without hesitation. It looked like an 18-inch trout,
but when it took off downstream I knew it was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   We headed into a cove and soon the brute came to the net. It was
my first 20-inch fish of the journey. Later that afternoon, I cast
to a much larger trout that again took a grasshopper, bolted
through a tangle of roots and fortunately headed for open river. It
was 25-inches _ Henderson's largest client-caught rainbow of the
season _ and made both of our days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was the talk of the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Futaleufu Lodge is nestled along the Andes in Chile's Region Los
Lagos, some 750 miles south of Santiago and 20 miles southwest of
Esquel, Argentina. Operators Jim and Sonia Repine come from a
background as diverse as the lakes, rivers and volcanoes that dot
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Jim is from Richmond, Va., with stops in the Marine Corps and in
Alaska for 20 years as a fishing guide, author, outfitter and
outdoors television-show host. Sonia is the widow of a Chilean Air
Force jet pilot.

EDITORIAL: DEMOCRATS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 25:
</P>
<P>
   We would feel more confident about the lasting value of
President Clinton's trip to China, which begins Thursday, if we
knew that someone had included among his briefing papers a summary
of Ronald Reagan's extraordinary visit to the Soviet Union in 1988.
Reagan used that trip to meet with prominent dissidents and speak
directly to Soviet audiences about fundamental freedoms and the
advantages of democracy, and there was little that his host,
Mikhail Gorbachev, could do about it but grumble. Reagan knew that
one of the important powers of a traveling president is the right
to speak plainly in lands unaccustomed to open debate. Bill Clinton
has the same luxury. The cause of human rights will be poorer if he
squanders it.
</P>
<P>
   His aides have said he will address the issue in some way, and
there is no shortage of promising venues. His itinerary includes a
small village that has just conducted its first open election, an
ecumenical church and a classroom at Beijing University. But there
is one obvious setting in which Clinton can seize the moment,
politely but firmly, to assert American values. That is Tiananmen
Square, which he will visit Saturday, and where hundreds of
peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators were slaughtered on June 4,
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, of course, prefer to see Clinton's visit to
Tiananmen Square not as a reminder of that tragedy but as a form of
closure, a way of saying farewell to a relationship strained by
that memory and moving quickly to the ``constructive strategic
partnership'' celebrated in last fall's meeting in Washington
between Clinton and China's president, Jiang Zemin. But why accept
Beijing's definition of what the Tiananmen visit means? More than
700 people were arrested there nine years ago, and many are still
in prison. Clinton can honor their memory by describing their
sacrifice as a reminder of how much further China and its leaders
must travel.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the points the president's Republican critics
have been trying to make on Capitol Hill. On Tuesday they tried
unsuccessfully to ram through a series of amendments that, among
other things, would have denied visas to Chinese officials involved
in religious persecution or forced abortions, and put new
restrictions on some forms of economic aid to Beijing. Senate
Democrats said the entire exercise was an attempt to embarrass the
president. ``I'm not going to allow one single vote on China this
week,'' said Sen. Thomas Daschle, the Democratic leader. But there
are also plenty of liberal Democrats who believe that in pursuing
his policy of engagement Clinton has looked squishy on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course China cannot be viewed through a single lens, and of
course there will be other important issues on the president's
agenda in the next nine days. But the Chinese leadership has
already profited greatly from his visit. His very presence is an
affirmation of Beijing's growing power. The Chinese are certainly
strong enough to hear straight talk on American values and a
presidential statement of solidarity with the democrats in Chinese
society. A show of presidential will would not disrupt the trip. It
might even make it memorable. &QL;

JUDGE REJECTS PROPOSED PACT IN SEX HARASSMENT CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal court judge in Manhattan unexpectedly
rejected a proposed settlement of a sex discrimination case against
Smith Barney Inc. Wednesday, criticizing it for vagueness and
questioning whether it would have sufficient financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Judge Constance Baker Motley does not mean Smith
Barney and the female plaintiffs in the case must start over, and
both sides said they thought the judge's criticisms could be
swiftly addressed. But the proposed settlement, which had been
agreed to by lawyers for both sides after several months of
negotiation, had been widely expected to win the court's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark case, brought by 23 past and present female
employees of Smith Barney as a class-action suit on behalf of
thousands of current and former women employees of the big
brokerage firm, had shone a rare light on some of the seamier
aspects of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which had attracted considerable media attention,
detailed male brokerage executives' frequent discrimination against
female employees, and several instances of sexual harassment
including an infamous ``boom boom room'' at Smith Barney's office
in Garden City, N.Y., where carousing male bosses would grope and
harass their female subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   In a 48-page ruling filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan
Wednesday, Motley declined to approve the proposed settlement,
saying that it ``leaves unclear both what new programs it will fund
and to what extent existing Smith Barney expenditures can qualify
under the vague definition of `diversity-related expenditure.'''
She said, ``The proposed programs are nowhere delineated or
defined.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Motley wrote, ``It is possible to envision that $15
million over four years for a company as large as Smith Barney is
grossly inadequate if personnel training, for example, is
included.'' The judge also criticized the settlement because it did
not allow for continued court oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers for Smith Barney and for the plaintiffs sought
Wednesday to play down the rejection, calling it a setback that
could be addressed quickly. They maintained that they would now
work together to adjust the proposed settlement to address Judge
Motley's concerns. Smith Barney Inc. is now Salomon Smith Barney,
the brokerage subsidiary of the Travelers Group. Travelers itself
is now merging with Citicorp to form Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Smith Barney lawyers'' on modifying
the settlement, said Mary Stowell of Stowell &AMP; Friedman, the
Chicago law firm that represented the plaintiffs. After further
work, the two sides intend to submit some suggested modifications
``perhaps as early as next week,'' she said. ``We are hopeful that
we will be able to address the court's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Belnick, a partner at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &AMP; Garrison
and lead counsel for Smith Barney, said Wednesday that although
``all of us would have preferred final approval at this time it is
nonetheless heartening that the court has approved all the core
provisions of this settlement relating to the dispute resolution
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Belnick added: ``Smith Barney and class counsel intend to submit
to the court as quickly as possible an amendment which responds to
the one specific concern the court raised _ which all of us take
very seriously _ regarding the specifics of the diversity programs
on which Smith Barney will spend its $15 million. On the basis of
that submission, Smith Barney and class counsel hope to secure the
approval of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo distributed Wednesday to all employees at Salomon
Smith Barney, John Donelly, the brokerage firm's head of human
resources, played down the court's rejection. The memo, entitled
`Proposed settlement still awaiting final approval,' characterized
the judge's ruling as a ``temporary setback,'' and said that the
firm was pleased that the court had ``endorsed all features of the
settlement relating to establishment of a dispute resolution
process for handling all gender based and other employment
claims.'' The court's primary concern, the memo said, ``related to
the lack of specificity of the diversity programs which Salomon
Smith Barney has committed to create and fund prospectively.'' The
firm, the memo said, remained hopeful that its ``proposed amendment
will lead to final approval.''
</P>
<P>
   In their response to the judge's rejection of the proposed
settlement, the plaintiffs and Smith Barney were expected to allow
for continued court oversight of the proposed settlement, and to
offer more specific information about the diversity programs that
Smith Barney plans.

LETHAL VIRUS BORNE BY MICE MAKES RETURN IN THE WEST

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOLCOTT, Colo. _ Carried by a surging population of deer mice,
hantavirus has returned to the Southwest this spring, killing a boy
and a woman in Colorado and a man in New Mexico. Nonfatal cases
have been recorded in Arizona, New Mexico and, on Tuesday, this
western Colorado town.
</P>
<P>
   For Colorado and New Mexico, the hantavirus deaths are the first
since an outbreak receded in the mid-1990s. The mouse-borne virus,
which can kill swiftly, claimed this year's three fatal victims
within hours of hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can go from mildly ill to fatally ill in a couple of
hours,'' John Pape, an epidemiologist with the Colorado health
department, said from the town of Durango, where he was
investigating the death last week of Cheri Newbold, a mother of
three. ``It is a nasty virus and can hit people pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   With revived memories of the earlier outbreak, which killed 15
people in the Four Corners area of Colorado and New Mexico in 1993,
residents of southwestern Colorado have started buying cats to kill
mice and work masks to filter out dust contaminated by deer-mouse
droppings and urine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep cats in here,'' said Jackie Lee, director of the
La Plata County Humane Society Animal Shelter in Durango. ``People
come in to adopt because they are afraid of hantavirus. We had a
cattery that was 100 percent full, and now we don't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hardware store nearby, disposable masks are selling at a
brisk pace. ``People come in,'' said Joel Krueger, the manager,
``and ask if we have anything for cleaning up mouse areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The hantavirus _ so called because a strain of it infected about
3,000 U.S. soldiers along the Hantaan River during the Korean War _
has probably killed people in the American West for centuries. But
it was not identified until 1993, after the mysterious outbreak had
started taking lives on the Navajo Reservation. By studying old
blood samples, scientists identified cases in the region dating
from 1959.
</P>
<P>
   As in the outbreak five years ago, the culprit now appears to be
El Nino. A mild, wet winter has given an enormous boost to the deer
mouse, a brown rodent with a white belly that was already
considered North America's most common mammal. (America's common
gray ``house mouse'' does not appear to carry the virus.) The warm,
moist weather provided extra plant cover for mouse shelter, and
extra fruits, seeds and insects for mouse nourishment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mouse monitoring sites, set up in Arizona, New Mexico and
Colorado after the 1993 outbreak, indicate that the deer-mouse
populations this spring are as much as 20 times those of a year
ago. A trap left for three days in Mesa County, west of here,
captured 59 deer mice in late May. One year ago a trap at the same
site captured only eight.
</P>
<P>
   In years when the number of deer mice per acre drops below one,
hantavirus infects about 10 to 15 percent of them. This spring,
with as many as 10 mice per acre, infection rates can hit 40
percent. Male mice seem to spread the virus, which does them no
harm, by fighting over food and females, inflicting wounds on one
another, said Dr. Brian Hjelle, associate professor of pathology at
the University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hjelle said the mice might also transmit the virus among
themselves through sex, by walking in infected droppings or by
urinating on one another. A team led by him is using a $1.35
million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the
mice's transmission methods and to search for a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Although deer mice are found across the country, 95 percent of
the 185 hantavirus cases identified in the United States, dating
from 1959, have occurred west of the Mississippi. Scientists do not
know why.
</P>
<P>
   Humans contract the virus by inhaling dust contaminated by mouse
droppings or urine. There are no known cases of transmission
between humans in the United States, although a different
hantavirus strain was transmitted from person to person in
Argentina two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With 75 percent of hantavirus cases occurring in the rural West,
towns like this one are getting the word out through posters and
fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that mice can wriggle through openings the size of a
button, health officials urge rural residents to seal their houses
by plugging holes and girdling foundations with metal flashing.
When people open barns, trailers or cabins for spring cleaning,
they should leave doors and windows open for 30 minutes before they
enter to work, to insure good ventilation. Masks should be worn
when mouse-infested areas are swept, and campers should use tents
with floors and not pitch tents in areas with mouse burrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are living in a rural area of the western U.S.,'' said
Pape of the Colorado health department, ``you are always going to
be at risk of hantavirus.''

EDITORIAL: A MISTAKEN MICROSOFT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 25:
</P>
<P>
   One month after the Justice Department filed its sweeping
antitrust suit against Microsoft, a federal appeals court has
issued a deeply flawed ruling that may weaken the government's
case. The three-judge panel seemed to adopt Microsoft's arrogant
claim that it has the right to incorporate its browser, or any
other software, into its Windows operating system as long as doing
so offers certain advantages to consumers. But if the thinking
behind this decision prevails, it could permit Microsoft to use its
monopoly power to crush competitors throughout the Internet. The
Justice Department thus needs to mount a vigorous counterattack
invoking the full force of antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department can argue that the appeals court ruling
need not determine the outcome of its larger antitrust case against
Microsoft. That is because it was based on a narrow case brought by
the Justice Department last year, when it charged that Microsoft
violated a 1995 consent decree affecting the marketing of Windows
95. In that decree, Microsoft agreed not to condition its sale of
Windows to computer makers on the sale of other software, but could
improve Windows by integrating other functions into it.
</P>
<P>
   In December a federal district judge ordered Microsoft to split
off its browser, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web,
from Windows 95. Now the appeals court has said the browser can be
included, because with it Windows became a new and improved
integrated product.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the appeals court's reasoning is that virtually
any new form of software can be integrated into the basic Windows
system, arguably improving it. Right now, Microsoft is expanding
into myriad Internet businesses, including news, entertainment
information, banking, financial transactions, travel bookings and
other services. Since consumers have no choice but to buy the
Windows operating system when they buy personal computers,
Microsoft is in a position to give such a big advantage to its own
software that any other software maker would not be able to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Because the court of appeals ruling was based on the meaning of
the 1995 consent decree, the Justice Department has a chance to
reverse its thinking in its larger case against Microsoft, which is
to come to trial in September. In that case, the judge will be
asked to look beyond the consent decree to the broad principles of
antitrust law, and to look as well at Microsoft's predatory
practices. The department has assembled impressive evidence that
Microsoft deliberately used its monopoly in Windows to crush its
rival Netscape, which was selling a browser that many consumers
preferred to the one made by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's decision referred to the general
``undesirability of having courts oversee product design.'' Judge
Patricia Wald, in her dissent, correctly warned that the decision
``would seem to permit'' Microsoft to incorporate ``any
now-separate software product into its operating system by
identifying some minimal synergy'' as a result. It is not healthy
for the courts to grant Microsoft a permanent chokehold over the
entire expanding world of the Internet. &QL;

REVISITING BROOKLYN'S BED-STUY, 30 YEARS AFTER PIONEERING TV SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo of Charles Hobson is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling

(nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Hobson never had to look far for guests to
fill his first television show, ``Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant.'' He
once plucked Cicero Murphy, then one of the country's great black
pool players, from a billiards hall on Nostrand Avenue. Another
time he recruited the renowned musician Eubie Blake.
</P>
<P>
   He brought on local police officers, teachers, a calypso singer,
Cleon Jones of the New York Mets and Julius Lester, the radical
author. He invited a high school football team, welfare mothers,
business owners and enough singers and dancers to fill a Broadway
musical. If the variety of people seemed dizzying, Hobson said,
that was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a way for blacks to hear their voices,'' said Hobson,
who is 62. ``Here's a community of about 400,000 people at that
time, with all of their culture and churches, and no coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely forgotten, ``Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant'' was a
pioneering television show in New York City from 1968 until 1970.
It was the city's first program written, produced and presented by
blacks at a time when blacks were largely invisible on television,
or seen only on news footage about riots, protests or crime. Now,
Hobson, the show's producer, has edited excerpts of the program
into a 55-minute film being shown Thursday at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   What made ``Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant'' unusual was the
unfiltered window it offered on an ignored black neighborhood and,
to a degree, on black America. Film scholars and social historians
consider it a rare video time capsule, perhaps the only one of its
kind documenting a black community.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a measuring stick. Returning to the Brooklyn
neighborhood last week to reminisce on the 30th anniversary of his
program, Hobson lamented that the news and entertainment media
often still fail to portray the whole of Bedford-Stuyvesant. He had
not been back for 15 years, and while he found stretches of poverty
and neglect, he also found sidewalk trees fat with leaves and
blocks of neatly kept brownstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, this looks great,'' Hobson declared as he arrived at the
immaculate old brownstone where he grew up. He joked that it would
be ironic if it had been bought by white yuppies. But according to
a neighbor, the current owners are a black Jamaican family who have
planted a neat flower garden and renovated the entire house. Hobson
peered through the windows at the elaborate woodwork he polished as
a child. ``This is quite amazing for me personally,'' he said. ``It
looks really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his surprise at how well-kept the block looked, Hobson
conceded that perhaps he himself had succumbed to some of the
stereotypes he had worked to shatter in making ``Inside
Bedford-Stuyvesant.'' For this, in part, he blamed the media.
``When I go to Park Slope,'' said Hobson in a later interview,
``I'm not surprised, because the media does tell you it is New
York's Left Bank. But when I went to Bed-Stuy, you're not prepared
for the humanity, for some of the quite wonderful blocks, and some
of the normal people and conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame, Hobson added, falls on the ``black media.''
He rated Spike Lee's ``Do The Right Thing'' as the best film
portrayal of the neighborhood. But Hobson criticized other aspects
of the black media, particularly rap videos that he said only
reinforce and exploit negative stereotypes. While black celebrities
are far more visible on television than in the past, what he
considers rare is any thoughtful examination of real black
communities. Crime and crisis, he said, are what usually attract
cameras to Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   So it was, too, in the 1960s, Hobson said, when the media always
missed the neighborhood's complexity. The neighborhood had scholars
and street gangs, famous musicians and winos, good blocks and bad
blocks. ``The media never got that because they lumped everything
together,'' Hobson said. ``If it was a black community, it was a
ghetto or a slum.''
</P>
<P>
   His opportunity to show a different picture came in February
1968. The federal government's Kerner Commission had issued its
landmark report on race relations, criticizing the media for
failing to adequately cover black communities. Two months later, on
the same day that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in
Memphis, WNEW announced the creation of ``Inside
Bedford-Stuyvesant.''
</P>
<P>
   The program was largely conceived by Sen. Robert Kennedy's
Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, a community development
group. The initial $45,000 budget dictated relatively low
production values (Hobson compares the show to public access
television today).
</P>
<P>
   Roxie Roker, who later starred on ``The Jeffersons,'' was one of
the hosts. The 7 a.m. time slot (with a repeat at 1 a.m.) was
awful, but the program found an audience.
</P>
<P>
   In 52 half-hour programs, Hobson simply turned his camera on
Bedford-Stuyvesant. The hosts did not use a sound studio; they
filmed all over the neighborhood, often outdoors. The show
attracted celebrities like Harry Belafonte and Max Roach, the
musician, but mostly they had a cast of thousands _ the ordinary
people of the neighborhood. They filmed discussions about Richard
Nixon, welfare policies and anti-Semitism. Children read Black
Power poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've rarely seen such candor and such open expression, even
when it's boring,'' Hobson said. ``People spoke their hearts and
their minds. They didn't know how to do anything else at that time
because there weren't any models.''
</P>
<P>
   The program ended in 1970 when sponsorship money dwindled. But
other, more polished shows remained, such as the nationally
syndicated ``Black Journal'' on PBS and the local ``Like It Is'' on
WABC.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson's career took him out of New York to Atlanta and
Washington. He has also lectured at several universities, including
Harvard and Yale, and he taught film in Munich in 1996 as a
Fulbright scholar. He currently runs his own documentary film
production company.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he returned to New York in the early 1990's did Hobson
discover that the old tapes of ``Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant'' were
still stored in a warehouse at WNEW. With a grant from the Ford
Foundation, he restored many of the old programs and made his film,
which was shown at the Margaret Mead Festival in 1997. Its showing
Thursday, at 6:30 p.m., is part of the Human Rights Watch
International Film Festival. Copies of the program are now archived
at the Museum of Radio and Television, the Brooklyn Historical
Society, the Schomberg Center in Harlem and the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson's work has carried him to the townships of South Africa
and to another famous American ghetto, Watts in Los Angeles. What
interested him about both places were the layers he discovered, the
surprising nuances he found in places so often seen in two
dimensions. Of course, he had already learned that in his own
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other black community in America was documented the way
Bed-Stuy was,'' he said with obvious pride. ``And because of the
low production value of it, it was like truth, you know?''

A LOONY LANDMARK THAT INSPIRED A SEVENTH-GRADER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICKY SILVER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs, creeping walls of ice, hunger, wars _ these are among
the ingredients of the play ``The Skin of Our Teeth,'' Thornton
Wilder's condensed (three acts) history of the human race. Wilder
had already won a Pulitzer Prize for ``Our Town,'' when, five years
later, in 1943, he won again for ``The Skin of Our Teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   His main characters, Mr. and Mrs. George Antrobus of Excelsior,
N.J., their two children, Gladys and Henry, and the family maid,
Sabina, live in a surreal place, a combination commuters' suburb
and prehistoric wasteland. Survival is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The initial production, directed by Elia Kazan, opened on
Broadway in 1942 starring Fredric March and Florence Eldridge as
the parents and Tallulah Bankhead as Sabina, with Montgomery Clift
as Henry.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, the New York Shakespeare Festival opens its
43rd season of theater in Central Park with a revival of the play
at the Delacorte Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes John Goodman as Antrobus, Frances Conroy as
his wife and Kristen Johnston as Sabina, under the direction of
Irene Lewis, the artistic chief of the Center Stage in Baltimore.
The set designer is John Conklin.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to a collection of his plays, Wilder said about
this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrtten on the eve of our entrance into the war and
under strong emotion and I think it mostly comes alive under
conditions of crisis. It has been often charged with being a
bookish fantasia about history, full of rather bloodless
schoolmasterish jokes. But to have seen it in Germany soon after
the war, in the shattered churches and beer halls that were serving
as theaters ... was an experience that was not so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, he noted, ``is deeply indebted to James Joyce's
`Finnegans Wake.' I should be very happy if, in the future, some
author should feel similarly indebted to any work of mine.
Literature has always more resembled a torch race than a furious
dispute among heirs.''
</P>
<P>
   In this essay, the playwright Nicky Silver, author of ``Raised
in Captivity,'' ``The Food Chain'' and ``The Maiden's Prayer,''
among others, talks about Wilder's effect on his own writing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am occasionally asked what writers have influenced my work.
This happens most frequently on foreign soil, when I've dragged
myself over an ocean and am groggy with jet lag. Desperate for
sleep, I answer by rote. I say Joe Orton, John Guare, Chris Durang
and Stephen Sondheim, whom I consider a playwright who happens to
rhyme a lot. Were I really thinking, I'd have to include Thornton
Wilder, whose play ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' woke me up from a
dreary adolescence of ``Arsenic and Old Lace.''
</P>
<P>
   While I've seldom thought about Wilder's loony epic, its
influence has been profound on me. You see, my play
``Pterodactyls'' was called the flip side of ``The Skin of Our
Teeth'' by the critic from this very paper _ and for obvious
reasons. While both plays feature ice ages and dinosaurs, mine is,
frankly, a cautionary tale, while Wilder's masterwork is a love
letter to the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   I guess he hasn't made my list because I never cared for ``Our
Town,'' a lovely play soured forever, for me, by the fact that I
was not cast in my summer camp production (Mark Segal got the part
I wanted) and when, as a child, I saw the film of ``The
Matchmaker,'' it upset me to see Hazel in those period costumes.
I've been unfair.
</P>
<P>
   I read ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' when I was in the seventh
grade. I checked an anthology out from my junior high school
library (I don't think I ever returned it, oops), one of those
massive hardback volumes containing musty ``important'' works. I
tried to struggle through ``The Wild Duck'' and ``The Voice of the
Turtle'' but gave up midway and returned to ``Dark Shadows'' on
television.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then I read ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' in one sitting, smiling
the whole time. And the reason was simple: it's a riot! Wilder's
play chronicles the adventures of an archetypal family struggling
to be virtuous as they face the Ice Age, the Great Flood and the
destruction of war. I had not yet, at that young age, ever read a
play that so blithely combined broad comedy and big ideas. I had
not read a play in which the characters addressed the audience to
complain about the material. And I had certainly not read a play
that featured quotes by Plato and Spinoza as well as talking
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if I understood what I was reading, but I knew what
made, and still makes, me laugh. Early in Act I, Sabina, the maid,
is forced to stall alone on stage as another character is late for
an entrance. Rather than improvise, she complains:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't invent any words for this play, and I'm glad I can't.
I hate this play and every word in it. As for me, I don't
understand a single word of it anyway _ all about the troubles the
human race has gone through, there's a subject for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I wasn't reading a play about a family, set in a living
room. I was reading a play about actors set on a stage. This
predates my studying at the Experimental Theater Wing at NYU, where
I learned the phrase ``site-specific,'' meaning a play set in a
bathroom, performed in a bathroom. And while, ultimately, Orton may
have spoken more clearly to me, his jaundiced view of mankind
matching mine more closely, Wilder was where I first saw politics
mixed so adroitly with jokes.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't yet read Guare or Durang. So it was surprising to me
that venomously funny repartee could be juxtaposed with serious and
emotional politics. But there they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are a thing only a parent can stand'' in the same
play with ``You and I want the same thing; but until you think of
it as something that everyone has a right to, you are my deadly
enemy and I will destroy you.'' I don't know, I wasn't born, but I
can only imagine that this was stylistically shocking in its day. I
base this conclusion on the fact that it's stylistically shocking
now.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' offers no simplistic solutions.
Evil, in the personification of the Antrobus son, Henry, evolves
from a happy family struggling nobly to continue. There is no
explanation for why he goes astray while his sister, Gladys, does
not (although she does wear red stockings in the second act, a
fashion faux pas so severe, her mother feels it borders on evil).
No. Wilder is saying that the world is complicated, scary and
beyond our understanding. But he also sees mankind's honor. He sees
us as a species in love with life and infatuated with hope. These
were important messages at the height of World War II. Everyone saw
the world as treacherous _ the enemy was at the door and America
was frightened of tomorrow. We needed to hear Sabina tell us that
the archetypal characters will prevail, as she does at the end:
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of this play isn't written yet. Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus!
Their heads are full of plans and they're confident as the first
day they began __ ''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't leave the theater feeling good about themselves and
tomorrow? Who doesn't enjoy being congratulated on their strength
and dignity?
</P>
<P>
   But we live in a different era now and everything is wonderful.
Or so we like to believe. With no obvious enemies, we drive through
life, enjoying the sunny view. The predators are hidden; they're
subtler and we don't see them. While ``The Skin of Our Teeth''
offers us hope for better times, we're busy wallowing in the good
times of today. Frankly, I'm not so sure the time is right for a
``love letter to the human spirit.'' But hell, the time is always
right for a good laugh.

EDITORIAL: THE HIV PLAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 25:
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures on the global AIDS epidemic are frightening
beyond expectations. A country-by-country analysis by the U.N. AIDS
program has found that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is running
wild through many parts of the developing world, especially the
impoverished nations of Africa south of the Sahara. The virus has
infected one in four adults in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and almost
one in five adults in several other African countries. Most do not
even know they harbor the virus, but virtually all are doomed
unless modern science or their own beleaguered governments can pull
off some miracle not yet in sight. As it stands now, the AIDS
pandemic is destined to rival the Black Death of the Middle Ages
and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 as a global horror.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are no sure-fire weapons to bring the
epidemic under control. Drugs to treat the disease have become
increasingly effective. But they are prohibitively expensive for
poor countries where the virus is most prevalent. Although it is
heartening that several drug companies are planning huge price cuts
for poor nations, even that will leave the cost too high for most
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention programs stressing health education and condom use
have helped some countries slow transmission of the virus. But the
best hope would be a vaccine to prevent infection. The first
full-scale clinical trial of an AIDS vaccine is just getting under
way in the United States and Thailand, but many experts believe the
vaccine being tested is not very promising. The message in the
latest U.N. estimates is that efforts to secure an effective
vaccine must be broadened and greatly intensified. Otherwise,
today's shockingly high HIV infection rates will only get worse. &QL;

 (Adds wording in 5th graf to clarify identity of ambassador at time
of killings)  
 DOCUMENTS SUGGEST SALVADOR HIGH COMMAND ORDERED NUNS' DEATH in By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ El Salvador's defense minister suspected that a member
of his high command had ordered the killing of four American
churchwomen in 1980 and later informed the U.S. ambassador of his
belief, according to newly released State Department documents.
</P>
<P>
   For years both governments have asserted that no high-ranking
military officials were involved in the slayings, which provoked an
intense debate about U.S. policy in Central America. The
declassified documents also raise questions as to Washington's
motives for not investigating the confidential information more
aggressively, human rights advocates and former officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions were confided to Thomas Pickering, who was then
the American ambassador to El Salvador and is now under secretary
of state for political affairs. It is not clear from the documents
what action, if any, the State Department took to investigate the
leads passed on by Pickering or to pressure the Salvadoran
government to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, who is on vacation, did not respond to a request for
comment left with his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone should be called on the carpet for this,''
Robert White said in a telephone interview Wednesday. White was the
U.S. ambassador at the time of the killings but was replaced by
Pickering shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   White made clear, however, that he was not referring to
Pickering. ``What has been released moves toward confirming what
most of us have always believed, that this was ordered by higher
ups and was not the idea'' of the enlisted men who were convicted,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Three Roman Catholic nuns, Maura Clarke, Ita Ford and Dorothy
Kazel, and a lay worker, Jean Donovan, were abducted by a military
unit on Dec. 2, 1980, and raped and shot to death. The killings
occurred as the United States was beginning a decadelong
multibillion-dollar effort to prevent left-wing guerrillas from
gaining power, and the case immediately came to symbolize the
pitfalls of American involvement in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 four members of the El Salvadoran National Guard and
their immediate superior were convicted of the murders and
sentenced to 30 years in prison. In March the four enlisted men
broke their 17-year silence and told American human rights
investigators that they had acted only after having received clear
and explicit ``orders from above.''
</P>
<P>
   (The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a judge granted
conditional freedom to three of the five guard members under a
two-month-old law that mandates a reduction in prison overcrowding.
A prosecutor said officials might seek to have the order
overturned, however. The three men, who would be released Tuesday,
have been given credit for good behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered the release of
relevant American documents in response to requests by members of
Congress and representatives of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, which represents the families of the churchwomen and which
interviewed the guard members. State Department officials have said
the 300 pages will be published and posted on a State Department
website in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 12-year civil war, in which 75,000 people were
killed, the Reagan and Bush administrations always echoed the El
Salvadoran government's contention that the slayings were the work
of a small group that was acting on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, however, make clear that officials at the
American Embassy in San Salvador, based on conversations with the
highest levels of the El Salvadoran military, had strong
indications to the contrary and that their superiors in Washington
apparently chose to ignore the indications.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In February 1985, Pickering met with the defense minister at the
time of the killings, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia. Garcia
acknowledged that ``there existed an attitude among the National
Guard elements that colleagues should be protected'' and suggested
that a subaltern might have been directly involved in the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became clear the women had been murdered, he thought
immediately of Col. Edgardo Casanova,'' military commander in the
zone where the churchwomen were abducted, a State Department cable
about the discussion said. ``Without recounting specifics, Gen.
Garcia noted that, sometime before the churchwomen incident,
something similar had happened within the territory falling under
Casanova's jurisdiction,'' the cable said.
</P>
<P>
   In another cable, Pickering related a conversation with the
deputy defense minister, Col. Rafael Flores Lima, regarding
information that ``Edgardo Casanova had been aware of and possibly
ordered the murder of the churchwomen.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores Lima ``noted that Gen. (then Col.) Garcia had had
reservations about Edgardo Casanova,'' the document states, and it
pointed out that Casanova had been transferred to a desk job at
headquarters partly ``because of Garcia's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the families of the churchwomen said Wednesday that
they particularly welcomed a chance to examine the ``special
embassy evidence'' that American officials, as well as a judicial
commission that is looking into the case, have always cited as
proving the guardsmen acted on their own. That evidence turns out
to be a clandestinely taped conversation between the guardsmen's
immediate superior, Sgt. Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman, and a
higher-ranking officer in which the issue of orders from above does
not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that those
insisting this evidence was definitive proof were engaging in some
kind of fraud intended to avoid irreparable damage to the policy,
which was to continue working with the Salvadoran military,'' said
Scott Greathead of the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, which
is based in New York. ``That's the only conclusion you can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript does, though, make it clear that senior
Salvadoran officers organized and directed a cover-up of the
killings. Sgt. Colindres Aleman states that within days of the
killing he admitted his role to Maj. Lizandro Zepeda, who was in
charge of the military's initial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, Zepeda took declarations from at least some of
those involved'' in the crime, in which they concocted an offical
verson of events that absolved them of responsibility, according to
an Embassy cable accompanying the transcript notes. ``Zepeda
included these in his January report knowing that they were
false.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a United Nations Truth Commission report concluded that
Garcia and Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova organized and
directed the cover-up. Col. Vides Casanova, who in 1980 was
director of the National Guard, is a first cousin and friend since
childhood of Col. Edgardo Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   Awarded a general's rank, Vides Casanova later served as
minister of defense during one of the most violent periods of the
war, working closely with American authorities. Within days of
retiring in 1989, he moved to Florida, where he gained permanent
resident status and lives with his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   The new material is unlikely to lead to additional legal
proceedings in El Salvador, however, because the 10-year statute of
limitations on murder has expired.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 25:
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution is the nation's bedrock charter, and lawmakers
sworn to uphold it should resist the temptation to push for
pandering amendments every time an election year rolls around. But
such resistance requires more principle and self-restraint than the
Senate Judiciary Committee seems able to muster.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, by a mostly party-line vote, the committee approved
narrowing the Bill of Rights to combat the rare instance of flag
desecration. In doing so, the committee blessed what would be the
first exemption ever to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of
speech. The committee's Democrats, with the glaring exception of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, tried to stop this repressive
move but failed. Few politicians want to risk being seen as voting
against the Stars and Stripes. But poking a hole in the First
Amendment to punish people who burn or otherwise physically abuse a
flag in the exercise of their free-speech rights is an act of
desecration, not patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the committee will take up the so-called victims'
rights amendment allowing victims to participate in criminal
proceedings. No one disagrees that victims of crime deserve
sympathy and respectful treatment. But state legislatures and
courts are already experimenting with ways to inject greater
sensitivity for victims into the justice system without tampering
with defendants' rights or inadvertently harming prosecutions, as
the lengthy, complex amendment is destined to do.
</P>
<P>
   In little more than a week, the nation will mark another
Independence Day. Messing with the Constitution is no way to
celebrate. &QL;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Lam Firing Up to 25% Of Staff  
   
 By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In yet another sign of troubles in the computer chip industry, Lam
Research of Fremont said yesterday that it will lay off 20 to 25
percent of its workforce.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lam said it will trim 1,000 to 1,200 workers _ in its second
round of layoffs this year _ mainly because of slowing sales and
financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, chip equipment sales are slow in the summer, said
Lam chief executive Jim Bagley. But, he said, ``the situation today
is a dramatic slowdown ... with no improvements likely for fall
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The company refused to say where the layoffs would occur, but
the Bay Area is home to almost three-quarters of the firm's 4,400
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said it will take a charge of up to $65 million related to
the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The company also expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of 5
cents a share before the restructuring charge, in line with
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Lam's troubles are only the latest ripples in the wave of bad
news that hit the chip sector, which is in its third consecutive
year of slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   Lam's biggest rival, Applied Materials of Santa Clara, shed 15
percent of its workforce last month.
</P>
<P>
   And Bay Area chipmakers Intel, National Semiconductor and
Cypress Semiconductor all have announced significant job reductions
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sign of the times,'' said Mark FitzGerald,
semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like those companies, Lam blames the cuts on slowing PC sales,
an oversupply of computer memory and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said it expects chip companies to spend 30 percent less this
year on chip equipment than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on this view of the industry, we have made the decision
to realign the company's cost structure,'' said Bagley, Lam's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Lam has internal problems, too. It is in the
midst of a turnaround after several years of losing market share to
Applied Materials and a Japanese firm called TEL.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lam laid off 700 workers worldwide because of
similar problems _ a dramatic slowdown in the chip industry, and
its attempt to turn the company around.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Lam officials told analysts that they are likely to
shut down the Chemical Vapor Deposition division _ an area Lam had
unsuccessfully sought to penetrate for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been struggling for a while,'' said Gus Richard,
semiconductor analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``Now,
they're going to shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the troubles in the chip equipment industry,
however, Richard said he thinks that the industry soon may rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is going through what I consider to be the bottom
of a cycle,'' Richard said. ``I don't believe it's going to get
much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made after the market closed. Lam shares
closed at $22.06 yesterday.

 Insurers Can't Use ZIP Codes To Gauge Rates   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A superior court judge ruled yesterday that the state's automobile
insurers cannot use ZIP codes as a major factor to determine
premium rates.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Henry E. Needham Jr. of Alameda County reversed a policy
adopted last March by state Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush. The policy had been appealed by San Francisco,
Oakland, Los Angeles and various consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The cities and consumer groups argued that the use of ZIP codes
violated Proposition 103. They said Quackenbush allowed insurers to
discriminate against drivers in the inner cities, where premiums
tend to be highest.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Department spokeswoman Dana Spurrier said the
department won't comment on yesterday's ruling ``until we have
thoroughly reviewed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal sources said the department has several weeks to consider
an appeal and that the ruling won't take effect before then.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling goes unchallenged, inner-city auto-insurance rates
likely would come down while those who live in the suburbs would
see their rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed with the plaintiffs that Quackenbush
circumvented Proposition 103, which mandates that auto rates be
based primarily on three factors: a driver's safety record, miles
driven annually and years of driving experience.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, citing an opinion by an administrative law judge
within the Insurance Department, had provided the insurers with a
loophole.
</P>
<P>
   He permitted the insurers to use other factors in determining
rates as long as the average weighting for the other factors was
less than the weighting for any of the three Prop. 103 criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocates, one of the groups that appealed Quackenbush's
decision, pointed out that the policy allowed the insurers to give
geography the greatest weight of all.
</P>
<P>
   They could do this by introducing numerous other criteria.
Although the average weight for these criteria might be low,
certain criteria could have substantial weight.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocates pointed to a filing by Allstate, the
second-largest auto insurer in California. The firm gave driver
safety a 20.65 percent weighting, but geography had a 34.6 percent
weighting.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies say they need to use geography in setting
rates because there are many more auto thefts in some parts of the
state than in others. They also note that medical costs and costs
of auto repairs are exceptionally high in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco city attorney Louise Renne was pleased with the
ruling. ``The insurance companies set rates that are
discriminatory,'' she said.

FOOD MUST BE SECURE FROM BEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT PURDUE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ Trouble's ``bruin'' in the Inyo National
Forest this summer for hikers who don't properly tend to their bear
necessities. Officials for the popular Eastern Sierra backcountry
are vigorously enforcing a policy that requires backpackers to
secure their food from bears throughout the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas are ``infested'' with black bears that find it far
easier to gorge on human food than forage for themselves, said
Diana Pietrasanta, a U.S. Forest Service wilderness manager in Lone
Pine. The regulations are designed to keep bears from becoming
habituated to people, which often has dangerous consequences for
both the four-legged critters and their two-legged counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Campers must store their chow in plastic bear-proof canisters,
counterbalance food bags in a tree (the traditional method) or take
other bear-aware precautions. (Few permanent metal bear boxes are
available outside of the national parks that the Inyo National
Forest accesses.)
</P>
<P>
   Violators could suffer the double-whammy of having their rations
raided and getting slapped with a citation that calls for a fine of
not more than $5,000 and/or six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were in education mode, so we wrote very few
citations,'' Pietrasanta said. ``But this year I've written one and
it's only June.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hikers have acquiesced to the new mandate, officials said,
but some have to be reminded that they are venturing into the
bears' backyard, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone arguing with a guy who didn't want the
government telling him what to do in the backcountry.... but (the
policy) is for both the bears and you,'' Pietrasanta explained.
``If we don't tell you there's a bear problem and what to do about
it, your $300 tent gets ripped up, all your food gets eaten and you
have to leave. And, by the end of the summer, the bear is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the popular Kearsarge Pass Trail through Onion Valley west
of Independence, where 4,000 hikers tromped last year, backpackers
are required to carry their food in bear-proof containers. Wildlife
agents were forced to kill two aggressive bears there last summer,
including one that tore into a camper's tent and swatted him in the
face.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-pound, 13-ounce canisters can be rented locally at
Adventure 16 in Tarzana, (818) 345-4266 ($8 for the first day and
$2 every day after that), and REI in Northridge, (818) 831-5555
($15 first day; $4 per day afterward for nonmembers). They are also
available at U.S. Forest Service stations in Lone Pine, Bishop and
Mammoth Lakes for $5 a day or $73.50 retail plus tax.

 Silicon Valley's Word Wizard   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Chasms, tornadoes and gorillas may sound like good subjects for
National Geographic specials. But they're also terms used to
describe marketing strategies for technology companies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who popularized this decidedly nontech vocabulary is
Geoffrey Moore, a 51-year-old author/consultant who is emerging as
the heir-apparent to Silicon Valley's pioneer marketing guru, Regis
McKenna.
</P>
<P>
   In three best-selling books _ ``Crossing the Chasm,'' ``Inside
the Tornado'' and ``The Gorilla Game,'' Moore has used catchy
metaphors to describe the life cycles of companies and markets in
the turbulent world of high tech.
</P>
<P>
   According to (Geoffrey) Moore's law, a chasm is the gulf that
must be crossed as a company goes from a small market of customers
who embrace new technology to the larger mainstream market.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado is a ``hypergrowth'' market that many companies
encounter once they cross the chasm.
</P>
<P>
   The gorilla is the company that dominates a technology, such as
Microsoft, Intel and Cisco. They are the equivalent of the
600-pound gorilla that sleeps any where it wants to, Moore says.
Everybody else in the sector is either a monkey, trying to copy the
gorilla, or a chimp pushing a different kind of technology.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Moore cites the semiconductor industry, where
Intel is the gorilla with its Pentium chips. Motorola and Digital
Equipment Corp., which have chips based on alternative technology,
are the chimps, while AMD and Cyrix, with their Pentium clones, are
the monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moore's previous efforts, ``The Gorilla Game'' is riding
high on business best-seller lists. Published in March, it was
third on the Business Week list this month.
</P>
<P>
   But while the first two books focused on marketing strategies,
``The Gorilla Game'' examines the way technology companies perform
in the stock market _ and how investors can spot the hottest
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Moore enlisted two co-authors who provided investment expertise
to go with his marketing acumen _ Tom Kippula, a partner in Moore's
consulting firm, the Chasm Group; and Paul Johnson, managing
director of equity research at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   The result of their collaboration is a common-sense primer with
straightforward advice:
</P>
<P>
   _Find markets making a transition into hypergrowth.
</P>
<P>
   _Buy a basket of stocks that represents all the companies that
have a clear shot at being the gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   _As the gorilla emerges, sell off the rest of the basket and
consolidate your holdings in the gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   _Plan to hold the gorilla for the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   _Sell the gorilla only when a new category, based on an
alternative technology, threatens to eradicate its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gorilla Game'' is aimed at individual investors, says
Moore. ``The audience is people who want to use the stock market as
part of their personal financial plan. The book offers a safe and
sane way to play in high-tech markets assuming you don't have very
much money and can't afford to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a burly fellow with a ready smile, has risen above the
crowd of high-tech strategists and consultants largely because he's
a clear communicator. That requires a solid grounding in language,
which he has, having received degrees in English literature from
Stanford University and the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ```Renaissance man' is an overused term, but if I were going to
label somebody that, out of all the people I know in Silicon
Valley, it would be Geoff,'' says Tom Byers, who teaches
entrepreneurship at Stanford and has known Moore for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moore started out as an English professor at Olivet College in
Michigan. After four years of that, however, he and his wife,
Marie, decided they'd rather live in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years starting in 1978, Moore worked in marketing for
three technology companies, none of which exist today. In 1987 he
started consulting, and shortly thereafter joined McKenna's
company, the leading public relations firm in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an exciting intellectual time,'' he says. ``There was
an enormous demand for high-tech strategy consulting, Regis had a
very good reputation and we got a lot of great clients and problems
to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, HarperBusiness, which has since published all of
Moore's books, released ``Crossing the Chasm.'' That created enough
interest in Moore to let him start his own consulting firm the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Mateo, the Chasm Group today is six people strong
and has worked for many of the big names in technology, including
IBM, Netscape, Intel, Sun Microsystems and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Moore earlier this year joined the board of Documentum, a
Pleasanton tech company that modeled its marketing strategy on his
tactics. He also recently joined venture capital firm Mohr, Davidow
Ventures as a venture partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us (at the Chasm Group) are joining boards and getting
involved with venture firms,'' he says. ``We're sharing this huge
wave of excitement in high tech. I don't know when it will crest,
but it hasn't yet.''

 Another Day, Another Merger _ Welcome to the New Economy   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The phone rang at 3 a.m. yesterday, rousting PR guy Andrew Johnson
from his bed in Antioch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was TCI corporate in Colorado, telling him to get dressed and
drive to Walnut Creek, because AT&AMP;T was buying its way into the
cable business and it was Johnson's job to inform TCI's Bay Area
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to another day in the New Economy, where the megamergers
just keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson arrived at TCI's offices at 4:10 a.m. and relayed an
e-mail from TCI President Leo Hindery to the general managers at
all 128 TCI franchises in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The managers were supposed to reassure TCI's 4,000 local
employees that no ``downsizing'' was expected if and when AT&AMP;T
became their boss.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery, The Chronicle's former chief finance officer, was still
on the phone late last night, explaining the deal from New York,
where he's spent the last 12 days cloistered with his negotiating
counterpart, AT&AMP;T Chief Financial Officer Dan Somers.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery said the seeds of the current merger were planted in
January, when TCI sold AT&AMP;T its share of the Teleport
Communications Group, a large-scale Internet service provider.
Meeting the AT&AMP;T brass for that and other deals forged the personal
relationships that led to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is you date around, you date around, and after a
while, you say, `What the heck, let's get married,''' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Self-fulfilling prophecy? &LR;  It's no accident that deals like
this occur in spurts. Morgan Stanley investment banker Rex Golding
told me recently that whenever a big merger occurs, bankers pay
discrete calls on other firms in the same industry, trying to match
them with potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good for us to claim credit but our role is to
precipitate the mergers,'' Golding said.
</P>
<P>
   So you can bet dealmakers are out there now, pitching the
WorldComs and Sprints as well as the Comcasts and Cox Cables on the
virtues of telco-cable matchups _ and the dangers of staying
single.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  _ &UR; Whither goest antitrust? &LR;  While the merger wave continues
to surge, the political winds seem to have shifted against the
Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, each of which has
tackled one-half of the Wintel monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's appellate court ruling in favor of Microsoft was a
slap at the antitrust case Joel Klein's DOJ lawyers have brought
against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, lawyers in the Beltway are buzzing
about a recent op-ed piece in the Chicago Tribune that ripped Klein
for pursuing a ``weak'' case against Microsoft while approving huge
mergers like the $70 billion Citicorp-Travelers deal. It wasn't the
opinion that caused the stir, but the fact that op-ed writer Steve
Frank is an attorney in the DOJ's civil appellate division.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel was sounding aggrieved yesterday, after the
Washington Post reported that the FTC had indirectly tried to win
over public opinion, by sending a pro-government briefing paper to
antitrust experts likely to get quoted by reporters. (You can find
the paper at  &LR; www.ljx.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is against the FTC's rules,'' said Intel
spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Klein and his FTC counterpart Robert Pitofsky may
feel like the legendary King Canute who drowned trying to halt the
tides. Lawrence Sullivan, emeritus professor of antitrust law at UC
Berkeley, said despite their legal and PR setbacks, the antitrust
duo are right to buck the merger wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klein is not a crazy, neither is Pitofsky,'' Sullivan said.
``They're thoughtful, cautious people who deserve support and
encouragement'' as they try to figure out how 19th century
antitrust plays in 21st century industries.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Magic words: &LR;  Personally, I say to heck with Sullivan and his
fellow travelers in D.C. It's the New Economy, stupid. Antitrust
drools. One-stop shopping rules.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that one rationale for the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal, the notion that
synergies and efficiencies result when consumers can get everything
from Seinfeld reruns to Web pages to phone calls from one
brand-name corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact once the dust settles, AT&AMP;T should acquire Domino's,
Costco and Sears, then merge the whole shebang into Citicorp, so we
can order everything from pizzas to microwaves, and debit the
transaction to our AT&AMP;T tele-banking account.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's one-stop shopping! Accept no substitutes.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL PATIENTS` RIGHTS PLAN

(ps) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans unveiled a long-awaited proposal
on Wednesday to define patients' rights and set uniform nationwide
standards for health insurance, especially health maintenance
organizations. The insurance industry immediately denounced the
proposal, saying it would increase costs for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the House Republicans, who have been working behind closed
doors for four months on legislation to address voters' anger at
the constraints of managed health care, found themselves in the
same position as President Clinton four years ago: in the
cross-hairs of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican proposals would guarantee coverage of
emergency medical care, assure open communication between doctors
and patients, and allow women in an HMO to go directly to
obstetricians and gynecologists, without getting prior approval.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in the Senate and House said the House
Republican plan did not do nearly enough to protect consumers, but
the reaction from the White House was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to President Clinton, said, ``The
House Republican proposal is a pleasant surprise coming from the
very people who said just six months ago that we'd get a patients'
bill of rights over their dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ``We are pleased
that the Republican leadership has recognized the need for federal
action,'' though she added that Democratic bills were superior.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure whether any of the proposals will become
law. But there is plenty of common ground if members of the two
parties want to strike a compromise. More and more Republicans say
they want to be able to respond in some way to the concerns of
voters, and to the daily attacks by Democrats on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert, R.-Ill., chairman of the 15-member group
that drafted the House Republican proposal, said, ``It was pretty
evident in listening to our constituents collectively that there
was concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, interest in legislation to regulate HMOs has been
bubbling for monts in both parties. But conservatives like Sen.
Don Nickles, R.-Okla., the party's assistant leader, express grave
doubts about new federal requirements of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican plan would also enable consumers to
challenge the denial of medical services by filing appeals with an
an independent panel of medical experts. Patients could not
necessarily sue an HMO for damages, but they could get quick
assistance from the courts _ much more than is now available _ if
an HMO or an insurance company improperly denied benefits that had
been promised to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans would have to pay a monetary penalty for each day
they refused to pay a claim or provide a service to which consumers
were entitled under the terms of their insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and lawmakers of both parties are clamoring for
federal standards to protect patients. But Bill Gradison, a former
Republican congressman who is president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said on Wednesday, ``The public would be
better served by no congressional action.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradison described the House Republican proposals as ``a
mishmash of cobbled-together ideas that are guaranteed to raise
consumers' costs, reduce choice and generate more federal
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising statement, Gradison said ``we are equally
opposed'' to the three major patient-protection bills: the House
Republican measure; a Democratic bill written by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, and a
bipartisan measure drafted by Rep. Charlie Norwood, a Republican
from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood endorsed Hastert's bill, saying he had gotten 75 percent
of what he sought. Norwood, like many Democrats, wanted to do more
to let consumers sue HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents HMOs, offered a more nuanced assessment
than Gradison. She said the House Republican plan ``moves in a
better direction than what has been discussed thus far on Capitol
Hill'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While less onerous than the Kennedy-Dingell proposal or the
Norwood bill, this proposal still tilts toward a reliance on
government mandates,'' she said of the House Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gradison said that the insurance industry was not planning
anything like the $15 million ``Harry and Louise'' television
advertisements that helped kill Clinton's plan to guarantee
coverage for all Americans in 1994. But Gradison said, ``I would
not accept the idea that there will be legislation enacted this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical Association,
said, ``The Hastert task force represents a step in the right
direction, but it does not go far enough'' in making HMOs
accountable for the clinical decisions they make.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care in Santa
Monica, Calif., said patients would not be fully protected until
they could sue HMOs and recover damages for injuries caused by the
denial of medically necessary care. Another consumer advocate,
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said the
Republican proposal was ``an election-year stunt, a ploy to enable
some members of Congress to claim they did something on managed
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, the chief deputy whip for House Republicans, said he
was not worried by such negative reaction. ``We tried not to pander
to any one group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans provided a detailed description of their
proposals today and said they would introduce a bill soon after the
Fourth of July recess. Speaker Newt Gingrich worked on the
proposal, and aides said he might try to take the bill directly to
the House floor, bypassing the usual process of committee hearings
and votes through which legislation is normally refined.
</P>
<P>
   HMO lobbyists, while not thrilled with the prospect of federal
regulation, are pragmatic. They said they were willing to negotiate
with Congress, to fend off what they see as the most onerous
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican initiative includes these elements:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs and other health plans would have to pay for emergency
care in any situation that a ``prudent lay person'' would regard as
an emergency. Democrats agree on this.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs could not interfere with doctors' ability to tell
patients about any treatment option, regardless of whether the
health plan offers or pays for such services. Democrats support
this idea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents could choose pediatricians, rather than family
doctors, to coordinate care for children in an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers could, for an extra premium, buy coverage allowing
them to use doctors outside the network of physicians formed by an
HMO. Democrats say they too want to expand choices for consumers,
but would do it differently.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are also proposing several devices to expand
the number of people with health insurance. Under one proposal,
small businesses and self-employed people could band together and
buy insurance through trade associations and professional
organizations. Another proposal would create regional supermarkets,
or ``health marts,'' where families could shop for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   State officials generally oppose such purchasing pools because
the new arrangements would be exempt from many state laws and
regulations, including requirement to cover of specific conditions
like maternity care or cancer screenings. Moreover, Glenn Pomeroy
of North Dakota, president of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, said the health marts could recruit healthy people
and avoid sick people by operating in certain geographic areas or
by refusing to cover services needed by people with costly
illnesses like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they could not accept a
House Republican proposal to set a $250,000 limit on damages for
pain and suffering in medical malpractice lawsuits. The House has
passed several bills to set such limits, but the Senate has
repeatedly refused to go along.

 Mylan Fleshing Out Deal for Penederm   By Carl T. Hall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Penederm Inc., a Bay Area skin-products and drug-delivery company,
is being acquired by generic-drug giant Mylan Laboratories Inc. in
a stock deal worth about $205 million .
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mylan, the largest producer of off-patent drugs in the United
States, has been trying to jump into the market for higher-profit,
brand-name drugs. Foster City-based Penederm gives Mylan three
dermatology products on the market and several more in development,
including two in the final stages of clinical testing.
</P>
<P>
   Mylan is paying nearly a third more than Penederm's recent
market value. Analysts said the price did not seem out of line
given premiums paid in other recent drug-industry takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really paying for a future product stream here,''
said Eugene Melnitchenko, a stock analyst at Sutro &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles. ``Mylan has been trying to diversify away from purely
generic products, and Penederm does have a decent pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Mylan said it planned no layoffs and intended to beef up
Penederm's clinical research efforts. Penederm's delivery
technology may be incorporated in some Mylan product candidates now
in development.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Malchow, chief executive at Penederm, said the deal ``will
enhance significantly Penederm's ability to pursue its
product-development and marketing plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been approved by directors of both companies.
Penederm shareholder approval also is required before it can take
effect, expected by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Penederm stockholders would get 0.68 shares of Mylan for every
Penederm share. That made the deal worth about $205 million, or
$21.89 a share, based on stock prices Tuesday, when the terms were
made final.
</P>
<P>
   Mylan stock edged down 44 cents yesterday to close at $31.75,
while Penederm rose $4.75, or 30.2 percent, to close at $20.50.
</P>
<P>
   Penederm's existing products are Avita, a topical medicine for
acne; Mentax, for fungal infections; and Acticin, for scabies.
Mentax has been marketed through a partnership between Penederm and
Mylan's Bertek Pharmaceuticals Inc. subsidiary, which plans to take
over marketing all Penederm products once the deal closes.

 Conference Focuses on Women in Tech   By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
One small but telling sign of the growing influence of women in
technology: The Santa Clara Convention Center placed Boston ferns
in the men's urinals this week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The convention center had to turn the men's rooms into women's
rooms for the fourth annual Women in Technology International
conference this week. The ferns were designed to cover up the fact
that the convention center didn't have enough rest rooms for the
4,500 women who will attend the three-day conference, which ends
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WITI's mission is to get women into technical fields and keep
them there. And that's still a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this year's record attendance at WITI _ only 2,500
attended last year _ the percentage of U.S. electrical engineers
and computer analysts/scientists who are women has barely budged in
the past decade. The majority of women at the conference were in
fields such as marketing, sales and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to encourage young girls,'' said Carolyn Leighton,
founder and director of WITI, &UR;  &LR; which is based in Sherman Oaks.
``The only messages they get from the media are about how women can
balance career and family; they rarely see women talking about
computer products or something purely technical.''
</P>
<P>
   Leighton founded the nonprofit group in 1989 as an e-mail
network for women technologists. Today it is a professional
association with 6,000 members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, which had sessions on Java and e-commerce as
well as career development tracks, speaker after speaker emphasized
the need for women in technology to find and serve as role models.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In her keynote speech, Autodesk Inc. chief executive Carol
Bartz described watching her grandmother whack the head off of a
rattlesnake in a Wisconsin barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to have someone to show me how to do something
difficult and move on,''said Bartz, who worked for Digital
Equipment Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. before moving to
Autodesk.
</P>
<P>
   Bartz said the women in the audience should be encouraged by the
prevalence of technology in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Images like the computer-generated ``dancing baby'' on the Fox
television show ``Ally McBeal'' (which is created with Autodesk
software) have made technology accessible to everyone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her upbeat focus, Bartz said she sometimes gets
``depressed'' about how underrepresented women are in science and
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   One attendee said that while events like WITI can cut down on
female engineers' sense of isolation, the real problem starts in
grade school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so trite now to say that girls are discouraged in math
classes, but it's true.'' said Stacey Blaschke, an engineer and
owner of Computer Matters, a Laguna Beach consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Blaschke, who has a computer science degree from California
Polytechnic University, said one of her good friends was told by
her calculus professor to switch majors, ``just for asking a few
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is a familiar one to researchers who are trying to
pinpoint reasons for the relative lack of women in technical jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Two main causes are the fact that fewer women enter technical
fields than men, and they also drop out at a greater rate,
according to New York research firm Catalyst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time to make a scientist,''said Jennifer
Allyn, an associate with Catalyst who is working on a study of
women in technology.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also attracting attention in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The House has passed the Women in Science, Engineering and
Technology Development Act and it heads to the education and
workforce committee this week. The so-called Wisetech bill would
allocate $750,000 for a commission to study barriers that women
face in technical fields and make recommendations on recruiting and
retaining women scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the brainchild of Representative Constance Morella,
R-Md., who said she wrote it when she learned about the dearth of
women in technical fields.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get more girls interested in technology is to give
them more hands-on experience.
</P>
<P>
   The WITI conference spotlighted two such programs: Advocates for
Women in Science, Engineering and Mathematics, a Portland,
Ore.-based science and math advocacy program for girls aged 11-18;
and Design Your Future, an Autodesk initiative that sponsors
computer-assisted design contests for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, a dozen girls from Bay Area middle schools showed
what they had learned through the Design Your Future program.
</P>
<P>
   As she created a software model of an intricate LEGO truck,
14-year-old Naomi Duben of San Rafael said, ``I really like
computers. I don't see why I couldn't do this as a job.'' &LR;

KING'S REPRESENTATIVES SECRETLY TAPED MEETINGS, LAWYER TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lawyer for a Lloyd's of London syndicate testified
Wednesday in Don King's insurance fraud trial that the promoter's
defense team secretly taped meetings last year aimed at settling a
related civil case.
</P>
<P>
   King and his company are being tried in federal court in
Manhattan, accused of filing a fraudulent insurance claim after a
Julio Cesar Chavez-Harold Brazier bout was canceled in 1991, and
the Lloyd's syndicate is suing to recover the $671,000 payment it
made.
</P>
<P>
   What the lawyer, Donald Cayea, and another syndicate lawyer,
William Dunnegan, said during the settlement meetings is a matter
of dispute. King's defense claims that Cayea and Dunnegan tried to
broker a settlement in the civil suit by offering to provide
evidence that could exculpate Don King Productions for repayment of
the $671,000 claim.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Baruch Weiss, an assistant U.S.
attorney for the Southern District, Cayea testified that no tape
recorder was visible at two meetings that were recorded, and that
none of King's lawyers said that the meetings were being taped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you learned you were taped, you were upset?'' Weiss
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ethical violation,'' Cayea said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that although the tapes are a year old, King's
lawyers did not disclose their existence to the U.S. attorney's
office until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cayea testified that during settlement meetings, the Lloyd's of
London syndicate merely offered _ in the event of a settlement of
the civil case _ to give King's lawyers access to witnesses who
might help develop defense strategies for the criminal trial. Cayea
said it was standard procedure in settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   Cayea said he warned King's lawyers that the help that was
offered would not necessarily lead to an acquittal for King's
company.
</P>
<P>
   Closing statements in the case could be heard Thursday or
Friday. King's first trial on the charges in 1995 ended in a hung
jury. &QL;

COMMENTARY: WHEN CHARTER PLUS BASEBALL EQUALS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is constitutional reform the way Rube Goldberg
would have liked it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after many impassioned words and stirring
pronouncements _ one member compared the event to the Boston Tea
Party _ the New York City Council voted to place a referendum on
the future of Yankee Stadium on November's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum would ask voters whether the City Charter should
be amended to prevent public funds from being used to move the
stadium from the Bronx to Manhattan. If New Yorkers voted ``yes,''
it would mean no public funds could be used, while if they voted
``no,'' it would mean yes, public funds could be used.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the vote, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking at
a news conference Wednesday in Manhattan, denounced the proposed
referendum, calling it ``very, very bad government'' as well as
``an indication of a total lack of willingness to make difficult
decisions.'' Giuliani has made it clear that he will do everything
in his power, which turns out to be quite a bit, to keep the
council's referendum from coming to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he reiterated his position that proposals made by a
commission he has appointed to revise the City Charter will bump
the council's proposal on amending it off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a much better chance in court than they do,''
he said, anticipating where the dispute will end up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city's public advocate, Mark Green, at a news
conference of his own, denounced the mayor for forming a Charter
Revision Commission to foil the City Council's charter amendment.
Members of the mayor's commission have already stated that one of
the charter changes they will consider is eliminating his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This abuse of power won't stand up in a court of law or in the
court of public opinion,'' Green declared.
</P>
<P>
   With his job suddenly on the line, Green perhaps has the most
pressing reason to lament the bizarre connection between baseball
and charter revision. But everyone should be embarrassed by it.
</P>
<P>
   The council complains, with good reason, that the whole fight is
a result of the mayor's stubbornness. Giuliani, it contends, is not
acting in the public interest but rather on behalf of powerful
interests who would benefit from moving the stadium. The whole
point of the referendum, council members suggest, is to show how
unenthusiastic most New Yorkers are about the mayor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue in which the people have the right to be
heard,'' the City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, said Wednesday,
defending the stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, also with good reason, blames the City Council, and
in particular Vallone and his political ambitions. Giuliani has
frequently said he thinks Vallone is pushing the stadium referendum
simply as a way to raise Democratic voter turnout in November, when
the council speaker hopes to be the party's candidate for governor.
The mayor portrays himself and his Charter Revision Commission as a
necessary brake on this kind of legislative irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``everything then would be decided by
referendum and the deliberative process of executive and
legislative branch would end.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both sides are much more persuasive when hammering each
other than when trying to justify their own actions. Both were
astonishingly ready to escalate the argument over Yankee Stadium
into an argument over charter revision. And both had plenty of more
reasonable alternatives available.
</P>
<P>
   If the City Council does not want a new stadium to be built in
Manhattan, there are several points at which it could stop such a
plan. Most significant, it could just refuse to appropriate the
funds to finance it.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, if the mayor does not want to see voters turn down
a new stadium in a referendum, he could try to convince them that a
new stadium is actually a good idea. Instead, having pointed out
that the future of the stadium is a bogus excuse for a referendum,
he has turned around and supported an even more bogus proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he has offered rationales for charter revision, he has
never seriously tried to disguise the fact that his goal is to beat
the council at its own game.
</P>
<P>
   As Giuliani observed Wednesday, the issue of the stadium will be
resolved one day. But, as he also correctly noted, ``it's going to
take a little more thinking to figure out how to move to a more
responsible level of leadership.''

NASDAQ REPORTS A 6 PERCENT RISE IN UNCOVERED SHORT SALES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Open positions of short sales on the Nasdaq stock market rose 6
percent, to 2.09 billion shares, for the month that ended June 15,
the market said. The June short positions equal 3 days of average
trading volume on the Nasdaq, up from 2.46 days on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   For the second month, Worldcom had the largest short position on
the Nasdaq and the largest increase in short positions.
</P>
<P>
   Short positions in Worldcom totaled 116.95 million shares on
June 15, up 14.1 million shares, or 13.7 percent, from May 15. The
previous month, the short position rose by 28 million, or 37.4
percent, to 102.9 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom is awaiting government approvals to acquire MCI
Communications, the long-distance telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Short-sellers borrow, and then sell, shares whose price they
expect will fall. They profit if they can buy new shares at a lower
price to replace the borrowed ones. High short-interest positions
are often considered an indicator of bearish sentiment among
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But short interest can also increase as a result of complex
trading strategies involving options, futures and other
stock-related derivatives.
</P>

   The second-largest short position, and the second-largest
increase, was in Intel, the computer chip maker. &QL;

A THOUSAND (ISLAND) REASONS TO TAKE A HIKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRY WOOD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ The arrival of the summer backpacking
season in the Sierra Nevada mountain range is met by trekkers with
a combined sense of glee and irony.
</P>
<P>
   The cobwebs can finally be dusted off those trusty lug-sole
boots, but as maps are unfolded and routes are sketched out a
hurry-up-and-wait mentality soon sets in. For in years like this,
when El Nino-fueled storms pummeled the High Sierra with impossibly
deep banks of snow, backcountry passes remain glaciers well into
July _ or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like good ol' planning to help wait out the thaw.And
here's an idea for an overnight outing that could be altered to
serve as a day hike: a nearly 20-mile loop trip to Thousand Island
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   An overvisited Alpine gem, the Thousand Island area in Inyo
National Forest's Ansel Adams Wilderness still offers abundant
charms that make the journey worth the effort. If you plan to do
this as an overnighter, though, be sure you are in
better-than-average physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most gratifying routes to the lake (there are
several) originates northwest of Mammoth Lakes at Agnew Meadows,
via the Pacific Crest Trail or, as this portion of the PCT is known
locally, the High Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at a trailhead situated at nearly 8,400 feet _ and
equipped with a pit toilet and piped, potable water _ between the
Agnew Meadows campground and a nearby pack station, hikers begin,
and soon complete, the sharpest ascent of the entire trip. An early
start will ensure that most of the major climbing is done in the
shade.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the route turns northwest and hikers are granted a
panoramic view across the San Joaquin River valley to the imposing
Minarets and Volcanic Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   At an elevation of about 9,400 feet, walkers come to a splendid
viewpoint that visually positions distant Shadow Lake in the center
of an expansive series of serrated peaks and dramatic ridgelines.
Reaching this spot early in the day is reward enough for making an
early-morning start from the trailhead.
</P>
<P>
   The course's undulations from this point are moderate and the
views remain far-ranging and unimpeded for much of the 9{-mile
march to 9,833-foot Thousand Island Lake.
</P>
<P>
   As beautiful as the lake is itself, probably the loveliest spot
in its environs is its outlet, which northbound PCT hikers
encounter about a quarter-mile before reaching its eastern shore.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the outlet are abundant with Indian paint brush and
other wildflowers, which combine with rushing waters and the
towering backdrop of massive Banner Peak to offer a picturesque
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers may be tempted to test their skills. Careful where you
tread; this is fragile territory. It is a difficult place to leave,
even after you spend a long time absorbing all the beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Thousand Island Lake is justifiably closed to
camping. If you get a late start, you may have to find a campsite
prior to reaching this spot; several options appear once you pass
marshy Badger Lakes. Other layover possibilities are found south of
Thousand Island Lake at Emerald and Ruby lakes along the John Muir
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, continue south on the JMT to stunning 9,678-foot
Garnet Lake, found 2{ miles from Thousand Island Lake. Camping is
also prohibited here. The lake outlet, traversed by a rickety
wooden bridge, is a popular subject among backcountry photographers
_ and brook trout anglers. The vantage here is nothing if not
sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers who are tiring may opt for the trail that wanders
northeast of Garnet's outlet to cut 1{ miles off the trip's total
distance ... at the expense of much of the high-country scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The best route, however, is to continue south from Garnet, where
travelers will spot a T in the trail in 2{ miles. To the west lies
9,265-foot Ediza Lake _ definitely worth a visit if you have the
energy, but add 6 miles round-trip to your journey.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing east from the junction for 1 mile, hikers will reach
8,737-foot Shadow Lake in a large bowl formed where Shadow Creek
empties. (Camping is forbidden around the entirety of the lake.)
</P>
<P>
   From Shadow Lake's west end, trekkers drop 2 miles to Olaine
Lake on the valley floor (8,000 feet) and walk 2 miles along the
River Trail back to Agnew Meadows to complete the loop.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth Lakes is the jumping-off point for Agnew Meadows and the
trailhead to Thousand Island Lakes. From Los Angeles, drive north
about five hours via Highways 14 and 395. At Highway 203, travel
west to the famous ski-resort town. Turn right at Minaret Summit
Road, following the signs to Mammoth Mountain. Here things get a
little tricky.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Agnew Meadows is closed and not expected to open
until at least next week. But that's not the biggest dilemma. This
is: The backcountry remains buried under snow _ with drifts in some
spots exceeding depths of six feet _ and won't clear until mid-July
or later. The good news? That just gives you more time to secure a
wilderness permit, which is required for overnight trips
originating in the Inyo National Forest from the last Friday in
June through Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Permits are $3 per person and can be reserved by calling (888)
374-3773 at least two days in advance of a trip or up to six months
beforehand. Be prepared to give dates and points of entry and exit,
as well as up to four overnight destinations on your itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew Meadows and Thousand Island Lakes is found on the Devil's
Postpile 15-minute series topographic map and Tom Harrison's
``Trail Map of the Mammoth High Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Road and trail information can be obtained by visiting or
calling the Mammoth Ranger Station and Visitor Center in Mammoth
Lakes, (760) 924-5500. It is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Island Lake can also be accessed from Reds Meadow,
farther south from Agnew Meadows on Minaret Summit Road, and from
Silver Lake on the June Lake Loop (Highway 158).

BAN ON MONO COUNTY NIGHT FISHING REINSTATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Calif. _ Officials concerned that night-fishing in
Mono County is unsafe have won a reversal of the recent action
permitting 24-hour angling in the popular Eastern Sierra
destination.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting Thursday in Bridgeport, the state Fish and Game
Commission approved emergency action to reinstate a ban on
nighttime fishing. The request was made by the Mono County Board of
Supervisors and was not opposed by the Department of Fish and Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that this has been a tradition in Mono County
for some years and one that the community wants to see
maintained,'' said Tim Farley, chief of the DFG's Inland Fisheries
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The order was unanimously passed by the commission. It is
expected to receive approval by the state Office of Administrative
Law _ the next step in the process _ and take effect July 1. If
approved, Mono County will once again be the only Sierra Fishing
District where angling is allowed only from one hour before sunrise
to one hour after sunset. (Night-fishing in Mono went on the books
March 1.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The night-fishing issue is not a biological issue,'' Farley
said. ``Objections to it in Mono County appear to be based
primarily on local safety and security concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue was the integrity of the customary flare that is
shot over Crowley Lake each last Saturday of April at 5 a.m. to
signify the start of trout season in the Eastern Sierra. Now that
tradition is preserved.

YOUTH ISN'T SERVED BY VORACIOUS NBA DRAFTING STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish I could get excited.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce? Hey, I like Paul Pierce. Why did he slip to 10?
'Cause it's still a judgment; that's why. Teams ahead of the Boston
Celtics all wanted somebody else. There is no so-called right
answer. There are wrong answers, as we all know, but there is no
right answer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce was there when the Celtics picked, and Rick Pitino
was up there beaming. ``Last year we got a little unlucky,'' he
told the FleetCenter crowd Wednesday night. ``This year we got
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it sounds great. Paul Pierce is a pure small forward
who averaged 20 points a game for one of the premier college
basketball programs of them all. He was a great high school player
and he was a great college player, and if Rick Pitino is as lucky
as thinks he is, he could become a very good NBA player. If he's
what he appears to be, the Celtics have three brilliant young
mid-sized talents under the age of 23 in Antoine Walker, Ron
Mercer, and Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   (This is where I could get into the whole Walker business, but
let's table that for at least 24 hours, OK?)
</P>
<P>
   Great. I hope it all works out. But it's gotten to the point
where the NBA draft has become one of the most depressing nights of
the year on my sporting calendar.
</P>
<P>
   What we had last evening was another example of the beast
devouring its young. We have seen the steady deterioration of play
in this league, and the decline will continue with the addition of
more immature, incomplete, and almost certainly misguided players
to the mix. Listening to the comments of Hubie Brown, John
Thompson, and Rick Majerus on TNT Wednesday night, you'd think that
every one of the first 10 players selected was on his way to sure
stardom. Uh-uh. Isn't gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the first 10 players selected in the 1998 draft were
underclassmen. The only four-year player chosen was Raef LaFrentz,
who went at No. 3 to Denver. First pick Michael Olokowandi, a
departure from the new norm since he is a mature 23 years old, came
to these shores from England three years ago. He played three years
of American college basketball, but he is a legitimate academic
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else came out early, or, in the case of German Dirk
Nowitzki, didn't play here at all. We already know what to expect
when he decides to play here (he might choose to wait for a year of
two, although Pitino said he would have been ``available to the
Boston Celtics'' had that situation materialized). Doc Rivers
explained Nowitzki on TV Wednesday night. He is a European, which
means he would have been utterly clueless on defense.
</P>
<P>
   These kids are really amazing sometimes. TNT's Craig Sager asked
Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor why he was in the best shape of his life
now after spending three years at 300-plus pounds at Michigan. The
kid said something about there being only 30 games a year in
college. Huh? It's OK to be fat for your college coach, but you'd
better get in shape for your pro career just because they play 82
games? I don't think that's the answer Oscar Robertson, Jerry West,
John Havlicek, or Joe Dumars would have given, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento made Pierce possible for Boston by taking a 6-1 point
guard from Florida named Jason Williams. Sacramento needed a point
guard badly. How badly? The Kings needed one badly enough to take a
kid who was originally signed by Providence, then went to Marshall
for one year before transferring to Florida, where he was kicked
off the team after 20 games during his one and only season as a
Gator for violating ``team and athletic policy.'' Sounds like a
very coachable kid. What he needs is for some coach to give him an
hourly spanking. What he'll now receive as the seventh pick in the
draft is a guaranteed contract for approximately $1.5 million
annually over the next three years. What a country.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes was the eighth pick. He spent one year at St.
Louis, where he averaged 20 points while shooting 41 percent from
the floor. He is a nice talent, but is he ready in any way for the
NBA? Probably not. But he's the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   And what, by the way, does it say about the quality of the big
men available that the No. 1 pick in the entire draft is a young
man from Nigeria who wasn't even playing basketball four years ago?
Perhaps Michael Olokowandi is the next Hakeem Olajuwon. Perhaps
he's the next Dikembe Mutombo. But there is no guarantee he won't
be the next Yinka Dare.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino loves the idea of Paul Pierce, and that's fine. But
he also loved the idea of Chauncey Billups last year. Maybe there
was a reason Paul Pierce dropped. I just know I'd feel better about
Paul Pierce, Mike Bibby, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, and Robert
Traylor if they had gone through four years of college so they
could enter the NBA as better men.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been lost. With each passing year, the NBA draft
disgorges more and more incomplete players. You see the results. No
NBA person can look me in the eye and say it's as entertaining and
satisfying a league as it was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry. I used to love the draft. Now I hate it.

BOSTON TURNS TO REALITY AFTER DNC VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now that the Democratic Convention site committee has
moved on to inspect other contenders, Boston can focus on what it
needs to do if it should actually land the 2000 convention.
</P>
<P>
   What began last year as a glimmer in the eye of Mayor Thomas M.
Menino after a tour of Atlanta, has blossomed into a viable
possibility, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   For months, city officials have been sweating the details of
hotel rooms and transportation, telecommunications, and computer
plugs. But as far as the visitors were concerned, Boston seems to
be able to &UR;  &LR; handle all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things you can't put on an Excel spread
sheet, like how much is the city willing to go the extra mile,''
said Joseph Andrew, chairman of the site panel. Boston showed
marathon potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that Tommy's town couldn't be better, and Tommy's
tour is tops,'' said the Indiana state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor himself could not sound more confident. ``We are one
team and we are ready,'' he said at a farewell breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the stellar showing of these past few days, the
reality is that Boston still has two high hurdles to conquer in
order to host a successful convention of that scale: Raising $30
million in private funds for the four-day party, and overcoming a
political deck that has always been stacked against this Democratic
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   No Democrat has ever won the presidency without carrying
Massachusetts, so the traditional wisdom has directed the
convention to swing states and regions where the party needs a
boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's the wisest place for them to have the
convention for the ticket,'' said Ron Kaufman, Massachusetts native
and Republican National Committee member. ``If the Democrats are in
the position of having to drum up support in Massachusetts, they're
in deep trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But New York and Chicago have won the convention several times,
neither of them offering strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big political picture still has to play itself out,'' said
Chuck Campion, a former Democratic campaign operative now with the
Dewey Square Group. ``They went to New York twice for the Democrats
and there wasn't a political argument to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mountain of money to be raised, Kaufman said the
business community has to be convinced it's worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Campion agreed that Boston would have to change its style in
that regard. ``We're not a city that usually jumps up and down to
get in on things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for the city dwarfs that contribution, with an
estimated $150 million in direct spending and twice that amount in
long-term benefits that would come from publicity. While
Massachusetts consistently tops the fund-raising charts for
Democratic candidates, the business community here has little
practice with huge outlays for marketing the city for conventions.
The financial services industry, which is sizable here, has been
slow to reach for its wallet, according to city sources.
</P>
<P>
   So far, BankBoston, Fleet Bank, and John Hancock have been
generous in supporting the city's bid with checks and by sponsoring
events like Tuesday's breakfast in the John Hancock Tower.
Companies large and small were ready with donations of food and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Others gave their time _ Bobby Orr mixed drinks in the Reebok
box at Fenway; M.L. Carr greeted the group in the Celtics locker
room at the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get it, we need to start the fund-raising that day,''
said Kelley Quinn, spokeswoman for the Boston Redevelopment
Authority. ``All the people on the fray will have to step up to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the city has emerged as a contender for the convention,
business support has mushroomed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit-bounce will probably be better than the
(presidential) candidate will get'' after the national convention,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Boston has passed the technical test, with
21,000 hotel rooms. In fact, the executive housing at Harvard
University turned out to be the site panel's favorite. Wowed by the
computer hookups, fax machines, and conference tables available for
each of the Harvard rooms, the panelists urged the city to ask some
of the other top academic institutions in the area to see if they
have similar space available, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet Center turned out to be the darling of the committee
as well. Plans need to be made for moving 100 buses full of people
away from the arena in rapid succession, however, and parking
supplies in the neighborhood have to be assessed, Quinn said. Other
details remain, but they are manageable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demonstrated far and above that we have the ability and
enthusiasm to do this,'' said Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Donald R. Sweitzer, former finance and political director for
the DNC, has been watching Boston from Washington, remembering how
his site panel shocked everyone by choosing Atlanta over Houston
because Mayor Andrew Young was so enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Boston's chances are pretty good,'' he said. But the
decision in many ways is out of the city's hands, Sweitzer said.
``It's one part technical, one part political, and one part rub
your belly.''

OWNERS TO KICK OFF A FLURRY OF EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Nine days after the Stanley Cup finals, the National
Hockey League treadmill speeds up this week with an important
owners meeting, the annual awards ceremony, the expansion draft for
the Nashville team and the entry draft for 18-year-old amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   After that, team executives will return to their offices next
week for the beginning of the free-agent signing season. Training
camps open in about 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, meeting as the board of governors on Thursday, are
expected to pass several rules designed to increase offense.
Assuming they follow the recommendations of their general managers,
they will move the goal lines out two feet, from 11 to 13 feet from
the back boards, will reduce the size of the goal crease so
attacking forwards can get closer to the net and will assign two
referees, instead of one, for a limited number of games.
</P>
<P>
   They may also discuss a proposal to award three points for a
victory, instead of two, if won in regulation time. An overtime
victory would be worth two points and an overtime defeat worth one.
</P>
<P>
   And the governors are likely to create the Maurice Richard
trophy to honor the leading goal scorer. In addition, the board
might learn of candidates to replace Brian Burke, who left his
position as NHL senior vice president and director of hockey
operations to take a job as president and general manager of the
Vancouver Canucks. One candidate is Colin Campbell, a former
Rangers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Although the league is adding four expansion teams over the next
three years, some owners say they are losing money. The players
association recently announced that the average player salary last
season was $1.168 million, up more than 18 percent in one year and
up from $572,161 in 1993-94, the season before the 15-week lockout.
Commissioner Gary Bettman, who recently said the vital signs of the
business are good, is likely to discuss these and other numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek of Buffalo is the favorite to repeat as winner of
the Hart and the Vezina trophies, which go to the most valuable
player and the best goalie, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The other Hart candidates are Teeumu Selanne of Anaheim and
Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh. The other Vezina candidates are Martin
Brodeur of the Devils and Tom Barrasso of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for the Norris trophy, given to the best defenseman,
are Niklas Lidstrom of Detroit, Rob Blake of Los Angeles and Chris
Pronger of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Calder trophy, for best rookie, will go to either to Sergei
Samsonov of Boston, Patrik Elias of the Devils or Mattias Ohlund of
Vancouver. Wayne Gretzky of the Rangers is one of three candidates
for the Lady Byng trophy for skill and sportsmanship. The Adams
trophy, given to the coach of the year, will probably go to Pat
Burns of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The party moves to Buffalo, N.Y., for the expansion draft on
Friday in which the Nashville Predators and their general manager,
David Poile, will choose 26 players from the 26 established teams.
Poile is a close friend of Neil Smith, the president and general
manager of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been speculated that Poile will choose as one of his
three goalies Mike Richter of the Rangers, who can become an
unrestricted free agent July 1. By choosing him, and making no
attempt to sign him, Poile would acquire for his team the rights to
a second-round draft choice in 1999 as compensation for Richter's
signing with another team.
</P>
<P>
   And Nashville's choosing of Richter would protect the Rangers
from losing another goalie in the 1999 expansion draft, when
Atlanta joins, because a team cannot lose two goalies to expansion
drafts in two successive years.
</P>
<P>
   The entry draft, Saturday in Marine Midland Arena, is likely to
feature center Vincent Lecavalier of Rimouski in the Quebec League
as the top pick. Tampa Bay chooses first. The Rangers choose
seventh, the Islanders ninth, the Devils 26th.
</P>
<P>
   As for free agents, they can take bids starting next Wednesday.
Among the unrestricted are Richter of the Rangers, Doug Gilmour of
the Devils, Brett Hull of St. Louis, Ron Francis of Pittsburgh and
Steve Duchesne of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the restricted are Blake of Los Angeles, Dimitri Khristich
of Boston, Aleksei Zhitnik of Buffalo, Sandis Ozolinsh of Colorado,
Tomas Holmstrom of Detroit, Curtis Joseph of Edmonton, Doug Weight
of Edmonton, Saku Koivu of Montreal, Scott Niedermayer of the
Devils, Kenny Johnsson, Zigmund Palffy and Trevor Linden of the
Islanders, Rod Brind'Amour of Philadelphia, Pierre Turgeon of St.
Louis and Joe Juneau of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Teams signing restricted free agents risk owing up to five
first-round draft choices as compensation. &QL;

more immature, incomplete, and almost certainly misguided players
to the mix. Listening to the comments of Hubie Brown, John
Thompson, and Rick Majerus on TNT Wednesday night, you'd think that
every one of the first 10 players selected was on his way to sure
stardom. Uh-uh. Isn't gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the first 10 players selected in the 1998 draft were
underclassmen. The only four-year player chosen was Raef LaFrentz,
who went at No. 3 to Denver. First pick Michael Olokowandi, a
departure from the new norm since he is a mature 23 years old, came
to these shores from England three years ago. He played three years
of American college basketball, but he is a legitimate academic
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else came out early, or, in the case of German Dirk
Nowitzki, didn't play here at all. We already know what to expect
when he decides to play here (he might choose to wait for a year of
two, although Pitino said he would have been ``available to the
Boston Celtics'' had that situation materialized). Doc Rivers
explained Nowitzki on TV Wednesday night. He is a European, which
means he would have been utterly clueless on defense.
</P>
<P>
   These kids are really amazing sometimes. TNT's Craig Sager asked
Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor why he was in the best shape of his life
now after spending three years at 300-plus pounds at Michigan. The
kid said something about there being only 30 games a year in
college. Huh? It's OK to be fat for your college coach, but you'd
better get in shape for your pro career just because they play 82
games? I don't think that's the answer Oscar Robertson, Jerry West,
John Havlicek, or Joe Dumars would have given, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento made Pierce possible for Boston by taking a 6-1 point
guard from Florida named Jason Williams. Sacramento needed a point
guard badly. How badly? The Kings needed one badly enough to take a
kid who was originally signed by Providence, then went to Marshall
for one year before transferring to Florida, where he was kicked
off the team after 20 games during his one and only season as a
Gator for violating ``team and athletic policy.'' Sounds like a
very coachable kid. What he needs is for some coach to give him an
hourly spanking. What he'll now receive as the seventh pick in the
draft is a guaranteed contract for approximately $1.5 million
annually over the next three years. What a country.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes was the eighth pick. He spent one year at St.
Louis, where he averaged 20 points while shooting 41 percent from
the floor. He is a nice talent, but is he ready in any way for the
NBA? Probably not. But he's the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   And what, by the way, does it say about the quality of the big
men available that the No. 1 pick in the entire draft is a young
man from Nigeria who wasn't even playing basketball four years ago?
Perhaps Michael Olokowandi is the next Hakeem Olajuwon. Perhaps
he's the next Dikembe Mutombo. But there is no guarantee he won't
be the next Yinka Dare.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino loves the idea of Paul Pierce, and that's fine. But
he also loved the idea of Chauncey Billups last year. Maybe there
was a reason Paul Pierce dropped. I just know I'd feel better about
Paul Pierce, Mike Bibby, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, and Robert
Traylor if they had gone through four years of college so they
could enter the NBA as better men.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been lost. With each passing year, the NBA draft
disgorges more and more incomplete players. You see the results. No
NBA person can look me in the eye and say it's as entertaining and
satisfying a league as it was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry. I used to love the draft. Now I hate it.

IRAQ MAKING CHEMICAL WEAPONS, U.N. OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(inserts new graf after 7th graf to say council has extended Iraq
sanctions for 60 days)  (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief United Nations weapons inspector for
Iraq told the Security Council on Wednesday that laboratory tests
left no doubt that the Iraqis had loaded deadly VX nerve agent into
missile warheads, but he said he was content to go along with a
Council decision to call for further tests.
</P>
<P>
   The new analysis will be carried out at laboratories in
Switzerland and France to address Iraq's contention that the U.S.
Army laboratory that originally found traces of VX was biased.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with eliminating weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq, described the original findings as ``utterly
unambiguous.'' The tests, he said, detected traces of VX and
stabilizing chemicals on warhead fragments that United Nations
inspectors retrieved at Nibai, Iraq, in March.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters later, Butler said he made clear to the
Council ``that there is no doubt that VX was present in some of the
warhead remnants.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``In the spirit of cooperation, we've said, yes,
we'll re-run some further tests in other labs and see what they
come up with.'' Butler said he expected their findings to be
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said a delegate had asked whether there could have been a
mix-up in the tests. ``The answer is no,'' he said. ``These are
unique products. They were of VX. They were found in ammunition,
namely a missile warhead. That's weaponization.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the new tests, the U.S. representative, Bill
Richardson, said, ``We have no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from Butler, the Security Council decided to
extend sanctions against Iraq for another 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Butler told the Council that the laboratory's findings were
``very serious,'' because while Iraq admitted producing VX, it has
denied pouring it into weapons. VX is so lethal that a few drops
can kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now these findings show that they did weaponize it,'' Butler
said. ``They put it into missile warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest analysis, which was completed two weeks ago, revives
a lingering uncertainty about whether the VX stocks were destroyed,
as Baghdad reported. VX has a long shelf life and could be stored
for years, experts say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Security Council urged that Butler press ahead with the work
schedule for disarmament that he recently proposed to Iraqi
officials. He said he would ask them how much VX agent was produced
and what happened to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with Iraq on this with good will and get to
the bottom of the question of how much of this substance did they
make, where did they put it, where is it now,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq initially denied making VX, then said that some was
produced experimentally but later destroyed. Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said 1.7 tons of VX were produced, but not of
weapons grade.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's efforts to shake off the oil embargo imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990 have been undercut by the latest report on
VX. Aziz, who is visiting Spain, charged in a Madrid interview
Wednesday that the disclosure of the analysis was a ``political
strategem'' to poison the atmosphere before the Security Council
reviews the sanctions issue.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Iraqi officials visited the Council to
describe their progress in qualifying for the lifting of sanctions.
Wednesday, Britain's chief representative, Sir John Weston, called
the VX analysis ``a rather potent symbol'' of the gap to be bridged
before Iraq could be declared free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the United States also protested a letter that Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahaf sent to the Security Council
last Friday in which he disparaged a senior State Department
official, Martin Indyk, as ``a known Jew and a Zionist.'' Sahaf
complained that Indyk, who is assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, told some journalists that Washington was planning
a new effort to build up political opposition to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements of the United States assistant secretary of
state, Martin Indyk, who is a known Jew and Zionist, are simply an
official and documented reaffirmation of the enmity of the United
States administration toward Iraq,'' al-Sahaf wrote. He asked that
his letter be circulated as a Security Council document.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said five other delegations expressed support for the
U.S. view that ``racist slurs in a Security Council document are
totally unacceptable.'' He called upon Sahaf to apologize.

BAY STATE AD CAMPAIGN TO ATTACK TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an unusual use of taxpayers' money, the
Massachusetts public health department is launching a $280,000 ad
campaign to counterattack the tobacco industry media blitz that
critics say led to the collapse of the recent national tobacco
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Using excerpts from the cigarette industry's own internal
documents, the three TV ads and two newspaper ads will begin
appearing locally Thursday and will be made available to public
officials in any other states, said Dr. Gregory Connolly, director
of the state's $36 million Tobacco Control Program.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said the ads are intended to offset the $40 million
worth of advertising which cigarette makers sponsored over the past
three weeks to undermine an attempt in Congress to raise cigarette
taxes. State public health officials estimate that close to $1
million was spent by the tobacco industry in Massachusetts alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to put an infusion of truth into the
debate,'' said US Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat and the co-chair of the Task Force on Tobacco and Health
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which contain images of youngsters smoking, display
quotes taken from confidential industry documents that appear to
show cigarette makers targeted teens in the past. The damaging
documents recently emerged from the suit filed by Minnesota
officials against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One cites a 1976 R.J. Reynolds document that said ``the 14- to
18-year-old group is an increasing segment of the smoking
population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in this
market.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, a excerpt from a 1972 document is shown that says:
``Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating
and unique in its variety of physiological actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The tag line on each of the ads states: ``They knew. They always
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly Wednesday said the public health department feels it is
proper to use public funds to weigh in on the political debate in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the advertising the industry conducted over the past
few weeks has undermined the reality that the tobacco companies are
targeting kids,'' Connolly said. His program spends about $12
million a year on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The state is prohibited from using tax revenue for political
purposes, but Connolly said the real intent is to discourage
smoking, not influence politicians. The money for the ad campaign
comes from the 25-cent sales tax increase on cigarettes approved by
voters in 1992 to create a state anti-smoking program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not lobbying for or against any national settlement,''
Connolly said. ``We are just trying to bring the issue back home
and letting people know that the industry is after their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, who authorized the two-week ad
campaign, said the ads put to rest the cigarette makers' claims
that they did not intentionally market to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secret documents, recently released, tell a different story
and this campaign reveals the truth that the tobacco industry has
been going after our children with an addictive product that can
kill them,'' Cellucci said. ``In private, Big Tobacco `knew, they
always knew.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, however, stood against the 1992 cigarette tax hike
that created the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program which pays
for the anti-smoking ads. Furthermore, Cellucci recently expressed
opposition to the Washington-led effort to raise federal cigarette
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in
Washington, declined to comment on Massachusetts' new ad campaign,
saying he and his colleagues had not seen them or the industry
documents used. He also declined to offer any industry reaction to
the comments made by Cellucci, Meehan, and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said the tobacco industry media blitz was instrumental in
helping defeat the McCain bill in the Senate last week, a near
fatal blow to the efforts to pass the legislation. The McCain bill
would have raised cigarette taxes $1.20, created anti-smoking
campaigns to protect children, and paid for health care initiatives
promoted by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The state's use of its tax revenue to attack the industry is
also being hailed by national anti-smoking leaders. Bill Novelli,
president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids in Washington, said
Massachusetts' decision to launch the ads is first major boost to
efforts to combat the industry's aggressive ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has basically set out to correct the most recent record
and that's why this Massachusetts program is unique and
important,'' Novelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Novelli said national anti-smoking leaders are concerned that
the industry has been bolstered by the success of its media blitz,
feeling it has helped its public image. He said he hears from
industry sources that the manufacturers plan to use similar ad
campaigns to further shape their image and influence the public
debate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Novelli said his group is considering using the Massachusetts
ads in the Washington media market to combat the tobacco industry's
media strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the debate on Capitol Hill is expected to continue.
Sensing an opportunity to blame Republicans for the collapse of the
bill, President Clinton and the Democrats have vowed to try to
revive the national tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate version of the tobacco bill died last week when
advocates could not marshall the necessary 60 votes to bring the
issue to a vote, the effort has been kept alive in the House.
Meehan and Rep. James P. Hansen, a Republican from Montana, have
offered a revised version of the bill.

ONE THING WASN'T ON THE BOARD _ LOGIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all figured it was going to be a wild, wacky night. It was.
</P>
<P>
   There was no scenario in which the Celtics had Paul Pierce
tumbling to No. 10. That was one of many stunners, which, of
course, were all predestined because the Clippers were in control.
</P>
<P>
   You could have made a lot of money had you placed a wager that
Jason Williams, the point guard from Florida, would go ahead of
Pierce. He did, by three spots. Dirk Nowitzki, the German
star-in-waiting, was on the Celtics' wish list and, according to
Rick Pitino, was prepared to accept some Uncle Sam Benjamins
instead of Italian lire.
</P>
<P>
   (That was another curveball. Both Pitino and Chris Wallace had
said they weren't all that interested in anyone who couldn't put on
a uniform right away. And that Pitino had never had any foreign
kids in his programs. And that foreign kids generally present some
kind of problem, usually contractual.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki appeared to be one of those fellows, having reportedly
agreed to play the next two years in Bologna. Pitino worked him out
in Rome and said he was as certain as he could be that Nowitzki
would have played in Boston next year.)
</P>
<P>
   It all started at the top, which, with the Clippers making the
first pick, guaranteed a night of craziness. Los Angeles hemmed and
hawed between Pacific big man Michael Olowokandi and Arizona point
guard Mike Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby was the logical choice if you went by Donald Sterling's
logic: fame and pedigree. He's also pretty good. But the Clips
instead took Olowokandi, who may not be ready right away but could
be one of the better centers in the league in the next five years.
And when the dust settles from this summer's lockout, the rookies
almost assuredly will be signed to five-year deals.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver was next. Last year the Grizzlies took Antonio Daniels
as their point guard of the future with the fourth pick. He flamed
out and at the end of the season was on the bench, watching Bobby
Hurley and Lee Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   Would Grizzlies general manager Stu Jackson, who already has
three point guards, add a fourth? Would he do so knowing the choice
would all but invalidate the selection of Daniels? To his credit,
Jackson went with Bibby. If he delivers as promised, Big Country
Reeves and Sharif Abdur-Rahim will be much happier fellows. Who
knows, Rahim may even decide to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had needs everywhere. The Nuggets went with Raef
LaFrentz, who would have been the No. 3 pick last year had he come
out early. He had started out high on everyone's list, tumbled a
bit, then risen again. But he's a skilled player who also happens
to be 6 feet 11 inches. Denver has needs up front and took him,
even though it was assumed the Nuggets would go with either Pierce
or Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   There was subterfuge everywhere in the next three picks. Golden
State felt comfortable that Antawn Jamison would be available at
No. 5 but then got wind that Dallas was trying to move up to take
the College Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   So Garry St. Jean, the Warriors' general manager, upstaged
former boss Don Nelson and made a cash deal with Toronto. The
Raptors took Jamison, the Warriors took Carter, the two lads
swapped caps at NBA Draft Central in Vancouver, and some ``carrying
charges,'' as Sidney Greenstreet might say, followed.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas then took Robert Traylor. Why? The Mavericks already have
A.C. Green and Samaki Walker at power forward. The answer became
apparent soon enough. Dallas was drafting for Milwaukee, which
agreed to send picks No. 9 and 19 to the Mavs in exchange for the
No. 6. Implicit in that transaction was that Milwaukee would take
Nowitzki at No. 9. The German was Nellie's favorite all along.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas wasn't through. The Mavericks worked out a deal with
Phoenix which brought them Steve Nash as well. That gave them
Nowitzki and Nash. In return for Nash, they sent the Suns their
unprotected first-round pick next season and two salary cap
throw-ins, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was a real shocker. No one had the Florida guard going
that high. He was an undeniable talent, the second-best point guard
(after Bibby), but had some behavioral problems at Florida. It was
a gutsy choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings didn't need Pierce; their forward spots are all
filled. They might have used Larry Hughes, but his age (19) may
have scared them away. They definitely needed a point guard, and he
was high on everyone's list in terms of pure ability.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia could have put a dent in Pitino's plans by picking
Pierce. But the 76ers are committed to Tim Thomas at small forward
and have no one to play shooting guard. Hughes, a shooting guard,
was there and had looked good in workouts. So they went with the
6-4 guard, an outstanding talent who played only one season of
college ball.
</P>
<P>
   That left Pierce to the Celtics and completed a top 10 which no
personnel man or GM could have envisioned. The Celtics certainly
didn't. And as the first round moved well into the 20s, there were
still such names as Nazr Mohammed, Rashard Lewis, Corey Benjamin,
Vladimir Stepania, and Ruben Patterson available for the picking.
Mohammed was supposed to be a top 15 pick; then again, he was
coming out of Kentucky because he was going to lose playing time to
people like Mike Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Sound crazy? It is. But it was fitting for the night.

LAPD TO DEFEND IN COURT RESTRICTIONS ON CONCEALED-WEAPON PERMITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lawyers for the Los Angeles Police Department will
be heading back to court to defend Chief Bernard C. Parks' decision
to deny all new requests for concealed-weapons permits since he
took office in August.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' hard line on the permits follows a five-year period
during which some 158 concealed weapon permits were issued under
his predecessor, former LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The department started issuing the permits to residents in 1994
under the terms of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by 37 residents
who were angry that the LAPD had not issued concealed-weapon
permits to residents in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   But now lawyers for the plaintiffs in that suit have gone back
to court, claiming Parks is failing to fulfill the terms of the
settlement, denying more than 60 renewal requests and more than 100
applications for new permits.
</P>
<P>
   At his monthly news conference Wednesday, Parks denied that he
indiscriminately is rejecting all applications, claiming instead
that he is reviewing each on a case-by-case basis to see if
applicants can prove there is a tangible threat to their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some who received permits at the time of the settlement have
been denied a renewal because they no longer meet the standards, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were approved as part of the settlement, but they are not
within our guidelines,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Byron Boeckman said that under the deal
reached with the plaintiffs, each applicant has to show a
compelling need to carry a concealed weapon. ``The chief is looking
at each case to see if good cause is shown on a case-by-case
basis,'' Boeckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs has ordered
lawyers for the LAPD to show cause at a hearing Friday why the city
should not be held in contempt of court for violating the
court-ordered judgment.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams approved 158 concealed-weapon permits, within the
last year, Parks has turned down more than 60 renewal applications
and more than 100 new applications. Since the permits have to be
renewed annually, the number of active permits has slumped to about
65.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the plaintiffs, William Crawford and Burton
Jacobson, said they both personally have been denied renewals for
their concealed-weapon permits since Parks took office.
</P>
<P>
   They complained to the judge about 19 other denials for permits
and allege that Parks has returned to the presettlement policy of
rejecting all concealed-weapon permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chief Parks came along, he just said no. Unless you have
an immediate, life-threatening situation backed up by a recent
police report, you can't get a permit,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford said the 1994 judgment against the city requires
the LAPD to use ``reasonable standards'' in considering permit
applications rather than simply rejecting all such requests. &QL;

GAMBILL PERSISTS AND IT PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What kind of tennis tournament is this, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Weird. Nothing like Jan-Michael Gambill of the Spokane, Wash.,
Gambills had ever experienced. But then, he's only a 21-year-old
Wimbledon new boy, and you wouldn't exactly call Spokane a tennis
breeding ground. His was the longest, strangest debut at the
121-year-old Big W, which, he said, ``isn't like the Wimbledon I've
watched on TV. Coming here was sort of like stepping into a movie _
except the court I played on was never in the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Jan-Michael Gambill, a tall, polite,
peroxide-headed kid, has the looks to be in the movies himself, but
if you're No. 60 in the world playing No. 53, Sjeng Schalken,
they're not going to put you in the Palace. You go to the back lots
where the B movies are made. In fact, Diane Gambill named her boy
for the B movie star she adored, Jan-Michael Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   Court 7 was the location. What happened out there, a paddock on
the wrong side of the concourse, well away from Centre Court _ over
and over and over _ was more a miniseries than a match. The feeling
was that some director with a megaphone kept yelling at Schalken
and Gambill, ``Cut! Cut! Let's do another take, fellows, until we
get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while and a lot of takes. Why not? When you go to work
at Wimbledon on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, are you supposed to
play the same guy on the same court every time? That could get
monotonous. But that's what Gambill _ the winner _ and Schalken
did. Again and again and again, until Gambill, who'd never played
more than three sets or one day against any opponent, got it
righter: 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 4-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The suspenseful miniseries in three episodes went like this:
</P>
<P>
   Monday _ ``Gambill Gambols But Gambles.'' Jan-Michael, baffling
his foe with wacky, powerful two-handed shots from both sides, has
done enough to win any prior match in his life. He takes two of
three sets _ and comes within two points of victory (5-5) in the
tie-breaker _ but tries ``a shot I shouldn't have'' to lose the
breaker. The curtain comes down in the form of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday _ ``Schalken's Shakin'!'' Sjeng, the lanky Dutchman,
victor over Marcelo Rios to win the MFS Pro last August in Boston,
turns up the heat, seizes the fourth set, and breaks Gambill to
start the fifth. Gambill's coach _ his father, Chuck Gambill _
groans, but the kid is saved by the curtain descending in the form
of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday _ ``Gambillation!'' Jan-Michael and Sjeng, rewarded by
sunshine, slug away nervelessly, surely leaving their footprints on
Court 7 forever. Gambill retrieves the break after trailing, 2-4,
and keeps pushing Schalken to the edge of the cliff. Time after
time. Match-point take after match-point take _ only to have to
repeat the scene. Schalken serves to 5-5 from 15-40, escaping four
match points. He does the same, from 0-40, to 6-6, rescuing five
more match points. ``I keep thinking I'll get one. Can't worry
about it,'' Gambill says. Schalken wriggles out of a 10th match
point, but on Take 11, his forehand fails and over the cliff he
falls, with the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Out go the Dutchman's lights, and Jan-Michael wants to sing,
``The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,'' his favorite song by
his favorite singer, Reba McEntire, who, he says, follows his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night,'' Gambill recalls that intermission, ``I was
really mad. I should have won the tie-breaker, the match.'' He was
``madder'' the second, ``falling behind after leading the whole
way. But Dad and I talked it over, made some adjustments, and being
mad made me determined not to let this chance get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this wasn't the Wimbledon I've seen on TV.'' Nope. Too
weird. No network is going to broadcast a three-day match.
Miniseries are strictly for sex and gore.
</P>
<P>
   So now the kid who won the championship of Spokane at age 15 and
16 _ ``I loved that huge cup; you could take it home for a year'' _
is in the second round against Byron Black. He hopes that doesn't
last until Sunday. But it will be weird, too, because Black also
hangs on with both hands for backhand and forehand _ a duel of
freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, proclaiming, ``Steffi Graf is my hero,'' knew the drill
from watching her on TV (until arriving here for a gratifying
personal look). ``You go hard all the time to win any match.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it takes three days.

GRADUATION AISLE IS CAMPAIGN TRAIL

<P>
   NEW YORK _ MARK GREEN, the city's public advocate, did something
Wednesday that only a politician would do: He gave three
commencement speeches.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, he faced fifth-graders graduating from Public
School 33 in Jamaica, Queens. Then he was off to Madison Square
Garden for the Bronx High School of Science commencement. Later, he
went back to Queens for the Grover Cleveland High School
graduation, held at Queens College.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a record, at least not for Green, a candidate for the
Senate. ``I've done five in a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it without prepared texts. ``I have to speak without
notes because otherwise you have all the dynamism of an Al Gore
inaugural address,'' he said. ``Obviously you have set ideas and
language that you occasionally repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   He custom-tailored each talk, though his basic theme was: ``In a
world where Michael Jordan was cut from his JV basketball team and
we have a one-armed pitcher in major-league baseball, nobody's
smart enough to be a pessimist and nobody can tell you you can't
reach your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one listener was paying attention. At the Bronx Science
graduation, Green ad-libbed a line about the defeat of the tobacco
bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid yelled, `Great,''' he said. ``Some other kids laughed.
I said, `Me, I don't think it's a good idea that tobacco merchants
can seduce 14-year-olds the age of my son with deceptive ads and
lure them into a lifelong, life-ending addiction.' I didn't want to
put him down, but I didn't want him to be the dissenting voice
confused for the majority, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Borough, Now Her Own
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In chronicling the exotic demimonde of Manhattan in
her 1986 book ``Slaves of New York,'' TAMA JANOWITZ included
characters who were slaves to their apartments in Manhattan
(couldn't pay for them, couldn't hang on to them or couldn't stand
living in them).
</P>
<P>
   She is no longer among them, if she ever was. She and her
husband, TIM HUNT, the chief curator of the Warhol Foundation, are
bound for Brooklyn. He said that they had signed a contract on a
co-op. But there is a but. ``We haven't yet met with the co-op
board,'' he said. ``That happens shortly, so we can't celebrate
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooklyn?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no intention of looking in Brooklyn,'' he said, ``but
we saw an ad that looked very tempting and interesting. I ran out
to see it one evening. Tama followed the next morning and we made
an offer that afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiss and Tell
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rock-music producer PHIL SPECTOR and his former
wife and former Ronette RONNIE SPECTOR GREENFIELD found themselves
in the same room for the first time in at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   A courtroom, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't seem to get rid of her,'' said Spector, who is the
defendant in a civil suit in state Supreme Court in Manhattan filed
by the Ronettes, who maintain that he cheated them out of millions
in record royalties and licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greenfield testified earlier in the month, but Spector was
not in court that day. On Wednesday, she watched as he was
cross-examined by the Ronettes' lawyer, ALEXANDER PELTZ.
</P>
<P>
   Spector said later he believed that he had not encountered her
since their divorce in 1974. ``I have difficulty in dealing with
people whose future is the past,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greenfield had her say outside the courtroom. ``Like so
many of those people back then,'' she said, ``he cheated the
performers and thought he could get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Spector got away without even a hallway encounter: He
left the courtroom through a back door.

DRUGSTORES FINED FOR IMPROPER TOXICS DISPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hoping to prove they can be friendly to business and
tough on pollution at the same time, Massachusetts environmental
officials Wednesday fined CVS and Walgreen a total of $55,000 for
violations discovered when the drugstore chains volunteered for a
new program aimed at cutting red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The fines _ for improper disposal of toxic silver at the stores'
photoprocessing shops _ mark the first penalties under a nationally
watched program that allows companies to self-report their
environmental performance instead of going through elaborate permit
approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists had feared that the ``Environmental Results
Program'' would allow businesses to get away with polluting when
former Governor William Weld unveiled it 1996 &UR;  &LR; by tearing up
permits. But Environmental Protection Commissioner David Struhs
said the fines send the message that enforcement, if anything, will
increase under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's critically important that (businesses) know that
we take these self-certifications very, very seriously,'' said
Struhs, noting that Walgreen and CVS got caught because Department
of Environmental Protection officials checked to see if the
certificates were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists cheered the fines, which Jim Gomes, president
of the Environmental League of Massachusetts, called ``a true Kodak
moment.'' Silver from photo processors travels through sewers to
discharge sites such as Boston Harbor where it can poison marine
life.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Results Program, expected to cover 15,000
Massachusetts businesses by 2000, is part of a national effort to
get away from old-style regulation where regulators write detailed
permits that tell businesses what to do. The process is so time
consuming that Department of Environmental Protection regulators
have little left over to make sure businesses are following the
permits.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders complain that the arcana of permitting slows
them down, while environmentalists say firms don't follow the
permits. The Department of Environmental Protection estimates that
60 to 70 percent of businesses are violating at least one
environmental permit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Environmental Results Program, which now applies only
to photo processors, dry cleaners, and printers, companies can
throw away most permits.But they must also file an annual statement
saying they meet environmental standards for the industry or
outlining ways they intend to correct violations.
</P>
<P>
   The new system got off to a bumpy start in 1996 when it was
revealed that state inspectors immediately found violations at 14
of the 23 companies that volunteered to try self-reporting,
including one firm that was illegally shipping hazardous waste to
Kazakhstan. Even Struhs called the findings ``alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the firms have improved compliance so much since 1996 _
only four of the volunteers still have violations _ that a US
General Accounting Office report this week held up the
Massachusetts program as a potential national model. In addition,
silver discharges among photo processors in the program have
dropped 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and some Department of Environmental
Protection employees were waiting to see if the agency would punish
any of the volunteer companies that don't follow the rules, making
CVS and Walgreen test cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island-based CVS and Walgreen of Illinois both said they
were obeying state limits on discharges of silver to the sewer
system in their first self-certifications, filed last September.
But the Department of Environmental Protection found violations at
50 CVS and 35 Walgreens photo-processing shops around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the violations centered on the two chains' failure to
test the discharge from the photo-processing machines to determine
silver levels and their lack of proof that employees regularly
changed special filters that remove silver from the
photo-processing waste water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave generic answers that did not meet the reality,''
said Steven DeGabriele, the Department of Environmental
Protection's director of business compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chains were cited for 12 violations each for
not filing certification forms for new stores.
</P>
<P>
   However, because CVS and Walgreen were among the first group of
volunteers to test the Environmental Results Program, the
Department of Environmental Protection levied relatively light
penalties. CVS agreed to pay $32,500 and Walgreen will pay $22,500
under separate consent agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Struhs said the penalties, while modest, probably would not have
been levied at all under the old system because the Department of
Environmental Protection doesn't have enough inspectors to check
out small discharge violations at 85 far-flung photo-processing
shops. Now, he said, the burden is on executives to take
responsibility even for small sites.

 &HT;    `It has to run its course,' E. coli survivors say
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In Laura Day's first semester in college, she took a
science class the hard way: in a hospital bed for seven weeks. The
University of Alabama student developed hemolytic uremic syndrome
after eating a hamburger from a fast-food place on the Tuscaloosa,
Ala., campus. The cause: E. coli O157:H7, a sinister bacteria she
knew little about.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a bad case of the runs turned into near
death. Her parents drove up from Florida and never left her side
from early November until Dec. 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the hospital with complete kidney failure,'' said
Day, now 22 and living in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., with her college
degree in hand. ``I was unconscious in the ICU for four to five
days. My lungs filled with fluid, I had respiratory failure, needed
a respirator and at one time, completely stopped breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Intravenous feeding, dialysis machines and a last-ditch
treatment that completely replaced her poisoned plasma kept her
alive. She also endured surgery to remove her spleen, chemotherapy
to cleanse her blood, constant steroids and the exhaustion of
constant dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Hope and wait. And then hope and wait some more. That's all the
doctors _ and her family _ could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing they can do to fight the bacteria. It has to
run its course. They treat the symptoms; they can't treat the
bacteria because nothing kills it,'' said Day, who would like
Atlanta to be the first stop in her career in international
marketing or public relations.
</P>
<P>
   She's already getting a start in publicity as a member of
S.T.O.P., Safe Tables Our Priority, a grassroots group of E. coil
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about any of this before, and certainly not
when I went to eat a hamburger because I used to eat a lot of
them,'' said Day, who no longer eats red meat. ``But my case proves
it can happen to anyone. I was a healthy 18-year-old collgee
student. I'd been on the dance team and been very active. Then all
of a sudden I had E. coli and I was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it can happen to anyone. People need to realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Damion Heersink of Dothan, Ala., was 11 years old when E. coli
O157:H7 almost killed him. It came from eating a tiny piece of
hamburger he innocently nibbled off a tray during a Boy Scout
cookout.
</P>
<P>
   Heersink also was hospitalized for seven weeks. Day by day,
another organ failed, another threat loomed. He came out OK and
today, at age 18, has become an advocate for safer meat practices,
along with his mother, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a roller coaster ride of panic and dread, relief, then
panic again when something else goes wrong,'' she said. ``That's
what these Atlanta parents are going through right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what these little kids are going through,''
Damion added. ``I understood what was going on. These little ones
have no comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those in public health are not immune from the E. coli
O157:H7 that's estimated annually in the United States to sicken
20,000 people a year, although activists say the toll is greater.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Howard, a communications specialist with the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, became a statistic of the
infectious disease before he became a collecter of such statistics
at Atlanta's national office.
</P>
<P>
   A quick stop at a roadside cafe driving to Sacramento, Calif.,
left Howard with a memorable New Year's Eve 1991. He spent it _ and
the next three days _ running in circles from the couch to the
bathroom. In the U.S. Army at the time, Howard learned it was E.
coli after a military doctor decided to conduct a test for it and
got back a positive result.
</P>
<P>
   Howard spent the next three days in misery but gradually
regained his strength and appetite, a typical course the strain
sets off in milder cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what it must be like for a child to go through
the advanced form of E. coli,'' Howard said. ``I was 40 years old
then and it was hell. The amount of fluids I lost in 48 hours was
just incredible. But I wasn't really that sick in comparison.''

 &HT;    More cases of E. coli showing up
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The E. coli outbreak that has severely sickened
several area children has grown to a potential 20 cases in Georgia
and up to 10 in six other states, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But because very few have been confirmed by laboratory analysis,
and not all have links to White Water park in Cobb County where at
least some of the children are believed to have been infected, the
scope of the outbreak may not be known for days.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Public Health said seven Georgia cases of
infection by the E. coli O157:H7 strain have been confirmed by lab
culture. Six of them are known to have visited White Water, and
five are hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially
life-threatening complication.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth child has been diagnosed with the syndrome, but has
not been proved to be infected with O157:H7, a bacterium that
releases a toxin capable of destroying blood cells and kidney
function. And 12 to 15 additional cases with symptoms likely to be
caused by the particular strain of bacteria _ chiefly bloody
diarrhea _ have been reported by hospitals or private doctors and
have test results pending.
</P>
<P>
   Outside state borders, the health agency has learned of seven
children in four states it would not identify who have the
symptoms; all of them visited White Water recently, but none has
been tested.
</P>
<P>
   And in a demonstration of how complicated the investigation has
become, the health department also learned Wednesday that test
results on two sick children in Tennessee who visited White Water
were not sent to the agency, but relayed via phone by a parent. In
addition, they discovered that a South Carolina child whose
infection had been thought to be lab-confirmed had not in fact been
tested _ and might never have visited the White Water park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many leads, and the numbers are changing very
rapidly,'' said Joyce Goldberg, director of communications for the
Division of Public Health. ``As we finish with suspected cases, we
find that there are more links.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem, health workers said, is that some
children who were infected may not have exhibited symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Bo Weiss, youngest son of Atlanta Braves shortstop
Walt Weiss. The baseball player said Wednesday that while
11-month-old Bo has tested positive for E. coli, he has shown no
symptoms. Meanwhile, Weiss's 3-year-old son, Brody, remains
hospitalized from severe symptoms of E. coli infection.
</P>
<P>
   Blood work performed Wednesday confirmed Bo had not developed
the hemolytic uremic syndrome that has left Brody in serious
condition and is being treated with dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be some more blood work (Thursday). If that's OK,
he's pretty much out of the woods,'' Weiss said of the younger
child.
</P>
<P>
   The family spent most of June 11 at White Water, but only the
two youngest boys spent any significant amount of time in the
Captain Kid's Cove kiddie pool area, where health officials believe
the E. coli cases were spread. Oldest son Blake, 11, did not test
positive for E. coli; neither did the boys' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said Wednesday that -- ome children in the
initial cluster _ believed to all have been infected in one kiddie
pool on June 11 and 12 _ may subsequently have infected others in a
``second generation'' of cases. That may be the explanation for one
of the out-of-state cases reported Wednesday _ a 3-year-old who did
visit White Water, but not until June 17. The toddler has Georgia
relatives who might have been infected earlier, the health agency
said. They have shown mild symptoms, but are in transit to another
set of out-of-state relatives and could not be reached immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The detective work was being conducted in an atmosphere of
intense concern, with the state's E. coli hotline logging more than
80 calls an hour. Most of them came from worried parents; none
produced any additional cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are legitimate calls for the people who are calling,''
said Dr. Scott Kellerman an epidemiologist from the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention on long-term loan to the state
health agency. ``It's a scary disease. But when we talk to them, it
turns out that the majority are folks who took their kids to White
Water at some point, and then heard about some connection between
the disease and White Water, but whose kids were never exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said they may never prove absolutely
White Water was the source of the infection, though the
epidemiologic evidence is overwhelming. The Cobb County water park
``is the only common characteristic,'' said Mel Ralstona CDC public
health adviser working with the state. A handful of Georgia
children remained in Atlanta hospitals Wednesday with symptoms of
E. coli infection, though it wasn't clear whether they all belonged
to the White Water outbreak. Two children, a 5-year-old boy and a
4-year-old girl, were admitted Tuesday night to Scottish Rite
Hospital, spokeswoman Staci Flaxer said Wednesday. She would not
give any information on their condition or whether they had been to
White Water Park.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Rite is treating three other children for E. coli. In
addition to Brody Weiss, two girls, ages 2 and 4, are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. All three children entered
the hospital between June 15 and June 20, Flaxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Egleston Children's Hospital is treating three children,
including a 3-year-old boy in fair condition and two sisters, ages
2 and 6, who are in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Neither hospital would release patient names, hometowns or any
other information. They said the parents did not wish to talk about
their children at this time.

`GREATEST MOVIES' LIST LEFT OFF BLACKS AND A WHOLE LOT MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one should be surprised that last week's list of the 100
greatest movies, as announced by the American Film Institute, is
overtly middlebrow and sentimental. Burt Reynolds wept when
discussing ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' _ tears he may have been
saving up since losing the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Robin
Williams. And poor Dustin Hoffman was so narcissistic that he cried
about ``Tootsie.'' But more unfortunately, the program _ and the
list _ seems racist as well.
</P>
<P>
   The only movie starring an African-American, the rapidly
mildewing ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' is No. 99, several
notches behind the homeboy-wannabe atmosphere of ``Pulp Fiction.''
And it is well below the racist classics ``Birth of a Nation,'' and
``Gone With the Wind,'' which was edged out of the No. 1 slot by,
thank God, ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been less than 30 years since the first African-American
directed a major studio picture _ Gordon Parks' ``The Learning
Tree'' _ and I was appalled to not hear any mention of the
exclusionary nature of the film selections, especially after
Reynolds' sobbing about the nature of race relations. I should
mention here that I'm an African-American, and after the horrible
ad hoc hate killing that took place in this state not long ago, I
think it's time for art to take a stand about the important brand
of omission.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to say that the elegant Poitier's best work was
``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' in which he was engaged to a
woman so unworthy of him that some joked that his character was a
gay African trying to get a green card. The list of 400 movies
eligible for inclusion includes a picture that was the best
showcase of Poitier's work: ``In the Heat of the Night,'' where
Poitier's elongated, innate superiority is the butt of the joke. By
foisting ``The Joy Luck Club'' onto the voters _ mercifully, it
didn't make the final selection either _ the AFI made evident how
little diversity exists in the American cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The list is a belated effort to celebrate the 100th anniversary
of film and was promulgated by the American Film Institute, which
advances and preserves American film. The films were chosen by
1,500 filmmakers, film critics, randomly selected filmgoers and
prominent citizens to represent the 100 ``definitive'' American
movies made between 1896 and 1996. And the announcement special was
merely part of the hoopla: Now comes a 10-part TNT series that will
explore in depth the selected films. Later, a Turner Classic Movies
festival will showcase the films; video companies will release
winners in deluxe box sets.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest-movies special, however, was the first splash of
the effort. Unfortunately, it often felt just like an infomercial,
although with a much more horrifying group of commentators,
including such film scholars as Larry King and Brooke Shields.
Hearing King growl about why he hated Louise Fletcher in ``One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' had about as much cultural weight as
listening to a 6-year-old go on about the relative merits of Power
Rangers Beetleborgs vs. original-recipe Power Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably understandable that the American Film Institute
put itself on the corner and did the stroll, since its federal
funding has been drying up and there are rumors that AFI is in
danger of closing. I'm not sure that excused Tommy Lasorda missing
the point of ``Patton,'' which he said represents the best of
America. Does that mean he misses the days of slapping rookie
centerfielders after they dropped pop-up flies? It seemed that
Lasorda's appearance, and that of Susan Lucci and her hair as well
_ Susan Lucci! _ was to legitimize Larry King. At least King has
been in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine the howls of laughter at Newt Gingrich's house as
President William Jefferson Clinton murmured rapturously about
``High Noon,'' and Gary Cooper's insistence on doing what was
right. At this point, hearing Clinton lecture on moral courage is
about like having Ronald McDonald criticize your taste in clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The original list of 1,500 films is almost as horrifying as the
100 that the participants selected. For example, the films culled
from 1979 include ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' but leave out ``Richard
Pryor Live in Concert,'' which features one of the greatest
performances in the history of film. Not to mention the omission of
the wonderful comedies of Buster Keaton and director Ernst
Lubitsch.
</P>
<P>
   If the top-100 list was created to provoke controversy, then
it's one of the few successes the AFI has had this decade. No one
seems to be sure if the list was supposed to include only American
films _ remember what the AFI is an acronym for. If so, how to
explain the inclusion of ``The Third Man'' _ one of the few great
films to make the cut _ or ``Bridge on the River Kwai?'' Or
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' which has hardly any Americans in it?
</P>
<P>
   Among the films that also merited inclusion are ``On the
Waterfront'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' which has made even
more noticeable the omission of director Elia Kazan from the list
of movie pioneers to have received the American Film Institute's
Lifetime Achievement Award. This is an organization that has given
the Lifetime Achievement Award to the man who starred in ``Every
Which Way But Loose'' _ Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   It's been said that the AFI hasn't honored Kazan because he
named names to the House Un-American Activities Committee, an act
that he has spent a length of time equal to Eastwood's career
apologizing for. It's a little juvenile to rule out a compromise,
especially after hurling this list at the wall to see if it'll
stick. Eastwood supported George Bush, a president who had to be
browbeaten into extending the expired Civil Rights Acts of 1964, a
gesture surely as cowardly as being stalked by the FBI and giving
up friends' names.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this will make the organization rethink its stance on
Kazan. If so, at least one good thing will have come out of it.

 &HT;    Georgia researchers study arsenal of bacteria killers
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As E. coli outbreaks become increasingly common,
Georgia researchers are experimenting with a variety of new
techniques _ using everything from lasers to ``beneficial''
bacteria _ to detect and combat the deadly bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the experimental methods are currently in use,
food safety experts believe they could lead to better ways to head
off or contain E. coli 0157:H7 infections, which sicken up to
20,000 Americans and kill 200 each year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech researchers have developed a laser that can
instantly detect the presence of E. coli in suspect foods, like
ground beef. This device, called a ``biosensor,''could one day be
part of a food processing plant and be tailored to look for ``any
bacterial organism,'' said Georgia Tech researcher Craig Wyvill.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, similar to the laser beam on a CD player, passes
a laser through meat or other foods. If E. coli is present, it
alters the beam, marking the food as contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on detection sensitivity,'' said Wyvill, who
said researchers believe the technique could be refined to provide
readings within minutes. Current E. coli detection methods, which
use laboratory cultures, take up to eight hours. The technology is
still years from commercial release, but current estimates say a
single system could cost less than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety and
Quality Enhancement at the University of Georgia, has experimented
with another technique using strains of a naturally occurring
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for beneficial bacteria that prevent the bad
bacteria from being carried in the intestinal tract of cattle,'' he
said in UGA's Research Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's research found that E. coli was eliminated from infected
animals in less than three weeks after they were given a solution
containing the bacteria that neutralize E. coli.

STUDY FINDS FAILING SCHOOLS ARE SCANTED BY DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A two-year study released Wednesday by New York
University has found that officials at community school districts
in New York City treat persistently failing schools like orphans,
staffing them with poorly trained teachers and shuttling some
students in the districts to failing schools at all levels, from
elementary to high school.
</P>
<P>
   The NYU study of the Schools Under Registration Review _ the
state's list of schools with persistently low reading and math test
scores _ called on education officials in Albany to exert greater
pressure on the city's community school district superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   District officials, for instance, have the power to remove
principals and reassign teachers, and can redistribute students in
the district so that children who graduate from one low-performing
school do not end up in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The districts knew for years they were failing and they turned
their attention elsewhere,'' said Norm Fruchter, the director of
the NYU Institute on Education and Social Policy and a co-author of
the report.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the report, which was commissioned by the state,
the education commissioner, Richard Mills, announced several
changes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the state's review teams would provide
school staff members with more timely feedback on what they need to
do to lift themselves off of the SURR list and craft teacher
training programs to address the shortcomings identified by the
state review team.

JURY FINDS BROOKLYN MAN GUILTY IN 3 ZODIAC KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heriberto Seda, a 30-year-old high school dropout and
loner from Brooklyn, was convicted Wednesday of being the Zodiac
killer, a mysterious gunman who terrorized the city and taunted the
police during two shooting sprees in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a six-week trial and after less than five hours of
deliberation, an emotional and visibly shaken jury filed into the
courtroom in state Supreme Court in Queens to announce that it had
found Seda guilty of killing three people and wounding one person
in Queens between 1990 and 1993. He faces a maximum penalty of 83
1/3 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   At least five jurors wept as the jury was polled.
</P>
<P>
   Seda, who had lashed out angrily on the first day of the trial,
stood impassively throughout Wednesday's short proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said he was unemotional because he had been prepared
to hear the guilty verdict. They said they planned to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Seda's mother sat quietly in the last row of the courtroom as
the verdict was read against her son, who prosecutors said chose
his victims at random, looking for vulnerable people who could not
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Seda, who is known as Eddie, has yet to stand trial in Brooklyn
for three Zodiac shootings and the shooting of his half-sister. He
has not yet been charged in the shooting of a homeless man in
Central Park for which the Zodiac killer also claimed credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two years ago last Sunday that Eddie Seda was arrested
and I said at that time that the people of the city could heave a
sigh of relief that the Zodiac killer was in custody,'' the Queens
district attorney, Richard Brown, said. ``Today's verdict means he
will finally be brought to account for his evil deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he would ask the court ``to require him to spend the
rest of his life in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The `Zodiac killer' name stemmed from the killer's letters to
the media and the police in which he said he would kill one person
for each sign of the zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Masters, the assistant district attorney who argued the
case, said that Wednesday's emotional outpouring by the jury was
probably due to a great sense of relief. ``But I think the jurors
also were very absorbed in the sadness of the victims,'' he said,
``and I think it was a very difficult thing for them to call a
human being just about the worst thing that you can call him _ a
serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zodiac killer's victims were primarily from the margins of
society, many of them homeless and physically and mentally weak.
</P>
<P>
   Seda, who had eluded the police for six years, was convicted of
17 crimes involving the four victims, including murder, assault and
criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Seda's other lawyer, John Wallenstein, said that as the lawyers
in the case spoke to the jurors after the hearing, ``the jurors
indicated that they really analyzed everything and essentially
looked for ways to find reasonable doubt and to find him innocent
if they could, but they were obviously unable to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Scheer, the other assistant district attorney who tried
the case, spoke of the mountain of evidence that was presented to
the jury during the trial _ including the testimony of 45 witnesses
and 150 pieces of evidence. ``I think, like the police officers who
were involved in the case, the jurors are somehow going to be
affected by this case for the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallenstein, said he was not surprised by the verdict. ``We felt
that the jury took the time to analyze everything, but there was so
much evidence,'' he said. ``They had everything but an eyewitness.
And in the end, there's only so much you can do with that.''

LOUISE DAVIES, 98, SAN FRANCISCO BENEFACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louise Davies, the San Francisco benefactor who gave the city
she loved a $5 million concert hall in 1980, died on Monday at a
retirement home in Portola Valley, Calif. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davies, whose husband, Ralph Davies, an oil millionaire,
died in 1971, bestowed millions of dollars on many cultural,
educational and medical charities in the Bay Area, including the
Exploratorium, the World Affairs Council, the Conservatory of
Music, the University of San Francisco, Stanford University and the
San Francisco Opera.
</P>
<P>
   But she will no doubt be best remembered as the benefactor of
the 3,000-seat, modern concert hall on Van Ness Avenue that bears
her name, the home of the San Francisco Symphony. Before the hall
was built, the orchestra had to share the War Memorial building
with the San Francisco Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The completion of Davies Symphony Hall, next door to the opera
house, allowed the orchestra to expand to a full 52-week season and
add additional players. After the hall opened, she gave another $3
million as a fund to attract leading guest conductors. One of the
first to come was Michael Tilson Thomas, who became the orchestra's
music director three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by an interviewer in 1990 why she had financed the
building, Mrs. Davies, a down-to-earth woman, said simply,
``Because I had the money, and we certainly needed the hall.'' In
that same interview, she added: ``I'm just learning after all these
years that I have quite a lot of money. Isn't that something?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davies was born fairly poor, on a remote cattle ranch in
Plumas County. When her parents divorced, her mother moved with
Louise and her three other daughters, eventually settling in
Oakland, Calif., where Louise attended a Catholic boarding school.
As a young woman, she held a $25-per-week job as a stenographer in
Oakland for seven years, then moved to Los Angeles to try her
chances at film acting. There she met her future husband, a young
executive with Standard Oil. They married in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Davies rose to the rank of vice president of Standard Oil. But
when the presidency eluded him, he left and formed his own oil
company. He also ran American President Lines and Natomas Co. In
1934 the couple bought 20 acres in Woodside, Calif., where in 1940
they built a magnificent house, which Mrs. Davies lived in until
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her daughter, Maryon Davies Lewis of San
Francisco, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mrs. Davies on Monday, Nancy Bechtle, the president
of the San Francisco Symphony Board, said, ``The crowning glory of
her life was that hall, and every time she walked in, she was just
thrilled to be there.''

STATE SENATOR'S BILL LOOKS TO REVISE SMOKING BAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ State Sen. W.J. ``Pete'' Knight has reignited the
smoldering debate over California's smoking ban by agreeing to
carry legislation to allow some bars to exempt themselves from the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Knight, R-Palmdale, would let smoking resume in
bars, taverns and card clubs if employees consent to working amid
cigarette smoke or if bar owners install state-approved ventilation
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the legislation that is in place is too
restrictive on small business,'' Knight said Wednesday. ``I believe
small businesses should be allowed to determine what kind of
business they have. If their clientele says we don't want a smoking
bar, they won't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's workplace ban on smoking went into effect Jan. 1 for
bars, taverns and card rooms. Though anti-smoking groups hailed the
move, the ban has been under attack by smokers, some bar owners,
the tobacco industry and organizations they support, including the
National Smokers Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, partially funded by three tobacco companies, is
sponsoring Knight's measure, SB 1513, which is scheduled to be
heard Monday in an Assembly committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly earlier passed its own version of a bill to repeal
the ban, but the measure has languished in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's bill, originally introduced as a measure on horse
racing, passed the Senate before it was rewritten to address the
smoking ban.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale changes to the measure had anti-smoking groups
crying foul, claiming that Knight had used a legislative sleight of
hand to put the issue on a fast track through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that a legislator would try to do an end run
around the normal legislative process in order to enact
special-interest legislation that will harm California workers,''
said Alan Henderson, president of the state chapter of the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight defended his tactics, noting that the Assembly
measure repealing the ban was never allowed to come up for a Senate
committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the Assembly passes Knight's bill, a final vote on
concurrence would be required in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly within the process,'' he said. ``I don't know
that I'm bypassing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of a new attempt to repeal the smoking ban came as the
state Department of Health Services announced that a March survey
found that 66 percent of bar patrons believe it's important to have
smoke-free bars. Alliance officials said the survey was dated and
claimed the department hadn't disclosed all its findings. &QL;

TEXAS FIRMS VYING FOR RAIL CARS FILLED WITH NAPALM 

</HEADLINE>

and GREG MCDONALD 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rail cars filled with 22,000 gallons of napalm may be
headed for a Houston-area storage facility in as little as two
weeks, sparking protests from some politicians unhappy about being
notified only days ago.
</P>
<P>
   GNI Group Inc. of Deer Park, an industrial city of 30,000 about
15 miles east of downtown Houston, is vying with Waste Control
Specialists, a West Texas company, for the contract to temporarily
store the jellied gasoline, according to a government memo.
</P>
<P>
   The winner may gain the inside track for a $2.5 million deal to
recycle 3.3 million gallons of the toxic substance that has been
stored at a Navy weapons station near San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Texas firms, based in San Leon, El Paso and Port
Arthur, are seeking the recycling contract in competition with
companies in Utah and Wisconsin, the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the public reaction to the Navy's efforts to recycle the
34,000 aluminum canisters of napalm _ and the 22,000 gallons in
rail tankers _ has been less than kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy was forced to scrap its plans earlier this year to
begin recycling the chemical in East Chicago, Ind., after negative
public reaction prompted the company that won the contract to turn
away a 12,000-gallon rail shipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy brought the napalm back to its facility in Fallbrook,
Calif., where another 10,000 gallons had been drawn for shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Once the napalm was placed in the tanker cars, environmental
regulations gave the Navy only 90 days to move it to a licensed
storage facility. For the 12,000 gallons, that deadline is July 8;
for the 10,000, July 15, according to the government memo.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Yocum, spokesman for Battelle Memorial Institute, an Ohio
company that holds the main napalm recycling contract, acknowledged
the time crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope to get it done in the next several weeks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas emerged as a likely home for the napalm when a number of
state-based companies that store and process chemicals showed
interest in the Navy contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush expressed concern about the toxic chemical
coming to Texas after being briefed by a high-level Navy official
Tuesday, spokeswoman Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, GNI officials notified Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston,
that they were a serious candidate for the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time we heard anything about it,'' said
Bentsen, whose office then contacted the Navy. Officials then set
about trying to brief members of the Texas congressional
delegation, claiming that they had already begun ``a public
outreach program.''
</P>
<P>
   But the program had not reached Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Beaumont,
by late Wednesday afternoon. Two of the companies bidding on the
recycling contracts are located in his southeast Texas district.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the issue is not necessarily the napalm, but the manner
in which (the Navy) has handled it,'' Lampson said. ``I'm sure
opposed to moving so quickly that we don't know the answers to a
bunch of questions that ought to be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen said he was ``somewhat perturbed that the Navy has just
dropped this in everybody's lap like it's no big deal,'' noting
that napalm is a mixture of gasoline, highly toxic benzene and
polystyrene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be concerned about the movement of it, and the
public needs to be adequately notified about it,'' Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to contacting the governor and congressional
delegation, GNI notified, the mayor of Deer Park and Houston Mayor
Lee Brown, who will meet with company officials Thursday, spokesman
Don Payne said. The Houston Fire Department Hazardous Materials
team has also been notified.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the images of death and destruction that napalm evokes,
once detonators are removed from the canisters, it is a more stable
substance than gasoline, hazardous waste experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no new or overbearing safety issues,'' said Bill
Reeves, GNI's vice president of regulatory affairs. ``Once they
take that cordex explosive out of the canister, it's neutered. The
bark is off the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Houston organic chemistry professor Randall Lee
confirmed that napalm is as safe as gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   GNI's Reeves said the public outcry in Indiana was caused by
inflammatory media accounts complete with Vietnam-era footage of
napalm exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lack of communication, and there was some
politics, and all of a sudden everything was inflamed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But worries about safety persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been handled well at all,'' said Bentsen. ``They
need to come out and make a statement about how they are proposing
to do this and give the public a chance to respond.''

SHELDON GUNSBERG, 78, FILM DISTRIBUTOR  
 (ATTN: N.J.) 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sheldon Gunsberg, a film producer and distributor who
later headed the Walter Reade chain of movie theaters in New York,
died last Thursday of a heart attack at his home in Manhattan. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Jersey City, N.J., Gunsberg served in the U.S. Merchant
Marine during World War II, and then entered the film industry,
promoting the 1945 version of ``Henry V,'' starring Laurence
Olivier, for United Artists. He joined Universal Pictures as a
publicist in 1948, where he directed advertising and marketing for
films including ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' and ``Kind Hearts and
Coronets.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he joined the Walter Reade Organization, whose
principal Manhattan theaters included the Ziegfeld, the Coronet and
the Baronet. He was named chief operating officer in 1971. In 1973,
Walter Reade Jr., the chain's president, was killed in a skiing
accident in Switzerland and Gunsberg succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Walter Reade Organization was a nationwide
theater chain with about 80 movie houses, but it was plagued by
financial losses. The company filed for federal bankruptcy
protection in 1977, and its holdings were whittled down to 10
theaters in the New York area before it emerged from bankruptcy in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the executors of Reade's estate, Gunsberg was charged
with finding a buyer for his 31 percent stake in the company.
Columbia Pictures bought it in 1981. But a year later, Gunsberg
said he regretted that deal, because Columbia backed an attempted
takeover of the company. Columbia eventually acquired the Walter
Reade chain outright in 1985, then sold it to Cineplex Odeon in
1987. Gunsberg retired as chief executive just before the Cineplex
Odeon deal.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure with the Walter Reade company, Gunsberg also
headed its Continental Distributing subsidiary, which distributed
and often financed or produced many notable foreign films. Among
them were the British ``Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,'' the
French ``Mon Oncle,'' and ``War and Peace,'' from the Soviet Union.
It also produced and distributed the American films ``Ulysses'' and
``A View From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Gunsberg was chairman of the Walter Reade
Foundation and vice chairman of the Film Society of Lincoln Center,
whose Walter Reade Theater he was instrumental in creating.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Lois; two daughters,
Mayra Bloom of Nyack and Donna Lerner of Manhattan, and two
grandchildren.

YANKEES TOP BRAVES, FOR NOW ANYWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Cone has been too politically correct while
discussing Recent baseball history this week, nodding his head
robotically while speculating that the Braves might have been
better than the Yankees in 1996. Maybe the Yankees were simply a
team of destiny two years ago, Cone theorized. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cone is too savvy to gloat about the diamond-filled
World Series ring that he slips on and off, the pitcher surely
believes that the Yankees were the better club in 1996 and, right
now, they are the better club again. Obviously, it is only June,
but what the mighty Braves and the mightier Yankees have
accomplished so far is the best and freshest evidence available for
making a comparison. And the Yankees prevail today.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever edge the Braves have with their formidable starting
rotation, which is the same advantage they supposedly had in 1996,
is eclipsed by the Yankees' superior bullpen, their superior depth,
their slightly superior offense and, one more time for emphasis,
their superior bullpen. If Ramiro Mendoza wandered into Atlanta's
bullpen tonight, the Braves would make him the closer. It would be
a shrewd decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen is something they've got to get together,'' Cone
said. ``That's big.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the reasons why, regardless of what happens in the
final two games of this interleague matchup between the two best
teams in the major leagues, I still think Joe Torre will awaken on
Friday feeling more secure about his team than Bobby Cox will feel
about his bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I need to find out about my club,'' Torre
said. ``I'm not trying to be smart. I really feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cox, who desperately needs Mark Wohlers to emerge
from his funk and right a relief corps that has botched eight save
opportunities, countered by saying, ``I know my team. We're not
going to find out anything by playing the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Cone imitates Pataki or Giuliani by uttering what he
thinks is safe to say about 1996, instead of what he actually
thinks, it is the 35-year-old pitcher churning into PC overdrive.
Does anyone believe Cone felt the 1996 Braves were better than the
Yankees? Then, today or in 2016? Absolutely not. The Yankees may
even have a psychological edge over the Braves, who might wonder if
this special team is destined.
</P>
<P>
   All it would take to challenge Cone's words _ and perhaps get
him to show that sly smile _ would be some quick reminders. More
baseball history. Flash back to the World Series and remember how
the Yankees trailed, 2-0, with Cone starting Game 3 in Atlanta. One
more defeat would have been like losing twice since no team had
ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit to win a four-of-seven-game Series.
New York's hopes rested with Cone, who was not thinking about
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was ornery that night, ornery that the Braves had seemed a
little too cocky and a little too comfortable while walloping the
Yankees by a combined score of 16-1 at Yankee Stadium. Sure, the
Braves had the right to feel cozy, but Cone seized upon it and used
it as his edge, his motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mindset of the team was we were a little
embarrassed in New York,'' Cone said at the time. ``I think
everyone in the city was into the Series and we didn't give them
anything to cheer about.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Atlanta. Until Cone began showing why the Yankees were the
better team. The Braves filled the bases with one out in the sixth
and New York's 2-0 spread suddenly looked puny. But Cone got Fred
McGriff to pop out to shortstop before Torre visited him. Ryan
Klesko was the batter and Mariano Rivera, the super setup man, was
ready. Torre's dark brown eyes studied Cone's fiery brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me do this,'' Cone pleaded. ``I can get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone later admitted, ``I lied, but I had to get him through the
sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Klesko with a 3-2 pitch that strayed inches out of
the strike zone. The score was sliced to 2-1. But Cone rebounded.
No destiny, just better pitching. Just Javier Lopez popping up to
Joe Girardi in foul territory. To that point, it was the most
important out in the Series as the Yankees won, 5-2, to begin a
dramatic comeback that would show everyone they were indeed better.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, who knows if Jim Leyritz goes deep off Mark Wohlers
in Game 4, if Paul O'Neill makes a lunging, game-ending catch in
Game 5 or if Charlie Hayes squeezes the popout to climax Game 6?
Or, who knows if these plays would have been as critical. Leyritz's
homer is not so devastating if it helps make the Series 3-1, not
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Leyritz homer, we go home,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Let Cone keep appeasing his PC instincts. Let him throw the
Braves a 2-year-old bone about wondering if they were better. Let
him do this while the Yankees pursue their second title in three
years. Let him be. Just don't believe every word you hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they the better team?'' Cone asked once more. ``Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not.

DAVID D. THOMAS, 85, AIR TRAFFIC SAFETY OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas, Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Duval Thomas, a principal architect of the country's
air-traffic control and safety system, died June 17 at Inova
Fairfax Hospital in Northern Virginia. He was 85 and lived in
Annandale, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a pilot for more than 30 years, retired in 1970 as
deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Thomas
was a frequent spokesman for the agency on air safety and
accidents, and for much of his career, he oversaw the nation's
network of civilian air-traffic control centers and its entry into
modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who was born in New Castle, Texas, studied mechanical
engineering at the University of Tennessee and business
administration at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   He entered federal service in 1938 as an air-traffic controller
in Pittsburgh and filled various field assignments for the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, a forerunner of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he moved into policy-making positions in Washington as
a planning officer in the CAA's traffic-control office; by 1956, he
was named director of the office. When the Federal Aviation
Administration was formed two years later, he took charge of its
Air Traffic Service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, as associate administrator for planning, he was
responsible for planning and coordinating the operating programs
for air traffic, flight standards, airports and systems
maintenance. He was appointed deputy administrator in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy honored Thomas in 1963 with an Award
for Distinguished Civilian Service, which recognizes exceptional
achievement. He also received the Rockefeller Public Service Award
from Princeton University in 1966, an award celebrating ``unsung
heroes,'' meaning Federal officials who perform important functions
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In Thomas' case, he helped create a nationwide air-traffic
tracking system and supervised its evolution from radar into the
computer era. He also oversaw the development of safeguards for
airport security to counter terrorist threats in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is survived by his wife of 60 years, Dorothy Clark
Thomas; a son, David C., of Fairfax, Va., and two grandchildren.

IVO JOHN LEDERER, 68, SCHOLAR OF EASTERN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Ivo John Lederer, a refugee in the only group of
European Jews given special passage to the United States by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, and who went
on to became a Russian and Eastern European scholar and teach
generations of future American leaders, died June 18 at Calvary
Hospital in the Bronx. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer was a professor of contemporary Russian and Eastern
European history at Princeton, Yale and Stanford between 1954 and
1977, when he began a second career bringing government and
business leaders together to discuss the interaction of foreign and
business policies.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was the director of the global
business policy council at A.T. Kearney, a management consulting
firm, helping corporate leaders adapt their strategies to changing
world conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he became ill last year, Lederer ran a conference
in Shanghai to examine, among other things, the desire of
executives to take advantage of abundant opportunities in China but
at the same time see democratic freedoms expanded in China and
elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He was also president of West-West Agenda/USA, an association of
European and American business and policy leaders that seeks to
resolve trans-Atlantic political, economic and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   James Schlesinger, a former defense secretary, energy secretary
and director of Central Intelligence who often took part in
Lederer's forums, called him a ``master at policy dialogue, knowing
how best to identify and orchestrate a multiplicity of views to
advance understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivo John Lederer was born on Dec. 11, 1929, in Zagreb, Croatia,
to Ruza and Otto Lederer, a lawyer. When he was 11 and his sister,
Mira, was 16, the Nazis invaded Zagreb and their father was
arrested for defying a ban against Jews practicing law. But his
mother, the first woman licensed to practice architectural design
in Yugoslavia, was able to bribe officials and obtain his release.
</P>
<P>
   Using false papers, the family fled to Italy; there, with the
help of friends and the Catholic Church, they hid for three years.
Then, in Naples, they got aboard the Henry Gibbons, a Liberty ship
dispatched by Roosevelt to transport wounded soldiers and 982
refugees, mainly Jews. (Other Jews who fled the Nazis were admitted
to the United States under set immigration quotas.)
</P>
<P>
   Once in New York, the 982 were sent to a detention camp in
Oswego, N.Y., by order of the War Department and held for a year
until the end of the war. Initially, they agreed to return then to
Europe, but after the war President Harry Truman signed an order
permitting them to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer earned a bachelor of arts degree at the University of
Colorado in 1951 and a master's and doctorate in contemporary
diplomatic history at Princeton by 1957. He joined the faculty at
Princeton in 1954, moved to Yale in 1957 and to Stanford in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Among his students were former Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., who
is now president of the United Nations Foundation; Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott and Federal Express chef executive Fred
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford he founded and directed the Center for Russian and
East European Studies. While on leave to work at the Ford
Foundation, he helped set up the Institute for Central European
Studies in Dubrovnik, Croatia, which was then still part of the
Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer was the author of several books and articles, including
``Yugoslavia at the Peace Conference'' (Yale University Press,
1963), which won the George Louis Beer Prize from the American
Historical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last month he won the United Nations Society of Writers Award
for his ``great contributions to the worlds of history, politics
and literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Lederer had essentially completed his childhood memoirs, titled
``I Have Seen the Mississippi,'' before his death, his son Michael
said. Besides Michael, of Manhattan, Lederer is survived by another
son, Philip, of Los Angeles, and by two grandsons, Nicholas and
Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   The reference in the title of the memoirs, which Michael Lederer
is now preparing for publication, was to a refugee's cry when the
Henry Gibbons steamed into New York Harbor, ``Look, it's the
Mississippi!'' The young boys aboard ship could not be persuaded
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   He further recounts: ``In Yugoslavia my family were assimilated
Jews. The first time I became aware that I was Jewish was when a
local fascist in my very own hometown slapped a yellow star on my
chest and spat in my face. . . . Only a foreign-born can truly
appreciate what America is.''

HISPANIC LEADER HERMAN BADILLO TO SWITCH TO REPUBLICAN PARTY  
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Herman Badillo, a former U.S. representative, deputy
mayor and mayoral candidate, and a fixture in Hispanic politics in
New York for more than 40 years, has decided to quit the Democratic
Party and become a Republican, associates familiar with his
decision said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said Badillo, 68, would announce his political shift
Thursday at a press conference attended by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
a Republican and his most visible political ally in recent years.
The announcement will also be attended by representatives of the
Republican National Committee, the associated said. Their presence
suggests the symbolic importance Republicans will try to attach to
Badillo's switch at a time the party has sought to make inroads in
a voting group once viewed as solidly Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Badillo's announcement is no surprise. His
alliance with Giuliani and his increasing advocacy of Republican
positions on issues from education to welfare have strained his
relations with Democratic leaders over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for many New Yorkers, the announcement will come
as a shock and an indication of the changing face of ethnic
politics in this and other cities. Badillo has been one of the most
visible faces of the Hispanic advance in mainstream politics since
he was elected Bronx borough president in 1965, and then a
congressman from the South Bronx in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, his switch in party allegiance is the latest
evidence that as a group, Hispanic voters in New York and across
the country are very much up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo did not return phone calls seeking comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, and the way it is being presented, seemed to
have as much to do with the political fortunes of Giuliani as they
do for Badillo. Giuliani has sought in recent months to present
himself as a candidate with national potential. His ability to
boast that he brought a prominent Hispanic politician into
Republican ranks would permit him to argue that this is another way
he could expand the party's reach.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any obvious political gain to Badillo, it would be
if he were to try yet again to run for mayor. He could do it in
2000, when Giuliani is not eligible to run again, in the much less
crowded Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   Although Badillo is expected to say Thursday that he is
supporting the candidacies of both major Republicans, Gov. George
Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, seeking re-election this year,
only Giuliani is scheduled to appear with him as he makes his
announcement, Badillo's associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has extensive ties to Badillo. The two ran on what
Giuliani called a fusion ticket in 1993. Badillo ran as a
Republican candidate for comptroller. Giuliani was supposed to
officiate at Badillo's second marriage two years ago (a delayed
helicopter flight forced him to miss it). And Badillo is a partner
in the politically connected law firm of Raymond B. Harding, the
Liberal Party leader, and one of the mayor's closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   He is also vice chairman of the board of the City University of
New York, where he was one of the mayor's allies in his
controversial though successful bid to eliminate remedial courses
at the system's senior colleges. He was one of the most insistent
advocates of Giuliani's proposals, which drew a furious response
from many quarters, including Hispanic groups, which argued that it
would hurt disadvantaged students trying to make their mark in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Democrats were quick to minimize the significance
of the defection. ``This announcement merely confirms what we
already know,'' said Matthew Hiltzik, the press secretary for the
state Democratic Party. ``Mr. Badillo has a long-standing
relationship with the mayor and the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic community in New York, though overwhelmingly
Democratic, is nonetheless far from unified in its political and
cultural beliefs. Giuliani, with his emphasis on anticrime measures
and social conservatism, has struck a chord with many Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   And Badillo, associates said, had been moved by Giuliani's
political success and by the mayor's denunciation of Democratic
policies that he says have failed to address urban problems.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo is clearly a figure of huge stature in New York's
Hispanic community, especially among Puerto Ricans like himself. He
is regularly afforded a hero's reception at the annual Puerto Rican
Day Parade, especially by the older attendees, who remember him as
the vibrant Bronx borough president and then congressman. He was
also a deputy mayor under Edward Koch.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement comes as, in New York City and across the
country, there have been indications of some political shifts among
Hispanic voters, and as that vote has become increasingly
influential, Giuliani enjoys strong support among Latino voters,
recent polls have shown.
</P>
<P>
   And while Democrats remain the overwhelming party of choice
among this group, there are some signs of small changes that
several analysts suggested could only be advanced by Badillo's
decision. Douglas Muzzio, director of the Baruch College, which has
conducted regular polls for the Hispanic Federation of New York
City, said he has seen regular evidence of some drifting away from
the Democratic Party, particularly among Latinos who are younger
and not of Puerto Rican descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a major shift, but you can see some shifting
ground,'' Muzzio said.

 &HT;    Harpring must have the magic
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly three months, Georgia Tech small forward Matt
Harpring heard the rumors from doubters. Critics claimed he was too
slow and not athletic enough to excel in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Harpring's undeniable determination and
tenacity, which often carried the young Yellow Jackets in his final
two collegiate seasons, paid off. After pre-draft speculation
placed him near the end of the first round of Wednesday night's NBA
Draft -- perhaps to No. 20 to the Atlanta Hawks -- Harpring was
selected with the 15th pick by the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little surprised,'' Harpring said. ''I knew I had a
chance to go in the teens, but a lot of people had me going at No.
20 to Atlanta. A lot of people thought I was a ''tweener'' for the
NBA, but I don't think I am. I think I proved that playing in the
ACC for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic chose the Dunwoody native with their third first-round
pick. Orlando took Utah center Michael Doleac and UNLV power
forward Keon Clark with the Nos. 12 and 13 picks, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Harpring's pre-draft anxiety began after he injured his left
foot toward the end of his senior season at Georgia Tech. He
continued to play on the foot, which became progressively worse as
he attempted to remain sharp for NBA workouts. After missing the
pre-draft camps, Harpring finally worked out for Houston on June
16th; Orlando on June 18th and Minnesota on June 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have loved to work out for 12 teams like everyone else
did,'' Harpring said. ''Unfortunately, my foot was injured and I
wasn't able to do it. My foot needed rest and I didn't do it. I
always play with pain and I thought it would go away. But my agent
(Atlanta-based Richard Howell) told me I had to start working out
with some teams because they were forgetting about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando coach Chuck Daly had eyed several forwards for his final
pick in the opening round. Besides Harpring, Orlando also had Notre
Dame's Pat Garrity and high-school phenoms Al Harrington of New
Jersey and Rashard Lewis of Texas in for workouts. Following
Harpring's visit, Magic general manager John Gabriel said the Tech
star had a ''Dan Majerle quality about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pleased,'' Howell said. ''I knew Orlando was seriously
considering him, along with Minnesota and Atlanta. What worried me
was him not being able to work out. He was able to work out for
Orlando, but he was limping badly. It wasn't the same Matt
Harpring.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpring, a 6-foot-6, 231-pound sharpshooter, produced one of
the most memorable careers in Georgia Tech history. He finished as
the Yellow Jackets' second-leading all-time scorer and rebounder,
falling only eight points short of Rick Yunkus' scoring record of
2,232 points.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior, Harpring averaged 21.6 points and 9.4 rebounds,
finishing second in the ACC in both categories behind North
Carolina's Antawn Jaminson. A first-team All-ACC selection and
third-team All-American in his final campaign, Harpring was only
the sixth Yellow Jacket to have his jersey retired.

 &HT;    Panoz urging peace between rival bodies
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Road Atlanta owner Don Panoz put more heat on the
feuding sanctioning bodies, U.S. Road Racing Championships and
Professional Sports Car Racing, during a press conference Sunday
about his American Le Mans Series.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who would sanction the series, Panoz said, ``We wish the
two organizations would get together. If it doesn't happen, I'll
assign the sanctioning body unilaterally. It may or may not be
them. The ball is in their court. I'm offering them a chance, not
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the CART-IRL fight, the USRRC-PSCR feud hasn't helped
either side.
</P>
<P>
   Venues for the proposed 11-event series include Sebring, Road
Atlanta, Lime Rock, Road America, Mosport, Portland and Laguna
Seca. What about Daytona, which hosts the 24 Hours of Daytona?
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we need to talk,'' Panoz said. It seems unlikely
that NASCAR czar Bill France, who owns Daytona, would give up
control.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Car Grand Prix
</P>
<P>
   It took only one lap for fans to know that Sunday's WSC/GT
Sports Car Grand Prix would be exciting. The Panoz No. 4 car,
fastest of a trio entered, started the race with four wheels, but
had only three when it came back around and made an early pit stop.
It played catch-up, a lap behind, until being knocked off the track
and slammed into a tire retaining wall. Tony Dow, managing director
of Panoz Motor Sports, said the team is still looking into the lost
wheel, which was one of several unlikely events _ No. 45 out with
gear box problems, No. 5 out of contention because of a broken prop
shaft _ that left the three strongest GT-1 cars in America out of
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore moves
</P>
<P>
   Whit Bazemore will join Team Chevrolet in the Nitro Funny Car
ranks, beginning with the Sears Craftsman Nationals this weekend.
Bazemore, 35, an Atlantan, who heads Bazemore Racing out of
Indianapolis, will switch from a Ford Mustang to a Camaro Z28 Funny
Car. ... Less than a month after he finished 11th in the
Indianapolis 500 as a rookie, Jimmy Kite of Stockbridge was back at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway last week testing a stock car. Andy
Evans, owner of Team Scandia, decided to switch from the Indy
Racing League to stock car racing and hopes to debut in the NASCAR
Winston Cup Brickyard 400 on Aug. 1 at Indy.

BEAUTIFUL VOICES STRIKE CHORD WITH LILITH FAIR FANS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore _ Lollapalooza is dead. George Strait and company
already have passed through town. Now in its second year, Lilith
Fair stands as the music festival of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah McLachlan's brainchild opened last Friday in Portland. It
will hit 57 cities this summer, stopping Sunday at Blockbuster
Desert Sky Pavilion in Phoenix. And after critics carped about the
lack of diversity among last year's acts, McLachlan strived to meet
that question by offering a different mix of performers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again maybe the mix of artists isn't that important. It
didn't seem to be for the nearly 20,000 fans who showed up at the
Portland Civic Stadium, a baseball field oddly planted in the
middle of the city's bustling downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who was performing onstage, women of all ages, shapes
and sizes would stand off to the side of the mammoth stage and
dance. And it wasn't couples swaying romantically. Rather it
reflected people struggling to express them selves through
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The constant fluttering of arms and legs began right when Sinead
O'Connor took the stage under an uncommonly broiling sun. It contin
ued as dusk fell and a gentle breeze cooled off the crowd, which
failed to fill the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythms and melodies in O'Connor's 35-minute opening set
were hardly danceable, but it didn't stop the throng to the side of
the stage. Rather unintentionally, O'Connor's performance _ Liz
Phair fills her spot in the Phoenix show _ illustrated what works
and what doesn't with the Lilith Fair concept.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to most other music festivals, the emphasis here is
on pure, beautiful voices. It's not a guitar fest or a dance-off.
It's not a spectacle; the stage set was mini mal, save for two huge
banners that draped both sides of the stage, depicting Lilith and a
pair of angels.
</P>
<P>
   But with thousands of tipsy fans thrown into the mix, some occa
sional spectacle might not be a bad thing. O'Connor's introspective
six-song set showed off her lovely, if brittle, tones but seemed
more suited to a small cabaret setting than an overheated baseball
field mas querading as a concert venue.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that onlookers in the bleachers could pick up on
the subtle touches in O'Connor's songs. In hushed moments, noise
from vendors and people waiting for bathrooms to open up leaked to
the stage, killing the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive nature of her songs was offset by her playful
mood. The Irish singer thanked the audience after each song,
affecting a different accent each time. She sounded like a fruity
English dame one minute; the next, she was a hick Minnie Pearl. It
was goofy but vaguely endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in deference to the end less barbs about whining women
with guitars, McLachlan added R&AMP;B siren Erykah Badu to this year's
lineup. And in her striking head wrap and bold African garb, Badu
certainly was not as tradition ally Lilithesque as past headliners
Mary Chapin Carpenter and Paula Cole.
</P>
<P>
   That also goes to show you the impact that the festival has had:
Terms like Lilithesque have slipped into the vernacular. Already
stereo types about who and what make up the Lilith Fair crowd are
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Badu came close to greatness, at least in terms of her vocal
ability. She's got a sharp, tangy voice, which she placed over some
sinu ous, jazzy rhythms. She said on stage that Chaka Khan was one
of her heroes, but there are touches of Nancy Wilson and Sarah
Vaughan in her style as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying herself with the fluid movements of a dancer, Badu was
captivating to watch. On the other hand, her spacey, ethereal
patter seemed to go right over the heads of the crowd. She was
better when she stuck to vocalizing, particularly on Ye Yo, a
lovely lullaby to her son, Seven.
</P>
<P>
   She was followed by the Indigo Girls, perhaps the archetypal
Lilith act. The silk-and-sandpaper harmonies of Emily Saliers and
Amy Ray got a boost when McLachlan made a surprise appearance to
join voices on the hymn The Water Is Wide. Belgian group K's Choice
also turned up for one song, the closest the night ever came to a
jam session involving all the artists.
</P>
<P>
   That was a disappointment about the entire festival. There were
few surprises to be had. McLachlan had mentioned the artists
participating in loosely organized jam sessions, but apparently
those are held back stage, away from the eyes of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The audience didn't need any guest stars to warm up to Natalie
Merchant. They greeted the ex-10,000 Maniacs front woman with a
rapturous cheer the moment she seemingly floated onstage in her
billowing outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The good mood continued, though the diminutive singer seemed
dwarfed by the large size of the stadium and the event. The gently
whimsical touches in her set _ a little box she stood on that was
painted with stars, or the red scarf that she twirled with abandon
_ were lost to the night.
</P>
<P>
   By the time McLachlan took the stage at 9:30, it was clear she
was the favorite. At one point, fans pushed down a barrier to get
closer to their heroine, causing a momen tary panic for concert
security.
</P>
<P>
   Her set was brief _ no one played for more than an hour _
featuring seven numbers. But the mix of her graceful soprano and
her smartly crafted songs was enticing.
</P>
<P>
   She offered a new song, Black and White, but it was the radio
hits that people responded to. The dis turbing Possession throbbed
with its dark undercurrents. Building a Mys tery and Sweet
Surrender also seemed punchier than on disc, thanks to a tight
six-piece band and McLachlan's arresting delivery.
</P>
<P>
   If McLachlan seemed sure-footed onstage, she was equally in com
mand at a press conference held earlier in the day. The women
fielded some puffball questions with relatively good humor, each
demon strating the kind of personality they later would exhibit
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The waiflike McLachlan was sen sible and patient, seeming
comfort able in her newfound role as boss. Ray and Saliers were
upbeat cheer leaders, smiling and listening raptly when the other
artists talked.
</P>
<P>
   A subdued Merchant came off as shy and obviously brainy, the
smart girl who sat behind you in algebra but never said a word. A
goddess for all intelligent geeks, she also managed to work in
references to Swedish immigrants and use the word suffragette in
her conversation.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, wearing a shirt that said ``Jesus is coming,'' was re
served and cynical. O'Connor, who will miss the Phoenix show, had
the best quip when asked what she brought to the tour:
``Estrogen.''
</P>
<P>
   No one brought up any of the negative comments that have been
hurled at Lilith Fair: the lineup's lack of diversity or the
stereotypical perceptions that plague the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at work were all on me about this,'' said Craig
Russillo, a Portland attorney at the show. ``Like, why would you
want to go see a bunch of lesbians? But it's not like that. It's
about hearing some great music.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Indigo Girls being the only ``out'' headlining act,
that misconception should finally be put to rest. As for the
diversity of the bill, the acts that played the two smaller stages
_ only K's Choice will show up in Phoenix _ were a bit more
adventurous and colorful.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Billie Myers, of Jamaican/English descent, was kinetic,
climbing high on the stage rigging at one point, waving to the fans
in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   She opened the set by saying ``I'm so happy to be here at
Lilith.'' But when organizers told her she had to end her set after
three songs, she said ``this is bull (expletive)'' before launching
into a ferocious version of her hit Kiss the Rain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the enchanting Lhasa sang in Spanish, backed only by
drums, guitar and accordion. Her voice, as rich as a cup of
Brazilian coffee, was exotic and intoxicating. It also led one
listener to gripe, ``Why is she singing in French?''
</P>
<P>
   That also pointed out the general slant of the event. Lhasa,
Myers and Badu may be used to shake up the mix a little bit, but
it's not clear the fans want to be shaken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erykah Badu kind of fit but not really,'' said Shelley
Goentzen, a Portland apartment manager. ``It has to be a certain
kind of music, more natural, more flowing, not like hip-hop bands.
I don't think that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it all about?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah,'' she said. ``That type of music. I don't want to see
every kind of music that's out there. How could you do that? A
little '70s, a little country, a little R&AMP;B _ it wouldn't work. You
need a focus.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who weren't completely enthralled by the songs, there
were plenty of booths in the Lilith Village to make the time go
faster. They ranged from the educational (Planned Parenthood) to
the usual (Lilith merchandise) to the oddball (www.excite.com).
</P>
<P>
   Tower Records erected a little shop that not only sold
merchandise from the featured acts but also basically from all
women in music. You could find artists who should be added to
Lilith (Canada's fine singer-songwriter Jann Arden) and those who
never will be (the late Sandy Denny). Throw in discs by the likes
of Doris Day, Ella Fitzger ald, Loretta Lynn and, yes, even the
Spice Girls, and it illustrated the diversity of women in music far
better than the Lilith Fair itself.
</P>
<P>
   When it all finally wrapped up, a fan exiting in a Lilith
T-shirt remarked, ``I could listen to them forever.'' After eight
hours under the unusually fierce sun, it felt like we had been
listening to them forever.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours of any kind of music is pushing it. But a few less
heartfelt confessionals, a little more energy and some more diverse
sounds would make the day a little more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, if Jewel were here, that would have been so cool,'' said
Sarah Lindquist, a veteran of last year's festival. ``And that Ally
McBeal woman, she would have fit in perfectly. And Janet Jackson!
Oh, and that country woman, Shania whatever. And Madonna _ if she
would do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a Lilith Fair bill. &QL;

MARY CHAPIN CARPENTER HASN'T LEFT COUNTRY RADIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what people may think, Mary Chapin Carpenter hasn't
left country radio. Quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy and comfortable to be thought of as a country
artist,'' says Carpenter, at home in Seattle. ``I still want to
come to the party. I still have my invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years the party has gone on without her. Country
radio snubbed the offerings from 1996's wry ``A Place in the
World,'' and the disc became her poorest-selling effort since
1989's ``State of the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been a presence on country radio for a while now,''
she says frankly. ``There's a part of me that says if I put a
record out and it doesn't chart, it's disappointing. But what am I
going to do? Take my football and go home?''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, her success on traditional country radio was a
surprise from the start. When she first hit the national scene in
1987, Carpenter looked more like the college folkie she was than a
potential Nashville queen.
</P>
<P>
   Her music reflected the duration she spent in D.C. clubs. Her
own compositions are smart, sharp and pointed: ``He Thinks He'll
Keep Her'' spoofed a Geritol commercial and painted a vivid picture
of Carpenter as musical Everywoman all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't down home unless Seattle was your definition of
``down.'' Her deliciously sly reading of Lucinda Williams'
``Passionate Kisses'' was about as country as Cosmo Topper, but it
still was embraced by the Nashville establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Her success painted her as a major player in the early '90s. She
drew to the format legions of listeners who never owned a pair of
Justins and who think Resistol is an over-the-counter cold
medicine. ``I never liked country music until Mary Chapin
Carpenter'' seemed to be the mantra of her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that comment, but I figure people that say that
don't know a lot about country music,'' she says. ``There's a lot
of stuff out there that people are not exposed to. It's hard to
define.''
</P>
<P>
   And as radio playlists grow tighter and the number of
Stetson-sporting hunks increases, Carpenter's place seems equally
hard to define.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what other airplay there is for someone like
me,'' she says. ``I'm making music, so if somebody's playing it _
that's great. At a certain point, if nobody's playing it, well,
that's not so great.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no problem for Carpenter on the road. She can play when
she wants to play, where she wants to play and still draw the
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shows do well, so something is still working,'' she says.
``But records . . . it's a struggle. I'll hopefully keep touring,
keep making records. I recognize the importance of having hits, but
I can't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ironic thing is that Carpenter usually winds up with a
record that doesn't have the lasting quality of her best work when
she tries for a radio success. Case in point: ``Not Too Much to
Ask,'' a duet that teamed her with good ol' boy Joe Diffie. It may
have been a hit, but you won't find a lot of her fans screaming for
her to sing the song in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to sort of meet the record label in the middle and find
the marriage that works,'' she says. ``The songs that I feel are
little compromises are the ones that don't find success. That to me
is a message to try to be true to me, to just follow my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes to touring as well. She's in between albums and has
nothing to hype, but she still opted to strike out on a full-scale
national tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep saying to me, `You don't have a record out _ what
are you doing on the road?' '' she says. ``But it's simple: I am a
musician. I like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour stops range from such prestigious, big-ticket spots as
the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles to Saturday's gig at the intimate
Celebrity. She will appear with five musicians and personally
selected the acts who will open for her. Phoenix gets a recently
revitalized Joe Ely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very lean and mean tour with not a lot of bells and
whistles going on,'' she says. ``Joe Ely is great. I'm playing some
songs by other writers I like, just because I like them. I'm
touring to have fun. I don't want to go bankrupt doing it, but it's
fun.''  &QL;

DISABLED BOY TURNED AWAY FROM CHARTER SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHRYN CRENO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If anyone needs a school that caters to the needs of
disabled kids, Onyx Teasley does.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the mother of the 8-year-old boy with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome concluded last spring, after he missed a
third of the school year because of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onyx is a very bright, inquisitive kid,'' Melissa Teasely
said. ``I want to keep him going, even in the face of death.''
</P>
<P>
   So in April, she decided to enroll her son in a 180-student
charter school near her home that had mailed out brochures touting
programs for children ``with special needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wheelchair Onyx frequently uses never got through the
front door of Children's Academy of Arizona's school at 1875 N.
Central Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wonder how many other kids like Onyx schools turn
away,'' Melissa Teasley said.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit Arizona Center for Disability Law, which has
received about 200 complaints about charter schools' treatment of
disabled kids since last October, agreed to take on the case.
</P>
<P>
   To attorney Jerri Katzerman, the issue is clear cut:
</P>
<P>
   The suit she filed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday says Onyx
was turned away from Children's Academy because he has AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't so clear in the minds of Children's Academy
director Reginald Barr, who is a former member of the state Board
of Education, or state Department of Education staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Barr vehemently denies that Onyx was not admitted to the school
because of his disease.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said his Central Avenue campus has a 60-child waiting list
and no elevator to haul a wheelchair to the second floor. He said
when Onyx was offered a space at a wheelchair accessible Children's
Academy site on west Camelback Road, his mother turned that down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, if a school receives federal funds, they
must provide access'' for the disabled, Arizona Department of
Education spokeswoman Patricia Likens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this particular case, we are investigating whether that
regulation pertains to the program or to the building itself. We
need to look into that before we have a clear answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Teasley said that during her initial visit, Barr's staff
said nothing about a waiting list. In fact, she said, the school
had a large ``Open Enrollment'' sign on the side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   She said one staffer told her ``We don't have the money'' when
she toured the Central Avenue site and pointed out that structural
changes would have to be made to accommodate her son's wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, she said, a staff member told her that teachers would
be unwilling to ``handle'' Onyx and that his presence might upset
parents of other children.
</P>
<P>
   She said she found the comment about the parents particularly
offensive because she and her son believe he has nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Born with AIDS, Onyx was not expected to live past 2, Melissa
Teasley said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he is still alive because of special medications he has
received as a participant in a National Institutes of Health study
of children with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Onyx sometimes is in a wheelchair because he is too
weak to walk.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the last three years, he has attended Longview
Elementary in central Phoenix with a medical assistant who gives
him five different kinds of medicine and a continual supply of
water to prevent him from dehydrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be lacking in some areas but he more than makes up for
it in other ways,'' Melissa Teasley said.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx, for instance, has told classmates at Longview about his
disease during show-and-tell. He brought a toy ``doctors kit'' that
includes latex gloves, syringes minus the needles and other
equipment to demonstrate safety precautions health workers use when
they drawing blood and treating him in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids were really surprised that I have AIDS,'' Onyx said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some didn't think it was a very big deal. I told them that
when I get a cut, I tell someone right away and make sure I don't
touch anyone who also has a cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr denies that his staff would not welcome Onyx.
</P>
<P>
   But he does question whether federal law actually requires him
to remodel his Central Avenue school _ or simply teach Onyx and any
other children somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure this young boy receives the right kind of
care and I have no problem spending money to do that,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do I need to shortchange other students by spending money
to remodel a school when I can accommodate him at another
facility?''
</P>
<P>
   Katzerman says the answer is simple. All public schools _
including charter schools _ must be 100 percent accessible to the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separate but equal is against the law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if a grandparent of a child is in a wheelchair and wants
to visit the school? A public building must be accessible to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzerman said while her center also takes complaints about
special education issues in district schools, it has received about
200 calls about problems in Arizona's estimated 250 charter schools
since last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frequent thing we hear is that parents of disabled
kids are discouraged from applying to charter schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are told that the schools probably aren't the best place
for their child,'' she said. ``They are told `You have become a
consumer _ is our school the best way you can spend your
educational dollar?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Lund, director of exceptional student services at the
Department of Education, agrees that many charter school operators
have had difficulty grasping that special education laws require
them to accommodate the needs of any student _ regardless of how
complex the child's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Her staff recently put together ``Charter Starter'' packets
explaining regulations that obligate all public schools to educate
disabled kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, it's an eye opener,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibilities are a lot more than they thought they
were getting into.''

BILL WOULD CUT FEE FOR CROSS-BORDER CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business people and mayors of Arizona border towns are keeping
their fingers crossed that Congress will adopt more realistic fees
and deadlines for replacing 5.5 million Mexican border-crossing
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some feared that many Mexicans cannot afford the $45 fee being
charged for the new ``laser visas'' and would stop crossing the
border to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are applauding a proposed amendment to the law by Sen.
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., that would waive the
fee for children under 15 and give the U.S. State Department an
extra four years to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very apprehensive,'' said Fred Johnson, former
president of the Nogales-Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the border towns depend on Mexican customers, and
that ``Everything we do to make it more difficult for the border
customer to come across has a serious impact on border economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered the replacement of old, easily counterfeited
border-crossing cards in an effort to control illegal immigration,
but did not consider the unintended consequences, an aide to Kolbe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laser visa system was intended to encourage, not inhibit
legitimate and lawful cross-border commerce,'' Kolbe said. ``This
bill introduces a more realistic fee policy and timetable for the
transition to a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, the State Department began replacing the outdated
documents with state-of-the-art ``laser visas'' that include an
individual's photograph, fingerprint and biographical data stored
with the use of compact disc technology.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had initially set an October 1999 deadline to complete
the switch, but State Department officials said the deadline was
impossible to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Kyl-Kolbe plan, U.S. consulates in Mexico will have
until October 2003 to replace the old cards with laser visas.
</P>
<P>
   Among those cheering the proposed amendment is Ray Borane, mayor
of Douglas, who says his city relies on Mexican shoppers for 40
percent of its retail revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with it,'' he said. ``Douglas and Agua
Prieta (Sonora) are really one bicultural community. We not only
depend on one another economically, but there are many social and
family ties on both sides . . . that would be stifled if people
couldn't come across.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix-based Border Trade Alliance, representing businesses
on both sides of the border, and Gov. Jane Hull have also been
seeking changes in the laser visa law.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's ``biggest concern is that those people who wanted to come
across legally and couldn't afford to replace their cards would
just not come across anymore,'' said Margie Emmermann, the
governor's policy adviser on Mexico. &QL;

AT&AMP;T,   TCI DEAL ALL ABOUT LINE ACCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The $48 billion merger of AT&AMP;T Corp. and
Tele-Communications Inc. creates a powerhouse communications
company that will put customers a click away from a vast array of
entertainment and information products, plus provide telephone
service around the world and around the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the deal will give AT&AMP;T access to 13.5 million
subscribers across the nation that get television programming via
TCI and its affiliates. AT&AMP;T can use that cable network to provide
phone service and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   A new subsidiary, AT&AMP;T Consumer Service, will market the product
lines, including TCI's cable service. AT&AMP;T said the new unit will
accelerate improvements to TCI's cable infrastructure and begin
offering digital telephone, video and data services to consumers by
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading cable lines for two-way transmission of digital
signals should be completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which could include up to 500 television channels,
will be offered under the AT&AMP;T brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will pretty much get one-stop shopping for a wide
range of services. TCI has got a pretty substantial customer base
and they have already laid the groundwork for an existing cable
system to reach a lot more homes,'' said Timothy K. Horan, an
analyst at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   TCI serves about 95,000 households in Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley area and 26,000 in Ventura County. All told the company is
in roughly 400,000 Southern California homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   However, for consumers, change will come later rather than
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very early to speculate on what changes consumers will
see and in what order,'' said Ellen Zundl, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal weds the nation's top telecommunications company and
one of the biggest cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   It benefits AT&AMP;T because the company is able to circumvent local
phone lines and to gain a foothold in the local phone market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're beginning to answer a big part of the question
about how we will provide local service to U.S. consumers,'' AT&AMP;T
Chairman C. Michael Armstrong told reporters in announcing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of
1999. Within three years, it will help the companies save about $2
billion annually through reduced costs, such as advertising,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   TCI benefits because AT&AMP;T has the cash to upgrade the cable
infrastructure more quickly than it could have done by itself.
</P>
<P>
   A critical component of the new unit's strategy is TCI's plan to
distribute about 10 million advance cable boxes over the next three
years. These devices will deliver hundreds of television channels
and Internet access. AT&AMP;T could then sell telephone services via
those cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Prepping this kind of market will cost about $500 per home, but
the cost to consumers for connection and usage fees has not been
established.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest benefits for consumers would be speed. Cable
lines can carry information more than 1,000 times faster than
telephone companies' copper lines and 100 times faster than
integrated services digital networks, or ISDN, lines.
</P>
<P>
   A file that would take 5 minutes to download over a standard
computer-and-phone-line modem would take about one second via a
cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be quite different than what people see today or
are expecting,'' said Berge Ayvazian, an industry analyst with the
Yankee Group, a Boston-based research firm. &QL;

KNICKS TRADE OAKLEY FOR CAMBY ON DRAFT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Updates and expands earlier story.)  (lb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ On the night the National
Basketball Association held its draft, the New York Knicks severed
their decade-long relationship with Charles Oakley, considered the
heart and soul of the team, in a trade that will send him to the
Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby, according to two Raptor team
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Knicks gave their second pick in the draft, the
44th over all, and cash to the financially strapped Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was noted for his aggressive rebounding and head-first
plays for loose balls since he arrived in 1988. He was offered to
the Raptors for a chance at a young shot-blocker and scorer like
the 6-foot-11-inch Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 24-year-old Camby has been fragile in his first two
pro seasons, the Knicks are in need of a more active front-court
player than the 35-year old Oakley. This need was magnified when
they watched Indiana's Antonio Davis and Dale Davis block shots,
grab rebounds and put down dunks as they eliminated the Knicks in
the second-round of the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was attractive to the cash-strapped Raptors because he
has one year left on his deal, even though he is scheduled to make
$10 million in the balloon year of his contract next season. One
league official speculated that the Knicks could pay part of
Oakley's contract. Although the Raptors believe in Camby, they fear
losing him next summer when he is eligible to become a free agent.
Oakley might not fit in with the Raptors' high-flying style, but he
could be used for a future trade.
</P>
<P>
   With their first pick, No. 38 over all, the Knicks selected
DeMarco Johnson, a 6-8 forward from North Carolina-Charlotte. His
skill is hard to gauge because he has played fewer than 55 games in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi of Pacific University was selected at No. 1
by the Clippers in the National Basketball Association draft at GM
Place Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Grizzlies took Mike Bibby, a 6-1 guard, with the
No. 2 pick and were said to be entertaining offers for him.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither the Knicks nor the Nets had one of the first 29
picks, the New York metropolitan area was represented in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Al Harrington, the 6-9 phenom from St. Patrick's High School in
Elizabeth, N.J., was taken 25th by the Indiana Pacers. He was the
first high school player taken, ahead of Parade Magazine's national
player of the year, Rashard Griffin, who was not taken until the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Lopez took a much more circuitous path. Lopez, whose
development at St. John's was always overshadowed by expectations
and hyperbole born out of his schoolboy legend days in Queens,
finally made it to the NBA Wednesday night. He was taken 24th by
the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Denver became one of several teams to pass on Kansas swingman
Paul Pierce, who fell to No. 10 into the laps of the Boston
Celtics. Instead, the Nuggets took his teammate, power forward Raef
LaFrentz at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing,'' said Pierce, who averaged 20.4
points last season. ``I have to move on and use it as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors selected North Carolina's Antawn Jamison
with the fourth pick and the Golden State Warriors chose his Tar
Heel teammate Vince Carter with the fifth pick. But the Raptors,
knowing the Warriors wanted Jamison all along, then traded Jamison
to Golden State for Carter plus cash.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor, Michigan's trimmed-down, 6-7,
284-pound forward, was taken sixth by the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas
traded him to Milwaukee for the rights to Milwaukee's two
first-round picks: the German forward Dirk Nowitzki, chosen No. 9,
and Pat Garrity, picked at No. 19. Dallas then sent Garrity,
forward Martin Muursepp, Charles Wells and a 1999 draft pick to
Phoenix for point guard Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Florida point guard Jason Williams was selected seventh by the
Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took a 19-year-old, St. Louis shooting guard Larry
Hughes, with the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   Bonzi Wells went to the Detroit Pistons with the 11th pick,
giving them a scorer to replace the free agent Jerry Stackhouse.
Wells averaged 21.4 points and 7.3 rebounds in four years at Ball
State, breaking Ron Harper's school scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   While Pierce tumbling out of the top five was surprising,
nothing was more intriguing than who would go No. 1 and why,
leading up to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby was projected as the first pick for the last month until
the Clippers' phone began ringing incessantly about Olowokandi, who
learned the game in relative obscurity the past three years at
little-known Pacific in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's agent, David Falk, was so confident his client would go
No. 1 that he had him work out only for the Clippers. But Falk
began to sweat on Tuesday, flying to Los Angeles to meet with the
Clippers' owner, Donald Sterling, with the notion of pleading
Bibby's case as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to give my opinion, I think it would be because
Vancouver got a lot of offers from veteran teams who wanted to
trade up and get me, and they figured they could keep me and get
something better later on,'' Olowokandi said, reasoning why he was
taken No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Elgin Baylor said,'' he added of the Clipper general
manager, ``there is a lack of available centers in the league right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi is the second straight center and college senior to
be taken with the No. 1 overall pick, following Tim Duncan's
selection by San Antonio last season.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, 23, averaged 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 2.9
blocked shots as a senior with the Tigers, earning Big West
Conference player of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi becomes the first player drafted from Pacific since
John Gianelli, who played on the Knicks' 1973 championship team,
was taken by the Houston Rockets in the second round of the 1972
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, meanwhile, got a rousing ovation from the Vancouver fans
as he stepped to the podium. Asked how he felt to be drafted by a
team he never worked out for, he smiled and said, ``It makes me
feel wanted, at least.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Through trades, Orlando and Houston controlled the middle of the
draft. The Magic and Rockets had three picks apiece between Nos. 12
and 18. Orlando used its first two picks on big men: Utah's 6-11
Michael Doleac and Nevada Las-Vegas' Keon Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, took small forward Michael Dickerson of Arizona at
No. 14 before Orlando made its third selection, forward Matt
Harpring of Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also took shooting guard Bryce Drew of Valparaiso
with the 16th pick.
</P>
<P>
   With the 24th pick, the San Antonio Spurs selected Felipe Lopez,
the St. John's guard. Lopez was a highly-touted player coming out
of high school, but had a disappointing four years with the Red
Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks do not have a first-round pick, and the New Jersey
Nets have no pick in either the first or second round. With the
38th and 44th picks in the second round, the Knicks were hoping to
move up and acquire a young frontline player or a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 24 picks, no high school player was chosen. Al
Harrington, the 6-9 center from St. Patrick's High School in
Elizabeth, N.J., was chosen at No. 25 by the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Parade Magazine's national player of the year, Rashard Lewis of
Alief Elsik High School in Alief, Texas, was taken by the Seattle
SuperSonics with the third pick in the second round.

LIVE INTERNET PROGRAM DRAWS COMPLAINTS FROM NEIGHBORS, CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Josh Harris has made a name for himself in New York
City's Silicon Alley _ first by founding a new-media consulting
company, then by holding large parties in a SoHo loft that evoked
comparisons to Andy Warhol's Factory. Most recently, he's known for
producing video programming for the Internet through a company
called Pseudo Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who said he employs 45 people and provides an outlet for
independent producers, would like the city to offer incentives for
start-up Internet ventures like his. Instead, he said, he has been
awakened in the middle of the night by gun-toting fire marshals in
bulletproof vests over complaints, mostly from neighbors, that he
stages his Internet programming in front of live audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole tone and tenor of them showing up that way is to
intimidate us from holding the events,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   As city fire officials see it, however, Harris is violating fire
codes required of social clubs and other places where more than 75
people congregate.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving 11 complaints about Pseudo Programs, the Fire
Department's Social Club Task Force inspected its studio six times
and ultimately issued a summons against Harris in January for
failing to provide lighted exit signs, maintain his sprinkler
system and meet other fire codes, said Louis F. Garcia, the chief
of fire investigations. He added that fire marshals are required by
law to wear bulletproof vests and carry firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's being persecuted,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the summons, Harris faces a $10,000 fine or six months in
jail or both. Harris said he had already spent $50,000 to bring his
studio up to code. A hearing is set for July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo Programs was established in May 1994 as a content
provider for the Internet service Prodigy. At the same time, Harris
said, he began throwing huge parties, often attracting as many as
2,000 performance artists, musicians and other creative people.
</P>
<P>
   From these events, Harris said, he developed the contacts and
ideas for the niche programming that the company began producing
about a year ago. Today, Pseudo offers 45 one-hour programs a week
on subjects from hip-hop music to skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   But Pseudo has also annoyed some neighbors by regularly inviting
what Harris describes as 75 ``movers and shakers in the hip-hop
business'' to his Wednesday night Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   As he acknowledges, some of his guests hang around afterward in
front of a Pottery Barn store at street level and occasionally
leave graffiti behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our storefront is covered with graffiti,'' said Susanna
Somogyi, a manager of the Pottery Barn in SoHo. She said that a few
times _ most recently, last week _ people believed to be guests of
Pseudo have also tried to break into the store.
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and his lawyer, John Johnson, said they felt that
Pseudo was targeted by the city's Multi-Agency Nightclub
Enforcement Task Force, formed in 1996 to address noise and illegal
activities at bars and nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's office said that the nightclub
task force had not been involved in the case against Pseudo. The
social club task force, which sometimes participates in
investigations by the nightclub task force, operates independently
under the Fire Department. It was formed after a 1990 fire killed
87 people at the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said that an Internet company with a live studio audience
has the same obligation to conform to fire codes as, say, David
Letterman does with his ``Late Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to wind up with another fire in another
unprotected location and wind up with a lot of people dead,''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said that since Pseudo did not have the resources of
CBS, the city should help the company meet the fire codes. ``My big
bone of contention with the city is that they should tell them what
they need to get done and try to help them with interim measures so
they could still operate and be within the law,'' he said.

BURST PIPE FLOODS MODERN ART MUSEUM'S SUB-BASEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A burst water main in midtown Manhattan flooded the
sub-basement of the Museum of Modern Art Wednesday, endangering two
dozen crates of artwork awaiting shipment, museum officials said.
No art was damaged because the crates were stored 6 to 10 inches
off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three inches of water filled the building's sub-basement,
which is not open to the public, after a truck ran over a six-inch
water main supplying a midtown Manhattan hydrant, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conservators immediately evacuated everything that was
down there and double-checked to make sure everything did not get
wet,'' Glenn Lowry, the museum's director, said. ``The range of
objects that were down there did not include anything of
extraordinary importance.'' He said that he could not name the
specific works, but that the sub-basement was generally used only
for less valuable items.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowry, citing fears of another such break, said the museum
would study whether to build a protective wall _ he called it a box
within a box _ to seal off its basement from future water main
breaks. ``We've been here since 1929 and to the best of my
knowledge this has never happened before,'' he said. ``After this,
we're increasingly aware of how fragile and vulnerable we are to
these kind of crises.''
</P>
<P>
   The rupturing of the pipe on West 53rd Street between Fifth and
Sixth avenues was the third highly publicized water main break in
the city this year. In January, a 48-inch water main burst,
creating a huge, car-swallowing sinkhole and a flame of natural gas
two stories high on Fifth Avenue. In March, a sprinkler line burst,
nearly drowning a 22-year-old woman and her terrier trapped in
their Upper East Side apartment building elevator.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials say that despite appearances, manmade deluges
are not growing more common. Charles Sturcken, chief of staff in
the Department of Environmental Protection, said that a recent
analysis by the department found that the number of water main
breaks in New York has remained the same since the 1970s, about 550
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average has not increased,'' he said. ``The vast majority
are small breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said that employees working in a nearby brownstone, which
had been converted into an office by the museum, heard the sound of
running water coming from the basement just before 1 p.m. An
employee opened a storage room door to find a funnel of water
pouring out of the wall. ``Imagine a fire hydrant with a valve
open,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   The basement of that brownstone, at 41 W. 53rd St., eventually
filled with 10 feet of water, Fire Department officials said. Water
then flooded the basements of two adjoining brownstones to the
east, at 37 and 39 W. 53rd. Finally, water burst through the wall
of a stairwell leading to the museum building's sub-basement, its
lowest level, at 11 W. 53rd St., and flowed downstairs to where the
crated artwork was stored.
</P>
<P>
   Sturcken said local residents told city officials that a truck
had run over the hydrant two weeks ago. Another truck ran over what
was left of the hydrant Wednesday, ramming a protruding section of
pipe into the ground and causing the pipe below the street to burst
from the pressure. City officials said they had no record of
anyone's having previously reported the initial hydrant damage to
city agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As the fire trucks left Wednesday, Lowry tried to be
philosophical about the flood. ``These are the kinds of things that
an old system is going to suffer,'' he said.

DEFIANCE REIGNS AS COUNCIL KEEPS SWINGING AT MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new act in a streak of defiance that began last
week, the City Council stiff-armed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani three
times Wednesday and used its harshest oratory for a measure giving
voters a say in the future of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Council members invoked the Boston Tea Party as they voted 39-7
to authorize a referendum in November intended to prevent the use
of city money to help the New York Yankees move from the Bronx to
Manhattan. ``We're talking about the Bronx Bombers _ not the West
Side Wallopers,'' said City Councilman Gifford Miller, D-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The vote sets up a likely court fight with the mayor, who has
extolled the advantages of a Manhattan stadium and has vowed to
knock the council's measure off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In two other jabs at Giuliani, the council added so many
conditions to a bill making the Department of Homeless Services a
separate city agency that the mayor said he would veto it, and it
also refused to start work on the mayor's bill to deny contracting
licenses to companies with ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the council's decisions amounted to another tear
in the quickly fraying relationship between the Republican mayor
and the Democratic-dominated council. Last week, in a vote also
influenced by the debate over Yankee Stadium, the council overrode
his vetoes of items for next year's budget, prompting a vow by the
mayor to block spending.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the friction, the two sides agreed Wednesday on a
bill, championed as historic by gay-rights groups, to give domestic
partners the same rights as married couples under city law. The
bill means that domestic partners, if they register with the city,
will receive the same benefits as spouses in future contracts with
unions of city workers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also grants domestic partners visitation rights in
city hospitals and succession rights to rent-controlled apartments.
It also give bereavement leave to city employees who register as
domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was proposed by Giuliani despite the risk to his
prospects for national advancement in a party where conservatives
control most nominations. The council gallery was packed with
gay-rights advocates, who hissed when opponents spoke. Brendan Fay,
a leader of a group of gay and lesbian Catholics, called the
measure ``a tiny step for our community, but a gigantic leap for
our conservative mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, a Democrat from Manhattan who is
one of three openly gay and lesbian members of the council, flew
the rainbow-striped gay flag from her microphone on the floor of
the council chamber. In arguing for the bill, she read words of
Thomas Jefferson that are painted on the ceiling, promising ``equal
and exact justice to all men of whatever state or persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium measure produced a more raucous debate, with some
council members sporting Yankee lapel pins or baseball caps. ``This
bill,'' said Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, a Brooklyn Democrat,
``assures the right of the people of New York City to carry on the
legacy that began with the throwing of the tea over the side of the
ship _ that no one could create for them a country in which they
could not have a voice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The council speaker, Peter Vallone, said a vote could prevent
``a billion-dollar rip-off'' resulting from ``secret negotiations
that are going on just between a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro said the mayor would veto the
referendum bill, which he called ``a hollow political gesture''
that will never appear on the ballot because a referendum favored
by the mayor _ proposed revisions to the City Charter _ would
supersede it under city law. Mastro said the stadium referendum
exists only to enhance the political fortunes of Vallone, who is
running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Vallone vowed to go to court to ensure that his
proposal makes the ballot. He said his ground for a lawsuit would
be that the charter revisions were being proposed only to block a
vote on the Yankees. ``It's contrary to the purposes of the
charter,'' he said. ``It's a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, the spokesman for the team's principal owner,
George Steinbrenner III, said a referendum would be ``very
disruptive'' as he decides among three options: staying in the
Bronx, or moving to the West Side of Manhattan or New Jersey. He
has said he will not pick until after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was also upset over the council's handling of a bill
that would make the Department of Homeless Services an independent
agency. Although he favored the concept, he did not approve of all
the conditions the council added before passing it, 41-6. Giuliani
had said earlier in the day that he expected to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they tried to do is load it down with so many terms,
conditions and burdens that they would have destroyed it,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions included adding beds and cribs to a center in the
Bronx where families apply for emergency shelter; limiting the
number of beds in new adult shelters to 200, and requiring the
submission of sanitation, health and fire protection records to the
council.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's veto would essentially dissolve the agency on June
30, and homeless services would once again be managed by the city's
Human Resources Administration. Vallone has vowed that the council
will override the veto. But both sides have indicated they are
willing to compromise to save the agency, which has been held up as
a national model for improving services to homeless single adults
and families in the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The council and the mayor's office also clashed over the future
of legislation that would give the city the power to impose
stricter regulations on whether certain companies are fit to work
on public or private construction projects in the city. In an
effort to get organized crime out of the construction industry,
Giuliani is pressing for legislation that would deny licenses to
contractors if they were found to ``lack good character, honesty
and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office had asked the council to introduce the
legislation at Wednesday's meeting, the first step in a series of
hearings and votes that lead to a bill's becoming law. But council
officials said the mayor's office submitted the legislation too
late. Council rules say legislation must be submitted to the
council by 1 p.m. on Friday to be introduced at a meeting the next
Wednesday. The mayor's bill did not arrive until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's above the law,'' said Bruce Bender, Vallone's chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro said that in the past, the council has routinely
introduced bills that had been submitted on Mondays. He added,
``Score one for organized crime.''

SILVER CHARM OUT OF GOLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Silver Charm, the heartbreak colt, is out of
Sunday's Hollywood Gold Cup, leaving Hollywood Park with the
notable matchup of Skip Away and Gentlemen but not the ``Race of
the Decade'' it advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm was withdrawn Wednesday morning after trainer Bob
Baffert reported he developed a temperature of 102 degrees, one or
two degrees above normal for a thoroughbred. After a blood test
later in the day, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner seemed to be
fighting a virus, Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got something there, so we can't afford to take a
chance,'' Baffert said. ``If I ran him and he got pneumonia or
something like that, I couldn't live with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's reminiscent of the Santa Anita Handicap in March. Silver
Charm was scratched the day before that race after returning from a
gallop with a bruised foot, leaving Santa Anita with thousands of
T-shirts ballyhooing his ``Showdown'' with Gentlemen. Capping a
beautiful week in the racetrack marketing world, Gentlemen bled
internally during the race and finished last at 1-20 odds.
</P>
<P>
   Since Silver Charm recovered quickly to win the $4 million Dubai
World Cup three weeks later, cynics charged that the foot bruise
was trumped up because the colt's handlers never wanted to run in
Santa Anita's little $1 million affair.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park general manager Eual Wyatt Jr., asked Wednesday
if he was suspicious of Silver Charm's latest withdrawal, answered
with an emphatic, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm owner Bob Lewis said it was simply a matter of
protecting the health of the popular gray horse who came within
half a length of sweeping the 1997 Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a great day Sunday anyway,'' Lewis said.
``It's just unfortunate we won't be able to come to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert speculated that the illness is the result of the stress
of Silver Charm's second-place finish to Awesome Again in the
Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs on June 13 and the
flight home. Because he had raced so recently, it had been a
surprise when Baffert announced last week that Silver Charm would
try the Gold Cup, for which entries will be taken this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm performed well in a 5-furlong workout Tuesday at
Santa Anita, recording a :58 3/5 clocking, fastest of the morning.
Baffert said his staff takes the temperatures of all the horses in
the barn each morning, and first thing on Wednesday Silver Charm
was normal.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert said he didn't attack the feed tub as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``(His groom) said he went to the corner and just put his head
down,'' the trainer said. ``We took his temperature again, and he
had a fever of 102. We brought every thermometer in the barn to
take his temperature, and they all had the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million Gold Cup would have marked 4-year-old Silver
Charm's first meeting with 6-year-old Gentlemen, the top handicap
horse in California for more than a year, or with 5-year-old Skip
Away, the nation's champion older horse of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Gold Cup features a rematch of the other two
horses, who met in the '97 Pimlico Special, Gentlemen holding off
Skip Away by half a length. Each ran one of his sharpest races at
Hollywood Park _ Gentlemen winning the '97 Gold Cup by four lengths
to lead a 1-2-3 sweep by trainer Richard Mandella, and Skip Away
winning by six lengths in the '97 Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   With Silver Charm's departure, jockey Gary Stevens is free to
jump back to Gentlemen, knocking Corey Nakatani out of the saddle.
The horses and riders expected to be entered: Gentlemen, Skip Away
(Jerry Bailey), Puerto Madero (Kent Desormeaux), Budroyale (Matt
Garcia), Bagshot (Alex Solis) and Don't Blame Rio. Listed as
``possible'' are Mud Route (Chris McCarron) and Anet.

PAC-10, BIG TEN AIM TO ALTER NCAA RULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two top Division I-A conferences want changes in the NCAA's
governance structure, which is less than a year old.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 Conference is sponsoring legislation to change
the membership makeup of NCAA committees. And Big Ten Conference
commissioner Jim Delany has circulated memos expressing his
league's displeasure with the setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Delany's memos to Division I-A commissioners said,
`This isn't the house we built and we're not happy living in it,'
'' said a source who had seen a copy of the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The discord centers on a power struggle. Division I-A schools
want more control and input on legislation that affects them. And
the most powerful conferences aren't shy about flexing their
political muscle to gain support on the committee issue.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl championship series agreed last year to distribute
money to I-AA schools, and Division I-A pushed for legislation that
would allow games with I-AA schools to count toward I-A teams
becoming bowl-eligible. Division I-A leaders could be waiting to
cash in, quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something that will be mentioned,'' Pacific-10
Conference commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``There's a political
aspect to all of this. That rule about I-AA games counting toward
bowl eligibility, that could go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Division I-A comprises schools with major football programs;
I-AA is made up of schools with midmajor football programs. I-AAA
comprises Division I schools that don't play football.
</P>
<P>
   Although there appears to be a rift in Division I pitting I-A
against I-AA and I-AAA schools, there is also discord in Division
I-A.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 is sponsoring legislation that would move conference
championship games from the first Saturday in December to the last
Saturday of November.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference, which staged the first conference
title game in 1992 and is one of four conferences with a
championship game, has expressed displeasure with the proposal and
asked the Pac-10 to withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's legislative proposal on committee membership could
lead to a full vote of Division I members. However, a subcommittee
is looking at a compromise that would not require a vote of all
Division I members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that our peers should be involved in selecting the
teams in basketball and baseball, and we should be judged by our
peers on the infractions committees,'' Hansen said. ``We tried to
reach a compromise, but we've come to an impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's revised structure took effect in August and was
designed to streamline the legislative process. In Division I, a
board of directors (presidents) oversees a management council
(athletic directors and faculty representatives), which oversees
four cabinet and eight committees.
</P>
<P>
   The new structure calls for no division to have a majority on
committees. For example, on committees such as men's basketball and
baseball, four of the nine members can be from Division I-A
conferences. (On the board of directors and the management council,
however, Division I-A has majority representation).
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Big Ten sought a waiver that would permit Michigan
State to play in the Black Coaches Association preseason football
game in August. Rules prohibit more than one team from a conference
playing in a preseason game in one season, and Purdue is to play in
the Pigskin Classic on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board of directors approved the waiver that allowed
Michigan State to play Colorado State on Aug. 29, Delany was irked
by the management council's original decision that upheld the rule.
Delany believed that I-AA and I-AAA should not have voted on this
issue. (Division I-A representatives from the Pac-10 and Conference
USA voted against the Big Ten request).
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee issue is one that Division I-A cares about,''
said Big South Conference commissioner Kyle Kallander, whose league
is made up of I-AA and I-AAA schools. ``I think there needs to be
some fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't categorize it as class or division warfare. I
believe there's room for compromise.''

PROSECUTION: OFFICERS PLANNED TO LIE TO PROTECT ACCUSED COLLEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arguing that police officers tried to cover up a
colleague's role in the 1994 choking death of a Bronx man, a
prosecutor said Wednesday that the officers had prepared an
elaborate lie to place the blame on a fictitious black man who
disappeared from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, speaking out of the jury's presence,
told a federal judge in Manhattan that Officer Daisy Boria was
prepared to testify that ``in the formative stages, the story was
going to be a mysterious stranger with black hands choked'' the
victim, Anthony Baez.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Shira Scheindlin refused to allow that testimony into
the trial of Francis Livoti. She did not explain why she considered
it inadmissible.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment
on the judge's action, but Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, said of
Boria's planned testimony: ``It was hearsay that was neither
reliable nor trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had told the judge that Boria was told of the
cover story by her partner, who was at the scene with her that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Scheindlin did allow other testimony by Boria about what
Pomerantz said was ``in the nature of a police cover-up.`` Boria
testified that she declined an invitation to meet with other
officers to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Livoti was acquitted of state charges of criminally
negligent homicide in the death of Baez on Dec. 22, 1994. He was
later dismissed by the police force.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between Livoti and Baez was sparked by a
late-night touch football game outside the Baez family home in the
Bronx in which a football hit police cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's acquittal led to street protests in the Bronx and
further fueled the debate about how the police treat minorities in
New York. Baez was Hispanic and Livoti is white.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides resting their cases in the week-old federal case
Wednesday, Judge Scheindlin told the jurors that closing arguments
would begin Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In another case stemming from Baez's death, a judge in the Bronx
unsealed additional parts of a deposition Wednesday in a wrongful
death lawsuit filed by the Baez family against the Police
Department. The newly released parts show that Louis Anemone, now
chief of department, rejected a 1991 recommendation _ three years
before Baez's death _ to transfer Livoti because of the number of
police brutality complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was made by Livoti's commander at the time,
William Casey, now a deputy chief, who said in the deposition that
there were 12 civilian complaints against Livoti by 1991, of which
nine alleged excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   A police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity on
Tuesday night, said that Anemone had rejected the transfer because
the complaints against Livoti were unsubstantiated. Continuing to
demand anonymity last night, the same police official broadened
those reasons, saying that Anemone also countermanded the transfer
because of Livoti's status as a union delegate.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman, Deputy Inspector Michael Collins, reiterated
Wednesday night that the department would have no comment on the
trial or the pending civil suit.

CLIPPERS GET 7 FEET 1 INCH OF POTENTIAL AT NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new lead and new head, to downplay the trade of
Oakley, as he has not been contacted.)  (lb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ His skill is hard to gauge because
he has played fewer than 55 games in his life. But his size _ 7
feet 1 inch, 265 pounds _ made it impossible for the Los Angeles
Clippers to stubbornly choose a small point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi of Pacific University was selected at No. 1
by the Clippers in the National Basketball Association draft at GM
Place Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Grizzlies took Mike Bibby, a 6-1 guard, with the
No. 2 pick and were said to be entertaining offers for him.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft-night trade, the Knicks severed their decade-long
relationship with Charles Oakley, considered the heart and soul of
the team, in a deal that sent him to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus
Camby, according to two Raptor team officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Knicks gave their second pick in the draft, the
44th over all, and cash to the financially strapped Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   One Knick official said the team was not prepared to announce
the deal because they had not contacted Oakley. Calls to Oakley's
house were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was noted for his aggressive rebounding and head-first
plays for loose balls since he arrived in 1988. He was offered to
the Raptors for a chance at a young shot-blocker and scorer like
the 6-foot-11-inch Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 24-year-old Camby has been fragile in his first two
pro seasons, the Knicks are in need of a more active front-court
player than the 35-year old Oakley. This need was magnified when
they watched Indiana's Antonio Davis and Dale Davis block shots,
grab rebounds and put down dunks as they eliminated the Knicks in
the second-round of the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was attractive to the cash-strapped Raptors because he
has one year left on his deal, even though he is scheduled to make
$10 million in the balloon year of his contract next season. One
league official speculated that the Knicks could pay part of
Oakley's contract. Although the Raptors believe in Camby, they fear
losing him next summer when he is eligible to become a free agent.
Oakley might not fit in with the Raptors' high-flying style, but he
could be used for a future trade.
</P>
<P>
   Denver became one of several teams to pass on Kansas swingman
Paul Pierce, who fell to No. 10 into the laps of the Boston
Celtics. Instead, the Nuggets took his teammate, power forward Raef
LaFrentz at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors selected North Carolina's Antawn Jamison
with the fourth pick and the Golden State Warriors chose his Tar
Heel teammate Vince Carter with the fifth pick. But the Raptors,
knowing the Warriors wanted Jamison all along, then traded Jamison
to Golden State for Carter plus cash.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor, Michigan's trimmed-down, 6-7,
284-pound forward, was taken sixth by the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas
traded him to Milwaukee for the rights to Milwaukee's two
first-round picks: the German forward Dirk Nowitzki, chosen No. 9,
and Pat Garrity, picked at No. 19. Dallas then sent Garrity,
forward Martin Muursepp, Charles Wells and a 1999 draft pick to
Phoenix for point guard Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Florida point guard Jason Williams was selected seventh by the
Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took a 19-year-old, St. Louis shooting guard Larry
Hughes, with the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   Bonzi Wells went to the Detroit Pistons with the 11th pick,
giving them a scorer to replace the free agent Jerry Stackhouse.
Wells averaged 21.4 points and 7.3 rebounds in four years at Ball
State, breaking Ron Harper's school scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   While Pierce tumbling out of the top five was surprising,
nothing was more intriguing than who would go No. 1 and why,
leading up to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby was projected as the first pick for the last month until
the Clippers' phone began ringing incessantly about Olowokandi, who
learned the game in relative obscurity the past three years at
little-known Pacific in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's agent, David Falk, was so confident his client would go
No. 1 that he had him work out only for the Clippers. But Falk
began to sweat on Tuesday, flying to Los Angeles to meet with the
Clippers' owner, Donald Sterling, with the notion of pleading
Bibby's case as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to give my opinion, I think it would be because
Vancouver got a lot of offers from veteran teams who wanted to
trade up and get me, and they figured they could keep me and get
something better later on,'' Olowokandi said, reasoning why he was
taken No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Elgin Baylor said,'' he added of the Clipper general
manager, ``there is a lack of available centers in the league right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi is the second straight center and college senior to
be taken with the No. 1 overall pick, following Tim Duncan's
selection by San Antonio last season.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, 23, averaged 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 2.9
blocked shots as a senior with the Tigers, earning Big West
Conference player of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi becomes the first player drafted from Pacific since
John Gianelli, who played on the Knicks' 1973 championship team,
was taken by the Houston Rockets in the second round of the 1972
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, meanwhile, got a rousing ovation from the Vancouver fans
as he stepped to the podium. Asked how he felt to be drafted by a
team he never worked out for, he smiled and said, ``It makes me
feel wanted, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Through trades, Orlando and Houston controlled the middle of the
draft. The Magic and Rockets had three picks apiece between Nos. 12
and 18. Orlando used its first two picks on big men: Utah's 6-11
Michael Doleac and Nevada Las-Vegas' Keon Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets took small forward Michael Dickerson of Arizona at
No. 14 before Orlando made its third selection, forward Matt
Harpring of Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also took shooting guard Bryce Drew of Valparaiso
with the 16th pick.
</P>
<P>
   With the 24th pick, the San Antonio Spurs selected Felipe Lopez,
the St. John's guard. Lopez was a highly-touted player coming out
of high school, but had a disappointing four years with the Red
Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks do not have a first-round pick, and the New Jersey
Nets have no pick in either the first or second round. With the
38th and 44th picks in the second round, the Knicks were hoping to
move up and acquire a young frontline player or a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 24 picks, no high school player was chosen. Al
Harrington, the 6-9 center from St. Patrick's High School in
Elizabeth, N.J., was chosen at No. 25 by the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Parade Magazine's national player of the year, Rashard Lewis of
Alief Elsik High School in Alief, Texas, was taken by the Seattle
SuperSonics with the third pick in the second round.

BACKS BILL OFFERING TAX BREAKS FOR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 8th graf for clarifying who is eligible for program)  (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday voted to send President
Clinton a bill that would provide tax breaks for parents who save
for education costs, including private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would veto the legislation. In a
recent letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Clinton called the
bill ``bad education policy and bad tax policy'' that embraces the
wealthy, shrugs off the poor and siphons federal tax dollars from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   With the votes in the House and Senate falling slightly short of
the numbers needed to override a veto, Republicans and Democrats
will take competing education agendas to the public for the
November elections _ one that calls for funneling money into public
schools and another that advocates redirecting that money to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, a compromise between the House and the Senate,
passed the Senate 59-36.
</P>
<P>
   While the bill is the centerpiece of a Republican education
agenda and is designed to make in-roads on an issue that Democrats
have successfully used to their advantage, it drew some Democratic
support. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., co-sponsored the bill with
its chief architect, Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a simple idea,'' said Torricelli. ``How basic. American
families can save their own money, in their own savings accounts,
without taxation, to educate their own children in the school of
their own choice. What possible argument could anyone have with
that proposal? And yet people have found reason to object.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would expands a program that promotes
saving for college, would allow family members and other sponsors
to contribute up to $2,000 a year to special savings accounts for
individual elementary and secondary school students. The money
would have to be used for education expenses, like tutoring,
computers and private and religious school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Interest on the money and withdrawals from the account would be
tax free and could be rolled over for college expenses. The
program, which would cost the federal government $1.6 billion over
10 years, would be available to couples with incomes up to $150,000
and individuals up to $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate the two parties have used statistics to
their own advantage. While Coverdell maintains that the bill would
benefit 20 million children and lead to savings of $12 billion over
10 years, Democrats say that the average yearly benefit for a
student would be minuscule, between $7 and $37.
</P>
<P>
   To try to draw Democratic support and thwart a veto, House and
Senate negotiators removed several contentious provisions from the
bill and added a few sweeteners, including $210 million for reading
programs. The move appealed to some Democrats but not enough to
override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   With dogged persistence, Republicans have seized on Coverdell's
proposal, the only major education legislation in Congress this
year, to castigate Clinton for his stance on education, which they
view as unimaginative, short-sighted and beholden to the teachers'
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long favored a policy of ``school choice,''
which has grown in grass-roots popularity. It would permit tax
dollars to be used for private schools as a way of making public
schools more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept is reviled by Democrats who frame it as a
Republican attempt to abandon public schools in favor of religious
and other private schools, and they point to Coverdell's bill as
the first step leading down that path. Most Democrats advocate
earmarking funds to repairing schools, building new ones and hiring
more teachers, and tried several times to derail Coverdell's bill.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
criticized Republicans for pushing the bill at the same time that
House Republicans had voted in a subcommittee to slash funds for
summer jobs programs and educational technology, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut back $1.8 billion yesterday, and they are over here
now in the United States Senate saying we are doing the most
revolutionary thing for public school students,'' Kennedy said.
``This is an absolute sham.''
