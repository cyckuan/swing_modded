A GIFT EVENING UNRAVELS, AS FRANCO PULLS THE STRING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is like this for the New York Mets. They will
tease you with dramatic finishes against all odds and make you feel
as if nothing is out of their reach, not the National League wild
card, not even the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And then the dispirited Florida Marlins roll into town. For some
reason, the meek make the Mets lose the kind of focus and edge that
allow them to beat the elite teams in the league. It happened to
them against Friday night at Shea Stadium, when the Mets lost a
golden opportunity to pull even with the Chicago Cubs in the
wild-card race by losing to the Marlins, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse seemed unlikely. The Mets had a 6-4 lead heading into
the ninth inning when their closer, John Franco, fell apart, giving
up a two-run single with the bases loaded. That was followed by a
sacrifice fly by Edgar Renteria that gave the Marlins a lead that
the Mets could not overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who made late-inning heroics a habit in Houston, had
nothing left to pull out of its bag. The 34,862 fans at Shea
grasped the importance of the game, and they were merciless in
their booing of Franco as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets understood the gravity of Friday night's game, too.
They spent Friday afternoon with one eye on the row of television
sets that hang from the clubhouse ceiling. Instead of the normal
echo from dueling talk shows, all channels were tuned to the Cubs'
game against the Reds at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every play elicited a reaction from a passing Met,
including a moan by Franco on an error by Reds second baseman Bret
Boone in the early innings. By the time the Mets had finished their
pre-game warmup, their groans had been replaced by grins because
they knew exactly where they stood in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had lost. All the Mets had to do was finish off the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed like a simple feat, considering the Marlins had won
just 50 games and lost 103 before Friday night. But their record
against the Mets was much better _ 4-5 coming in _ and this night
would not end without angst for New York. Rick Reed, an All-Star
pitcher who baffled hitters in the first half of the season,
continued to display an unnerving knack for serving up a home run
ball as a chaser to otherwise fine pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had given up six home runs in his two previous starts, a
pattern that continued when Kevin Orie blasted a 1-0 pitch in the
second inning, and Cliff Floyd followed by hitting a homer off a
2-2 pitch in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   As they grabbed hold of Reed's mistakes, the depleted Marlins
were making the game uncomfortable for the Mets. Although the Mets
were making headway against the Marlins' starter, Livan Hernandez,
using a wild pitch to score a run in the first and getting a home
run by John Olerud in the third, the score was tied, 3-3, in the
bottom of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Mike Piazza slipped into his cape once again,
delivering a two-run double down the third-base line with two outs
to provide a 5-3 lead. Trouble still lurked, though.
</P>
<P>
   Reed left a mess when he departed in the seventh inning with
Marlins on first and third and no outs. Reliever Dennis Cook came
jogging out of the bullpen and ran right over the Marlins, striking
out the side.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Cook had the crowd on its feet. Shea, though far
from packed, was lively and loud. The Mets, often uninspired when
facing sinking teams, were hoping to look into the seats for the
kind of edge that has sustained the Sammy Sosa-powered Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sammy has provided the Cubs with something we've been
without,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said before the game.
``When we got Mike Piazza here, I thought we'd have more of a 10th
man. And we did that first homestand. But that turned around on us
over the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Insults were hurled at Piazza as he struggled to find his groove
with the Mets after he arrived from the Dodgers. But slowly, with
every game-winning hit, Piazza has discovered the kinder side to
the New York fan. Even so, the empty seats at Shea have revealed
the difference in the kind of support the Cubs have thrived on as
Sosa matches Mark McGwire home run for home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sammy, you see the support building,'' Valentine said.
``Fans are cheering, even in the opposing ballparks. And that's a
bonus when you're looking for any edge you can get. We haven't had
that at home. We haven't had that home-field advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   That only partly explains why the Mets , who have been
adrenaline junkies getting their fix by facing daunting challenges
and impossible circumstances, have been surge-less when facing meek
teams like the Florida Marlins
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell's man of steel performance out of the bullpen of
late, which included consecutive saves on back-to-back days this
week, has surprised everyone but him. In the first game against
Houston, he pitched two shutout innings. In the second, he went one
and two-thirds, and then threw two shutout innings in the third
game for a save. He still had enough left to throw one shutout
inning in the fourth game for another save. The more innings he
pitches, the better Wendell believes his stuff gets. ``If you feel
too strong, you might tend to overthrow,'' Wendell said. ``You try
to do too much. Sometimes if you're a little under the weather, or
fatigued, you're better off.'' ... In order to accommodate Fox
Sports' national broadcast of the Mets game against the Braves on
Sept. 26, the game time has been switched from 7:10 p.m. to 1:15
p.m.

STUCK ON THEMSELVES: FAST-MOVING CRAZE COMES FROM JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA HELSER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nikki Martin and Sheree Bennett are stuck on their own sweet
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Or more precisely, their faces are now stuck on them.
</P>
<P>
   Through the magic of a photo-sticker machine they discovered in
a Tempe mall on a recent Saturday afternoon, they can emblazon
their faces on stickers while joining a fast-moving craze imported
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done this before,'' said Sheree, standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with her friend as they fed three $1 bills
into the glorified voting booth, one of six or seven such machines
in metropolitan Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Following instructions from the singsong voice coming from
within, they selected an appropriate frame for their faces and then
struck a pose.
</P>
<P>
   Voila!
</P>
<P>
   Within 60 seconds they were oohing and ahhing over the results _
a sheet of 16 tiny, (one-half by three-quarters of an inch)
individual photos of themselves, complete with superimposed kitty
ears, noses and whiskers, suitable for power sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sheree could utter the words, ``Way cool!'' she had
planted one of the stickers squarely on her cheekbone as Nikki
positioned another one on her lime-green pager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give them to our friends, too,'' said Nikki, an
eighth-grader from Chandler, ``and I'll put them on my notebook.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a socially acceptable spinoff of graffiti or just
another way to be noticed in an otherwise anonymous world,
``putting your face all over the place'' with the help of a sticker
machine has become one of the Valley's hottest new trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very, very popular,'' said Cookie Lee, manager of
Sanrio, a children's shop at Arizona Mills in Tempe, full of
merchandise featuring cartoon characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mall is busy, there's a waiting line at the machine
and what amazes me is, after they do one, they get in line to do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanrio's machine, in place since the franchised shop opened at
the end of May, features frames of Sanrio's cartoon characters such
as Pretty Kitty.
</P>
<P>
   But other Sticker Stations, such as the one located near the
IMAX Theatre at the Grand Canyon provide a variety of superimposed
artwork that serves as accompanying adornment for those posing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real hot one now is the one with Al Gore and Bill Clinton,''
said Darrel Jackson, who maintains the premises. ``It looks like
you're standing between them.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's first photo-sticker machine clicked its first
pictures in Japan three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to lure customers into stores, it was particularly
well-received by girls 10 to 14 years old. But it proved to be
attractive to a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my sister was teaching school over in Japan, she'd always
send her letters with these stickers on them,'' said 27-year-old
Elise French of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   French finally was in a position to retaliate recently when she
and her husband, Troy, stumbled upon the Sanrio store sticker
machine.
</P>
<P>
   French is destined to see many more if APBI and another
distributor, Atlus Dream Entertainment Company, have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of 1999, APBI will have over 2,000 across the
nation,'' said Liz Wellford, public relations spokeswoman for APBI.
She said there are about 1,600 in the country now.
</P>
<P>
   As for Arizona, Wellford said there are plans for at least four
more of the company's Sticker Stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the month or early next there'll be one at The
Limited Too in Scottsdale Fashion Square, one at the Arizona
Factory Shops and another in one of the Old Navy Stores,'' she
said. ``We just don't know which one yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more individuals are buying the machines and their
stickers. Attilio Leonardi, who purchased his 300-pound machine for
$8,000 and normally keeps it busy in Tucson's Foothills Mall, rents
it out for family reunions, bar mitzvahs and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real popular at special functions,'' he said. ``I charge
$200 to get it there and then $2 for the 16 photos.''
</P>
<P>
   A line of accessories, specifically made to show off the sticky
photos, also is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pendants, key chains, bracelets,'' said Leonardi,
``and these things like rolls of film that you stick them on.'' &QL;

SOSA AND THE CUBS LACK PUNCH IN A LOSS TO THE REDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to remove the word ``sixth'' from the final graf.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs left Wrigley
Field last weekend for the West Coast, Sosa had just tied Mark
McGwire in their home-run race by belting four in the three-game
series against Milwaukee, and the Cubs had staged two dramatic
come-from-behind victories.
</P>
<P>
   In their return home on Friday, Sosa and the Cubs lacked last
weekend's flair. Sosa went 0-for-4 in a 6-4 loss to the Cincinnati
Reds, and the Cubs managed just six hits, without a home run, let
alone any late-inning heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's performance, in front of more than 40 family members whom
the Cubs had flown in from the Dominican Republic as a surprise,
left him one behind Mark McGwire, who has 64 after homering in the
fourth inning Friday night against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa never hit the ball out of the infield even as 40,105 fans,
on their feet, chanted ``Sammy, Sammy'' and ``MVP'' during each of
his at-bats. He did reach base and scored a run in the first inning
after hitting a checked-swing grounder that second baseman Bret
Boone booted. Sosa then grounded out to third in the second inning,
struck out in the fifth inning after battling to a full count, and
popped out to Boone in the seventh. He was left in the on-deck
circle when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reds shortstop Barry Larkin and left fielder Dmitri Young
who stole the show. Young was 4-for-4 with two RBIs, and his diving
catch on Micky Morandini's sinking line drive in the sixth inning
kept the Cubs from tying the score. It also ended the inning and
prevented Sosa from coming to the plate with two runners on. Young
then led off the seventh with a single and scored a run, putting
the Cubs away for good. Larkin was 4-for-5 with a double and a home
run, and he scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the Cubs' lead over the Mets in the wild-card
race to just a half-game, with the Mets playing Friday night. The
two teams, whose play and dramatic games have mirrored each other
the last couple of weeks, have not been separated by more than one
game in the standings since Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Though fruitless on Friday, hundreds of ticketless fans again
flocked to Waveland Avenue, just past Wrigley's left-field wall, in
anticipation of a potentially lucrative home-run ball. Following
Sosa's two-homer game last Sunday, during which a fan claimed he
had possession of home-run ball No. 62 but lost it after being
bitten and mauled during the scramble for it, the Chicago police
have added officers and erected barricades for this series,
corralling the fans onto one sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's game, a collector who paid a fan $10,000 for
home-run ball No. 61 returned the ball to Sosa in exchange for some
of Sosa's autographed equipment. Sosa said after the game he
intended to donate the ball to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   And despite recent criticism that major-league baseball was not
giving Sosa the same attention that McGwire receives, Sosa said he
felt plenty of support from fans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are what motivate me every day,'' he said after the
game. ``The support here in Chicago and all over the country has
been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   He then gave a parting word of encouragement to McGwire, his
friend and fellow slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hit one every day,'' Sosa said before heading home to
celebrate his son's birthday. ``I'm just going to go home and relax
with my family and watch Mark. I hope he hits one tonight.''

JUDGE SETS TENTATIVE TRIAL DATE FOR FIVE POLICEMEN IN LOUIMA
BRUTALITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge on Friday tentatively set a trial
date of March 22 for four New York City police officers charged
with brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, in Brooklyn
last year and for a sergeant accused of trying to cover up part of
the assault.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Eugene Nickerson of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
also indicated that there was a good chance the trial would not
start by then. Instead, he characterized the date as ``something to
work for.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has already been delayed for months, first by a switch
from state to federal prosecution and more recently by a dispute
over legal representation for two of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Louima was beaten by the four officers in a
police car after he was arrested in a street brawl on Aug. 9, 1997,
and that two officers later tortured him in a bathroom of the 70th
Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers and the sergeant insist the charges against
them are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the police officers said outside Nickerson's
courtroom Friday that among the major pretrial issues they will ask
the judge to decide will be whether there should be one trial for
all the defendants or whether any of the officers should be tried
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Each lawyer said he would seek a severance for his client from
one or more of the other defendants because of conflicting defense
moves.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also said they might be restricted in their defense
strategy if the officers were tried together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have antagonistic defenses,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, the
lawyer for Justin Volpe, who is accused of torturing Louima in the
station house bathroom by ramming a stick into his rectum and then
his mouth, causing severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A second officer, Charles Schwarz, is accused of helping Volpe
by holding Louima down.
</P>
<P>
   Those officers and Officers Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese are
accused of beating Louima in the patrol car on the way to the
station house. All four are charged with violating Louima's civil
rights. The sergeant, Michael Bellomo, is accused of trying to
cover up the police car beating.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kornberg told Nickerson that he would submit a motion that his
client's trial should be moved elsewhere, saying the intensive
pretrial publicity would prevent Volpe from obtaining a fair trial
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Bruder and Wiese, Stuart London and Joseph
Tacopina, respectively, also said they would ask for a change of
venue.
</P>
<P>
   Later, another judge in the same court, Sterling Johnson, ruled
that a civil suit that Louima has filed against the city, the
indicted officers and other parties would be held in abeyance until
the criminal prosecution was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The same ruling applies to a similar suit filed by another
Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine, who prosecutors say was beaten
by Volpe after the brawl.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: CATTLE DRIVE AT SUNRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The days shorten, the morning chill intensifies, and all across
the Rockies cattle have been driven down from the high country.
Recently a party of ranchers on horseback gathered before dawn at
the mouth of a canyon along Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone River
to drive 193 yearling steers and one Corriente bull down the
highway to a set of corrals _ a trip of 13 miles _ where they would
be weighed, given a clean bill of health and trucked to feedlots in
Kansas. The night before, some of the cattle had moved down the
highway on their own, only to follow the wind back up into the
canyon in early morning. The herd was footsore.
</P>
<P>
   At sunrise the steers were on the move, though two men had gone
to re-ride the canyon in search of four missing cattle. The highway
dropped eastward out of the mountains, where the wind was hard, and
into a still basin that quickly filled with morning sun. From time
to time, a rider would turn to hasten a laggard steer and catch a
glimpse of dawn reflected against the mountain walls. Several men
rode ahead of the herd, and as they came upon interruptions in the
highway fence they would position their horses abreast of them to
keep the steers from breaking through into the open country beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the sage and chamisa gave way to grass, the cattle
would bunch up eating, and wherever their path crossed irrigation
ditches, they would wallow and bawl, and then the blacktop would be
traced with long sinuous lines of drool, like a sketch by Jackson
Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the yearlings were quiet, almost stoic. From a
distance, their feet moving through stiff grass sounded like spring
rain. In their silence they were completely unlike a herd of
cow-calf pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, one of the horsemen had moved a herd of mother
cows and their calves from one pasture into the next, a trip of
perhaps 500 yards. The word ``moo'' does not do justice to the
vocalizations that filled the evening air. As the cries rose and
fell and rose again, they began to sound, in the imagination of one
listener, like the tintinnabulation of bells on a feast day in some
medieval city. Then the last calf was driven through the gate, its
mother found, and the night was no louder than the wind across the
hilltops.

FEW COUNTING ON BEAN TO DETHRONE HOLYFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (js) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The opponent weighed in at a less-than-svelte 231 on
Thursday, 19 more pounds than he weighed for his last unsuccessful
title shot. If Vaughn Bean were a puncher, this would be good. But
his best attribute is said to be his lateral movement.
</P>
<P>
   As Evander Holyfield prepares to get back in the ring for the
first time in 10 months, and it is hard to know whom to feel more
sorry for: Bean, the No. 1 contender whom most fans do not expect
to leave the ring standing, or the legions of fight fans yawning
for the heavyweight division to percolate again.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, home is apparently no place to lose your World
Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation titles. A
Georgia Dome crowd that promoters are hoping will swell above
30,000 will back Holyfield, who will be host to a homecoming party
afterward. Between 50 million and 60 million homes will have access
to the fight on Showtime's free-preview weekend
</P>
<P>
   Still, with more pertinent boxing matters going on in Las Vegas
this weekend _ Oscar de la Hoya trying to send Julio Cesar Chavez
into retirement and Mike Tyson attempting to get his boxing license
renewed _ Holyfield-Bean is not exactly boffo box office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier this week when he would try to unify the title
with the World Boxing Federation champion Lennox Lewis, Holyfield
curtly replied, ``Some time next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Bean will have to do. He has the right to be here
because he is the mandatory IBF challenger, meaning Holyfield
(35-3, 25 knockouts) would be stripped of his belt if he did not
fight Bean (31-1, 25 knockouts).
</P>
<P>
   But other than Michael Moorer, who defeated Bean by majority
decision in March 1997, they have no common opponents. Most of
Bean's record was built from a litany of journeyman fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Louisiana and grew up in Chicago. Testament to
how unknown he is, two of Bean's four trainers _ Joe Frazier and
Michael Spinks _ have signed more autographs than he has this week.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 11 inches, he is 3 inches shorter than Holyfield. Bean
moves and jabs well, but may have trouble catching up to the
sculpted Holyfield, who weighed in at a lithe 217 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he came in so heavy, Bean replied, ``I'm still
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight is Holyfield's first in his hometown since he knocked
out Bert Cooper in 1991. He has not fought since last November, an
eighth-round technical knockout of Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he was prepared to defend both titles, on June 6
at Madison Square Garden, doctors determined that the No. 1 WBA
contender, Henry Akinwande, had Hepatitis B. The fight was
postponed It may come off in the fall.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors are still reeling from the news that
trading losses, mostly in emerging markets, will erase a lot of
earnings from the books of leading financial services companies in
the United States this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch said it lost $135 million trading bonds in July
and August, cutting earnings to one-fourth their level during those
months in 1997. Citicorp's losses will slice $200 million from
third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks have been trounced on the news. Bankers Trust
has fallen to $63.75 from an April high of $136.4375. Lehman
Brothers is down 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Time to bargain-hunt? Or is there another wave of losses out
there?
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is, surf's up. Falling interest rates mean fresh
problems at banks and brokerage firms in their mortgage lending
businesses or trading of mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   As rates fall, homeowners refinance mortgages. What's good for
consumers _ their borrowing costs shrink _ is bad for the
institutions that made the higher-rate loans or serviced them.
That's because the income and servicing fees on these loans vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Even though mortgage rates have yet to decline sharply, the
number of consumers refinancing their mortgages is way up. The
Mortgage Bankers Association refinancing index is at double the
level seen in May. And the index will skyrocket in coming weeks
when mortgage rates really plummet.
</P>
<P>
   How gnarly will the refinancing wave be? Nobody knows.
``Mortgage rates have declined to levels not seen in the history of
the modern mortgage market,'' said Bob Kulason, director of the
mortgage strategy group at Salomon Smith Barney. Thus, predicting
future prepayments is much tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Prepayments are important because finance companies make
assumptions about the profitability of a loan based on how long it
is likely to stay on the books. If loans get paid down faster than
anticipated, the assumptions are wrong and earnings need to be
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders in Green Tree Financial learned this the hard way
last fall. The company, which makes loans to buyers of manufactured
housing, found prepayments on its loans coming in faster than
expected. It took a $150 million pretax charge to earnings, and the
stock fell 20 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street firms that trade mortgage-backed securities are also
vulnerable to lower rates; those with big mortgage holdings are
already behind the eight ball this year. The return on the Lehman
Brothers government bond index is 7.89 percent while that of a
mortgage-backed securities index is only 5.21 percent. Mortgages
typically beat Treasuries' returns by 1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, many trading houses and hedge funds bought
mortgages and hedged the positions by selling Treasuries. As
Treasuries rose and mortgages lagged, these investors took a double
hit.
</P>
<P>
   And those traders holding interest-only strips, a derivative
security that pays out only the interest generated by a pool of
mortgages and is not backed by the loan's principal, will find
themselves with nothing when homeowners pay off their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a trader want such a security? If rates stayed where
they were or rose, the strips would continue to produce income. And
since few Wall Street traders believed rates could drop to their
current levels _ 5.15 percent on the 30-year bond _ interest-only
strips were the thing to own.
</P>
<P>
   When will mortgage problems surface? Not until October or
November at the earliest, says Charles Peabody, bank analyst at
Mitchell Securities in New York. ``The first losses are likely to
be housed in hedging strategies,'' Peabody said. ``Arbitrage losses
first, absolute dollar losses later.''

HOPES FOR RATE CUTS ARE RAISED, THEN DASHED  
 SO LONG, EBULLIENCE, HELLO, CUTBACKS  
 TURNING TIDES SINK A BIG TECHNOLOGY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The week began with President Clinton hoping to strike up the
Group of Seven band of major economic powers in a rousing chorus of
coordinated interest rate cuts, to relieve the pressure on
embattled Latin American countries like Brazil that are struggling
to contain currency and debt crises. World financial markets took
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But by midweek all was disharmony, thanks to political paralysis
in Japan, election distractions in Germany and muddy political and
economic waters in the United States. The chief soloist, Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made it clear that no
sweet music would be forthcoming _ and the markets, disappointed,
sank once more.
</P>
<P>
   The week closed to the clangor of printing presses, as Russia's
central bank, against all advice, tried papering over economic
chasms with freshly minted rubles.
</P>

</P>
<P>

   Telltale droplets of blood began appearing on the forehead of
corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Venator, nee Woolworth, which only recently finished scrapping
its 5-and-dimes to concentrate on specialty retailing, said it
would shutter 570 Kinney and Footquarters shoe stores and take a
$173 million charge. Toys ``R'' Us said it would close 90 stores,
shed up to 3,000 jobs, take a $495 million charge and revamp its
remaining outlets to combat stiffening competition from discount
stores. CBS and NBC each announced layoffs in the hundreds, while
ABC said it would make nonpersonnel cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reader's Digest said it would slash its dividend, sell much of
its art collection and let some workers go because of sagging
performance. Citicorp and Travelers Group confirmed that their
pending merger would spell the end of several thousand jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Tides Sink a Big Technology Deal
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs called off its planned $7.1 billion acquisition of
Ciena, the top maker of equipment for building the capacity of
phone networks, because shareholder approval was unlikely, thanks
mainly to a near free fall in Ciena's business outlook after the
deal was announced on June 3. Since then, Ciena has warned that its
third-quarter profit would be less than half of what analysts
expected, said it had failed to land two important contracts, and
seen its stock tumble 81 percent _ abetted by the general
late-summer slide in the markets, of course _ while Tellabs fell 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other deals came undone, too: Coca-Cola's plan to buy the
Orangina soft drink business from Pernod-Ricard for $840 million
was blocked by French regulators, who agreed with Pepsico's
complaint that it would stifle competition. And privately held
Quark abandoned its icily greeted offer to acquire Adobe Systems,
Quark's main rival in desktop-publishing software.
</P>
<P>
   But Allied Signal's hostile bid for AMP, the leading maker of
electronic connectors, gained momentum when shareholders
controlling 72 percent of AMP voted to go along. That allowed
Allied to trim back its tender offer to apply to only 18 percent of
AMP shares, fewer than needed to trip an AMP anti-takeover
provision. AMP's board responded by lowering the threshold.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Consumer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, the same

nation's imports fell in July. But exports fell faster, reflecting
soft demand in troubled Asian countries. So the trade deficit
widened to $13.92 billion. ... Sluggish sales in Asia hammered
Nike, whose profits fell 35 percent in the latest quarter. ...
Three former executives of Archer Daniels Midland, including the

DODGERS HIRE GEIVETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kevin Malone completed his first week as Dodgers
general manager Friday by making his first hire. Tampa Bay Devil
Rays assistant GM Bill Geivett, who has known Malone since both
joined the Angels in 1985, assumes a similar position with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Geivett, 35, worked the past two seasons under Devil Rays GM
Chuck LaMar, developing the expansion team's international scouting
programs that included Latin America, the Far East and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been part of every facet of a baseball operation and
has special skills, talents and abilities that will help the
Dodgers in the years to come,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Under former general manager Fred Claire, the assistant GM
duties included clerical work and some contract negotiations. Those
responsibilities will remain with Robert Schweppe, son of former
farm director Bill Schweppe, and general counsel Sam Fernandez, who
was chief negotiator in contract talks last spring with catcher
Mike Piazza. Geivett will play a scouting role with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Schweppe and Sam Fernandez are highly valued
specialists and they will remain specialists,'' Malone said. ``Bill
will work more in player evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Devil Rays, Geivett worked under Malone in
Montreal as director of player development. Geivett, one of the few
people in baseball of Philippine descent, also has college
assistant coaching jobs at Loyola Marymount and Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some challenges, but there's also a lot of tradition
and history with very high standards,'' Geivett said. ``To be
chosen as the one of the caretakers of that, that's something I'd
like to be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Mum on manager: Although Malone has been candid about people
he'd like to hire (Geivett, former Baltimore boss Pat Gillick), he
refused to speculate about the manager's position. He is expected
to offer Glenn Hoffman a prominent role in the farm system but for
now says Hoffman is his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fair to speculate,'' Malone said. ``As far as I'm
concerned, Glenn Hoffman is the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
My focus right now is stabilizing the organization and finding
people who can take us forward. There are other areas I need to
address before the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds honored: Before the game, Giants left fielder Barry Bonds
was honored for becoming the first player to reach 400 homers and
400 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds has reached 30 homers and 30 steals five times. With a
week to go, he might come up short, but it won't be from lack of
effort. He has 34 homers and stole his 25th base in the fourth
inning Friday. Last week, he raised eyebrows by attempting to steal
with the Giants trailing 14-0.

COLLINS NOT WORRIED ABOUT FINLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Angels manager Terry Collins insists he isn't
concerned about Chuck Finley, even though the ace of the Anaheim
staff has made it into the seventh inning only twice in his past
five starts and won only three of his past 15 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Finley pitched eight shutout innings against Kansas City on
Sept. 6 but allowed five runs in 41/3 innings against Cleveland
(Sept. 1), eight runs in 51/3 against Baltimore (Sept. 11) and five
runs in 62/3 vs. Texas on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't pitched good, that's not a secret,'' said Collins.
``But in my mind there's no doubt he'll go out the next time and
keep us in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big-game guy. There's no doubt he's the guy I want out
there and so does the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins did say he might move Steve Sparks up a day (to Monday)
and push Finley back to Tuesday since Sparks lasted only 12/3
innings against Texas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not ready: Barring a special situation, Darin Erstad (strained
left hamstring) won't play again until Monday, when the Rangers and
Angels begin a three-game series at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't run him in there where he has to beat something out,''
Collins explained. ``It depends on the situation, maybe two outs
and we need a hit or with a runner at third and we need a fly
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said after watching his first baseman try to run on
Thursday night, he had little choice but to pull him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him run and said, `This is not going to go,''' he said.
``If he had stayed in and tried to play base-to-base, there is a
good chance he would have blown it out. You know how he is, he
would have got caught up in the emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins did have some good news to report on Erstad. Trainer Ned
Bergert told him that Erstad said his leg felt better Friday than
it did on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No vindication: Cecil Fielder made it clear he was unhappy when
the Angels released him on Aug. 5, hinting that Anaheim's move was
prompted by the team's unwillingness to pay some performance
bonuses. But Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said he doesn't
feel vindicated by Cleveland's decision to release the power hitter
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't matter to me,'' he said. ``We make our moves
for our own reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, however, made it clear he didn't appreciate some of
Fielder's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't begrudge Cecil for being upset, but to say that it had
anything to do with with anything other than our roster or ability
is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mad over what he said, but he was wrong, just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielder was hitting .143 with no home runs and no RBI for the
Indians. He struck out 13 times in 35 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher corps: With catcher Phil Nevin on crutches the day after
spraining his left ankle in Texas, the Angels acquired catcher Chad
Kreuter from the Chicago White Sox for cash considerations. Kreuter
will be available for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter, 34, hit .253 with two home runs and 33 RBI in 93 games
for Chicago this year. To make room for Kreuter on the 40-man
roster, Charlie O'Brien (broken finger) was placed on the 60-day
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   This Kreuter's second stint with the Angels. He hit .234 in 70
games last season before signing a free-agent contract with the
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin, who said he needs ``a few days to let the swelling go
down,'' was obviously upset about being injured at this point of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kills me, it's not supposed to happen,'' he said.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: D'AMATO PAINTS A `LIBERAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with ny-senaterace) 
(bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a new 30-second commercial that the re-election campaign
of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., began broadcasting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Jamestown Associates Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The advertisement opens with an ominous view of
the Brooklyn Bridge and the skyline of lower Manhattan in
foreboding dark blue tones. ``Chuck Schumer'' appears in black
letters at the top right of the screen. The word ``liberal''
scrolls across the bottom in huge capital letters as a stern
picture of Rep. Charles Schumer appears at left. As the voice-over
begins, ``Three Largest Tax Increases'' appears in jagged white
type, and a stack of dollar bills grows on screen. An image of a
hammer lying unused appears as the narrator criticizes Schumer on
the issue of welfare, followed by the image of a jail cell door
swinging open as Schumer is criticized on crime. Finally, the word
``wrong'' flashes repeatedly in bright red letters, as the narrator
again declares Schumer wrong on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``Chuck Schumer's a New York City liberal, and he
proves it every day. Chuck Schumer voted for the three largest tax
increases in American history. Chuck Schumer voted for more welfare
and against workfare. And Chuck Schumer voted for less jail time
for violent criminals. Liberal Chuck Schumer. Wrong on taxes. Wrong
on welfare. Wrong on crime. Wrong for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Measuring the largest tax increase in history is a
game that campaign strategists love to play. Depending on who is
counting, either President Clinton's 1993 budget or a 1982 bill
signed by President Reagan could be described as the largest tax
increase ever. Schumer did support both of these bills, but the
advertisement fails to mention that Sen. Alfonse D'Amato also voted
for the 1982 bill.
</P>
<P>
   The ad accurately notes Schumer's vote against President
Reagan's 1984 anticrime bill, which contained tougher drug and bail
laws. D'Amato supported the bill and it became law. A decade later,
Schumer sponsored the tough 1994 crime bill, which extended prison
spending and the federal death penalty and it also became law.
D'Amato voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The ad seeks to drive home what has quickly become
the D'Amato campaign's central message: that Schumer is a
``liberal'' who is ``wrong for us.'' But it does little more than
demonstrate how hard it will be for D'Amato and Schumer, both
18-year veterans of Congress, to contrast their voting records in
ways that are clear to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Schumer about crime is likely to fall flat in
light of the 1994 crime bill, his recent support of the death
penalty and his well-known work on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Branding Schumer ``a New York City liberal'' plays to the
historic resentment of the city among voters upstate, but risks
alienating voters in New York City, the majority of whom are
registered Democrats.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: SCHUMER SEES `TOO MANY LIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with NY-SENATERACE)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are two 15-second commercials that the campaign of Charles
Schumer, the Democratic nominee for U.S. senator in New York, began
broadcasting Thursday night and Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Morris, Carrick &AMP; Guma
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The first advertisement opens with ``D'Amato's
lying about Chuck Schumer on taxes'' in white type on a black
screen with ``lying'' underlined in red, then flashes to a white
screen with ``The Truth'' in large black letters. It cuts to a
scene of Schumer speaking with constituents. ``Schumer voted to cut
taxes,'' appears on the screen. Then, a cut-out picture of D'Amato
appears next to a red arrow pointing up to indicate increased
taxes. Finally the words ``D'Amato: too many lies for too long''
appear next to his picture.
</P>
<P>
   The second ad opens the same way and cuts to a similar scene of
Schumer with constituents. ``Chuck Schumer: tough on crime''
appears on-screen as the narrator speaks about the 1994 crime bill.
It then shows two police officers and ``Chuck Schumer: put new
police on the street'' and ``Chuck Schumer: banned assault
weapons'' appear on-screen. The ad ends with the same picture of
D'Amato and the words ``D'Amato voted no'' followed by ``D'Amato:
too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``D'Amato's lying about Chuck Schumer on taxes. The
truth: Schumer voted to cut taxes for 2 million New York families.
Since 1981, D'Amato voted for $300 billion in tax increases.
D'Amato's been raising taxes for three decades. D'Amato: too many
lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Amato's lying about Chuck Schumer on crime. The truth: Chuck
Schumer's the tough-on-crime Democrat who wrote the law that put
thousands of new police on the street and banned assault weapons.
D'Amato voted no. D'Amato: too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The first ad asserts that D'Amato voted for $300
billion in tax increases since 1981, based on budget bills in 1982,
1984 and 1995. In fact, he voted for only two of those bills. Both
candidates voted in favor of the 1982 bill and both supported early
versions of the 1984 bill but ultimately voted against it. In any
event, using the Schumer campaign's accounting, both men have voted
for more than $264 billion in taxes since 1981. The main purpose of
the third bill, the 1995 Republican budget package supported by
D'Amato and opposed by Schumer, was a $245 billion tax cut. So
while the bill included about $30 billion in tax increases, it
hardly indicated support of higher taxes by D'Amato. As for the
second ad, D'Amato did vote against the 1994 crime bill, saying it
contained too much ``pork.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: These ads are intended as a counterattack to the
D'Amato ad calling Schumer ``wrong'' on taxes, welfare and crime.
They seek to convey a hard-and-fast message: the D'Amato ads are
untrue and the senator is untrustworthy. Accusing D'Amato of
``lying'' and of ``too many lies for too long'' may strike voters
as too vicious so early in the campaign.

CHAVEZ HITS, THEN QUITS AGAINST DE LA HOYA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As unbelievable as it sounds, Julio Cesar Chavez had
Oscar De La Hoya right where he wanted him Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In an unforgettable eighth round, the two traded punches with no
regard for defense _ drawing a screaming, pro-Chavez crowd of
17,715 at Thomas &AMP; Mack Center to its feet _ and it was the aging
former champion who seemed to be in better condition when it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if a remarkable eight rounds meant absolutely
nothing, Chavez quit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sport's great champions, his head bowed, blood
dripping from a cut inside his mouth and his opponent in apparent
trouble, in effect borrowed an infamous phrase from Roberto Duran
as he sat on his stool: No mas .
</P>
<P>
   It was an inglorious finish to an otherwise glorious effort.
</P>
<P>
   As for De La Hoya, he got the job done: He retained his WBC
welterweight title and remained undefeated (29-0, with 24
knockouts). However, he didn't dominate his 36-year-old opponent
(101-3-2, 84 KOs) as he had hoped and many expected. He fought
Chavez's fight much of the time, engaging in many toe-to-toe
exchanges in an apparent effort to get that knockout he so wanted
and didn't fare nearly as well as expected.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was ahead on all three cards, but it wasn't
one-sided: 79-63, 78-75, 78-75.
</P>
<P>
   And he never came close to that knockout, the knockout that
would force Chavez to give him the credit he refused to give him
after their first bout was stopped with Chavez cut in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, De La Hoya landed plenty of power punches and Chavez felt
them. However, he was never hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Chavez yelled, ``You did it, you did it'' and later
added, ``He's a great fighter,'' but it had to be half-hearted: Had
he not given up, it seemed, it could've been Chavez who did it.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's inexplicable explanation? ``We had a bad game
plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya controlled the fight when he stayed on the outside.
However, he refused to stay there: And, while De La Hoya also never
was hurt, he almost paid a very expensive price.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of so many, Chavez, who suffered inconsequential
cuts over both eyes, looked much like the Chavez of old and proved
that he has plenty left. De La Hoya's co-trainer, Gil Clancy, said,
``We beat the Chavez of old. Chavez was the best we've seen in five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges were both as thrilling and shocking as any seen in
this town in some time. And it all culminated in that unforgettable
eighth, when De La Hoya in effect said, ``What the heck? It's me or
him,'' and the two wailed away. A buzzing crowd couldn't wait for
the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was no next round. When the fight was stopped, De La
Hoya leaped in the air to indicate his joy, but he also had to be
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   At the post-fight press conference, Chavez said, ``I want to
make one thing clear: My corner stopped the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   However, replays of Chavez sitting on his stool appeared to show
him shaking his head as he was asked whether he wanted to continue.
Either way, it was fortunate for De La Hoya that Chavez didn't get
up.
</P>
<P>
   The champion will next face Ike Quartey, the former WBA
welterweight champion who many believed would be his first
legitimate challenger. Instead, Chavez was that legitimate
challenger, at least until he decided he couldn't take it any more
and spoiled what could've been one of the sport's great
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In other fights, Yory Boy Campas (72-2, 62 KOs) retained his IBF
junior middleweight championship when his one-sided fight with
Larry Barnes (44-3, 17 KOs) was stopped after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mia St. John (8-0, 5 KOs) of Calabasas remained undefeated,
narrowly outpointing B.J. Felter (0-3) in a four-round
featherweight women's bout.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Diaz (23-2, 18 KOs) of Coachella stopped Hector Quiroz
(25-3-1, 21 KOs) at 1:05 of the 12th and final round of a junior
lightweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   And Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch (39-1-1, 29 KOs) knocked out Troy
Roberts (14-7, 13 KOs) 41 seconds into the third round of a
scheduled four-round heavyweight bout.

BURKETT COMES UP ACES FOR RANGERS IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander John Burkett presented his most
compelling argument to remain a member of the Texas Rangers'
rotation through the season's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The honorable Johnny Oates, who also serves as the Rangers'
manager, remains noncommittal toward his verdict despite powerful,
11th-hour evidence presented by Burkett during Friday night's 3-1
victory against the Oakland Athletics at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett surrendered only one run on four hits through eight
innings, and home runs from third baseman Todd Zeile and first
baseman Lee Stevens during the middle innings helped the Rangers
keep their 11/2-game lead ahead of the Anaheim Angels in the
American League West, pending the result of the Angels game later
Friday night against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone way past thinking about myself,'' said Burkett, who
will be the odd-man out should Oates decide in favor of a four-man
rotation before Wednesday. ``A lot of managers wouldn't have stayed
with me this long, and I appreciate that. I'll understand whatever
he decides.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's understanding of the situation stems from his
performance this season. Friday night's 89-pitch appearance was the
33-year-old veteran's best since his July 9 start against the
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Burkett's first since Aug. 6, and his earned-run
average slipped under the 6.00 threshold. However, his next
scheduled start would be Wednesday against the Angels at Edison
International Field of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I want to pitch again? Yes,'' said Burkett, who gained that
elusive eighth victory in his 21st decision. ``I feel like I can
rise to the occasion even though it's hard to have confidence in
someone who is 8-13 with a 6-point ERA, but I think I can do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett presented his case.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Burkett, who pitched on nine days rest after muscle
spasms in his neck prevented him making his scheduled start
Tuesday, pitched ahead in the count throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about how important it was to pitch aggressively and
get ahead,'' catcher Ivan Rodriguez said. ``He came ready to pitch
and demonstrated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: Right-handers Rick Helling (19-7) and Aaron Sele
(18-10) crossed the 200-inning barrier this season, and ``neither
one of them is feeling 100 percent right now,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager also indicated that he would prefer to stay with a
five-man rotation and not start ``four guys in a role they're not
accustomed to'' with only three days rest.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit C: Burkett owns a 3-1 record and 3.16 ERA in his four
previous starts against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit D: Burkett's Sept. 21, 1996, victory against the Angels
in Anaheim snapped the Rangers' five-game losing streak, and that
7-1 victory helped propel the organization toward its first and
only AL West title.
</P>
<P>
   Two arguments also can be made against Burkett starting
Wednesday against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander remains the rotation's most unreliable member,
as his record and ERA suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' 5-1 victory June 12 at The Ballpark in Arlington
occurred with Burkett on the mound. Burkett surrendered home runs
to center fielder Jim Edmonds, right fielder Garret Anderson and
designated hitter Tim Salmon during that eight-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Oates acknowledged this week his thoughts of going to a four-man
rotation, which would mean that Burkett will not start another game
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said he wouldn't,'' Oates said. ``I'll let you
know. I've said the rotation is going to be flexible.''

RANGERS' OATES HAS EARNED THE RIGHT FOR JOB SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ John Burkett helped general manager Doug
Melvin dodge potentially embarrassing questions about how his team
could be in the position of being caught short of pitching in
September on Friday night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the Rangers' critical 3-1 victory against
Oakland behind Burkett's surprisingly strong eight innings _ he
hadn't won since Aug. 6 _ continued the momentum built by their
two-game sweep of the archrival Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, dangerously short in the bullpen despite a 14-man
pitching staff and the ability to add even more, might have been in
trouble if Burkett had been knocked out early. But the veteran
right-hander pitched like he did during the stretch run in 1996,
when he won two key games in the final week of the season to help
the Rangers secure their first division championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's a news bulletin that will raise few eyebrows:
Throughout it all, manager Johnny Oates remained calm, cool and
collected.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he did scratch his nose at one point in the fifth inning,
causing a ripple of excitement through the Metroplex, but it was
just a small itch.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the TV cameras showed the Rangers' manager back to his
normal statue-like self, arms folded across his chest, eyelids
drooping, gaze fixed hypnotically on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had a camera inside my stomach,'' Oates said, ``they
might see something different.''
</P>
<P>
   That know-nothing talk show critics and callers occasionally
criticize Oates for his seemingly passive disposition is of no
consequence. Only if new owner Tom Hicks is listening _ and you're
free to wonder if that's the case _ is there reason to be
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, without question, hesitation or preamble, should be told
that he will be back as the Rangers' manager in 1999, something
that hasn't been done yet.
</P>
<P>
   No waiting to see whether the Rangers will win the West. No
nothing. Just do it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Oates already has another year on his contract. That's your
basic severance package and he knows it. That does not mean he'll
be back.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers president Tom Schieffer says he expects no major changes
and Melvin maintains that he's happy with the job Oates and his
staff have done.
</P>
<P>
   But the official company line is that all evaluations, as usual,
will come following the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine if Hicks is on board, something that has yet to be
determined. The Rangers' new owner wasn't at The Ballpark for
Thursday night's critical showdown against the Angels _ he was the
honoree at a charity roast at The Dallas Press Club _ or for Friday
night's almost equally important victory against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The critics claim that not only is Oates too easy-going but that
he has surrounded himself with coaches who reflect the same
personality. Quiet. Unassertive. Boring.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   First, baseball's long and demanding 162-game, six-month
schedule requires an even keel. It has too many peaks and valleys
to accommodate those whose emotions ratchet up and down like a
fairgrounds roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Even more importantly, what you see on TV or read about in your
daily newspaper does not always reflect what's going on behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't normally know, for instance, that Oates and hitting
coach Rudy Jaramillo aired each other out in the dugout during a
game in this homestand; or that Tom Goodwin and Rusty Greer heard
in no uncertain terms about their base running blunders after
Thursday night's game; or that a coach and a player wrestled in the
tunnel leading to the clubhouse the last time the Rangers played in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of slightly stained laundry that every team has
but that Oates normally chooses not to air in public.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is pleased with the job his coaches have done and he has
told Melvin that. It is Oates who will pay the highest price if
he's wrong about them.
</P>
<P>
   That includes pitching coach Dick Bosman, who has come under
fire because the Rangers' team earned-run average has rested near
or at the bottom of the league most of the season. He has done what
he could with what he's had.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosman's defense, remember that Rick Helling (19-7), who'd
never won more than five games in a season before this year, will
very likely become just the third 20-game winner in franchise
history, that Aaron Sele (18-10) has resurrected his career after
being given up for dead by the Red Sox and that the bullpen has
overachieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have had managers who ripped the players after every
loss (remember Kevin Kennedy?) and who screamed and kicked trash
cans over in the dugout during games (say hello, Doug Rader) and
those tactics failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Oates delivered this franchise its first and only
division title and he's on the verge of doing so for the second
time in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't buy a little job security, somebody's definitely
listening to the wrong people.

FOYT'S CAREER MAKES HIM A CERTIFIED LEGEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To ascend from superstar status to become a legend, you must do
something that makes people say, ``only old so-and-so could do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment for Nolan Ryan came when a young third
baseman named Robin Ventura charged the mound after being hit by a
pitch. The old man grabbed the rushing Ventura, swiftly landed a
series of blows to his noggin and, in a few frenzied seconds,
gained larger-than-life status.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment for A.J. Foyt came during the inaugural Indy
Racing League event at Texas Motor Speedway last year. The car
owner was celebrating a victory by his driver Billy Boat, when Arie
Luyendyk charged into victory circle, claiming he had won the race.
Foyt wasn't in the mood for debate. He slapped the driver from
behind, knocking him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the funniest thing,'' IRL driver Greg Ray said. ``He's
the only person who could get away with it. Nobody really holds it
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL returns to Fort Worth for the running of Lone Star 500K
Sunday at TMS. The series features up-and-coming drivers such as
Tony Stewart, Kenny Brack, Boat and Ray, and established veterans
such as Indianapolis 500 champions Luyendyk and Eddie Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   But its dominant personality is a certified legend and Texas
hero named Anthony Joseph Foyt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody may say legend,'' Foyt said Friday, after Boat drove
a Foyt Racing car to the pole for Sunday's Lone Star 500K. ``But my
name is just good old A.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't exist, you'd have to invent him,'' Cheever said.
``Foyt's a legend. He is hard-headed, he is arrogant, he is very
opinionated, but I love him. I think he's a great guy. He was one
hell of a racer. He's one of the cornerposts to the IRL.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt was born in Houston in 1935, the son of a man who owned a
garage that specialized in race cars. By the time he was 5, he knew
he wanted to be a driver. When he was 18, he was a regular on the
midget-racing circuit in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   He worked his way up the Indy-car ranks and became the most
dominant driver in that series.
</P>
<P>
   He first won the prestigious Indy 500 in 1961 and went on to
become the first four-time winner of the ``greatest spectacle in
racing.'' He is the all-time Indy-car leader with 67 victories and
won the points title seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt also ran a part-time NASCAR schedule and won seven races in
the stock-car ranks, including the 1972 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   He dabbled in endurance racing and won the 24 hours of LeMans in
1967 and the Daytona 24-hour race in 1983. He has won 12 driving
championships in various categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my fair share of glory through the years,'' Foyt said.
``I couldn't have had a better career, I don't think. I wouldn't
change anything I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt inspired boys who dreamed of racing the cars he drove to
glory, including Ray who, like Foyt, grew up in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember reading a biography about A.J. when I was in fifth
grade,'' Ray said. ``I remember the story of him driving go-karts
and quarter midgets, and taking the cars out when his dad wasn't
there and getting grounded, and being ornery just like he is now. I
actually did a skit in an English class of the life of A.J. Foyt,
being a four-time Indianapolis 500 champion.''
</P>
<P>
   With Foyt, it's my way or no raceway. When you have a resume
such as his, you tend to believe that your way must be the best
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who works for him is in for a very demanding
relationship,'' said Cheever, who drove for Foyt in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams ranks in 1994 and '95. ``I don't
think he could ever be a diplomat. Everybody would be at war in
about 20 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray experienced what it's like to work for Foyt when he joined
the team for two races this summer while Boat recovered from
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have three things to get along with A.J. Foyt as a
driver,'' Ray said. ``If you're a strong personality guy, if you
can _ for lack of a better word _ drive the crap out of the race
car, and if you can tell him what it's doing articulately and in
very few words, then you're A.J.'s kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's gruff, terse manner can cause people to underestimate
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. is not exactly polished around the corners, but he is a
very, very smart man,'' Ray said. ``He is also very passionate
about racing, and that is why he's been so good at it. A lot of
people worry about what people think of them. A lot of people worry
about how much money they're going to make. At the end of the day,
A.J. is one of those kind of guys who's always stuck to his guns
and did what he believed in, and everything worked out because he
did the right things for the right reasons.''

KIMMEL WINS POLE, THEN RUNS INTO WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the space of a scant few seconds Friday,
Frank Kimmel experienced the full Wide World of Sports treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One moment, Kimmel tasted the thrill of victory. He roared past
the start/finish line at Texas Motor Speedway after a hot lap at
173.393 mph to take the pole for the ARCA Z-MAX 250 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The next, he experienced the agony of defeat. He hit the wall in
Turn 2 in his No. 46 Advance Auto Parts-Visionaire Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tore up the car pretty good, but it's fixable, so I think
we'll be OK,'' said Kimmel, the points leader in the ARCA
Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series who is after his 10th victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kimmel didn't know he had tasted the thrill of
victory. If he had, he likely wouldn't have hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ciochetti, the 12th car out, set the pace with a lap of
31.182 seconds at 173.176 mph. It was the fastest circuit since the
ARCA cars arrived at the track Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had the pole there for a little bit, but I knew
it was going to be close,'' said Ciochetti, driver of the No. 17
Hughes Supply Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ciochetti realized the driver most likely to bump him was
Kimmel, who had run speeds close to that in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it held up until Kimmel topped it with the first of
his two laps.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, Kimmel didn't know he was the new pole sitter.
He was told via the radio that a stopwatch clocked him at 31.14,
but he didn't know if he could trust it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went ahead and started to run the second lap as hard as I
could to make up a little more and got a little off line coming off
\RTurn\S 2,'' Kimmel said. ``I got up in some loose stuff and
wasn't smart enough to back out of it, and I smacked the wall
pretty hard. We ran a .14 the first lap. If I had known that going
into the second lap, we never would have wrecked. But hindsight is
always better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wreck, Kimmel will get to start from the pole
because his car was repairable. If he had gone to a backup car, he
would have had to start at the rear of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Ciochetti's speed held up for the outside of the front row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the fastest car, but we've got the fastest car
with all four wheels still on it,'' he said. ``That's almost as
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Norris, who entered his first ARCA race to shoot race
footage for Walker, Texas Ranger _ the show starring his dad, Chuck
Norris _ qualified third at 172.062 mph.
</P>
<P>
   That was a surprise, but not because Norris is competing in an
ARCA event for the first time. He is an experienced racer who is
running the complete NASCAR Winston West series this season. The
surprise came because the No. 14 Prolong Super Lubricants Ford had
precious little practice time Thursday because of a master cylinder
problem, locked up brakes and an oil-line leak during practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy with it,'' Norris said. ``The car ran great.
After all that trouble \RThursday\S, I'm real happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he didn't take his second pole of the season,
Ciochetti also is happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to be on the front row,'' he said. ``You're
away from the trouble if it starts, unless you're the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast drivers are concerned that there could be trouble
Saturday because of the disparity of the speeds in qualifying _ the
slowest car ran a not-so-hot lap of 145.231 mph, almost 30 mph
slower than Kimmel _ because of the length of the race and because
of tires that aren't gripping the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting a lot of attrition, but I'm hoping that doesn't
happen,'' Ciochetti said. ``Everybody doesn't have a handle on this
place.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pole went to the fastest. The race won't necessary come down
to the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to have to be a smart race,'' Kimmel said.
``Whoever is the smartest will win this thing. And I've already
done my stupid thing for the week.''

BOAT SEIZES LONE STAR POLE IN RECORD FASHION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Billy Boat captured the pole for the Lone
Star 500K Sunday with a backup engine he did not know about, and
with innuendo he has come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the most recent Pep Boys Indy Racing League event at
Texas Motor Speedway in June, Boat added the track qualifying
record to his resume with a hot lap of 225.979 mph. Boat's one-lap
wonder _ the gearbox in his car broke on his second allowable lap _
erased the mark of 224.448 mph set by Tony Stewart for the True
Value 500K on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Boat earned the sixth PPG Pole of his career and fifth of the
season, an IRL record. The pole was Boat's third consecutive _
another IRL record. The speed was also the fastest by a new formula
IRL car, which debuted in the series in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Good stuff from a guy who was admittedly lost after the first
day of practice, when he posted a top speed of 216.381 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out to lunch this morning,'' said Boat, driver of the
No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora owned by four-time Indianapolis 500
champion A.J. Foyt of Houston. ``We went back and changed almost
everything. We changed springs, (ride) heights _ there wasn't
anything we didn't change. We went out and two changes later we ran
a lap at 226. I'm constantly amazed at the wealth of his (Foyt's)
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat was also amazed to learn during the post-qualifying news
conference that he had set the record with a backup motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy had a race motor in today, our backup race motor,
because we broke his qualifying motor on the dyno,'' said Foyt,
whose specially prepared qualifying Oldsmobile Aurora V-8s are the
envy and bane of his competitors. ``This was actually a very good
backup race motor. That's why we put it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, meanwhile, salvaged some pride and managed to raise
temperatures inside Foyt's pits when he pulled out a lap at 224.869
mph on the final attempt of the afternoon. That allowed Stewart,
the reigning series champion, to secure the No. 2 qualifying
position.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before qualifying, Firestone engineers reported the air
temperature at 93 degrees and track temperature at 127 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, whose No. 1 Glidden-Menards Special Dallara/Aurora was
uncharacteristically down on horsepower in the most recent race at
Atlanta Motor Speedway, fired the last shot at Boat after his team
changed engines. At 5:19 p.m., Stewart took the car out for a
``leak check'' of the engine but did not take the green flag to
start his qualifying run. He returned at 5:37 p.m. but fell short
of knocking Boat off the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was running a qualifying motor, Stewart said: ``I
think we're running anything that we have that's in one piece. I
don't even know how many motors we have. Anything that's in one
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Team Menard have been publicly at odds with the Foyt
camp since the race at New Hampshire International Speedway in
June, when team-owner John Menard suggested that Foyt's qualifying
engines were not totally legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on that,'' Stewart said tersely.
``The guy's a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the charges of cheating are a backhanded compliment,
Foyt said, ``Usually the ones that call you cheaters _ that's who
you need to look it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat's three consecutive poles are the perfect complement to
teammate Kenny Brack, who has won a record three consecutive IRL
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good young crew working very hard,'' said Foyt,
explaining the hot streaks. ``They realized what a win means to
them. Like I've always said, when you start tasting those wins you
just go crazy for it. It's like giving a kid candy. They're just
working that much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack, driving a car Foyt said was identical to Boat's except
for the engine, wound up 10th with a hot lap at 222.186 mph in the
No. 14 Power Team Dallara/Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Racing teammates Scott Sharp, who formerly drove for
Foyt, and Mark Dismore make up the second row after posting
respective speeds of 224.551 mph and 224.299 mph in their
Dallara/Auroras. Sharp was among nine drivers who took the No. 2
spot in the order before Stewart settled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the bad thing about going out first,'' said Boat, who
actually went out second to Roberto Guerrero. ``We were sitting
there, it seemed like, forever. There was a lot of fast guys there
at the end and we knew it was cooling off so they were going to
pick up a little speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of agonizing down there.''

COWBOYS HIT AGAIN BY INJURY BUG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys' banged-up defensive line
took another hit Friday. Lineman Antonio Anderson will miss three
to four weeks because of torn cartilage in his knee, coach Chan
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is expected to have surgery this morning. He injured
his knee in practice Thursday. A magnetic resonance imaging exam
performed Friday revealed torn cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   With tackles Leon Lett (knee) Chad Hennings (knee, ankle, wrist)
hobbling, the Cowboys' front four will be challenged to hold up
against a Giants offensive line that averages 315 pounds per
player.
</P>
<P>
   Lett and Hennings returned to practice Friday for the first time
this week. Gailey said both will probably start against the Giants,
although Lett might be limited to 25 to 30 plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Chad and Leon did OK,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lett played about 15 snaps against Denver last week, but Gailey
said he expects Lett to play more against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to limit him,'' he said. ``He's looking better
than he was last week, so I'm hoping he will play more snaps than
he played last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had played mostly behind defensive end Greg Ellis,
registering one tackle in two games. Gailey said the club is
considering whether to add a defensive lineman to replace Anderson.
But the Cowboys will go into the Giants game with a seven-man
rotation on the line, instead of the normal eight-man rotation,
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurvin McCormack is expected to get most of the defensive snaps
in Anderson's place, Gailey said. WARREN NEARS RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chris Warren, who has surprised team trainer Jim
Maurer with his fast recovery from an injured groin muscle, said he
needs one week before he will be ready to play. He said he expects
to be placed on the inactive list for the Giants game.

GIANTS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Dodgers could have gone quietly, the way
they had all season.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night they were eliminated from the National League
wild-card race, the Dodgers decided to play it tough Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Not until a Barry Bonds homer off Scott Radinsky to lead off the
bottom of the eighth was the Dodgers' season mathmatically ended
with a 4-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants at 3Com Park in front
of 31,452.
</P>
<P>
   For Bonds, honored before the game as baseball's first player to
reach 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases, it was his 35th homer of
the year and 409th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, it was the same old sad refrain.
</P>
<P>
   They took the lead, lost an important player _ in this case,
Dave Mlicki to injury _ then watched the game slip away.
</P>
<P>
   The game had none of the classic overtures of this storied
rivalry _ no pennant race on the line, no fights in the stands. But
in a season of unfamiliar faces, the Dodgers were hoping to see
more of Mlicki, who left the game with one out in the sixth with
lower back pain.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Mlicki departed that the Giants tied the game at
three with a seventh-inning pinch single by Marvin Bernard off
Radinsky that scored Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants entered the game five back in the wild-card race with
10 games to play. The Chicago Cubs and New York Mets already had
lost Friday.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered to Mlicki, already under contract ($2.25
million) for 1999, but already is best known as the pitcher stolen
in the Hideo Nomo deal, Fred Claire's last trade as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki has been solid, 8-3 in 19 starts since he came to the
Dodgers from the New York Mets along with right-handed reliever
Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   After Claire was fired, interim GM Tom Lasorda sent McMichael
back to the Mets for left-hander Brian Bohanon. Mlicki and Bohanon
have re-established careers with the Dodgers that were floundering
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants, Mlicki made few mistakes. The first was a
fourth-inning double by Jeff Kent that scored Bonds with the Giants
first run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had taken a 1-0 lead in the top of the fourth
against Giants starter Mark Gardner, who last won Sept. 6 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi opened with a single, stole second and took third
on a throwing error by Giants catcher Brent Mayne. He scored on an
infield out by Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added two runs in the fifth when Gardner was undone
by his control. After allowing a double to Roger Cedeno, Gardner
retired Jim Eisenreich, but walked Eric Karros and Bobby Bonilla to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   With Mondesi at the plate, Gardner threw a wild pitch to score
Cedeno and put Karros at third. Karros scored on an infield out by
Mondesi to give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki first strained is back swinging the bat in the sixth
inning when he flied to the right-field warning track. He struck
out Burks to open the Giants sixth, but then gave up a double to
Bonds off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi made it a close play when his strong throw just missed
getting Bonds and punched the air in disgust. So did Dodgers
manager Glenn Hoffman when Kent followed with his second RBI double
to cut the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki clutched his lower back as pitching coach Charlie Hough
came to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers turned to rookie left-hander Jeff Kubenka, who won
his first major league game Sept. 8 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants pinch hit Joe Carter for J.T. Snow and Carter flied
to medium center. Cedeno made the catch and Kent made an
ill-advised attempt to take third. Cedeno threw him out easily to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were back at in the seventh when Kubenka walked
Charlie Hayes to open the inning. Hayes was sacrificed to second
and went to third on Rich Aurelia's ground single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka came back to strike out pinch hitter Chris Jones before
giving way to the veteran Radinsky, who gave up the game tying
single to pinch hitter Bernard.

MICHIGAN HAS NO DEFENSE FOR WINLESS START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After waiting 40 years for the school's second national
championship in football, Michigan fans are now waiting for some
good news. They had better be patient.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines' first 0-2 start in a decade was darkened
considerably this week by the news that senior safety Marcus Ray,
considered the best player on a veteran defense, has been suspended
while an investigation is conducted into his alleged dealings with
an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The litany of problems is long: no running game, a porous
defense, inconsistent special teams. Also, there's a quarterback
controversy brewing; freshman Drew Henson continues to impress in
relief of starter Tom Brady.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, a school icon is missing. The ``Go Blue''
banner that hangs in the tunnel at Michigan Stadium was stolen last
week. Since 1962, the players have jumped and touched the banner as
they ran on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me what's going on, what's happening, I'm still
surprised with it,'' Michigan offensive tackle Jon Jansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Michigan led the nation in total defense. After two
games, Michigan ranks 84th in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected us to be a much better defensive football team than
we are,'' coach Lloyd Carr said. With nine starters returning, that
was a reasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Wolverines allowed 9.5 points and 89 yards rushing
per game. In losing its first two, Michigan is allowing 37 points
and 235 yards rushing a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any questions of whether or not this is the same team as last
year, or whether we're going to be stellar on defense, they've been
answered: We're not there yet,'' nose tackle Rob Renes said. `We
have a lot of improvement to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Michigan faces Eastern Michigan, which makes the
eight-mile trip from Ypsilanti to Ann Arbor with a 1-1 record. In
two weeks, the Wolverines face Michigan State, which dominated a
Notre Dame team that mauled Michigan in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines are 0-0 in the Big Ten. And there's always the
(annual) dream of ruining Ohio State's year in the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two weeks to get ready for the Big Ten season, and
we each have to take a look at where we are and what we're doing,''
Carr said. ``It's going to be a lonely time now. We understand
that. But we have to dig ourselves out of this hole.''
CHAMPIONSHIP FALLS
</P>
<P>
   In the 62 years of The Associated Press rankings, 11 teams that
finished No. 1 failed to finish in the top 10 the next season.
Michigan, last season's AP champion, is 0-2 and unranked. The 11
teams that had the biggest falls after a championship season: Team,
title year Next season W-L, rank Alabama, 1992 9-3-1, 14th
Colorado, 1990 8-3-1, 20th Penn State, 1986 8-4-01, UR BYU, 1984
11-3-0, 16th Miami (Fla.), 1983 8-5-0, 18th Penn State, 1982 8-4-1,
UR USC, 1962 7-3-0, UR Syracuse, 1959 7-2-0, 19th Notre Dame, 1949
4-4-1, UR Ohio State, 1942 3-5-0, UR Minnesota, 1941 5-4-0, UR TCU,
1938 3-7-0, UR
</P>
<P>
   Notes: UR means team was not ranked in final poll; Alabama's
record in 1993 was changed to 1-12 because of NCAA-mandated
forfeits; In 1962, the AP poll ranked 10 teams.
BCS SETS RATINGS DATES
</P>
<P>
   It's complicated. It's maligned. And it's not going to make its
debut until mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series' ratings, which will decide what
teams play in the national championship game, will debut Nov. 17.
The news media and coaches polls are a Monday morning staple, but
the championship ratings take more time to figure because of all
the factors. The ratings combine the two polls, three computer
ratings, strength of schedule and won-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   The series ratings will be released four times. The final time
will be Dec. 6, the day after the major conference title games. The
teams that finish first and second will be matched in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was not to do it too early because we wanted to get
enough games to gauge the teams' strengths,'' said BCS spokesman
Charles Bloom of the Southeastern Conference, which is charged with
figuring and distributing the ratings. ``Also, we didn't want to
have the poll come out that many times. The only one that makes a
difference is the last one.''
JOE (GRAND) PA
</P>
<P>
   Joe Paterno kept saying that reaching a coaching milestone was
no big deal. But after he recorded the 300th victory of his career
Saturday against Bowling Green, Paterno was surprised that his
emotions betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   After the Nittany Lions' 48-3 victory, his players carried him
to the middle of the field for a postgame ceremony. He told the
sellout crowd of 96,291 spectators that he was ``overwhelmed'' and
``filled up with memories'' of his 48 years at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said later. ``You think you know yourself.
I didn't realize I'd get that choked up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room with his players, he started crying. The
tears flowed again when Matthew Gigerich, his 16-month-old
grandson, toddled up and presented gramps with the game ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in tears a little bit when he started crying,''
linebacker LaVar Arrington said. ``It was an emotional thing. It
meant a lot to me. We made history today and I was proud to be a
part of it.''
LIGHTENING UP
</P>
<P>
   Before his team's game with Iowa last week, Iowa State coach Dan
McCarney told defensive backs Jeff Waters and Jamarcus Powers he
would change his hair color if the Cyclones won.
</P>
<P>
   Final score: Iowa State 27, Iowa 9. McCarney hair color: blond
from brunette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks horrible,'' McCarney said. ``It's taking homeliness
and ugliness to a new level.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarney won't have to put up with his new look for long. The
color can be shampooed out.
IN QUOTES
</P>
<P>
   Purdue coach Joe Tiller believes that the Boilermakers' attitude
after a 21-19 defeat of Rice on Saturday is a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come a long way in a short period of time at Purdue
when we come off the field and we're disappointed with a win,''
Tiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee wide receiver Peerless Price on life without
quarterback Peyton Manning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, when you have one guy who gets all that
attention, you sometimes kind of sit back and wait for him to make
something happen. And the thing with Peyton is that he almost
always made a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden on 26-year-old sophomore Chris
Weinke after his six interceptions in an upset loss to North
Carolina State:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee you none of them have lost any confidence in
him. You know why? Because there's not a one of them who can look
at him and say, `Hey, I did good. You did bad.' It was a total team
loss.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Voters in The Associated Press poll were not impressed by
Kansas State's 73-7 victory against Northern Illinois. The Wildcats
dropped from fourth to fifth and were passed by UCLA. Jeff
Sagarin's computer rankings list Michigan (0-2) No. 15 and Kansas
State (2-0) No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Figure today's Florida-Tennessee game to be decided early. The
Gators have won the past five in the series and have outscored the
Volunteers 52-13 in the first quarter. In four of the five losses,
Tennessee was scoreless in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clemson, coming off a 37-0 loss to Virginia Tech, opens
Atlantic Coast Conference play at No. 10 Virginia. The Tigers have
lost five of their past six ACC openers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under coach Butch Davis, Miami is 3-7 against ranked
opponents. The 2-0 Hurricanes face four ranked foes in the next
five games _ Virginia Tech today, UCLA, Rutgers, Florida State and
West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oregon State (2-0) is at Southern California today. The
Beavers have not won their first two games since 1985. The last
time they were 3-0 was 1967, which is also the last season they
defeated USC.

STARS' CAMP IMPRESSES HITCHCOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock left Vail, Colo., singing the
praises of the the team's work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it's been the best training camp we've
had,'' said Hitchcock, completing his third camp with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars wrapped up five days in Vail with an early practice,
but no scrimmage. Instead, they will have their final full-squad
scrimmage at 10 this morning at the Dr Pepper StarCenter in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   It likely will be the final appearance for several junior-league
players who will return to their junior teams Sunday. The Stars
also will send 23 players on the road for preseason exhibition
games to Sunday in Lakeland, Fla., and St. Louis on Monday. The
rest of the veterans will remain in Texas to prepare for a
preseason game Tuesday against the Nashville Predators in Little
Rock, Ark. FOREIGN COACH ASSISTS STARS
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have opened their training camp to Vladimir Jourzinov,
a longtime assistant coach in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Jourzinov also has coached in Finland for several years and the
Stars have done a great deal of scouting in the country. Jourzinov,
who coached the Stars' Jere Lehtinen in Finland and Sergei Zubov in
the USSR, is in town for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not coaching, I am learning,'' Jourzinov said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock, who had a long discussion with Jourzinov through
a translator, said the veteran coach has great ideas.

   ``He has such an extensive background, there's just so much we
can learn from him,'' Hitchcock said. PARTNER SWITCHING
</P>
<P>
   Stars coaches are experimenting with several defensive pairs
during the preseason with Richard Matvichuk missing time to
rehabilitate his left knee and Darryl Sydor out because of a
contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk regularly has been paired with Derian Hatcher, forming
the Stars' top defensive duo. Stars assistant coach Rick Wilson has
experimented with the duo of Hatcher and Shawn Chambers or rookie
Petr Buzek.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor has been paired with Sergei Zubov, forming the Stars' top
offensive duo. In camp, veteran Dan Keczmer has been paired with
Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   The third pair regularly has been veteran Craig Ludwig with
rookie Sergey Gusev.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to look at,'' Wilson said. ``We'll probably need
all eight exhibition games to study everything.'' HITCHCOCK
PRESENTS
</P>
<P>
   The Stars announced last week they had signed Wilson and
assistant coach Doug Jarvis to three-year contract extensions. With
the earlier extension awarded to Hitchcock, the Stars could have
the same staff through 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Rick and Doug do for me is they challenge me. If they
don't agree with something we're doing, they'll come after me,
they'll challenge me daily,'' Hitchcock said. ``They're very
supportive. But if they don't like something, they're not going to
let it slide. I find that kind of passion goes a long way, because
the players read how much the coaching staff cares about winning.''

BENES PITCHES ANOTHER GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Facing the Diamondbacks on Friday night obviously was
not on Atlanta star right-hander Greg Maddux's list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   After his previous start on Sunday, when he came out of the game
against Florida after six innings with tightness in his triceps,
Maddux said, ``I'll be able to start against the Arizona _ what are
they called? _ The Diamondbacks?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he will remember who they are after they defeated him
and the Braves, 5-0, in front of 46,434 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason that Arizona was able to raise its record to
62-93 was not so much getting to Maddux, but the fact that the
Braves couldn't get to Diamondbacks right-hander Andy Benes.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of a near no-hitter against the Reds in Cincinnati
on Sunday, Benes came through to shut down Atlanta on three hits
through eight innings to increase his scoreless inning streak to
20, one-third of an inning shy of right-hander Willie Banks' club
record. Over his past five starts, Benes is 3-1 with an ERA of
0.69.
</P>
<P>
   He also was able to raise his record to 14-13, the first time he
has gone beyond the .500 level this season. The 14 victories equal
the 14 of Tampa Bay's Rolando Arrojo for the most wins by an
expansion pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Alan Embree, who came to Arizona from the Braves on
June 23 in a trade for right-hander Russ Springer, began the ninth
but got in trouble. He walked leadoff man Gerald Williams, but
Williams was doubled off first when Chipper Jones lined out to Matt
Williams at third and Matt Williams threw to Travis Lee at first.
</P>
<P>
   Embree gave up a single to Ryan Klesko and a double to Andruw
Jones before Arizona Manager Buck Showalter brought in veteran
right-handed closer Gregg Olson, who got pinch-hitter Andres
Galarraga on a game-ending grounder to Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored single runs in the third and sixth, then
broke it open with three in the seventh off Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Benes started the rally with a single to right field, then later
scored on a fielder's choice grounder by Matt Williams. Travis Lee
followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got a case of ``wildness'' as Benes led off the top of
the third. One pitch was extremely tight and the other amazingly
went behind the big fellow.
</P>
<P>
   If one were a conspiracy buff, one might think the pitches were
retaliatory in nature after a game in Atlanta on April 22 in which
Benes plunked the Braves Andruw Jones with a pitch after John
Smoltz had hit Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smoltz called Williams immediately after that game to say
it wasn't intentional, Benes didn't apologize in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that we're not here to make friends,'' Benes
said.
</P>
<P>
   So since Smoltz wasn't scheduled to pitch and make a possible
response, it was Maddux's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux walked Benes and attempted to pick him off first, but the
throw went past first baseman Ryan Klesko and Benes took off for
second. He probably should have stopped there, but he lumbered for
third like a big truck that had lost its brakes. He lunged
head-first in the dirt, but the throw to third baseman Chipper
Jones was there in plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox then singled to left-center, stole second and scored
the first Arizona run on a single to left by Jay Bell. It was the
1,500th hit of Bell's career.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux then bore down to strike out six of the next nine
batters. His strikeout of Fox for the second out of the fifth
inning was his 200th of the season, the first time he has reached
that mark in his career.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the sixth, the Diamondbacks got consecutive
singles from Lee, Tony Batista and David Dellucci to produce a run
for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux then ran out of gas in the seventh. &QL;

RESPECT, TITLE FOR OSCAR  
 CHAMPION STOPS CHAVEZ AFTER 8 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ For weeks, respect was just a word. Friday night, it
finally meant something.
</P>
<P>
   It could be measured.
</P>
<P>
   Seen.
</P>
<P>
   And spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Only Julio Cesar Chavez tasted it.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez, a mouthful of blood was the bitter residue of defeat
at the fast and wicked hands of angry Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya had been promising to make his boyhood idol submit.
He promised punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he delivered. There was no knockout. Chavez was
never off his feet. But the fight ended after eight rounds with
Chavez seated on his stool and blood filling his mouth from a cut
on his lower right lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got what I wanted: I made him quit,'' De La Hoya (29-0, 24
knockouts) said after he retained the World Boxing Council's
welterweight title in front of a Thomas &AMP; Mack Center crowd of
17,125.
</P>
<P>
   There could be no bigger insult hurled at a proud fighter who is
so worshiped in his native Mexico. It hurt more than any punch
thrown by De La Hoya, who was badly bruised beneath his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Bruises vanish. Cuts leave only scars. But humiliation is a
savage cut. It always stings.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez (101-3-2, 84 KOs) raged at suggestions that he is a
quitter. He spit out a couple of expletives in English.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed his cornermen for the stoppage. But he never said why
he didn't argue the decision, and De La Hoya expressed skepticism
about who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't quit,'' an interpreter said as he translated
Chavez's Spanish. ``He's a man. He has heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But by boxing standards, he's a very old man. More than 100
bouts has turned the 36-year-old warrior into a relic. An irony is
that the bout ended after one of his most spirited rounds in years.
</P>
<P>
   With blood trickling down his face from a slight cut above his
left eye, Chavez tested De La Hoya as severely as anyone has.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments when De La Hoya's eyes seemed to fill with
uncertainty as Chavez shook off a couple of early combinations and
went straight at him again and again.
</P>
<P>
   In the round's final seconds, the crowd went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico, Mexico,'' Chavez partisans chanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar, Oscar,'' countered De La Hoya fans.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes still reverberated through the arena when, suddenly,
it was over. The end was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya had to be the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Judges John Keane, David Van De Wide and Anek Hongtongtain
thought so. De La Hoya led on all three cards. Computerized
punching statistics also favored De La Hoya, who earned $9 million
and a percentage of pay-per-view TV sales. He connected on 49
percent of his blows compared to Chavez's 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, Chavez said he will retire after a bout with
International Boxing Federation junior welterweight Vince Phllips.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seemed certain:
</P>
<P>
   There will not be a third De La Hoya-Chavez match. De La Hoya
faces other, perhaps more difficult challenges. On Nov. 21 at Las
Vegas, he has a date with former World Boxing Association
welterweight champ Ike Quartey, who was at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat me; I don't want no more,'' Chavez finally said.
</P>
<P>
   From him, it was a mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   Of respect. &QL;

NORTH TEXAS: BIG PAYDAY ASU: MAKE THEM-PAY DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Arizona State's practice field has resembled a
holding cell of sorts this week, with coaches taking a tough love
approach to workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Has ASU been scared straight? The answer comes tonight when
North Texas, which became a Division I-A program three years ago,
visits Sun Devil Stadium. Kickoff is 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking them very seriously, obviously,'' ASU
quarterback Ryan Kealy said. ``We're 0-2, so if we don't, there's
something really wrong with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sun Devils are 36{-point favorites, they might as
well be underdogs. The slap of reality provided by losses to
Washington and Brigham Young has made this team take nothing for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Everything on paper suggests this game will be a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who also call themselves the Mean Green, are still
finding their way under first-year Coach Darrell Dickey. They've
managed a combined nine points in losses to Oklahoma and Texas
Tech. Dickey plans to use quarterbacks Jason Attaway and LaDarrin
McLane against the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas has acknowledged that scheduling this game has much
to do with money. The Eagles will make $370,000 from this contest
and $1.28 million this season, the most in the country.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas' schedule is rated the 52nd toughest in the nation
by ``USA'' ``Today's'' Jeff Sagarin, which is tougher than powers
Nebraska (92nd) and Florida (133rd).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on the win-loss record, but it helps our athletic
department a lot,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tough on the ego, too. The Sun Devils are bitter about
their start and the prevailing theme among players seems to be:
Take out frustrations on North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like them to play angry every week,'' ASU Coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``Smart angry, not dumb angry. I hope none of these
guys have to go to war, but the game of football is as close to war
as you're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said, ``(The Sun Devils) are probably disappointed in the
way they've played. They may be a little better equipped than us to
handle that from a mental standpoint. That's what their intentions
will be on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our intentions will be to hang together, work through
our mistakes and keep getting better as a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting jobs could be won or lost in this game for ASU. Snyder
will be taking a close look at junior college transfers Junior
Ioane and Erik Flowers, who will be starting at defensive tackle
and end, respectively, tonight for the first time. Eric Fields
starts for Stephen Trejo at linebacker, and free safety Phillip
Brown replaces Mitchell Freedman, who is sidelined because of a
thigh strain.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Peters steps in at left guard for Randy Leaphart, who is
out indefinitely because of a knee injury, and punter Stephen Baker
also will kick field goals after Mike Gauthier struggled in ASU's
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Snyder isn't buying this mismatch pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a real spirited group,'' he said. ``This is a real
compliment to Coach Dickey. In terms of schematics, they are smart,
they are not dumb. They play very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Sun Devils, who hope they have completed their
work-release program. &QL;

   TEMPE, Ariz. - A huge scab simmers below his elbow, an angry
wound that hasn't healed and probably won't until the season is
over. An early barrage of turf bruises are both self-inflicted and
inescapable, gifts of his inexperience and the men paid to protect
his backside.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing hurts like his bruised ego. And nothing has lingered
like the taste of failure.

   Jake Plummer returns to the cozy cocoon Sunday, the place where
his legend was born. A place where he received a standing ovation
after debuting with a three-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are not as hard on me as, say, I was in New York and
threw a couple of picks,'' Plummer said. ``If I would've played
like I did last week and played in New York, they'd probably have a
guy starting for me this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Plummer, this is not the East Coast. But for the
first time, he returns in the form of a question mark. And for the
first time, he may be a quarterback on a short leash. &QL; 
Risking a riot &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If he orchestrates a victory, the whole tone of the season
changes, and everything's fine in the desert. But if Plummer
struggles again in a must-win venture against the Eagles, Vince
Tobin may have no choice but to turn to Dave Brown. Even if it
means risking a riot at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good week of practice, we have a good game plan, and
we should do a lot better,'' Plummer said. ``I think the guys take
it personally when a team gets seven sacks on them. Whether 2 or 3
of them were my fault, they still took it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   They should, because it's two weeks into the season, and Plummer
has been sacked nine times. In 26 possessions, the offense has
produced 24 points, 14 punts and five turnovers. They have yet to
score in the first half, turning each contest into a futile game of
catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   And so should Plummer, who has looked nothing like a budding
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   There are many theories surrounding the slow start. After a
nine-game audition last season, defenses have recognized Plummer as
a legitimate weapon. Opposing coaches have heeded the words of Bill
Walsh, who considers him the next Joe Montana and an MVP candidate
for this season. Together, they have done everything possible to
make his life miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be the fishbowl of structure. Last season, Plummer's
brilliance was mostly improvisational, a guy who made plays while
running for his life. This year, he is asked to read defenses, pick
the right receivers, succeed under a well-defined system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every quarterback is facing stuff like this, whether it's a
first-year guy or Warren Moon,'' Plummer said. ``They probably do
it more to myself to test me, see how far I've come, see how much
I've learned. And also to test the offensive line. We've been
tested, and we haven't stepped up.'' &QL; 
Downward trend &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Cardinals tried simplifying the game plan. This
week, they'll concentrate on keeping guys at home to help with
protection. The trend is ominous, an offense that is reacting to
what the defense is doing rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that changes this week, a week in which the entire offense
started watching film together, stressing accountability. Plummer
cringed at his mistakes. Offensive lineman owned up to missed
assignments. Together, they vowed to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are put on me, and they think the stadium will be
built if I have success,'' Plummer said. ``But you can't attribute
that (pressure) to my two bone-headed interceptions last week.
Nothing is like the expectations I put on myself as a quarterback
maturing and learning the system. I want to get better. And when we
get this offense all timed out and get everything going, I feel
more comfortable that we'll start moving the ball better.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, because somehow the Cardinals must discover the end zone.
And when the final gun sounds on Sunday, they better have found the
win column.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all starts with the guy taking snaps from center.
The hometown hero who has to start acting the part. &QL;

TRAILING, 5-1, THUNDER MAN AGES TO PULL OUT A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ZUCKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For 45 minutes Friday night, the Arizona Thunder could
not figure out how to penetrate a stifling Sacramento Knights
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, it was the Sacramento defense that could
not figure out how to stop the Thunder offense.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 5-1, with seconds to go in the third quarter, the Thunder
stormed back to score six unanswered goals and held on to defeat
the Knights, 7-6, at Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually made a great game out of a lazy game,'' said an
exasperated Thunder Coach Petar Baralic after the victory. ``I
really don't like to win games like this. It may be good for the
spectators, but not for the teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Muth scored the first hat trick in the Thunder's brief
history, putting Arizona ahead for good in the fourth quarter with
his third goal. Trailing, 5-3, with just over six minutes to play,
the Thunder fired off four goals in 2:15 minutes to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indoor soccer is such a high-scoring game,'' Muth said. ``If
you can keep it relatively close, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything almost did happen. Despite three agonizing quarters in
which the Thunder had plenty of scoring opportunities but could not
break through, Arizona continued to put pressure on Knights
goalkeeper Blair Quinn, finally hitting paydirt.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Soderman scored twice in the fourth quarter, while Jason
Vanacour and Kenny Wright each added a goal. Vanacour triggered the
four-goal flurry on a deflection of a hard shot by Mark Kerlin, who
had two assists, with 6:02 to go. Wright then tied the game at 5
with a beautiful one-on-one move around a defender and a pinpoint
shot past Quinn's left arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights (4-3) nearly came back in the game's waning minutes
after a goal by Danny Barber made it 7-6. They pulled Quinn in
favor of a sixth attacker but could not get a shot past Thunder
goalkeeper Chris Sagar.
</P>
<P>
   Sagar, making his first start after Scott Hileman signed with
the Florida Thunder Cats of the National Professional Soccer
League, made 13 saves to earn the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``For playing for the first time for the whole game, (Sagar) did
very well,'' Baralic said.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams will meet again tonight in Sacramento. &QL;

BELL FINDS A HOME AT 2ND BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Normally when a veteran player is asked to switch
positions in the 10th year of his major league career, it's almost
considered an act of heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when that player is asked to move from shortstop,
where he had played 1,497 games at perhaps the most demanding
position on the field, to second base.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; Jay Bell is handling it well enough that second base may
become his permanent home in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay has taken to it well,'' said Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck
Showalter, &UR; who moved Bell to second and inserted  &UR; Tony Batista at
shortstop eight games ago in Cincinnati as part of a season-ending
experiment. ``I think it has inspired him, and I think he looks at
it as a challenge. I'll be very surprised if he can't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing about Jay is he'll do anything if he thinks it
can help the ball team. I know it sounds like a cliche, but in his
case, I really mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since making the switch, Bell has played errorless ball after
committing 18 errors in 135 games at shortstop, and the only miscue
Batista has made came in the second game after the move when he
dropped Bell's feed on a potential double play.
</P>
<P>
   What's more Bell, who collected his 1,500th career hit with an
RBI single in the third Friday night against  &UR; Greg Maddux, and
Batista have hit six of the team's last seven homers and have
formed one of the National League's most potent double-play
combinations at the plate with a combined 37 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things that Buck and I were talking about
for about three months, and it finally came about,'' Bell said. ``I
certainly appreciate that Buck came to me and asked me about it
first. I told him whatever helps the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a piece of the puzzle that will enable us to have
success in the future, I'm certainly willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 32, broke into the majors with Cleveland by playing two
games at second in 1986, then moved to short in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is challenging is I don't have a rote memory of
going to places like I do at short,'' he said. ``At second base, I
have to think about where to go on certain situations. On the other
hand, the throw is nice and easy and you don't have to rush
yourself.'' &QL; 
Future 'Backs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rod Barajas, who catches for the Diamondbacks Class A High
Desert team, spent a day this week with the parent team before
joining the Instructional League in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   He said the heralded pitching trio of right-hander  &UR; Brad Penny
and southpaws
 &UR; John Patterson and  &UR; Nick Bierbrodt, just babes at 20, are all they
are said to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patterson has clocked 99 miles per hour and throws 95 to 94
consistently,'' Barajas said. ``Penny is probably the furthest
along and throws around 93 to 94. Their fastballs don't have a lot
of movement, but both have good command of their pitches and know
when to move the ball in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bierbrodt improved a lot, too. We were in the pennant race at
the end of the season _ before he kind of had a
it's-just-another-game approach _ but he started battling every
game and got really mad if he didn't pitch well. It's funny, all
three really try to outdo each other.'' &QL;

LANGKOW, WAITE READY FOR BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle of the backups will begin tonight at the Arrowhead
Pond of Anaheim, and  &UR; Jimmy Waite and  &UR; Scott Langkow say they are
ready.
</P>
<P>
   The two goalies will split time in the nets when the Coyotes
play the Mighty Ducks to open their eight-game preseason schedule.
Waite, the odds-on favorite to win the No. 2 job behind  &UR; Nikolai
Khabibulin, will get the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thursday night) Jimmy Waite was our best goaltender,''
Coyotes Coach
 &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said a day after Waite shined during the team's
annual Black and White scrimmage. ``Maybe it's a battle for No. 3.
We need Nik to play better, too. We need everyone pushing
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Langkow, the goalie of the year and a first-team All-Star last
season in the American Hockey League, won't concede anything, even
though most people probably aren't giving him a chance to beat out
the veteran Waite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just motivates me more than anything,'' he said. ``I've got
to make a strong showing, and that starts (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update &QL; 
Veterans not expected to make the trip include  &UR; Jeremy Roenick,
Rick Tocchet, &UR; Teppo Numminen and  &UR; Jyrki Lumme.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Michel Petit suffered a concussion during Thursday's
scrimmage after a hard check by  &UR; Louie DeBrusk. He will be
sidelined indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing  &UR; Dallas Drake is back on the ice after missing two
days with back spasms. Center  &UR; Cliff Ronning said he will play
Sunday against the Vancouver Canucks after missing two days with
pulled abdominal muscles. &QL;

TOMEY WARY OF IOWA  
 UA OFFENSE THRIVES WITH PAIR OF QBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona has won its first two football games easily,
climbed to No. 16 in the rankings and appears ready to be a factor
in the Pac-10 race.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coach Dick Tomey isn't giddy about his Wildcats just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   He's pleased with their efforts in wins over Hawaii and
Stanford, but he knows his team has yet to be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   It's questionable if that challenge will come tonight, when
Arizona will open its home schedule against Iowa (1-1) at 7 p.m. in
Wildcat Stadium. The Hawkeyes lost last week to Iowa State, 27-9,
for the first time in 16 years. But, as Tomey is quick to point
out, the last time Iowa lost to the Cyclones, it beat Arizona the
next week.
</P>
<P>
   So Tomey is wary, and he hopes his team is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are a better team than they showed last week,''
Tomey said. ``They have the best skill people we have played
against, and it is not even close. They have more skill people than
(Hawaii and Stanford) put together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona has more offensive threats than in any of Tomey's
previous 11 seasons in Tucson, beginning with its two quarterbacks,
sophomore Ortege Jenkins and junior Keith Smith. Each has started a
game this season, with Smith earning the nod last week at Stanford.
And each has come off the bench to spark the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey won't say which player will start tonight, but both will
play. That's as definitive as he gets about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, both players seem to be handling the
job-sharing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we keep winning, I don't see it changing,'' Jenkins
said. ``I'll get my two quarters, and Keith will get his two.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Arizona's biggest questions entering this season was its
defense, but the Wildcats have been dominant in the first two games
and held Stanford to 60 net rushing yards last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've played an offensive team yet that could
present the challenges that many teams in our conference will,''
Tomey said. ``We've got a lot of growing to do, but so far, we're
reasonably pleased with what we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear that Iowa will present that kind of challenge,
either. The Hawkeyes are averaging just 58 yards rushing this
season after leading the Big Ten a year ago with 217 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   This year's rushing average has been hurt by the team's
inability to protect the quarterback. The Hawkeyes have given up 12
sacks for 105 yards of losses, which in college football is
deducted from the rushing total.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Coach Hayden Fry, 69, is in his 37th year as a head coach,
and he's not panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying hard to keep my head screwed on straight,'' he said
on the Big Ten's weekly conference call. ``I've been coaching so
long that I know the worst thing you can do with a young team is be
inconsistent.'' &QL;

FIESTA BOWL DIRECTOR ANGERED BY MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   J &UR; ohn Junker, &UR; executive director of the Fiesta Bowl, is a little
peeved at ``Sports Illustrated'' these days. And not because
representatives keep calling him during dinner trying to extend his
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ``SI'' ran an item in its Scorecard section, pointing
out that the Fiesta Bowl is not assured of hosting a national
championship game, as ABC and Tostitos, the bowl's sponsor, are
implying in promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine correctly noted that a split vote for the national
championship could give a non-Fiesta Bowl team at least a share of
the national title. It's not likely to happen, but it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   So Junker decided to do a little writing himself and e-mailed a
challenge to the magazine last week. Junker offered to donate
$1,000 of his money to Arizona Special Olympics if the Fiesta Bowl
doesn't crown a national champion. If it does, then the magazine
would donate $1,000 to the charity.
</P>
<P>
   To punctuate his seriousness, Junker has sent the magazine a
personal check for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you willing to put your money where your mouth is?''
Junker asked in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``Sports Illustrated'' hasn't replied. But then, neither
has Junker's wife,  &UR; Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't told her about it yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Junker thinks his money is safe because the chance of another
bowl producing a national champion is remote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a college football coach out there who is saying,
`We want to go to the Orange Bowl because maybe we can win a
national championship there,' '' he said. &QL; 
Tossin' it around &QL; 
Southern California Coach  &UR; Paul Hackett has returned to the college
game after spending the past five seasons coaching in the NFL, and
he's noticed a few changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more wide open right now,'' said Hackett, the
former coach at Pittsburgh. ``These people are all over the joint.
It's trick plays, screens to receivers underneath, all the skill
players. . . . It's far different than what I remember. It drives
coaches crazy, but it's great for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in Hackett's impression might have more to do
with geography than X's and O's. The Pac-10 has been known for its
wide-open style for years, while schools in the East usually have
been far more conservative. &QL; 
No wonder &QL; 
It's no wonder Arizona State's defense has struggled in the first
two games. The players are either too inexperienced to play at a
high level now, or they just aren't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this group with 1996. Seven players from that team made
NFL rosters this year, including linebacker  &UR; Derek Smith, a starter
for the Redskins; defensive end  &UR; Derrick Rodgers, a starter for the
Dolphins; linebacker  &UR; Pat
 &UR; Tillman, who is starting for the Cardinals; cornerback  &UR; Jason
Simmons, Pittsburgh; safety  &UR; Damien Richardson, Carolina; defensive
lineman  &UR; Shawn
 &UR; Swayda, Atlanta; and defensive lineman  &UR; Vince Amey, who is on the
Raiders' practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   The other starters were safety  &UR; Mitchell Freedman, a senior this
year; defensive end  &UR; Brent Burnstein, who was cut by the Cardinals
in camp this year; linebacker  &UR; Scott Van der Ahe, who was cut by
the Colts this year, and cornerback  &UR; Marcus Soward, now a teacher.
Defensive lineman  &UR; Jeremy Staat, now with the Steelers, was a
backup.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tillman, Simmons, Amey and Richardson did not
redshirt. If they had, they would be fifth-year seniors this year.
ASU's program has not developed to the point where players of that
quality are easily replaced. &QL; 
Hissing match &QL; 
Kansas Coach  &UR; Terry Allen and Missouri Coach  &UR; Larry Smith
acknowledged they have been reprimanded by the Big 12 for their
comments regarding the officiating in last week's game between the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was angry because officials didn't call pass interference
when the Tigers intercepted a pass at the Missouri goal line in
Missouri's 41-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about 10 different (camera) angles,'' Allen said.
``The defensive back pushes our receiver down and makes the
interception. It was right in front of the official.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that there were three clips on their punt return for
a touchdown,'' he said. ``That's why coaches don't officiate.
That's all part of the game. I've been hurt and helped both
ways.'' &QL; 
Perhaps they'll listen now &QL; 
Before his team's first game, Northwestern's  &UR; Gary Barnett preached
to his team about how dangerous Nevada-Las Vegas was. Northwestern
proceeded to win, 41-7.
</P>
<P>
   So when Barnett preached the same sermon last week for the Duke
game, his players apparently tuned him out. Lowly Duke whipped
Northwestern, 44-10. &QL; 
No circus acts &QL; 
 &UR; Phil Fulmer has a 55-11 record at Tennessee but is 1-5 against
Florida, which has won five straight over the Vols. Despite those
failures, Fulmer didn't use any special motivational ploys this
week as his sixth-ranked Volunteers prepared for today's game
against the second-ranked Gators in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to stand on my head and eat bugs and shave my
hair or anything like that,'' said Fulmer, the spoilsport.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the Gators have enjoyed needling
Tennessee. Coach
 &UR; Steve Spurrier has joked about the Volunteers' annual drive for a
Citrus Bowl bid, a jibe at Tennessee's failure to make it to the
Sugar Bowl as the SEC champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida has toned down the act this season. It was the
Gators, not the Volunteers, who played in the Citrus Bowl last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the Big House,'' Spurrier said of today's game
in Neyland Stadium. ``And we expect to be treated with a lot more
respect this year because we are now the defending Citrus Bowl
champions.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
 &UR; Kevin Gilbride Jr., the son of the San Diego Chargers coach, is a
freshman quarterback at Brigham Young. Gilbride, who played at a
Jacksonville, Fla., high school, was one of the top-rated prep
quarterbacks in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State Coach  &UR; Bobby Bowden blamed himself for quarterback
 &UR; Chris Weinke's poor performance in a loss to North Carolina State
last week. Weinke, a 26-year-old sophomore, was 9 for 32 and threw
five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've loaded him down like he's a senior, and he's not, which
he showed,'' Bowden said. &QL;

   The Pac-10 has its share of show stoppers. In  &UR; Paul Hackett's
mind, no one is better than Southern California's  &UR; R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most exciting player in college football,'' the
Trojans coach said. ``We're only one game into our season. Just
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   What separates Soward is his propensity to get into the end
zone. He scores once every 5{ times he touches the ball. In the
22nd game of his career Saturday, against San Diego State, he
scored three touchdowns and rolled up 256 yards on nine plays. The
scores came on receptions of 8 and 53 yards and a 74-yard punt
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not enough,'' the junior said. ``My mind-set is that I
should score every time I touch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference has an array of exciting players, including ASU's
 &UR; J.R.
 &UR; Redmond and Arizona's  &UR; Dennis Northcutt, who can rack up yards. One
of the most interesting individual races in the league will be that
for leader in all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska Coach  &UR; Frank Solich didn't win any friends in Berkeley
with his decision to kick a meaningless field goal with 19 seconds
remaining last weekend. The Cornhuskers were up, 21-3, at that
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was chicken (bleep),'' Bears safety  &UR; Marquis Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Solich said afterward he wouldn't do it again if put in the same
situation. &QL; 
On the rise &QL; 
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   By closing the 1997 season with four straight wins, the Wildcats
sent a message. Opening 1998 with two more was significant.
</P>
<P>
   The roughest part of their schedule will come in early October
with games against UCLA and Washington. &QL; 
On the decline &QL; 
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook isn't good for the Cardinal, which lost its opener
to San Jose State, 35-23, and fell to Arizona, 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   Five of its next seven games could be against ranked teams. &QL; 
Quote of the week &QL; 
``They did to ASU what we wanted to do to them defensively but
couldn't get done,'' Washington linebacker  &UR; Todd Johnson said about
Brigham Young, which will visit the Huskies today. &QL; 
Parting shots &QL; 
Linebacker  &UR; Anthony Kelly, one of the top recruits in Washington's
1998 class, has been granted a waiver by the NCAA and may practice
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   California has decided to redshirt wide receiver  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Ainsworth, who has been slowed by a deep thigh bruise. &QL;

SENATE NARROWLY FAILS TO OVERRIDE VETO ON `PARTIAL BIRTH'
ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in two years, the Senate on
Friday failed to override President Clinton's veto of a ban on a
late-term abortion procedure that opponents call partial birth. The
vote was 64-36, three shy of the two-thirds needed to override.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate, the graphic charts, the anecdotal stories and
the vote itself were familiar, the stark mathematics of the
November elections loomed large over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The most politically vulnerable Democratic senators _ Carol
Moseley-Braun of Illinois, Barbara Boxer of California and Patty
Murray of Washington _ are all fierce supporters of abortion
rights. Abortion opponents hope to pick up those seats and tip the
balance in the Senate to enact the partial-birth ban.
</P>
<P>
   Since the House has twice overridden the president's veto with
votes to spare, both sides have taken their struggle to the Senate.
The loss of these three senators could cost the president his
protection on a policy that has kept many liberal women steadfastly
in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who has led the charge for the ban,
described during the debate the importance of picking up those
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three votes in the U.S. Senate separate us from what I believe
is a clarion call to the world that we are a civilized country that
respects life,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, a lobbyist for the National Right to Life
Committee, said his side expected a net gain in November of at
least three senators who would vote with abortion opponents on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, was also looking toward
November, with more nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has been extremely good in advancing women's
policies,'' said Ms. Michelman, who conceded that even advocates of
abortion rights had been ``demoralized'' by the president's
involvement with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. ``We
have to convince people that these elections aren't about the
president; they are about their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Friday's vote marked the 97th abortion-related
vote in Congress since the Republicans took control four years ago,
and that advocates of abortion rights had lost all but 13.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a New York-based group that fights for abortion rights
through the courts, said the political climate made Friday's
victory a difficult one. On one side, she said, was an $800,000
advertising campaign by abortion opponents to convert the votes of
five senators. On the other was the weakened hand of some of the
Senate's most reliable abortion-rights advocates and the
president's perceived political weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in tight races didn't give this real aggressive
leadership this time, frankly,'' Ms. Benshoof said. ``And the
president has not been calling senators and twisting their arms. He
has a lot of chits to call in to save himself from impeachment _
you think he's going to call them in on this?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday's vote was staged by Republican leaders, not with the
expectation that they were going to win, but to coincide with the
annual gathering here of the Christian Coalition, which is drawing
up plans on how to galvanize its base of conservative voters for
the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their loss Friday, abortion opponents have found that
their graphic descriptions of the late-term procedure, which they
call infanticide, has proved an enormously successful strategy for
advancing their cause on otherwise stable political terrain. As
abortion opponents describe the procedure, a fetus is partly
delivered feet first, then the brains are suctioned out so that the
skull can be collapsed and the head delivered the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the ban say that the phrase ``partial-birth
abortion'' does not refer to a defined medical procedure, and is
instead intended to inflame emotions. But by highlighting this
method, they say, abortion opponents have won over some advocates
of abortion rights and have helped cast those who want to keep the
procedure legal as the extremists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the abortion opponents' central tenets is that as long as
Clinton is in the White House, the best chance they have of banning
the procedure is through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope,'' Sen. Daniel Coats, R-Ind., said after
Friday's vote, ``that the American people will choose to elect
representatives this year who will continue to fight for the
preservation of the ideals of life and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the lack of action by Congress, abortion
opponents in 25 states have successfully enacted bans similar to
the proposed federal legislation. But some uncertainty remains over
their constitutionality, and courts have blocked them in 18 states,
citing vagueness and an overly broad reach. Cases from several
states are headed toward the Supreme Court, which has yet to rule
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's debate followed the by-now familiar contours of the
seven others that have preceded it, four in the House and three in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents offered charts that emphasize the gruesomeness of the
procedure and said it was performed far more often and earlier in
pregnancy than advocates admitted. Supporters of abortion rights
served up the personal stories of women who said that they needed
the procedure to save their lives or future fertility and that the
ban was unconstitutional because it did not protect a woman's
health.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ban allows an exception to save the life of the
woman, but the president has cited its lack of an exception for the
health of the woman as his reason for vetoing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who is a medical doctor and who voted
to override the veto, said the procedure should never be performed
``because it is needlessly risky to the woman, because it is an
unnecessary procedure, because it is inhumane to the fetus, and
because it is medically unacceptable and offends the very basic
civil sensibilities of people all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boxer, speaking against the ban, said that a ban would be
dangerous because it would not protect a woman's health and because
it would allow unwarranted government intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No woman wants to walk into her doctor's office,'' she said,
``and see a sign that says, `Warning: Senate interference in your
doctor's decisions may be hazardous to your health.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., closed the debate by quoting
broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow. ``He would say, `There are
not two sides to every story,''' Brownback said. ``There are not
two sides to this story. Partial-birth abortion must be banned.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting to override Clinton were 51 Republicans and 13 Democrats.
Voting to sustain his veto were 32 Democrats and four Republicans.

NAU FACES CHALLENGE

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ A major test awaits Northern Arizona's
football team tonight as it attempts to win its third straight game
under new Coach Jerome Souers.
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't so much whether the Lumberjacks (2-0) can
beat California State-Northridge (0-1) in a Big Sky Conference
opener at 6:05 p.m. at Walkup Skydome. The bigger picture focuses
on how the Lumberjacks will respond without quarterback Travis
Brown. He dislocated his left (non-throwing) elbow last week
against Southwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Brown, who entered the game in the fourth quarter, was 5
for 7 for 115 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Brown, a junior who crossed the 7,000-yard mark in
passing last week, will be assessed a week at time, Souers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a stabilizing factor on offense,'' Souers said.
``We were just starting to jell. But we've got to channel our
energy to do the same with Clay. We're banking on him.''
</P>
<P>
   If the new quarterback can get the ball into the hands of
receivers Francis St. Paul and Dion Black, he should put up some
big numbers. St. Paul is coming off national and conference honors
for his three-touchdown, 204-yard performance. It was Black's
circus catch that got the NAU offense into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks are ranked No. 13 in the Sports Network poll and
tied for No. 13 with Montana in the ESPN/USA Today poll. &QL;

SPINKS PUTS `JINXS' ON TUCSON'S SUAZO

   LAS VEGAS _ The son has all his front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, there's not much that separates  &UR; Cory Spinks
from his dad,
 &UR; Leon, best-known for a famous upset of  &UR; Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   There's the fluid ring style with occasional power from wild
hooks that seem to circle the building before they land. And
there's the nickname:
</P>
<P>
   The Jinxs.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Spinks spells it with an `S' on the back of his robe.
Presumably, he wants everybody to know he's capable of casting more
than one bad spell.
</P>
<P>
   One was enough for Tucson junior welterweight  &UR; Lupe Suazo on
Friday during a non-televised bout before  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya's
victory over  &UR; Julio Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo (4-2, 4 knockouts) got the jinx. Spinks (11-0, 3 KOs) got
the win. The decision got the boos.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges scored against Suazo, who won the national
amateur championship in 1993 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo was the aggressor throughout, but he was bloodied and
bruised near the left eye by Spinks' hooks. &QL; 
The populist's price &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is called the people's champ. His managers invested
$100,000 of his $6 million purse on tickets for fans and friends.
Lots of fans. Lots of friends. The people's champ knows how to keep
his corner populated. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Mike Tyson was in town. He will appear today at a Nevada
Athletic Commission hearing on reinstatement of his license. But he
wasn't at ringside Friday night.

dinner.

</P>
<P>

GETTING BACK ON TRACK  
 RACER RECOVERS FROM ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This is what David Birmingham Jr. remembers of May 27,
1995:
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember leading most of the trophy dash and finishing
second,'' Birmingham said. ``I remember being mad about that. The
next thing I remember is being at the hospital on a Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash, however, occurred 72 hours earlier, on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a horrible accident.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing leader Dan Fredenburg in a midget heat race at
Manzanita Speedway, Birmingham was attempting to make a pass for
the lead. But Birmingham misjudged the distance separating the two
vehicles and struck Fredenburg's right rear tire with his car's
left front tire.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Birmingham's racer was sent into an uncontrollable
series of violent flips, six in all. When the machine landed
upright with a devastating thump after the final flip, Birmingham
was slumped over the steering wheel and unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was out 10 to 15 minutes,'' said Birmingham, who,
despite wearing a helmet, suffered a laceration near the top of his
head that required two large staples to close. ``But I don't
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Birmingham was released from the hospital within six
days, it could have been worse. In addition to the head injury,
which was serious enough to warrant an induced coma, Birmingham
suffered a badly broken left arm and a dislocated left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, now 31, wasn't issued a physician's release to
resume racing for almost a year after the crash. Then it was
another year before he finally climbed behind the steering wheel
again.
</P>
<P>
   But since returning to the Arizona Midget Racing Association
circuit in April 1997, Birmingham has been on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham notched career midget win No. 1 last August in Show
Low and finished third in the final driver standings, despite
missing several races.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham has added two more wins this season and likely will
finish runner-up in the championship standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started racing midgets in about 1989 or so, but before the
accident, I'd never won a race or finished way up in the
standings,'' Birmingham said. ``I really think I've become a better
racer since the crash because I'm smarter now. I'm more patient,
more willing to wait for my opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   And more determined than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were at the hospital and we knew after a couple of
days that he (David) would be all right, my friends would say to
me, `You can't let him race again. Make him not want to start back
up,' '' said Dayna Birmingham, who married her husband only six
weeks before the accident. ``I said, `If I do that, we'll have to
get him a blood transfusion, because racing's in his blood.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that when I married him. His dad raced and owned race
cars, and it's all David has done.''
</P>
<P>
   David Birmingham Sr., David's father, owned midget race cars
that drivers such as Jerry McClung and the late Bobby Ball drove.
The elder Birmingham, who, like Dayna, was at the race in which his
son was injured, said the crash reminded him of a wreck nearly
three decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McClung) was my driver, and we were at (Corona, Calif. in
1971),'' Birmingham Sr. said. ``There was an accident and Danny
Caruthers died. When I saw David's crash, it scared me. They were
so similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver Mark Passerrelli was the first to arrive at Birmingham's
wrecked car and immediately took control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was starting to turn blue,'' Passerrelli said. ``I told
(the paramedics) we need to get a helicopter out here now. When we
got him out of the car and on the stretcher, he woke up. He doesn't
remember this, but he started kicking and screaming. He didn't want
to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham eventually went to the front of the midget class.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's a good racer,'' said Passerrelli, a multiple midget
champion. ``I think before the accident, he was intimidated by
drivers like myself. He's not that way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I'm beside another driver or someone's coming up right
behind me, no matter how good they are, to me they're just another
driver,'' Birmingham said. ``I used to think I had to try and
impress other racers. I think that's what happened the night I
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember feeling like I should have won that trophy dash,
and then when it came to the heat race, I think I was trying to
prove something to people. It forced me to make a misjudgement, and
look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was bad. But at least Birmingham doesn't
remember. &QL;

TIRE AGENTS STILL AROUSE SUSPICIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A powerful motor and an aerodynamically sleek chassis would be
useless if fitted with slippery tires.
</P>
<P>
   It would be like  &UR; Mark McGwire or  &UR; Sammy Sosa whaling away at a
 &UR; Randy
 &UR; Johnson fastball with an extra-long summer sausage.
</P>
<P>
   This simple fact prompted drag racer  &UR; Tom Vosnick to invent a
chemical solution 20 years ago that, when applied to fresh rubber,
made tires more sticky than they were already.
</P>
<P>
   Vosnick called it ``Formula V Traction Treatment,'' and he still
sells it today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tire softeners have been in the news lately, but I call my
product a tire freshener,'' said Vosnick, whose Advanced Automotive
Inc. is based in McKeesport, Pa. ``My product enhances the rubber
and makes it fresher and stickier. It took me four years to develop
it, but it's amazing what it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What it can do is help give drivers an edge on the track, which
is what NASCAR Winston Cup car owner  &UR; Jack Roush claimed may have
been what helped rival driver  &UR; Jeff Gordon fend off the field over
the final 50 laps of a recent race when he took on only two tires
during a final pit stop when almost everyone else slapped on four.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing theory is that tire softeners or fresheners
lose their advantage after a few laps, which is why former racer
 &UR; Dean Borchert of Chandler used such products only during
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on sometimes when I was qualifying'' for a NASCAR
Southwest Tour race, Borchert said. ``When you first come out on
the racetrack on cold tires, it takes several laps to bring them up
to temperature. By using this stuff, it bridged that gap. It gives
you a good jump on the competition because it's giving you the
adhesion immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon's tires were impounded by NASCAR officials and
sent to an unknown chemical laboratory, where tests results showed
no illegal substances or wrongdoing, Borchert said it doesn't prove
anything.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are ``useless unless you know what you're looking
for,'' Borchert said. ``It's a hard thing to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosnick doesn't claim his product is undetectable when placed
under a microscope. But he knows of several lab tests performed on
tires laced with his product that were returned negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sense there's something there, but they can't prove it,''
Vosnick said. ``I do know that practically every (short-track)
record in North Carolina was set with my product.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosnick's product sells for $24.95 a gallon, and when applied
correctly, there is enough to treat about eight tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally recommend putting on three to four coats a day for
three days in a row, then letting them sit for two to four days,''
Vosnick said. ``Most tire softeners will (lose their effectiveness)
within 10 laps or so, but I know some (Winston Cup) teams tested my
product at Martinsville (Speedway in North Carolina) and went 120
laps.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the controversy, NASCAR recently changed its
policy of releasing race-day tires on the morning of a race. Now
teams receive the tires about an hour before the green flag. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL;

CHAVEZ HITS, THEN QUITS AGAINST DE LA HOYA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As unbelievable as it sounds, Julio Cesar Chavez had
Oscar De La Hoya right where he wanted him Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In an unforgettable eighth round, the two traded punches with no
regard to their well being _ drawing a screaming, pro-Chavez crowd
of 17,715 at Thomas &AMP; Mack Center to its feet _ and it was the
aging former champion who seemed to be in better condition when it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if a remarkable eight rounds meant absolutely
nothing, Chavez quit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sport's great champions, his head bowed, blood
dripping from a deep cut inside his mouth and his opponent in
apparent trouble, in effect borrowed an infamous phrase from
Roberto Duran as he sat on his stool: (begin ital)No mas(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   It was an inglorious finish to an otherwise glorious effort.
</P>
<P>
   As for De La Hoya, he got the job done: He retained his WBC
welterweight title and remained undefeated (29-0, with 24
knockouts).
</P>
<P>
   However, he didn't dominate his 36-year-old opponent (101-3-2,
84 KOs) as he had hoped and as almost everyone expected. He fought
Chavez's fight much of the time, engaging in many toe-to-toe
exchanges in an apparent effort to get that knockout he so wanted,
and took unnecessary punishment as a result.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, 25, was ahead on all three cards, but it wasn't
one-sided: 79-73, 78-75, 78-75.
</P>
<P>
   And he never came close to that knockout, the knockout that
would force Chavez to give him the credit he refused to give him
after their first bout (in 1996) was stopped with Chavez cut above
the left eye in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, De La Hoya landed plenty of power punches and Chavez felt
them. However, he was never hurt and he never stopped coming.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Chavez said, ``You did it, you did it'' as the two
embraced in the ring and later added, ``He's a great fighter,'' but
it had to be half-hearted: Had he not given up, it seemed, it
could've been Chavez who did it.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which the fight ended was satisfactory consolation
for De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wont' quit. I'll fight to the end,'' he said in a
not-so-veiled reference to Chavez's decision to give up, and then
added: ``He said, `You beat me. I don't want no more' and quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more satisfied that he quit on me.''
</P>
<P>
   With great courage, De La Hoya disregarded his corner's advice
to keep his distance almost from the start.
</P>
<P>
   He controlled the fight when he stayed on the outside and
could've won easily that way. However, he refused to stay there: He
couldn't resist the urge to prove he could beat Chavez at his own
game.
</P>
<P>
   And, while De La Hoya also never was hurt, he might have paid a
very expensive price had Chavez landed a key punch here or there.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of so many, Chavez, who suffered inconsequential
cuts over both eyes, looked much like the Chavez of old and proved
that he has plenty left. De La Hoya's co-trainer, Gil Clancy, said,
``We beat the Chavez of old. Chavez was the best we've seen in five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges were both as thrilling and shocking as any seen in
this town in some time.
</P>
<P>
   And it all culminated in that unforgettable eighth, when De La
Hoya in effect said, ``What the heck? It's me or him,'' and the two
wailed away and repeatedly made contact. A buzzing crowd couldn't
wait for the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was no next round.
</P>
<P>
   When the fight was stopped, De La Hoya leaped in the air to
indicate his joy but he also had to be relieved. He had engaged in
the toughest fight of his career.
</P>
<P>
   At the post-fight press conference, Chavez said, ``I want to
make one thing clear: My corner stopped the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   However, replays of Chavez sitting on his stool appeared to show
him shaking his head as he was asked whether he wanted to continue.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya dismissed those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it at all. Believe me when I tell you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it was fortunate for De La Hoya that Chavez didn't
get up.
</P>
<P>
   The champion will next face Ike Quartey, the former WBA
welterweight champ who many believed would be his first legitimate
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chavez was that legitimate challenger, at least until
he decided he couldn't take it any more and spoiled what might've
been one of the sport's great performances.
</P>
<P>
   In other fights, Yory Boy Campas (72-2, 62 KOs) retained his IBF
junior middleweight championship when his one-sided fight with
Larry Barnes (44-3, 17 KOs) was stopped after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mia St. John (8-0, 5 KOs) of Calabasas remained undefeated,
narrowly outpointing B.J. Felter (0-3) in a four-round
featherweight women's bout.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Diaz (23-2, 18 KOs) of Coachella stopped Hector Quiroz
(25-3-1, 21 KOs) at 1:05 of the 12th and final round of a junior
lightweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   And Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch (39-1-1, 29 KOs) knocked out Troy
Roberts (14-7, 13 KOs) 41 seconds into the third round of a
scheduled four-round heavyweight bout.

OSCAR'S NIGHT ANYTHING BUT EASY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As expected, Oscar De La Hoya methodically beat up
Julio Cesar Chavez Friday night, bruising his face, slicing his
left eye, and cutting his lip so badly that the blood flowing out
of Chavez's mouth forced him into a reluctant surrender after the
eighth round.
</P>
<P>
   But what was not expected was what Julio Cesar Chavez did inside
that boxing ring for 24 frantic minutes against De La Hoya before
his injuries put an end to a most gallant performance.
</P>
<P>
   What was not expected was that Chavez, supposedly too old,
supposedly too soft, supposedly in it for the $6 million payday,
would wind up posing a most serious challenge to De La Hoya before
17,125 thrilled spectators at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   What was not expected was that 36-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez
would reach back into his legendary past and somehow extricate long
missing skills to give Oscar De La Hoya the most exhaustive and
perilous fight of his dazzling young career.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, Oscar De La Hoya is still the Golden Boy, still the WBC
welterweight champion, still his sport's greatest gate attraction
until Mike Tyson returns.
</P>
<P>
   But on this memorable evening in Las Vegas, in a fight that was
expected to be a breeze for him, De La Hoya found himself in a
fearsome debate from the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   This time he wasn't exchanging punches with a Patrick
Charpentier, or a Macho Camacho, or a Wilfredo Rivera or any of the
other bums that his promoter, Bob Arum, has been lining up for him
in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   This time he actually found himself in a legitimate fight
against a motivated opponent determined to prove that he still had
some magic left in his vast repertoire of tricks and punches.
</P>
<P>
   And Julio Cesar Chavez unleashed all of them against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   He charged De La Hoya relentlessly throughout the match, and hit
him with savage body shots, including a low blow in the third round
that drew a stern warning from the referee, Dick Steele, and a
vehement protest from De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   He fired one right hand after another at De La Hoya, and had the
audience in a constant uproar with his valiant resolve.
</P>
<P>
   He turned the eighth round into the most memorable seen in this
building since that epic 10th round of the first Evander
Holyfield-Riddick Bowe fight, standing there with his younger,
bigger, stronger but not more courageous rival and attempting to
answer De La Hoya's wicked combinations with those of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were standing and cheering wildly because Julio Cesar
Chavez was performing like the fighter who had once been such a
dominant figure in his mean occupation.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a reflection of Oscar De La Hoya's emerging greatness
that he still was able to handle everything that Chavez threw at
him and Chavez threw 346 punches at him and connected on 162 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya still was able to catch Chavez with an assortment of
jabs, uppercuts, left hooks and straight right hands that, at the
finish, left Chavez a battered heap unable to answer the call for
the ninth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got what I wanted ... I made Chavez quit,'' said De La Hoya,
and Chavez indeed did quit after that torrid eighth round in which
the two fellows threw a remarkable 173 punches at each other.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Julio Cesar Chavez quit with honor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was no reason for him to continue, inasmuch as
De La Hoya's stinging punches had ripped open those cuts on his
swollen face and inasmuch as he faced only certain doom in the
remaining rounds.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt in the closing moments that Oscar De La Hoya
was getting stronger, and Julio Cesar Chavez was getting weaker.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need for Chavez to be humiliated on a night in
which he conducted himself with such fistic dignity.
</P>
<P>
   I had him winning only one round in the fight I thought the
opening round was even and had De La Hoya ahead by a 79-73 count
when Chavez called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my corner that stopped it,'' said Chavez afterward.
``De La Hoya beat me this time. But he's not a knockout puncher.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya might not be a knockout puncher against Chavez,
but I doubt if anyone in the welterweight division would be able to
knock out the granite-jawed Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it took Chavez to bring out the best in De La Hoya,
and the 25-year-old 1992 Olympic gold medal winner from East L.A.
certainly rose to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he rose too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he was too hyper, too energetic for his own good
against Chavez in the early rounds, choosing to brawl with him
instead of moving and bobbing and taking advantage of his far
superior jabs and quickness.
</P>
<P>
   But once he settled down, De La Hoya took total command, even
though Chavez never stopped coming forward and never stopped
throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya would throw more he wound up throwing 517
punches and connecting on 254 and would wind up proving that he
reacts quite nobly in adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought just the opposite of how I should have fought at
least at the beginning,'' said De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   He did, but it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya is a terrific fighter who probably will beat
Ike Quartey when they meet in November, and will probably beat all
the other heralded welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   It took a terrific fighter to beat an inspired Julio Cesar
Chavez Friday night.

DODGERS' HOPES OFFICIALLY END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Dodgers could have gone quietly, the way
they had all season.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night they were eliminated from the National League
wild-card race, the Dodgers finally decided to play it tough
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Barry Bonds homered to open the eighth inning
off Scott Radinsky that the Dodgers' season mathematically ended
with a 4-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants in front of 31,452 at
3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing that the wild-card race is over for
us,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``But I will never fault the
effort of this team. Barry Bonds has beaten a few teams like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bonds, honored before the game as baseball's first player to
reach 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases, it was his 35th homer of
the year and 409th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, it was the same sad refrain. They took the
lead, lost an important player _ in this case, starter Dave Mlicki
to injury _ then watched the game slip away.
</P>
<P>
   This one had none of the classic overtures of this storied
rivalry, no fights in the stands, no pennant races to decide. But
in a season of unfamiliar faces, the Dodgers were hoping to see
more of Mlicki, who left the game in the sixth with lower back
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki first experienced discomfort in his lower back during his
previous start in San Diego, an 8-7 loss last Saturday. He tweaked
it batting in the top of the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not serious, but I just couldn't go on,'' Mlicki said.
``I first felt it in the third. I have one more start and I'm going
to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Mlicki left that the Giants tied the game at 3-3
with a seventh-inning pinch single by Marvin Bernard off Radinsky
(6-6) that scored Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   With Bonds' homer, the Giants now are four games behind the
wild-card leading Chicago Cubs and three back of the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave the victory to Julian Tavares (5-3), who pitched a
scoreless eighth. Robb Nen pitched a scoreless for his 38th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was appropriate that Barry has such a big night on his
night,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``He started some
rallies, he completed some rallies, and that big home run against a
tough lefty was primo.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered to Mlicki, who hopes to make his next
start Thursday against the Milwaukee Brewers. Mlicki is already
under contract ($2.25 million) for 1999, but already is best known
as the pitcher stolen in the Hideo Nomo deal, Fred Claire's last
trade as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   After Claire was fired, interim GM Tom Lasorda sent Greg
McMichael back to the Mets for left-hander Brian Bohanon. Mlicki
and Bohanon have re-established careers with the Dodgers that were
floundering in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a great addition for this team,'' Hoffman said. ``It
would have been great to see him continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki first strained is back swinging the bat in the sixth
inning when he flied to the right-field warning track. He struck
out Ellis Burks to open the Giants sixth, but then gave up a double
to Bonds off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi made it a close play when his strong throw just
missed getting Bonds and punched the air in disgust. So did Hoffman
when Jeff Kent followed with his second RBI double to cut the lead
to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki clutched his lower back as pitching coach Charlie Hough
came to the mound. The Dodgers turned to rookie left-hander Jeff
Kubenka, who won his first major-league game Sept. 8 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants pinch hit Joe Carter for J.T. Snow and Carter flied
to medium center. Roger Cedeno made the catch and Kent made an
ill-advised attempt to take third. Cedeno threw him out easily to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were back at in the seventh when Kubenka walked Hayes
to open the inning. Hayes was sacrificed to second and went to
third on Rich Aurelia's ground single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka came back to strike out pinch hitter Chris Jones before
giving way to the veteran Radinsky, who gave up the game tying
single to pinch hitter Bernard.

ANGELS FALL TWO BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Angels manager Terry Collins said before Friday
night's game with Seattle that the last thing he would tell his
team was ``We have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bull,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But down by one game in the AL West with with 10 play and a
Texas win already posted on the scoreboard, Collins didn't have to
tell his team it (begin ital)had(end ital) to win.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' managing in a 5-3, 12-inning loss before 39,992 at
Edison Field spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Collins yanked his starter (Ken Hill) after 32/3 innings when
Alex Rodriguez came to bat with two on and two out. He took out
Jason Dickson, who had retired all 11 batters he had faced, when
Ken Griffey Jr. came to the plate in the eighth. And in the most
telling move of the evening, he brought closer Troy Percival in to
face Edgar Martinez with two outs in the eighth inning of a 3-3
game.
</P>
<P>
   Collins pinch-ran for his best hitter (Tim Salmon) in the ninth,
brought in Rich DeLucia to face Rodriguez after Jarrod Washburn had
retired the first two hitters in the 10th. After the Angels fell
behind in the 12th, he even allowed crippled Darin Erstad to
pinch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' bullpen responded to its challenge by retiring 22
straight hitters between the fourth and 12th innings, but once
Seattle broke the spell, the Mariners drove across two runs to drop
the Angels two games behind the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter David Segui doubled in the go-ahead run off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Rodriguez singled in an insurance run off
the Angels reliever. DeLucia, who opened the inning by walking
Raoul Ibanez, was the loser. Mike Timlin pitched two scoreless
innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullpen could hardly be blamed for another heartbreaking
Angels loss. Five pitchers combined for seven one-two-three
innings, but the Anaheim offense was almost as futile against the
notoriously suspect Seattle bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim managed only five hits after the fourth inning. It did
put runners in scoring position in both the 10th and 11th, but
neither Orlando Palmeiro nor Garret Anderson could get them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score. There is nothing more to say,'' said
Angels manager Terry Collins. ``The bullpen did a tremendous job.
We have got to remain optimistic and not worry about what the
Rangers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play with the same desire and heart and it's not good
enough, it's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival, who has been known to struggle in non-save situations,
didn't waver on Friday, striking out three of the four batters he
faced. After retiring the 16th consecutive Seattle batter in the
ninth inning, Percival left the field waving his arms, imploring
the home crowd for more support.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did in Texas on Thursday, the Angels got off to a
fast start.
</P>
<P>
   After Palmeiro flied out to lead off the bottom of the first
inning, Anaheim put together four consecutive hits, good for two
runs. Jim Edmonds drove in Randy Velarde with a double into the
right-field corner and Gregg Jefferies' single scored Edmonds. The
inning might have been bigger, but Seattle starter Ken Cloude got
Anderson to pop up and Matt Walbeck to strike out with runners on
first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Once again an Angels lead didn't last long. Seattle tied the
game 2-2 in the top of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who had retired the side in order in the first, gave up a
double to Martinez and a single to Ibanez to open the inning. Hill
nearly got out of the jam by striking out the next two hitters but
was touched up for a two-run double by Ryan Radmanovich. The
Seattle right fielder came into the game hitting .167 with five
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 3-2 lead in the third on another two-out hit off
Hill. Martinez picked up his 98th RBI of the season when he singled
in David Bell, who had doubled with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude couldn't stand prosperity either as he grooved a 1-1
fastball to Edmonds leading off the Angels' third. The Anaheim
center fielder, who hit .360 on the road trip, deposited the
mistake into the right-field bleachers for his 24th home run of the
season.

 &HT;      BOEHNER: CLINTON SHOULD CONSIDER RESIGNING
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- An ideological and political opponent of
the Clinton administration since its first days, Congressman John
Boehner said he is disturbed by the allegations surrounding the
president and believes the public would be best served if Clinton
left office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the West Chester Republican will not publicly call for
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this drags out, the worse it is for the country,''
Boehner said. ``I am deeply troubled by the seriousness of the
charges against the president. ... The president should consider
doing the honorable thing at this point, which is to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other members of the House of Representatives,
Boehner will not request Clinton step down. Instead, he will allow
the president to make that political calculation for himself while
Congress moves forward with impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should consider resigning for the good of the
county. It would certainly make it easier for Congress to move
forward with what we were elected to do if we didn't have to deal
with this. But I am not calling for it,'' Boehner insisted.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the House Republican leadership, Boehner predicted
the House will vote in early October to authorize the House
Judiciary Committee to begin an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   If the House Judiciary Committee determines the charges brought
against the president merit impeachment, the entire House would
then vote before a trial is conducted in the Senate. Sixty-seven of
the 100 Senators would have to vote for impeachment before
President Clinton is removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee members would begin with, but would not be
limited to, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report against the
president. The 445-page document cites 11 charges as grounds for
impeachment. Starr's report was accompanied to the Capitol by
thousands of pages of supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Clinton fall under three categories: perjury
before a grand jury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of the power
of the office of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report to Congress is a prosecutor's case, and Clinton's
lawyers have not yet had a legal forum to refute it.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorneys claim he has not broken any laws. They
admit that while Clinton's behavior with former intern Monica
Lewinsky was inappropriate and unethical, he has not committed any
misdeeds worthy of forcing his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is the special prosecutor has sent a report to
Congress that makes a credible case for impeachment. I am deeply
troubled by the seriousness of the allegations and the detail in
the description of the charges,'' Boehner said. ``All of these
charges, if proven, are grounds for impeachment. ... We are talking
about the rule of law here, and every American is subject to the
law -- even the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress are not being as cautious in their
criticism of the president. More than 50 congressmen -- including
Ohio Republicans David L. Hobson and John R. Kasich -- have already
called for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner said he does not have a problem with their pleas because
he sees a difference between urging the president to step down and
saying the president should be impeached. The latter would imply a
congressman had prejudged the president's guilt before reviewing
the relevant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Republican leadership is urging members to be
``judicious and statesmanlike'' in their comments.
</P>
<P>
   While the headlines coming out of Washington are dominated by
Clinton's troubles and talk of impeachment hearings, Boehner said
Republicans have not lost track of their legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to show the country we are still doing their
work,'' he said, pointing out that most congressmen are working on
legislation even while the country is caught up in impeachment
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a unique responsibility to show the American people
that we can still do our jobs. It is very important, given all the
confusion, that we be businesslike,'' Boehner said.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions to publicly release Starr's report and to air the
president's videotaped testimony have drawn serious Democratic
opposition and created their own controversies. But Boehner said
both were good choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to release a report to 435 members of the
House and their 5,000 staffers, then the public and the media are
going to have it an hour later,'' he rationalized. ``It was going
to get out there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The American people also have a right to determine for
themselves what is in the report and on the tapes, Boehner added.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Given the sheer volume of energy expended in
weighing President Clinton's fate, given Washington's horrified
fascination with every tawdry detail of his behavior, it would be
easy to assume that the machinery of government and policy-making
has ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   But on Capitol Hill last week, the Republican-controlled
Congress began consideration of a tax cut, renewed its efforts to
limit some late-term abortions, started wrapping up the spending
bills needed to keep the federal government operating and pushed
ahead with an overhaul of the bankruptcy system.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled though he may be, Clinton set in motion an international
effort to contain the financial crisis that began last year in
Asia, considered a plea from the Pentagon for more money, received
a report from his advisory commission on race and directed that the
government purchase only recycled paper.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly business as usual, and the effect of Clinton's
woes on Washington will only grow with each congressional move
toward impeachment. At risk in particular are efforts to set the
nation's course on big, evolving issues that require strong
presidential leadership, like shoring up Social Security or dealing
decisively with ethnic conflicts and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some administration officials admit that it is all but
impossible to get the attention of the president or top White House
staff, boding ill for any policy initiatives working their way up
the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government has tremendous momentum, and even in
times of war and political crisis it has a way of grinding
relentlessly on. Moreover, the very threat of drift and paralysis
in this case has provided both parties with tremendous incentive to
keep pushing a substantive agenda _ maybe even to push harder than
they would otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, confronting an electorate impatient with rabidly
partisan politics and uncertain about how Clinton's transgressions
should be punished, are hedging their bets; even as they turn up
the heat on the president, they are taking every opportunity to
tout their social and economic initiatives and their focus on the
people's business.
</P>
<P>
   Eager as well to probe for weakened resolve and cohesion among
Democrats, Republicans have also decided to see what happens if
they press on issues they had earlier given up on, most notably a
tax cut this year.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton said he should not be ``trying to obscure
my own personal acknowledgment and chagrin about what I did
wrong.'' But it does not take a ``Wag the Dog'' scenario for a
president to change the subject, as Clinton well knows, and last
week he was clearly taking the opportunity to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Halting the spread of the Asian financial crisis, he said, ``is
about the most important issue facing the world community.'' The
Republican plan to finance tax cuts by dipping into projected
budget surpluses could endanger the nation's fiscal health and
undermine efforts to shore up the Social Security system, he said,
fairly spoiling for an ideological, pre-election fight that could
help unify his demoralized party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Clinton, the situation creates a paradox. The more he
talks about issues, the greater the sense that he is deliberately
diverting attention from his own problems. Even pressing matters,
like striking back at terrorists or protecting the nation's long
economic expansion, can seem props in his personal drama.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Washington remember going down this route before.
Consumed by Watergate in 1973-1974, the nation floundered in many
ways, not least in addressing the economic turmoil set off by the
Arab oil embargo. Congress nonetheless found time to raise the
minimum wage, limit school busing and establish federal financing
of election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I was astounded at the resiliency both of the
government and of the people,'' said Bill Frenzel, who was a
second-term Republican congressman from Minnesota in 1974 and
served in the House until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government did not fall down, and actually most decisions
that people could see and feel were made and the government went
right on operating and doing a reasonable job of it,'' he said. ``I
would say it's going to be similar this time. That is, we're at
risk of falling behind in foreign policy, trade and security, but
the things that people see and touch every day will reveal to them
an operating government that's doing just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Washington is a slave to the calendar. The
government's new fiscal year will start Oct. 1 regardless of
Clinton's troubles, and that means Congress and the administration
have to agree on 13 spending bills, many of which are ideological
battlegrounds, in the next few weeks. Presidential vetoes seem
likely, and a partial shutdown of the government is not out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment proceedings aside, Republicans were already on the
defensive over Democratic complaints that this has been a
do-nothing Congress, intent on little more than killing initiatives
like tobacco legislation and an overhaul of health care regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is an open question how much new policy will get a
hearing once the immediate issues are out of the way. Dana Mead,
the chairman of Tenneco Inc., a big manufacturer, was in Washington
last week talking to administration officials and members of
Congress about issues of concern to the Business Roundtable, an
organization of corporate chief executives that he heads.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, who watched Watergate unfold as a domestic-policy adviser
in the Nixon administration, came away wondering whether the White
House and Congress would be able to take on any but the most
pressing issues, especially if the impeachment process moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that they must do, things that are
important to their constituents or the national interest or both,''
Mead said. Beyond that, he said, the ``nice-to-do items'' will
languish and a kind of rationing of time and attention will kick
in.
</P>
<P>
   There is already evidence of that phenomenon at work. Democrats
despair that a weakened Clinton has been less effective than he
would have been otherwise in rallying support this fall for an
increase in the minimum wage and action on health care. The White
House spin machine, which made an art of promoting small-bore
policy initiatives, is now consumed with the president's day to day
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers within the administration and some politicians from
both sides of the aisle in Congress already admit to being
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   After the campaign-finance overhaul bill that he co-sponsored
suffered another procedural defeat earlier this month, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., was asked if he would continue bringing up the
bill in the hopes of creating more pressure for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as long as the president has got the problems he has,''
McCain said. ``We don't talk about HMOs anymore, we don't talk
about taxes anymore, we don't talk about Social Security anymore.
There's only one thing on everybody's mind and everybody knows
it.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Speaker Newt Gingrich was hitting rock bottom
in facing the House's ethics reprimand last year, he resorted to a
time-honored insider technique: He reached out privately to one of
the capital's political ``wise men'' _ to an elder of the rival
Democrats known to offer stricken combatants confidential advice
beyond the bounds of partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got Gingrich together with Bob Strauss,'' recalled former
Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who, working the subtler ways of politics,
arranged for the Gingrich to break bread with Strauss, a
syrup-smooth, battle-scarred sage from President Jimmy Carter's era
who offered a recovery prescription of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Strauss, who has ranged over the years from
Democratic Party chairman to ambassadorial missions, was privately
called to the White House for advice in President Ronald Reagan's
confrontation with Congress over the Iran-Contra affair. He was
also summoned to join President George Bush's private gathering of
wise men, if only for reasons of bipartisan ritual, as the invasion
of Iraq loomed.
</P>
<P>
   So, then, with President Clinton now passing through the
political valley of darkness, surely he must be calling on Strauss
or some such capital elder to help find the best way out for both
himself and the nation, right?
</P>
<P>
   Weber, who is very close to Strauss, thinks not. ``I hate to say
it, but I wonder if this president has ever been willing to listen
to that sort of adviser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When in extremis in the Lewinsky sex scandal, Clinton has most
notably turned for advice to Harry Thomason, a figure from the
world of television entertainment. Late, great Democratic elders
ranging from New York Gov. W. Averell Harriman to Chicago Mayor
Richard Daley could only have been whirring in their graves.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, even as they wish for the half-measure solution
of a Brahmin-brokered censure of Clinton, sadly agree that the time
may have long since passed for summoning any of the Beltway's
fabled wise men. This is the informal cadre of emeritus politicians
and lawyers (historically, it's been a clubby men's preserve) who
occasionally drop by the city's floating political crap game at
critical moments, in between using their influence on behalf of
paying clients, to lend it some class and even a touch of realism.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a Republican wise man daring to approach the
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr early on with a plea about the
national interest amuses Democrats, who note that the special
prosecutor law gives free rein to Starr _ and that his circle of
party patrons features such anti-Clintonites as Sen. Lauch
Faircloth, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the president's overheated scandal of sex and
mendacity seems to be rattling down the congressional tracks toward
a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world in every way,'' said George
Stephanopoulos, once one of Clinton's strategists and now one of
his unyielding media critics. ``This wouldn't have happened in the
`wise men' days; they would have caught it before it got out,'' he
said, finding the predicament rooted not merely in Clinton's gross
excesses, but also in the demise of political parties with their
elders offering deep experience.
</P>
<P>
   This is a change brought about by modern politicians like
Clinton, driven by focus groups and personal fund-raising,
attracted more to short-run strategy wizards like Dick Morris than
to venerable mandarins. ``Having wise men is connected to the idea
that we have real parties,'' said Stephanopolous. ``But if
everybody is elected on his own, everybody lives or dies on his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``wise men'' approach faded during the Vietnam War, when
left and right exploited the anti-establishment backlash against
government by ``the best and the brightest.'' Right now, the need
of the president if not the nation for a bipartisan stretcher team
has rarely seemed clearer on Capitol Hill, where the impeachment
scandal is threatening to become a serial pageant about the sex
lives of the incumbent and righteous.
</P>
<P>
   Last week an adulterous affair from three decades ago suddenly
surfaced about the avuncular Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
congressman saddled with running the Clinton inquiry, who had been
universally lauded as a dispassionate model of fairness. Rumors of
further carnal outings of Republicans shook their ranks even as
they voted on partisan lines Friday to release the videotape of
Clinton's grand-jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   At critical moments in administrations past, presidents always
had wise men at their beck and call. President Lyndon B. Johnson
had Clark Clifford. In addition to Strauss, Carter quietly relied
on an Atlanta outsider, Charles Kirbo, to offer a presidential
reality check. President Dwight D. Eisenhower charged his younger
brother, Milton, an academic, with all manner of furtive oversight.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's chief confidential adviser, his wife, is now
handicapped by having to share the strain the scandal has imposed
on their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a president who shows no sign, throughout his
career, of relying on paternal senior figures,'' said Michael
Beschloss, a presidential historian. ``And there hasn't been a
situation of a president being in a mess quite like this. The wheel
is being invented on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Beschloss wondered whether this grave if lubricious crisis might
stump even Chance the gardener, the surreal wise man of the
satirical film ``Being There.'' Chance's horticultural platitudes
were taken as metaphorical wisdom by a crisis-ridden president.
(``As long as the roots are not severed, all is well, and all will
be well in the garden.'')

 WASHINGTON: the garden.'')  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lloyd Cutler, the veteran lawyer who has served in the Carter
and Clinton White Houses, has the silver-haired elan of a classic
Washington elder. But he speaks of wise men more in nostalgia than
as a promising dynamic in the current predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days when we were more bipartisan in this city, we
used the `wise men' approach quite often, especially in foreign
affairs,'' he said. ``But impeachment is highly partisan in its
nature, and it's very difficult to organize on a bipartisan
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Watergate, the approach was possible only after the prospect
of removal from office became a certainty for Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Some optimists talk of a wise-man bank shot: brokering a
bipartisan compromise of censure by rallying nonpartisan sages and
having them spark popular concern with a concerted warning that
only a strong president will be able to deal with the economic
crises sweeping the world. But one elder, wise enough to remain
anonymous, despairs of even this. ``The truth of the matter is
Clinton just goes through the motions and doesn't appreciate the
wise-men possibilities,'' this veteran summarized. ``And the
Republicans right now are mainly interested in milking their
advantage through election day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton critics question whether a president who never courted
wise men could turn now to such figures as former Sens. Howard
Baker, R-Tenn., or Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``George Mitchell is reported to
have turned down the president's offer to become his wise man,''
said Tony Blankley, the conservative polemicist at George magazine,
who rates the former senator from Maine as Washington's truly wise
man in declining to take up the president's folly. ``Certain events
can't be undone,'' Blankley said. ``To avoid a bad news cycle,
Clinton certainly has destroyed a presidency and perhaps truncated
it. This is no longer about the president; it's about the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the White House agrees. Clinton, clinging to job
approval ratings of 60 percent, is counting on the public to
eventually prevail as the truly wise one in the crisis, able to
force a compromise on combative Republicans. ``Life is a state of
mind,'' as the tale of Chance the presidential wise man concluded
about Washington. &QL;

<P>
   The Japanese are well versed in the art of fending off U.S.
accusations, including the perpetual hyperventilating over Japan's
protectionist trade policies. But nothing from the past could have
prepared the Japanese for the latest salvo by several prominent
American economists who say the Japanese government has been
insufficiently reckless.
</P>
<P>
   By running an overly tight monetary policy, these economists
say, and by driving down inflation, the government has
inadvertently contributed to a downward spiral of prices and
production that has cost the Japanese nearly a decade of growth and
added to economic turmoil throughout the region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   To make amends, the government must now ``credibly promise to be
irresponsible,'' says Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By that he means the central
bank should embark on a crash program of printing yen _ creating
not only inflation today, but also the expectation of inflation
tomorrow and an indefinite number of tomorrows into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a financial crisis that has swept from Asia to Russia
to Latin America, President Clinton and finance officials from the
major industrialized powers suggested last week a concerted effort
to emphasize growth over inflation fighting, presumably by cutting
interest rates. These officials do not want to spur inflation,
though it might be an unintended consequence of fighting off
recession with looser monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, by contrast, embraces inflation as an economic cure for
Japan's maladies. And at a moment when a quarter of the world's
population is living through recession or worse, there is good
reason to focus on Japan. Solving the growing financial crisis in
Latin America requires resolving economic chaos in Asia. And to
solve Asia's problems requires re-establishing Japan as an engine
of regional growth.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman's puckish prescription sounds wacky enough to Western
ears, but to the decorous, orderly Japanese, it probably sounds
quite mad. Professor Koiche Hamada of Yale University giggled when
asked to contemplate how Krugman's formula would be received by
most of the officials who run Japan's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   But as Krugman points out, Japan's desperate plight cries out
for unorthodox solutions. And there are signs that his ideas are
making inroads: A prominent Japanese lawmaker recently embraced the
notion of setting an inflation target.
</P>
<P>
   Let's step back. The Japanese economy, whose rapid and
noninflationary growth was the envy of the world in the 1970s and
'80s, has fallen into dire straits. Industrial production has
stagnated for the entire decade. Wholesale prices have fallen over
the past five years, an improbably long time for prices to drop in
industrialized economies. Land values have crashed, undermining the
solvency of banks whose loans are tied to real estate. Stock prices
have also plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation can be just as economically corrosive as inflation.
Falling prices create an expectation of future decline, which
compels consumers and investors to postpone spending, setting off a
self-sustaining downward spiral of production, income, spending and
prices.
</P>
<P>
   So what should Japan do? There are any number of ideas, but
these are the four usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Japan could close down its insolvent banks and bail out the
others. Only then will the normal interplay between lenders and
borrowers resume. A plan along these lines was announced last week.
However, such restructuring takes time and provides only a partial
solution.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government could try to spend its way out of recession by
investing lavishly in infrastructure projects. But the government
has an unenviable record of building roads and bridges that go
nowhere important, tailoring projects more to the needs of
political cronies than to the economy. And this, too, is only a
partial answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Japan could cut taxes to boost spending. But the nation is
aging quickly, and the federal deficit will balloon as the elderly
retire and draw pensions. So a tax cut today will have to be offset
by a tax hike in the future. Japanese taxpayers know this and can
be expected to prepare for the eventual hike by stashing money they
temporarily save on taxes into their bank accounts instead of
spending on consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ The most popular way to stimulate spending _ cutting interest
rates _ is impossible in Japan, because their rates are already
within an eyelash of zero. The rate controlled by the central bank
is already down to 0.25 percent, yet there has been no spending

</P>
<P>
   Enter Krugman. He urges the central bank to drop its traditional
mission of price stability and instead start printing however many
yen it takes to generate lasting inflation. The goal is to turn
expectations of deflation into their opposite, scaring people into
buying goods now before they become more expensive. This
pro-inflation policy would also spur investment by companies that
could borrow yen that they know will be worth less by the time they
have to repay their creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University urges the
Bank of Japan to pour out however much money it takes to stop
prices from falling, a less extreme goal than Krugman's. Professor

monetary pedal, arguing that people would use the newly printed yen
to buy land and other assets, thereby halting the slide in prices.
He also says increasing the number of yen would drive down its
value on foreign exchange markets and thereby boost exports.

<P>
   These economists offer bold ideas. But, as Krugman says
admiringly of his proposals, ``Faced with a novel kind of economic
malaise, the results of hard thinking deserve to be taken
seriously.''

<P>
   The Japanese are well versed in the art of fending off U.S.
accusations, including the perpetual hyperventilating over Japan's
protectionist trade policies. But nothing from the past could have
prepared the Japanese for the latest salvo by several prominent
American economists who say the Japanese government has been
insufficiently reckless.
</P>
<P>
   By running an overly tight monetary policy, these economists
say, and by driving down inflation, the government has
inadvertently contributed to a downward spiral of prices and
production that has cost the Japanese nearly a decade of growth and
added to economic turmoil throughout the region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   To make amends, the government must now ``credibly promise to be
irresponsible,'' says Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By that he means the central
bank should embark on a crash program of printing yen _ creating
not only inflation today, but also the expectation of inflation
tomorrow and an indefinite number of tomorrows into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a financial crisis that has swept from Asia to Russia
to Latin America, President Clinton and finance officials from the
major industrialized powers suggested last week a concerted effort
to emphasize growth over inflation fighting, presumably by cutting
interest rates. These officials do not want to spur inflation,
though it might be an unintended consequence of fighting off
recession with looser monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, by contrast, embraces inflation as an economic cure for
Japan's maladies. And at a moment when a quarter of the world's
population is living through recession or worse, there is good
reason to focus on Japan. Solving the growing financial crisis in
Latin America requires resolving economic chaos in Asia. And to
solve Asia's problems requires re-establishing Japan as an engine
of regional growth.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman's puckish prescription sounds wacky enough to Western
ears, but to the decorous, orderly Japanese, it probably sounds
quite mad. Professor Koiche Hamada of Yale University giggled when
asked to contemplate how Krugman's formula would be received by
most of the officials who run Japan's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   But as Krugman points out, Japan's desperate plight cries out
for unorthodox solutions. And there are signs that his ideas are
making inroads: A prominent Japanese lawmaker recently embraced the
notion of setting an inflation target.
</P>
<P>
   Let's step back. The Japanese economy, whose rapid and
noninflationary growth was the envy of the world in the 1970s and
'80s, has fallen into dire straits. Industrial production has
stagnated for the entire decade. Wholesale prices have fallen over
the past five years, an improbably long time for prices to drop in
industrialized economies. Land values have crashed, undermining the
solvency of banks whose loans are tied to real estate. Stock prices
have also plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation can be just as economically corrosive as inflation.
Falling prices create an expectation of future decline, which
compels consumers and investors to postpone spending, setting off a
self-sustaining downward spiral of production, income, spending and
prices.
</P>
<P>
   So what should Japan do? There are any number of ideas, but
these are the four usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Japan could close down its insolvent banks and bail out the
others. Only then will the normal interplay between lenders and
borrowers resume. A plan along these lines was announced last week.
However, such restructuring takes time and provides only a partial
solution.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government could try to spend its way out of recession by
investing lavishly in infrastructure projects. But the government
has an unenviable record of building roads and bridges that go
nowhere important, tailoring projects more to the needs of
political cronies than to the economy. And this, too, is only a
partial answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Japan could cut taxes to boost spending. But the nation is
aging quickly, and the federal deficit will balloon as the elderly

by a tax hike in the future. Japanese taxpayers know this and can

A SHAKY CRUTCH FOR THE LEARNING-DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., W.Va., Vt.)  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last decade, learning disabilities have
moved squarely to the foreground of the education world: more than
5 percent of the nation's students now have diagnosed learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of students in elementary schools,
colleges and graduate schools get accommodations like extra time on
tests, note-takers or quiet rooms to work in. When New York State
gave the bar exam in July, more than 300 students received special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled that
the New York Board of Law Examiners had illegally discriminated
against a learning-disabled law school graduate who was refused
accommodations on the bar exam in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But with the entry into the professions of the first large wave
of learning-disabled students accustomed to accommodations, the
impact of the disability laws is still a big unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Even as debate continues to rage about affirmative action,
learning disabilities present a special conundrum for employers,
who are unsure about how far to bend for people whose disabilities
might affect their job performance.
</P>
<P>
   The law tries to provide a balance: On one hand, the Americans
With Disabilities Act, which went into effect in 1992, forbids
employers to discriminate against people with disabilities, and
requires them to make reasonable accommodations. So a company
cannot refuse to hire someone simply because he is blind, and may
be required to adapt its workplace to accommodate a blind person.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, employers are not obliged to hire someone who
doesn't meet the qualifications for the job, so no one needs to
hire a blind person as a truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   But the line is hard to draw in professions that involve a lot
of reading and writing _ where precise qualifications are hard to
pin down. How important is it that a third-grade teacher spell
well? Or that a journalist read quickly? Are there ways to
compensate _ if, for example, the teacher has someone proofread her
writing, and the journalist reads slowly but thinks fast?
</P>
<P>
   The law school graduate at the center of last week's court
decision, Marilyn Bartlett, did not mention that she had a reading
disorder when she graduated from Vermont Law School in 1991 and got
a job at Bower &AMP; Gardner, a now-defunct New York City law firm. But
Dr. Bartlett, currently an educational administrator at Dowling
College on Long Island, succeeded at the firm until she was forced
to leave because she could not pass the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I read so slowly, I would go in at 7 a.m. and leave at
8 p.m., and only report an eight-hour day,'' said Dr. Bartlett, who
ultimately failed the bar exam five times, never receiving the full
accommodations she requested. ``I read carefully and I don't think
it made me a bad lawyer. There are blind attorneys, and attorneys
with cerebral palsy, and attorneys with horrible stutters, and that
doesn't mean they can't be good attorneys who know the law and
represent their clients zealously.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the disabilities laws, people with profound physical
limitations now make their way into every profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lawyers with hearing impairments or wheelchairs, and
the accommodations are obvious,'' said Sue Hastings, the partner in
charge of hiring at Squire, Sanders &AMP; Dempsey, a large Cleveland
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of lawyers with learning disabilities hasn't come up
yet, Ms. Hastings said, but when it does, deciding on reasonable
accommodations may be more complicated. For one thing, if someone
works slowly it is hard to know whether it is due to disability or
inability. ``If it takes them 10 hours to do what takes someone
else 2 hours, that obviously affects the bottom line and how
quickly they could service their clients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how a learning disability will affect job performance is
hard to predict. But some of those who license accountants, lawyers
and doctors have begun to wonder, quietly, whether the increasing
academic accommodation of those with learning disabilities will
lead to career problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that there a lot of people who
are just weak academically, or not that bright, coming out of the
woodwork claiming learning disabilities,'' said the head of one
licensing body, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``I worry
what happens to all these people who are getting accommodations
when they're out there in practice. Under the law, they may be
entitled to extra time on tests or a quiet room to take exams in.
But no one wants to be represented at trial by a lawyer who can't
think fast on his feet, or land in the emergency room with a doctor
who's too distracted to concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Anne Simon, a Brooklyn lawyer who represented Dr. Bartlett,
said such concerns were unrealistic. ``Some of the best emergency
room doctors, paramedics and cops are those with attention-deficit
disorder because they have high energy and function best in tense
environments,'' she said. ``There are all kinds of jobs even in one
field. Emergency room doctors are a different breed from surgeons;
tax lawyers are different from litigators.''
</P>
<P>
   And those with learning disabilities are often highly motivated,
because they have had to struggle to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people self-select away from situations they can't
manage,'' said Jack Gentul, director of New York University's Henry
and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people with learning disabilities know exactly what those
are. But people should have the right to try and fail. Before the
disabilities law, people who might have been able to succeed didn't
get the chance. For many people with learning disabilities, large
law firms are probably the most difficult area, since a lot of
those jobs are all about reading or writing speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the learning-disabled share stories about problems
at such firms _ a young associate berated for a draft document
replete with spelling errors, or another who fell further and
further behind, even working 15 hours a day, 7 days a week. But
while learning disabilities have become more visible in schools,
they remain largely hidden in private legal practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, we've never had either an applicant or a
lawyer at the firm say they had a learning disability,'' said
Robert Joffee, deputy presiding partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore,
a large New York law firm. ``If they're here, either they're
compensating so well it isn't an issue, or they're struggling with
a problem they don't want to advertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy could name only one lawyer with
a learning disability: Barbara Harmon-Schamberger, a Rhodes scholar
who left the Manhattan firm in 1993 to become West Virginia's
secretary of education. Ms. Harmon-Schamberger told the firm of her
dyslexia, word-recognition disability and visual impairment only
after she failed the bar exam twice and wanted to explain why.
``Milbank was wonderful in accommodating me and it was very
simple,'' she said. ``I think accommodations are easier in the real
world than in school. You know what tasks you can't do and find
someone who can. So when I had to do line-by-line readings, they
gave me a paralegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she added, the only other lawyer at the firm who had
learning disabilities was too embarrassed to disclose his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a stigma, a presumption of, oh, you must be
stupid,'' Ms. Harmon-Schamberger said. ``I will never forget when I
was being turned down for accommodations on the New York bar exam,
the secretary of the board told me, `We have to examine you even
more rigorously because, unlike attorneys who are blind or deaf,
the client can't look at you and know he's getting an incompetent
attorney.' That hurt.''

BOWING OUT: FERRARO'S 14-YEAR CURTAIN CALL

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps more than any other issue, the 14-year gap
since she had been in elective office _ or run for vice president,
her claim to fame _ dogged Geraldine Ferraro in her race for the
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. She lost last week and
declared her political career closed, which makes this the
opportune time to reflect on what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   During her campaign, Ferraro cited her stint as a commentator on
the CNN television program ``Crossfire,'' her ambassadorship to the
U.N. Human Rights Commission, her campaigns on behalf of other
female candidates. But she could not shake the perception that what
she had really done in that period _ more than twice as long as she
served in Congress _ was be famous.
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers, that was not enough. They gave her principal
opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, 51 percent of the vote, against her
second-place 26 percent, in the race to challenge Republican Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato in November.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, New York voters apparently ended one of America's
more peculiar political careers, one whose chief accomplishment
appeared to be less doing than being. She will be remembered not
for any bill she wrote, for any words she uttered, for any office
she held, or for any race she won, but instead for a race she ran
(and lost) _ for being a woman in the right place at the right
time, a creature of circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her party thought she was good enough to be president,'' one
supporter said during the primary. But wasn't it at least as
important that Democrats hoped she would help them capture the
presidency?
</P>
<P>
   She went from being a three-term congresswoman from Queens to
being an international icon; from then on, her achievements were
far exceeded by what she frequently characterized during this
year's campaign as her ``stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Being, of course, counts for something. Ferraro's selection and
her spunky persona did inspire women to get into politics, to aim
for the top. Perhaps her campaigning did help some of them succeed.
Even her presence on ``Crossfire,'' argues Anita Perez Ferguson,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus, made women
``think they don't have to be a cookie-cutter model to be in front
of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro herself described as ridiculous the notion of
unfulfilled promise and invoked the experience of another public
figure. What, she asked one interviewer, had Colin Powell done
since the gulf war?
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, Ferraro's supporters said she was the victim of a
double standard. Questions about what she had done lately, said
former Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., ``show how really easy it is to
demonize women.'' Walter Who?
</P>
<P>
   If Ferraro was hurt by a double standard, she was also its
beneficiary _ it was, after all, what vaulted her onto the national
stage, and what gave her far more attention and opportunities in
the succeeding years than, say, the man she shared the 1984 ticket
with (Walter Mondale, who became ambassador to Japan).
</P>
<P>
   And by offering the voters little reason to support her beyond
her sex, she may, in some cases, actually have set back the cause
by spawning a number of weak female candidates _ including New York
Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, another creature of circumstance,
who lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary last week.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is remarkable how much she seemed to take a
purely political decision as a personal affirmation, as being about
her and not the constituencies she represented. Consider her new
book, ``Framing a Life: A Family Memoir,'' to be published next
month. It is billed by the publisher, Lisa Drew/Scribner, as ``the
heartwarming story of four generations of Italian-American women,''
tracing the rise from her illiterate Italian grandmother to her Ivy
League-educated daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is really Ferraro's story all over again; the other
three generations are supporting cast. Her two daughters are not
famous, but they are successful _ one is a television producer, the
other a doctor _ yet in a book about the women in her family
Ferraro never specifies their achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she revisits her own childhood in great detail, then
retraces her hard-fought election to the House of Representatives
in 1978, her selection as the first female vice presidential
nominee, her flaying by the press and Republicans in that race, and
its reprise in her narrowly failed 1992 run for the Senate. The
presumption, throughout, is that history will want to know. The
unanswered question is how much it will care.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 20, moved Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS-SAGE-REVIEW is now POLITICAL-SAGES-REVIEW. IRAN-REVIEW
is now IRAN-AFGHAN-REVIEW. KING-BABE-REVIEW is now
LARRYKING-BABERUTH-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-REVIEW _ The government is not necessarily paralyzed by
the Clinton scandal. It has tremendous momentum, and even in times
of war and political crisis it has a way of grinding relentlessly
on. Moreover, the very threat of drift and paralysis in this case
has provided both parties with tremendous incentive to keep pushing
a substantive agenda _ maybe even to push harder than they would
otherwise. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   POLTIICAL-SAGES-REVIEW _ Many Democrats sadly agree that the
time may have long since passed for summoning any of Washington's
fabled wise men, like Robert Strauss, W. Averell Harriman, Clark
Clifford. They were part of an informal cadre of emeritus
politicians and lawyers who occasionally dropped by the city's
floating political crap game at critical moments, in between using
their influence on behalf of paying clients, to lend it some class
and even a touch of realism. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   LEARN-DISABLED-REVIEW _ Over the last decade, learning
disabilities have moved squarely to the foreground of the education
world: more than 5 percent of the nation's students now have
diagnosed learning disabilities. Hundreds of thousands of students
in elementary schools, colleges and graduate schools get special
accommodations like extra time on tests, quiet rooms to work in or
note-takers. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECON-REVIEW _ The Japanese are well versed in the art of
fending off U.S. accusations, including perpetual hyperventilating
over Japan's protectionist trade policies. But nothing from the
past could have prepared the Japanese for the latest salvo by
several prominent American economists. They say that the Japanese
government has been insufficiently reckless. By running a tight
monetary policy, wringing inflation out of the economy now and for
the foreseeable future, the government has inadvertently
contributed to a downward spiral of prices and production that has
cost the Japanese nearly a decade of growth. By Michael M.
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   FERRARO-REVIEW _ Perhaps more than any other issue, the 14-year
gap since she had been in elective office _ or run for
vice-president, her claim to fame _ dogged Geraldine Ferraro in her
race for the democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate from New
York. She lost last week and declared her political career closed,
which makes this a good time to reflect on what went wrong. By Amy
Waldman.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW _ Although the world has focused its
attention on the one-sided battle between the Chinese Communist
government and the political dissidents who press for radical
change, there is also a large population of intellectuals, many of
them scholars or former officials, who work openly to nudge the
system in a more democratic direction. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-AFGHAN-REVIEW _ Who's afraid of Afghanistan? Iran, it
seems. The Islamic Republic has positioned as many as 70,000
Revolutionary Guards and volunteers on its border with Afghanistan.
And perhaps 200,000 regular soldiers are on the way. The Taliban of
Afghanistan have only about 40,000 men under arms, so te primary
threat to Iran is not military. It is instead a threat that is
deeply political, and quite humiliating. Instead of showing Iran a
little respect, the four-year-old Sunni Muslim movement, which
follows a rigid, repressive version of Islamic law and now controls
most of Afghanistan, has nothing but contempt for its neighbor to
the west. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-PLANS-REVIEW _ The 1985 invasion of Libya would now be
in the lesson plans of every high school history teacher in America
if it had actually taken place. Instead, the stillborn invasion is
a classic example of Washington's propensity to gin up contingency
plans for seemingly otherworldly operations that never get the
green light. Indeed, there is a permanent infrastructure in the
United States national security apparatus that does nothing but
plan for every conceivable crisis, often with little or no hope
that the plans will be taken seriously by senior policy-makers or
the president. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   STARR-SPOOF-REVIEW _ A spoof on a supposed manuscript submitted
by Ken Starr for publication.

   WASHINGTON _ Who's afraid of Afghanistan? Iran, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Republic has positioned as many as 70,000
Revolutionary Guards and volunteers on its border with Afghanistan.
And perhaps 200,000 regular soldiers are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Iran fears an air and ground assault like the one
Saddam Hussein launched from Iraq 18 years ago this week. That
action triggered an eight-year war that by some estimates left
between 600,000 and 1 million people dead and cost both sides
hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's Taliban have only about 40,000 men under arms, so
the primary threat to Iran is not military. It is instead a threat
that is deeply political, and quite humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since its revolution nearly two decades ago, Iran has
proclaimed itself the model for the world's Muslims. One of the
most controversial articles of its constitution plainly states that
the Islamic Republic shall make ``every effort to realize the
political, economic and cultural unity of the world of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Taliban. Instead of showing Iran a little respect,
the four-year-old Sunni Muslim movement, which follows a rigid,
repressive version of Islamic law and controls most of Afghanistan,
has nothing but contempt for its neighbor to the west.
</P>
<P>
   In Taliban writings, members of the Shiite branch of Islam, to
which most Iranians belong, are ``hypocrites pretending to be
Muslims.'' And Iran is branded the ``mother of all hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they have the purest Islamic regime in the world,''
said Barnett Rubin, an Afghan scholar at the Council on Foreign
Relations. ``Now they are trying to develop a strong central
government around the principle of Islamic law _ and win
recognition as the government of Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iran, the Taliban are just a bunch of backward peasants with
Pakistani and Saudi support who have given Muslims a bad name.
Disregarding the international shock that greeted Iran's own
repression of its people in the name of Islam, the Iranians now are
criticizing the Taliban for going too far.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, for example, women have to cover their heads and
bodies, but can drive cars, vote, hold jobs and seats in
Parliament; in Afghanistan women cannot work or go to school and
must even cover their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, what is happening in Afghanistan today is a
disgrace to Islam,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   So Iran has opposed the Taliban ever since its fighters began
seizing chunks of territory. In loose collaboration with Russia,
Iran now supplies other factions with weapons, money and logistical
support in an effort to prevent a consolidation of power by the
Taliban, who are not recognized as Afghanistan's government by most
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for sending troops to the border was the Taliban's
seizure of a group of Iranian diplomats several weeks ago. Most of
the diplomats have been killed, and last week their bodies were
sent home, where they were praised and mourned.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other reasons as well. Iran's leaders claim their
national security is threatened by the instability of Taliban rule.
Iran still shelters 1.5 million Afghan refugees from a variety of
factions who fought the Soviet army in the 1980s _ and Iran fears
that some among them could be criminals or, eventually,
anti-Iranian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also fears that the Taliban will launch a campaign of
ethnic cleansing against the Shiite population of Afghanistan, a
development that could drive even more refugees over the border if
it is not sealed. In addition, Iran is used by the Afghans as a
market and a transit route for much of their opium crop, which the
massive troop presence has at least temporarily disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, continuation of the civil war in Afghanistan prevents
Western oil companies from building pipelines to transport Caspian
Sea oil and gas across Afghan territory. Iranians still hope that
if they wait long enough, the United States will change its policy
and allow a pipeline to run through Iran's territory.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Iran has been trying to convince the
rest of the world _ with little success _ to mount a vigorous
mediation effort to stop the Taliban. Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami is planning to use a speech to the United Nations General
Assembly on Monday _ during his first trip there, and his first to
the United States _ to call for international action in resolving
the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to take entirely seriously Iran's charges that
the Taliban's seizure of Iranian diplomats was an egregious
violation of international law, considering that Iran held more
than four dozen U.S. diplomats hostage for 14 months in 1979-81 and
still has a bounty of millions of dollars on the books for anyone
who assassinates novelist Salman Rushdie for his ``heretical''
writings about Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But the massing of hundreds of thousands of troops on a border
has a way of focusing attention on an issue, and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan has called for a high-level meeting on
Afghanistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, meanwhile, the Afghan crisis has prompted an
extraordinary public debate among the top leaders about whether to
go to war. Khatami has said he hopes Iran ``will not have to resort
to non-diplomatic methods, '' and former President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani suggested in a recent sermon that the United
States was behind a plot to weaken Iran by pushing it into war and
that Iran had to resolve the crisis in a prudent and calculated
way.
</P>
<P>
   Where the country's supreme religious leader stands is more
uncertain. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is also commander in chief
of the armed forces, has now backed away from a previous
declaration that Iran would not get involved militarily in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning remark that seemed to leave the door open for
groups that might welcome a war fever _ the hard-line Revolutionary
Guards, for example _ he said last week that he was ``waiting
impatiently for our statesmen'' to decide whether to declare war or
not.

   Familiar Faces Return to Moscow
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet
president, was tinkering with an ossified Communist economy, he
sought the advice of a group of then-liberal economists who
advocated such notions as a `'regulated market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in a return engagement that Russian headline writers were
calling ``back to the future,'' the same team of economists has
returned, advising Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov about how to put
the brakes on Russia's pell-mell transition to a free market.
</P>
<P>
   Their point man in the government, First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov, is another familiar face: in 1991, he was last head
of Gosplan, the giant state planning agency that planned the Soviet
economy into the ground.

   A Flash in Time Is Buried in Alabama
</P>
<P>
   People did not throng the streets of Montgomery to see the white
hearse roll slowly by, at least not as many people as might have
been expected. Maybe, some political experts surmised, it was
because George C. Wallace had already passed into history.
</P>
<P>
   The man generations of Alabamians just called ``The Guv'na'' was
buried Wednesday in Montgomery beside his first wife, Lurleen,
after finally giving in to the paralysis and sickness that had
slowly consumed his life. He was 79, and since 1972 _ since Arthur
Bremer fired five bullets into him in a Maryland shopping center _
he had lived in pain, in his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends _ white ones who had always stood by him, black ones
who believed him when he said he was sorry for what he had done to
them as a segregationist, had come to see his body as he lay in
state in the Capitol. Some of them brought their grandchildren, for
one last peek at a man who had personified a hot-flash in time,
only to become what many people came to regard as a tragic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forgave him,'' said John Watkins, a 68-year-old black man,
as eight State Troopers carried the casket from the Capitol.

   Watkins said he had, too.

   Familiar Names In Minnesota Too
</P>
<P>
   In a race among men with famous Minnesota names, victory in the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's primary for governor went to the
state's most revered one: Hubert H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it was Hubert H. Humphrey III, the son and
namesake of the former vice president, senator and 1968
presidential nominee. Also-rans in the primary included Ted
Mondale, the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale; Mike
Freeman, son of former Gov. Orville Freeman; Mark Dayton, heir to
the Dayton Hudson store conglomerate, which owns the Target chain,
and Doug Johnson, who described himself as the only commoner in the
contest but the one with the most authentic Minnesota name.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, the state's attorney general, ran a campaign that
boasted of a bringing a lawsuit against tobacco companies that will
net the state $6.1 billion, and vowed to pay two years of college
tuition for Minnesotans.

   Bosnia's Serbs Reject A Leader the West Liked
</P>
<P>
   As Bosnia conducted elections under the watchful eyes of the
United States and other countries with peacekeeping forces in the
land, the West's diplomatic strategy was clear: isolate the
hard-line Serb nationalists and support those moderates who
appeared most likely to support reconciliation of Bosnia's Serbs
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy seemed to have been dealt a heavy blow last week
when Biljana Plavsic appeared to have been voted out of office as
President of Bosnia's Serb Republic, according to international
officials monitoring preliminary results. The winner seemed to be
Nikola Poplasen, leader of the Serb Radical Party, who is
considered an extreme nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   From her own offices in Banja Luka, Ms. Plavsic had been
confronting radical Serb leaders in Pale for more than a year, and
a defeat would seem to be a clear repudiation of the West's goals.
```If Poplasen has won, it means the Bosnian Serbs are telling the
West, `We don't care about you or your money or your quaint ideas
about reconciliation with Muslims and Croats,''' a European
diplomat said.

   A Debt Wiped Out For the House Speaker
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich wiped out a debt he never incurred.
He said he did not need the $150,000 that former Sen. Bob Dole had
offered him to pay off the $300,000 fine that the House had levied
against the speaker last January.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Gingrich had made more money than expected on
his book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way,'' even though the tome
made the best-seller list for only one week.
</P>
<P>
   The fine against Gingrich _ to repay the government for the
expense of investigating whether he misled the House ethics
committee _ is now being examined as the model for part of a
possible sanction against President Clinton, who misled many
others.

   The U.N. Nominee Is Put on Hold
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous poison-pen letter has left the United States
waiting for a chief delegate at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The letter about Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee
for the post, alleged that the veteran diplomat may have violated
federal ethics laws in his contacts with former colleagues after
leaving the State Department two years ago. It also questioned his
ties to a former ambassador to Switzerland, who gave Holbrooke
rent-free lodging at his home in Washington for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that
halted the fighting in Bosnia, has denied any wrongdoing and
amended his financial disclosure statements to reflect the gift of
the lodging. The investigation by the Justice and State Departments
is expected to last at least several more weeks.

   Amid the Lost Lives, Also a Loss to Art
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian official who saw the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111
after it crashed into the ocean Sept. 2, killing all 229 people
aboard, said it looked like a pane of glass that had shattered into
a million pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Among those pieces is an original Picasso painting that was
being sent to Geneva and was probably destroyed on impact. In his
later years, Picasso dashed off at least six versions of a painting
called ``The Painter,'' and Swissair has confirmed that one of them
was on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated jet also carried a treasure trove of jewelry, cash
and diamonds, including one piece that had been displayed at the
Museum of Natural History until Aug. 30.

   Returning to Normal At Northwest Airlines
</P>
<P>
   Air service slowly began returning to isolated parts of the
upper Midwest and South last week after pilots at Northwest
Airlines ratified a new contract, ending their bitter 15-day strike
against the nation's fourth-largest airline. About one quarter of
Northwest's 1,700 daily passenger flights resumed on Wednesday; the
airline said its full schedule would not be back in the air until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest's labor troubles are far from over.

   A New Way to Read The Law at Home
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next month, students will be able to earn a law degree
entirely online.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Educational Centers, a Washington Post Co. subsidiary
best known for its test-coaching services, is opening the Concord
University School of Law, in which students will take all of their
courses over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The school will not be accredited by the American Bar
Association, however, and as a result graduates will face some
limits to where they can practice law. California is one state that
will welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which began accepting applications last week
(www.concord.kaplan.edu), expects to attract people whose careers,
family obligations or geographic locations make it hard for them to
attend traditional law schools.
</P>
<P>
   The cost, $4,200 a year for a four-year law degree program, will
be far below the cost at most private universities and even less
than at many public ones.

   Welcome, Friend. Wanna Bet? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a brilliantly cynical venture, the Palestinian Authority
unveiled last week the first large, for-profit international
investment in Yasser Arafat's territory: a casino catering to
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Oasis Casino outside Jericho is a $50 million,
Austrian-backed project intended to milk Israelis of their money in
order to generate millions in tax revenues for the cash-strapped
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are barred from entering the glitzy new building by
Arafat, who bowed to the protests of Islamic fundamentalists. Half
of its employees, though, are Palestinians, somewhat sheepishly
working in a house of sin in order to double the salaries they
could have if there were work available as laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat did not attend opening ceremonies. Neither did the
promised guest of honor: the model Claudia Schiffer.

   Italian Not Spoken Here &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if in Italy, at least, Private Ryan would not be
saved. A two-month strike by dubbers delayed the release in Italy
of more than a dozen major films, including Steven Spielberg's
latest hit movie.
</P>
<P>
   Italians, far more than the French or Germans, watch television
and go the the movies expecting to hear John Wayne and Jim Carrey
speak the native language. In Italy, some of the most prolific
dubbers are major stars in their own right. Their sudden shutdown
practically paralyzed Italy: panicked network executives were
forced last week to air beloved American soap operas in English
with subtitles. Viewers deluged television stations with angry
phone calls and threats.
</P>
<P>
   That show of force had results. Friday, producers and dubbers
agreed to reopen talks on a national contract and the strikers said
they would return to their sound studios. ``They couldn't take the
strike anymore,'' said Andrea Ward, the Italian voice of Andy
Garcia and David Keith.

   INTERNATIONAL (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-OIL (Eket, Nigeria) _ Denny Sansom of Mobil Oil has the
ocean behind him, seven million restive Nigerians of the Niger
River Delta in front of him, huge reserves of oil beneath him and
hundreds of thousands of angry complaints against his corporation
threatening to sink him. The trouble began on Jan. 12, he recalled,
when a 24-inch underwater pipeline from Mobil's Idaho production
platform three and a half miles offshore had snapped, creating a
huge oil spill and releasing the pent up anger of people living in
poverty in an oil-rich nation. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ECON (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ Two weeks before the Oct. 4
election, in which President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is to seek
another term in office, the financial tornado that has devastated
parts of Asia and Russia has begun spinning toward Brazil. By Diana
Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-ECONOMICS (Tokyo) _ They were the world's richest and
shrewdest investors, and they rode a wave of globalization to buy
bonds in a promising developing country. When the country
defaulted, they were livid. It all sounds a bit familiar, but the
year was 1842 and the developing country was the United States.
Globalization, in other words, may not be quite as fresh as it
sometimes seems. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-YELTSIN (Moscow) _ For the first time in a career that
capitalized on conflicts, President Boris Yeltsin last week backed
away from a certain showdown with the parliamentary opposition over
the nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. In
Russia's play-for-keeps politics, a compromise _ in this case, the
nomination of Primakov _ carries with it the faint aroma of defeat.
By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-SHARIF (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif leaves for the United States on Saturday and could not have
picked a better time for a getaway, with people here feeling he has
just tried to eliminate democracy from the constitution. Whatever
lies ahead for him this week _ and his schedule includes meetings
with President Clinton and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of
India as well as a speech before the United Nations _ the days
should seem tranquil compared with those he just left behind. By
Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDEN-ELECT (Stockholm, Sweden) _ Sweden this weekend is
staging its quadrennial political fete, a national election, and
the exercise is uneventful and unimpassioned, indeed, barely
detectable. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   PANAMA-CANAL (Panama City) _ As minister of housing for the last
four years, Francisco Sanchez Cardenas was supposed to improve
other people's living conditions, not his own. But with the United
States turning hundreds of homes of departing military officers
over to Panama as stipulated by treaty, he and other leaders of the
governing party have got the best residences for themselves. A
result has been popular outrage and a political scandal that
threatens to cripple the governing Democratic Revolutionary Party
in elections scheduled for next spring. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-ASSESS (Bangkok, Thailand) _ Wars, elections, coups and
riots come and go in Cambodia, but the unhappy entanglement of the
Prince and the former Communist, it seems, is never-ending. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RANGE-CATTLE-WAR (Ervay, Wyo.) _ In this modern range war,
radical environmentalists seek to force grazing cattle off public
land by cutting fences and otherwise carrying out economic sabotage
against ranching operations. With beef prices low, many Western
ranchers already have their financial backs to the wall. By James
Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION-POLITICS _ Across the country this election season,
scores of candidates for Senate and House seats are focusing on
schools, vowing that if sent to Washington, they will get the
federal government involved in cutting the nation's class sizes,
repairing school buildings and making them safer for learning. But
while education has long been one of the voters' top five or six
concerns, along with crime, drugs, the economy and foreign threats,
the issue is frequently cited by pollsters this year as the voters'
primary focus. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGWAR-OVERHAUL (Washington) _ U.S. border inspectors searched
slightly more than a million commercial trucks and railway cars
entering the United States from Mexico last year. They found
cocaine stashed in cargo compartments on only six occasions, said
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House director of drug control
policy. He cites the dispiriting statistic in pressing for an
overhaul of the strategy for stanching the flow of illegal drugs
into the United States. By Christopher S. Wren.
</P>
<P>
   N.J.-CASINO-GAMBLE (Anadarko, Okla.) _ Three years ago, the
mayor and business leaders of Wildwood, a struggling resort on the
Jersey Shore, were certain that the path to prosperity ran through
this parched corner of western Oklahoma. The idea seemed inspired:
Take a bit of city land _ a two-acre parking lot, actually _ and
give it back to Oklahoma's Delaware Indians, whose ancestors were
pushed out of New Jersey in the 1830's. The Indians would open a
casino, and Wildwood would finally tap into the river of dollars
flowing to the mighty resort casinos of Atlantic City, 30 miles up
the shore. It has not worked out that way. By Iver Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   LASKER-AWARDS _ Six scientists who made discoveries dating to
1960 that identified the genetic basis of cancer and improved the
diagnosis and treatment of certain types of the disease will
receive this year's Albert Lasker awards. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE-AIDS-DEBATE (Bangor, Maine) _ In Maine, a judge has sided
with an HIV-positive mother who refuses to treat her HIV-positive
son with accepted treatments. A look at the issue.
</P>

   POLITICAL-BRIEFS _ Short items on politics from around the
nation. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-VIDEOTAPE (Washington) _ On Monday, when the videotape
of President Clinton's testimony is released by Congress, the
public will see a more complex president than the one in Kenneth
Starr's 445-page report, Clinton's allies and friends have argued.
While Starr's report drew on many sources, particularly on Monica
Lewinsky's testimony, to painstakingly chronicle what Clinton did,
it did not describe in detail the president's justifications for
his actions. By James Bennet and Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ On Aug. 3, in the White House Map
Room, President Clinton rolled up his shirt sleeve in the presence
of an FBI agent and a prosecutor from the office of the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. The White House physician, Dr.
E. Connie Mariano, drew a vial of the president's blood. Clinton
considered it the ultimate indignity in a year of public
humiliations, a friend said. By John M. Broder and Don Van Natta
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHRISTIANS (Washington) _ This should be a time of
triumph for the conservative, overwhelmingly pro-Republican members
of the Christian Coalition. The Democratic, baby-boomer president
they have long considered a moral disgrace now faces talk of his
impeachment. And yet, in the hallways and during coffee breaks at
the three-day Christian Coalition convention here, many delegates
said they were despondent about opinion polls showing that most
Americans do not share the conviction that President Clinton should
resign or be impeached. By Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GORE (Washington) _ As the debate intensifies over
President Clinton's political future, a new magazine will be
introduced this week that is devoted to the post-Clinton era in
American politics _ and, apparently, to the election of Vice
President Al Gore in 2000. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-INTERNET (Undated) _ Congress' decision last week to
release the Starr Report over the Internet was seen as a defining
moment for the global computer network, a test of both its
technical infrastructure and its ability to play a critical role in
the political process. In many ways, the ad hoc experiment in
electronic democracy was a big success. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   COLUMNS (Moving in ``k'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ It was inevitable, of course, that
lawyers would destroy civilization. Shakespeare warned us to kill
them all. We didn't. By Maureen Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   HERBERT-COLUMN _ A few months ago a guy said to me, ``If the
economy is doing so great, how come I'm broke?'' A new study out of
Washington shows that there are an awful lot of Americans who might
ask the same question. By Bob Herbert.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There comes now news that the FBI kept a file on the late
Groucho Marx while in dogged pursuit of Communists during the Cold
War. This was disclosed in The Nation last week by Jon Wiener, a
University of California professor who obtained 186 pages of the
file under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener says much of the FBI scrutiny came in 1953 at a time when
Marx's band leader, Jerry Fielding, was being pressured to name
Groucho as a communist in his testimony to the House Un-American
Activities Committee. Fielding did not, and was later dismissed by
Marx under pressure from his TV sponsors, a move Groucho later said
he regretted.
</P>
<P>
   The newly disclosed material does not mention Fielding. But
while repeatedly misspelling either Groucho's first or last name,
it provides details of the comedian's apparently modest involvement
in left-wing causes in Hollywood in the 1930s and '40s. And it
includes letters from angry citizens to FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover, complaining about jokes that Groucho cracked on his TV show
``You Bet Your Life,'' which aired in the 1950s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, here is compelling evidence that Marx _ Groucho, never mind
Karl _ was a subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he was, and proud of it. And the FBI apparently missed
some of the strongest evidence: Groucho's own writing. Excerpts
follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   From the Actual FBI File:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)A 1953 internal F.B.I. memorandum to Hoover
discussed Groucho's possible links to the Communist Party:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Subject is a radio and TV comedian currently starring in TV show
``You Bet Your Life'' sponsored by DeSoto-Plymouth Dealers over
NBC. Rank and file member of Communist Party (CP), San Diego
County, recently remarked to confidential informant that GRAUCHO
(sic) MARX contributes heavily to CP; however, original source gave
no basis for this allegation. Los Angeles informants familiar with
CP activity in Hollywood motion picture and radio industry
throughout 1940's state MARX was never affiliated with CP and never
a contributor as far as informants are aware.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Nevertheless, Groucho's 1963 book ``Memoirs
of a Mangy Lover'' included a chapter conspicuously titled
``Marxist Philosophy, According to Groucho.'' Among his social
dictates: ``The nation needs a good ham sandwich.'' He doesn't stop
there: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Another national need is laundries that will send you a sheet of
pins with every shirt instead of making you pick the pins, one at a
time, out of the collar or (if you don't spot them in time) your
neck. My own laundryman and I have an understanding. Every time he
sticks me with a pin I stick him with a bad check. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We need, too, a vacuum cleaner that won't scare the daylights
out of you by whining like a B-707 jet when you try to snatch a
brief four-hour afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   From the Actual FBI File:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The same 17-page memorandum to Hoover quotes
positive remarks made about Groucho by a columnist for the
Communist Party newspaper, The Daily Worker:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   GRAUCHO MARX is of working class origin. His father was an East
Side tailor, and his mother sewed in sweatshops. . . . Today he is
one of the most diverting entertainers in America. He has never
forgotten his origin _ and his nonsense contains, as many have
felt, considerable satire and passionate thrusts at contemporary
society.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Passionate thrusts indeed. As Groucho notes
in ``Memoirs of a Mangy Lover'':(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I am not prepared to say that all American husbands are untrue
to their wives. Au contraire, I think most husbands are faithful in
their fashion. Horace says . . . ``I have been faithful to thee,
Cuynara, in my fashion.'' This is a pretty qualified statement, and
Horace should be ashamed of himself.
</P>
<P>
   From the Actual FBI File:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The memo to Hoover notes that Groucho
opposed the authoritarian, anti-communist regime of Gen. Francisco
Franco in Spain:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The People's World, Communist periodical for the West Coast, in
its issue of April 25, 1945, page 2, column 4, carried a news item
from San Francisco, California, under the caption ``Anti-Franco
Forces Open Office in SF.'' GRAUCHO MARX was indicated in the
article as active in a new committee called Friends of the Spanish
Republic, which had been formed to insure that no recognition
should be accorded to the Franco government at the United Nations
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Groucho signaled his scorn of authoritarian
Latin governments in his 1959 memoir ``Groucho and Me,'' recounting
a paid junket to Mexico:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The first day in Mexico City, we were all herded into a large
assembly room where a representative of the government was
explaining in endless detail where and what our activities were to
be for the entire week. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At one point he said, ``I am deeply honored to inform you that
at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon you are all invited to meet the
President at the palace.'' I raised my hand. The translator noticed
me and said, ``Yes, what is it, Mr. Marx?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``What assurance have I got that he'll still be
President by 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the Actual FBI File:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) A television viewer wrote to Hoover on June
17, 1960: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that the TV entertainer Groucho Marks (sic) be
investigated as being a Communist. Last night on his program both
my husband and I understood him to pronounce ``The United States''
as ``The United Snakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Groucho and Me,'' he speaks quite affectionately
of Charlie Chaplin, who is a well-known Communist. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Please, Hoover, investigate Groucho Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``Groucho and Me,'' Groucho did indeed
write of being buddies with Chaplin in the early days. But this
involved visiting a house of ill repute, which may not qualify as
comradeship in the strict communist sense: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He was a strange little man _ this Charlie Chaplin. The first
time I met him he was wearing what had formerly been a white collar
and a black bow tie. I can't quite explain his appearance but he
looked a little like a pale priest who had been excommunicated but
was reluctant to relinquish his vestments.
</P>
<P>
   We became real chummy in the ensuing weeks. He was terribly shy,
and I particularly remember a night when we all went to a sporting
house in Salt Lake City just for laughs. The madam took a shine to
Charlie, but he would have none of her, nor did he want any of the
younger girls. Instead he spent the entire evening lying on the
floor playing with the madam's English bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   From the Actual F.B.I. File:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Groucho made fun of the FBI, according to a
1960 bureau memo logging a complaint from a ``You Bet Your Life''
viewer: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (The viewer) called on 2/29/60 to advise that he had been
listening to the captioned program on last Thursday, 2/25/60, on
NBC, Channel 4 and that . . . when this contestant, whose name he
did not recall, stated he had been a bootlegger, Marx asked, ``You
mean you were a bootlegger for the F.B.I.?'' in an apparent effort
to be funny. . . . There was little laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Groucho had his share of clunkers. In
addition, he was frequently irreverent toward the federal
government, as in ``Memoirs of a Mangy Lover'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I was at an obnoxious little dinner party the other evening,
talking about world affairs, when this fellow said suddenly,
``Let's run Groucho Marx for Vice President.'' Naturally I was
touched. I asked, why I should be singled out for this honor? Why
should my friends want me to be Vice President?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' snarled my sponsor, ``the Vice President generally
keeps his mouth shut. It might be an interesting experience for
you.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   I remember about 40 years ago a Vice President made himself
famous merely by announcing that what this country needed was a
good 5-cent cigar. What this country really needs is a good 5-cent
nickel. And barring that, a good 5 percent income tax.

out of the family tavern. Pitcher, slugger, gorger, ladies' man.

difficult-to-get Babe Ruth in our studio. You've been on our wish

got my Playstation Hooters All-Star Babe '99 CD-ROM game to
promote.
</P>
<P>
   King: So many areas to cover. Let's start with Mark McGwire. You
know him?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   King: Great guy, good friend, frequent guest.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: A 6-foot-6 inch weenie. What's he swing, a 34-ounce bat? I
showed him the stick I hit 60 with. Fifty ounces. Big wimp couldn't
lift it. Whined like Ty Cobb when he didn't get invited to my 50th
birthday party at Nathan's.
</P>
<P>
   King: Amazing. Have you talked to Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Talk to him? He's wearing my lucky cup from 1927.
</P>
<P>
   King: Babe, you played fat. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: I'm an endomorph, kid. It's my body type. I couldn't help
it. Dr. Dean Ornish helped me learn not to hate myself for it.
</P>
<P>
   King: So it wasn't the hot dogs?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Ah, that was a lot of hype. Sportswriters saw me eat a
dozen dogs between innings and thought that was all I ate. Mostly I
ate baby carrots and soy burgers.
</P>
<P>
   King: Supermodel food but still a porker. Amazing. Lou Gehrig.
You hated him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Only after his mother made me a sauerbraten with cabbage
that put me in a slump in '31. Couldn't lift a bat or a woman for a
week.
</P>
<P>
   King: Slugging and sweet talk with the one and only Babe Ruth.

</P>
<P>
   King: Lots of critics think that was the worst sports movie
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Can't disagree. But did you see ``Baseketball''? I had to
hear Bob Costas talk about how hard his nipples were. But I loved
``Happy Gilmore.'' Adam Sandler just kills me.
</P>
<P>
   King: Why has nobody portrayed Babe Ruth well on the silver
screen?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: I thought John Goodman would be great. But talk about
endomorphic! He was 70 pounds too fat playing me when I was 40
pounds overweight. And I'll tell you, I wasn't fat as a kid. But
that movie made me look like a hippo at 15.
</P>
<P>
   King: You were great as you in ``Pride of the Yankees.'' If Babe
Ruth could choose an actor to play Babe Ruth, who would it be?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Pacino. Who else?
</P>
<P>
   King: Great choice. Good friend. Frequent guest. Columbus, Ohio,
you're talking to Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Hi, Babe. What do you think is the worst trade ever?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: When that bum Steinbrenner traded Jay Buhner for Ken
Phelps. How could he trade a future superstar for a guy who was out
of baseball in two years?
</P>
<P>
   King: Walla Walla, Washington, hello.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Babe, I hear you were depressed because nobody asked you
to manage in the majors. But you seem happy now. What's your
secret?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: St. John's Wort. And I read the ``Don't Sweat the Small
Stuff'' books.
</P>
<P>
   King: Let's go back. You grew up in Baltimore. Orphanage life
tough?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Nah, I loved it. Learned baseball there. Played the
recorder in the St. Mary's marching band.
</P>
<P>
   King: You were musically inclined?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Kid, you think all I did was hit home runs? I had a
liberal arts education, short as it was.
</P>
<P>
   King: Did you have any quibbles with the Modern Library's list
of the greatest 100 books ever?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: No Toni Morrison. No Wally Lamb. No Dick Schaap.
</P>
<P>
   King: Me, I'd have voted for Wilt Chamberlain's memoir. Babe,
what do you think _ Yankee Stadium on the West Side?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Kid, I live on the West Side and I don't want it there.
Too much traffic. And a billion dollars? Cripes, I built the first
one for $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   King: So you're for keeping it in the Bronx?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: I didn't build it to move it, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   King: You ever meet Rudy Giuliani?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Only long enough to sell him a cap with some old sweat on
it for 50 grand. He thought it was mine. It was really Wally
Pipp's.
</P>
<P>
   King: Don't ever be a stranger, buddy. The name is Babe Ruth.
What a mensch. Tomorrow night from Washington, William Bennett and
Little Richard. Good night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TO: Kenneth W. Starr
</P>
<P>
   FROM: Volumnia Valence, Editor-in-Chief
</P>
<P>
   RE: Manuscript Submission
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for the manuscript of ``Referral,'' your story of
romantic intrigue. We had been looking forward to it, given all the
buzz comparing you to Harold Robbins, Jackie Susann and the other
great masters of what those media philistines keep calling the
``trashy novel.'' We eagerly began reading the original draft, plus
each shipment of pages you keep sending (please stop!).
</P>
<P>
   But I'm afraid it's not for us. ``Referral,'' while an ambitious
first effort, simply does not meet the standards we like to
maintain here at Soaring Stallion Press.
</P>
<P>
   First, it needs editing. It is simply not sexy to describe the
same sex act three times, and then follow with five footnotes about
said act. We get the idea the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Actually our senior editor, Jane V.V. Voom, who specializes in
serial-killer romance mysteries, found your constant reiteration of
the same facts ``disturbing and possibly pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, that's just typical Jane! But your repetitions do
destroy the natural rhythms of lust. Sex builds. It arcs. It
climaxes. It is supposed to be fun. You make it sound a bit like
homework.
</P>
<P>
   And so unpleasantly tawdry! During an initial courtship scene,
your Monica character flashes her lingerie: ``In the course of
flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him
the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we have absolutely nothing against thong underwear. In our
recent best-seller, ``The Golddiggers of Grenada,'' Letitia
Lawrence wears a thong dotted with miniature tropical drinks. Of
course, a good heroine should wear a thong _ but not until much
later!
</P>
<P>
   We would prefer a ``meet cute'' scenario. If she must work in
his office, perhaps one could knock over a filing cabinet onto the
other? Something sudden and less obvious. Have you read our
top-selling title, ``The Empty Duplex''? In this wonderful novel,
Federica and Bartholomew meet when they discover they have the same
real estate agent. We aren't introduced to Federica's thong until
page 300. And Bartholomew finds it even later.
</P>
<P>
   Believe us, if you begin with a thong, you have nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point, Ken: We want somewhere to go. We crave
emotional depths from your characters. We want to believe that
Bill, like Bartholomew, would give up a whole semiconductor empire
for the right girl. Wars come and go, the real estate market
crashes, landlords renege, but passion always triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that when you rewrite moments like this one:
``[They) briefly discussed an antique book that she had dropped
off. . . . With the book, she enclosed a letter telling the
President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him at
least once.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken, that's cold! Remember, always show, don't tell. Give us an
inkling of inner life. And for God's sake don't make the woman
plead for sex in a letter; it's undignified. If your characters are
going to resist complete consummation _ a choice I should tell you
does lower your chances of getting published _ at least they should
feel a few pangs of desire.
</P>
<P>
   How about this instead:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The leather bindings cracked beneath his fingers. A first
edition, never read, flown in from a Beverly Hills dealer. He was
no fool. He knew how much such a book would cost. And his office
hadn't even paid her a salary. Thank God she came from money. She
would never need to sell the rights to their story. She would
always buy him thoughtful gifts that neither of them would have the
time to read or fully absorb. He leafed through the yellowing
pages. There was a letter inside, sealed with wax. He looked up.
``I don't care what this letter says, Monica,'' he told her. ``I
must have you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said firmly. ``And if not now, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We want a hero who doesn't need to read directions or take
polls. We want a heroine who follows her gut. But you give us a
hero who worries about what the world will think and a heroine who
worries about what the hero will think. (Meanwhile, given the close
proximity of Betty the secretary, the reader is distracted with
thoughts of what she must think.)
</P>
<P>
   We want  &UR; passionate &LR;  thoughts, cloaked in  &UR; passionate  &LR; 
language. Although we have been editing risque works of fiction for
years, your lurid yet clinical style upset everyone here
enormously. You tally and clock events as if each encounter were
not unique and timeless. You state there are ``nine incidents''
involving ``breasts.'' Why not just say: ``She held him to her
cleavage again. And again . . .''?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder too: Can't she hold him to her cleavage in a more
rapturous setting? Why set every scene in that irritating office
with all those interruptions? He is powerful. She is rich. You
would think they could get a hotel room. A dusky beach at sunset.
Or at least a bed of some kind. Lovers ought to be wrapped in
silken sheets, or in resilient animal rugs or hearth coverings. The
intern character stays on the floor too much, while the president
sits in his chair for long periods, which makes the reader worry
about his bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, your characters are strange. Your hero does not seem to
know what sexual relations are. Your heroine does not seem to
accept that he is the leader of the free world. Instead of jewels
and vows, they exchange a hat pin, a letter opener embellished with
a frog, an Annie Lennox recording and, ultimately, a series of
tacky souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they seem completely incapable of having a romantic
affair as we at Soaring Stallion Press define romantic affair. And
we have been in the business of defining it for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   I should warn you that yours is not the kind of fare that would
normally be found in a mainstream bookstore. You may want to try a
softcore porn publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps writing is not your vocation after all. Have you
considered law school?

PENTAGON PLANNERS GIVE NEW MEANING TO `OVER THE TOP'

 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a military plan of staggering dimensions,
designed by the Pentagon to be so over-the-top that it would never
gain the approval of the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Reagan White House in 1985, mounting evidence of
Libya's support for anti-American terrorism had created something
akin to panic, and calls went out for dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   So planners in the Pentagon went into overdrive to offer the
Middle Eastern equivalent of the Normandy invasion. The military
told the National Security Council it would require a ground
invasion by at least a couple of Army divisions, with support from
several of the Navy's prized carrier battle groups _ and an
alliance with the Egyptian military thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 invasion of Libya would now be in the lesson plans of
every high school history teacher in America if it had actually
taken place. Instead, the stillborn invasion is a classic example
of Washington's propensity to gin up contingency plans for
seemingly otherworldly operations that never get the green light.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a permanent infrastructure in the U.S. national
security apparatus that does nothing but plan for every conceivable
crisis, often with little or no hope that the plans will be taken
seriously by senior policy-makers or the president.
</P>
<P>
   So when the CIA and the Pentagon considered a high-risk raid
into Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
believed to be the mastermind behind the U.S. Embassy bombings in
Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, their planning efforts hardly
represented a rogue operation by cowboys in the Pentagon's
basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the problems you face are really hard, and sometimes
people stretch to figure out how to solve them,'' observed a former
director of Central Intelligence, Robert Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether such radical plans ever get the green light
depends on the grim calculus of risk versus reward _ the possible
cost in U.S. soldiers' lives versus the opportunity to take out a
terrorist bent on killing American civilians. Above all, it depends
on the will of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the scheme to abduct bin Laden, the plan never
even reached President Clinton. Instead, it was shelved by the
director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Few presidents have been willing to accept the risks of giving
the go-ahead to acts of derring-do by U.S. commandos except in
times of war or when other options have been exhausted. Indeed, the
specter of past failures, from the botched 1980 mission to rescue
the hostages in Iran to the bloody 1993 ambush of U.S. Army Rangers
on a mission to capture a local warlord in Somalia, haunt the
planners of new covert missions and the policy-makers who consider
them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in almost every international crisis, a wide array of
contingency plans _ including the kind of aggressive military
actions that would startle the public if it were known they were
under discussion _ are roughed out by military and intelligence
planners. Sometimes, the planning is done simply to sketch out all
options for the president and his senior advisers, and to highlight
the possible consequences of aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the plans are so out of the range of possibility that
they are not even presented to senior policy makers, let alone the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will say this is a great plan, but we're not
even going to run it up the flagpole,'' said one former senior
intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about the inter-agency process is that it
imposes a reality test on these plans,'' added Gates. ``We used to
call it the laugh test _ can you present this at the NSC without
people giggling?'' (To be sure, some still slip past even that test
at the National Security Council; otherwise the world would never
have heard of Iran-Contra.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States has developed a sizable, largely secret
infrastructure to plan and train for such contingencies, just in
case. Today, the planning often relates to the global battle
against terrorism, and involves proposed covert actions against
terrorist organizations and their leaders like bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Persian Gulf war, when military commanders and
CIA officials became convinced of the need for closer coordination
between their services, planning for covert missions has been
conducted jointly. Today, training and planning for such operations
often involves the Joint Special Operations Command, which includes
elite commando units like the Delta Force and the Navy's SEAL Team
Six, working closely with the Military and Special Programs
Division inside the CIA's Directorate of Operations, the agency's
clandestine espionage arm.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Justice Department are also intimately involved in
planning and assessing missions designed to capture individual
terrorists and bring them back to the United States to face
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. military doctrine calling for the use of
overwhelming force to minimize U.S. casualties and the demands for
nearly perfect intelligence about the target heavily influence such
planning. They tend to guarantee that most proposed covert missions
never get off the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for instance, the CIA and the military planned a raid
to capture the Bosnian Serb leader and indicted war criminal
Radovan Karadzic, but the plan was never approved in part because
of the fear of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military tends to present contingency plans that involve
significant U.S. forces to minimize casualties and end operations
quickly,'' Gates said. ``To civilian leaders, that would seem like
more than is needed, but very few civilian leaders are willing to
go ahead with an operation with less force than the military says
is needed. A civilian would take a very high risk if he directed
the military to undertake an operation with less.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Aspin learned that lesson when he was defense secretary,
after the costly raid in Somalia; he was criticized for having
failed to provide adequate armor support for the U.S. troops in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The extravagant planning also serves as a ``gut check'' for the
civilians, Gates argues. ``It's a test that allows the military to
ask: `Are they serious about wanting this? Or are they just playing
political games?'''

   BEIJING _ Although the world has focused its attention on the
one-sided battle between the Chinese Communist government and the
political dissidents who press for radical change, there is also a
large population here of intellectuals, many of them scholars or
former officials, who work openly to nudge the system in a more
democratic direction.
</P>
<P>
   These people, known as liberals, borrow a term from pingpong to
describe their strategy for stretching the bounds of political
debate. They speak of hitting a ``touch-ball'' _ one that just
grazes the edge of the table. A risky hit, yet one that scores.
</P>
<P>
   In this metaphor, the ping-pong table stands for the
ideologically correct thoughts of the moment. Impatient
progressives, as they write and speak, try to incorporate as much
of the day's official jargon and ideas as they believe, or can
stomach, while probing as far as they dare on issues like free
speech, rule of law and political pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the size of the table is constantly
changing, and such people spend enormous amounts of time monitoring
official talk and watching the experience of colleagues to figure
out just where the limits are at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hit it just right, then you can get away with saying
something new or provocative,'' said a Beijing law professor. ``If
you miss the table, you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose'' might mean anything from a reprimand at work to forced
retirement, with a de facto ban on publication. Or the writer could
descend into the ranks of the ``dissidents,'' who are harassed and
detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the liberal scholars and officials are not to
be confused with the beleaguered democracy dissidents, who push
more directly, persistently and actively for radical change. The
liberals hope instead that their more academic discourse will plant
the seeds of a more open system.
</P>
<P>
   Because every camp, from Communist leaders to dissidents, uses
terms like democracy and the rule of law, it can be hard to tell
who really stands for what.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, where ideas drove a revolution and words can bring
jail, people are exquisitely attuned to linguistic cues. What might
seem verbal hairsplitting in America is taken here with utmost
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   In today's parlance, for example, the need for ``political
structural reform'' is voiced by Communist leaders, starting with
the president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin. This seems to
mean things like improving government efficiency, ending corruption
and better enforcing party-dictated laws.
</P>
<P>
   Those with more Western notions of democracy often leave out the
word ``structural,'' and talk of ``political reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's definition of democracy seems, again, to focus on
improving ``oversight'' and ``supervision'' of bureaucrats, to make
sure they honestly carry out Beijing's edicts. (Genuine direct
elections are limited to administrative jobs in villages.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus at the Communist Party Congress last fall, Jiang could
declare, according to the official English translation, ``We should
promote democracy, improve the legal system and build a socialist
country ruled by law,'' even as he reaffirmed the Four Cardinal
Principles that the late Deng Xiaoping issued in 1979: keeping to
the socialist road, upholding the dictatorship of the proletariat,
upholding the leadership of the Communist Party and upholding
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung Thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's reference to a ``country ruled by law'' in that speech
last fall caused no end of analysis among the cognoscenti, because
of the particular Chinese characters used in the official
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders, and emperors before them, had long used one
term to call for what is often translated as ``rule by law'' or ``a
strengthening of the legal system.'' This term is taken to mean
improving the use of law and institutional channels to carry out
party rule _ an improvement over the highly personal rule of the
past, but hardly Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, liberals have used another term _ which sounds
the same in spoken Mandarin but is written with a different
character; this one is often translated as ``rule of law,'' meaning
that the entire nation, including the party, is governed under the
law.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent essay, Li Shenzhi _ a former vice president of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who was sacked for not
supporting the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrations _ writes
that there is a big difference: Under ``rule of law,'' he says,
``no one is above the law or exempted by it.'' Not even a party
chief.
</P>
<P>
   So heads turned when the official written Chinese version of
Jiang's speech used that second formulation. Was Jiang floating a
serious change in attitude? Or was his speechwriter merely toying
with the country's intellectuals?
</P>
<P>
   Li's essay appears in a recent book, ``Political China: Facing
the Era of Choosing a New Structure'' (China Today Publishing
House), in which Li shows himself to be an aggressive touch-ball
player. At one point, he writes that China ``should quickly adopt
the common concept of the world: `Human rights are civil rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The book, which includes articles by scholars and former
officials, exemplifies the touch-ball approach. The clear intent is
to foster discussion of serious change.
</P>
<P>
   Yet facing the title page is an artfully selected quotation from
Deng, whose vaguest utterances, now elevated to the level of
theory, are used by Jiang to legitimize his program. The quote
reads, ``If you only carry out economic system reform and not
political system reform, then economic system reform will not
work.'' It continues, ``Whether all of our reforms ultimately
succeed is dependent on political system reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent homage may signal that the book is not intended to
challenge the system brazenly in the manner of an impudent
dissident like the exiled Wei Jingsheng.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the book ever include words like ``multiparty
politics'' or ``direct election of national leaders.'' Aiming that
far off the table would have guaranteed that the book would be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   The book prudently includes a spectrum of views, including an
essay by a close adviser to President Jiang, Wang Huning. He calls
for ``political structural reform'' in order to build a ``socialist
political system with Chinese characteristics'' _ under the party's
leadership. That, of course, lands well in the middle of the
ping-pong table.
</P>
<P>
   A spray of touch-balls, in contrast, comes from Liu Junning, a
political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who
prefers exploring ``liberal democracy'' to ``people's democracy.''
In one essay, ``The Market Economy and Limited government,'' he
writes, ``Individual property rights and a free market economy will
not automatically lead to democracy, but without property rights
and markets, it's absolutely impossible to have democracy.'' He
also writes, ``Guaranteeing property rights not only needs
democracy, it also needs constitutional government and rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   But many liberals find it puzzling and frightening that the
authorities recently arrested one of the two journalists who were
the book's editors. Shi Binhai, a senior editor of The China
Economic Times, was detained Sept. 5 by state security agents who
gave his family no reason. Shi's associates say they do not believe
his involvement with the book, which continues to sell in Chinese
bookstores, was the reason. Apparently it was through some other,
undisclosed, activity that Shi missed the edge of the table.

<P>
   The Democratic candidate for governor in South Carolina, Jim
Hodges, has chosen as his logo a drawing of the back of a school
bus and the slogan, ``It's all about our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Republican Gov. George W. Bush is running a television
advertisement that declares, ``No goal is more important than
making sure all Texas schoolchildren are able to read.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters ended 30 years of bilingual education by
referendum in June and face another initiative over reduced class
size in November.
</P>
<P>
   And across the country this election season, scores of
candidates for Senate and House seats, like the Democrats Charles
Schumer of New York and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, are focusing
on schools, vowing that if sent to Washington, they will get the
federal government involved in cutting the nation's class sizes,
repairing school buildings and making them safer for learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a single motivating force in my public life,''
said Rep. Glenn Poshard, an Illinois Democrat running for governor,
in a comment that is echoed by candidates everywhere, ``it is to
provide a meaningful education to every child in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   While education has long been one of the voters' top five or six
concerns, along with crime, drugs, the economy and foreign threats,
the issue is frequently cited by pollsters this year as the voters'
primary focus, especially in the many states with gubernatorial
elections. Democrats are emphasizing their traditional stake in
education policy while Republicans, whose attention has been
focused on the Clinton scandal, are seeking to make the education
issue their own.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of all this attention is far from clear,
education advocates say. Is the talk of standards, class size and
safety leading to improved education or merely serving candidates
as ``family values'' campaign themes?
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in
Washington and a leading conservative voice in education, says the
vast majority of new state standards for students, instituted under
political pressure, are too low to be meaningful and the bulk of
campaign talk about education is useless or misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in so many other policy debates, much of the education
campaigning is based on focus groups and political consultant
input,'' Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Clinton's and other people's class-size reduction
scheme,'' he said. ``It is costly and problematic. Costly, because
you have to hire more teachers and payroll is already the largest
portion of the budget. Problematic, because there is so little
evidence that, apart from kindergarten and first grade, class-size
reduction produces any better education.''
</P>
<P>
   Finn added: ``American class sizes have been shrinking for 50
years. Many countries that beat the pants off of us in
international comparisons have much larger class sizes than we do.
The biggest immediate effect of reducing class size in most places
will be to draw more unqualified people into teaching and suck good
teachers out of urban into suburban schools. Nonetheless, everyone
is proposing class-size reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the focus on education has produced results.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schwartz, president of Achieve Inc., a bipartisan and
corporate-government partnership to improve schools, says efforts
have paid off in states like Kentucky, Maryland, Washington and
Oregon, where reasonable standards have been established,
businesses are focusing on applicants' school records in hiring,
and accountability procedures have been instituted for schools.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that teacher quality has come under greater scrutiny as
well, with many states raising the bar for teacher certification
and some, like Massachusetts, using budget surpluses to lure better
candidates into the teaching profession with signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that in a significant number of states, the
political conversation about education is qualitatively different
than it was in the past,'' Schwartz said. ``This is not just the
equivalent of family values as a campaign theme. Many states have
not only adopted standards but put in place assessments and systems
of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Albjerg Graham, a professor and former dean of the
Harvard Graduate School of Education, said: ``The most important
result of this prolonged debate on education has been the
widespread conviction that children of all social classes are now
expected to learn academic material. The idea that educational
achievement is for everybody is revolutionary. That's real
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over education often tracks the conservative-liberal
divide over school governance and standards. Generally,
conservatives favor local control and more rigorous standards,
while liberals tend toward a national approach and, while mindful
of the need for standards, they emphasize inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe we are going to achieve national
standards on education because liberals oppose standards and
conservatives oppose national,'' mused Arthur Levine, president of
Teachers College at Columbia University, who has been receiving a
growing number of calls from politicians seeking briefings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, what is striking about the debate is that if there
is not agreement on the means, there is near-universal consensus on
the ends of this education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditionalists have won,'' remarked Larry Cuban, an
education professor at Stanford University. ``New math and
whole-language reading are in retreat. Today there are more
phonics, more multiplication tables, more tests. There is a
consensus between the public and officials that the basic,
traditional model is the one to pursue. Whatever experimentation is
occurring today challenges the boundaries far less than two to
three decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that in their public appearances both Democrats and
Republicans are saying rather similar things about education _
vowing to provide more of it with better equipment, safer
classrooms and better teachers _ with their disagreements focused
on how to get there: whether to confront teachers' unions or
cooperate with them, raise taxes or shift revenues, focus on
traditional public schools or on alternatives, like charter schools
or government vouchers to pay for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the voters to be unsure which path is the more
efficient _ they tend to favor most options that sound like they
would lead to improvements _ suggesting that candidates are
competing over driving home their message that they care.
</P>
<P>
   One reason there seems to be such a consensus on education is
that the economic rationale for schooling has triumphed. As the
economy has shifted from an industrial to a white-collar base,
Americans have become increasingly persuaded that their children's
personal financial success will depend on what kind of education
they receive. This means that campaigning about education does not
displace campaigning about the economy _ it is a proxy for it.
</P>
<P>
   But economics aside, the prominence of education as a political
issue results from a confluence of factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, ever since the explosive 1983 report ``A Nation at Risk''
that attacked the quality of American public schools,
policy-makers, including President George Bush and President
Clinton, have focused on schooling, and the impact of their
sustained attention is being felt. Second, the 1990s, dominated by
the breakup of the Soviet Union, a rising stock market and a
plummeting urban crime rate, shifted the nation's focus away from
traditional front-runner issues, granting education more attention.
Third, the demographically powerful baby-boom generation has
children throughout the school system, so the boomers' attention is
focused on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the military draft ended, the public school system
is one of the remaining places for large-scale inculcation of
values. The system has had to bear a growing share of societal
goals _ fighting poverty, absorbing immigrants, preparing the
public for a multiracial future and instilling in the young a sense
of moral order and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   On this last point, many experts see voter concern over
education to be largely anxiety over their children's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astute politicians realize that a lot of us are worried about
our kids,'' said Theodore Sizer, an author and advocate of school
reform. ``The moral dimension and the safety dimension overlap.
More and more families are frightened by what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Glenn, a professor of education policy at Boston
University, agrees. ``There is a diffuse, general idea that America
is going to hell on issues of moral character,'' he said. ``Most
parents say they are worried about discipline. What kind of kids
will my kids be in contact with? Are my kids going to come home as
strangers with different values than mine? Conservatives talk about
school choice because they see the current monopoly of content to
be relativistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also focus on school choice because they think it
will improve schools generally. They say that one of the most
positive results of all the recent attention on education has been
to open up school systems to competition from charter schools and
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, President Reagan tried to free markets from
a lot of impediments like unions and taxation,'' remarked former
Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, who is expected to seek the
Republican presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``His idea was, if we free the market, we can get a good
economy,'' Lamar said. ``That's what we need to do with schools. We
need to free the schools from all those impediments like unions and
outdated practices. Let them flourish. America does best when we
pursue freedom and choice and allow ingenuity to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a Republican president to lead the charge and
give courage to governors and education entrepreneurs,'' he said,
``sometime in the next 5 to 10 years we would see real results with
higher academic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the issue differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were serious about our educational problems, we would go
see what other nations are doing,'' said Marc Tucker of the
National Center on Education and the Economy. ``Not one of them is
using vouchers as the secret of its success. They set high
standards and have exams and curriculum to match. There is very
little choice in the curriculum. This is true from Singapore to
Japan to Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is universally applicable,'' he said. ``Yet it doesn't
apply here? That's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, tests and standards are slowly being installed in
many states. In New York, for example, high school students will
soon have to pass Regents examinations on more and more subjects to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   All experts questioned said the real political test would be how
voters react when, or if, many children fail such exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is for high test scores till their kids get low test
scores,'' Sizer remarked. ``There is a kind of unreality to the
policy debate. Are we really going to shut down schools that don't
perform? I think the rhetoric and self-righteous table pounding
will stop when the reality sets in. The attention will shift to a
more varied approach. If all this attention doesn't lead ultimately
to improved education, we have certainly blown it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EKET, Nigeria _ Denny Sansom of Mobil Oil has the ocean behind
him, 7 million restive Nigerians of the Niger River Delta in front
of him, huge reserves of oil beneath him and hundreds of thousands
of angry complaints against his corporation threatening to sink
him.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began on Jan. 12, he recalled. Sansom, a Texan who
is Mobil's operations manager, walked into his 6:45 a.m. staff
meeting and was told that despite full production at Mobil's 57
offshore wells, oil was not reaching shore. ``Shut it down!'' he
hollered. ``Shut everything!''
</P>
<P>
   The order came too late. A 24-inch underwater pipeline from
Mobil's Idaho production platform three-and-a-half miles offshore
had snapped. Flying 26 miles out over the Atlantic in a helicopter
that afternoon, Sansom saw 26 miles of oil. ``The slick was moving
like a giant ship,'' he said. ``That thing about killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Nigerian coast, the spilled oil has now become a
subject of vehement dispute, a catalyst for pent-up claims fed by
poverty and state neglect. In few places on earth do the West's
richest corporations and millions of the world's poorest people rub
shoulders with such intensity or such potentially explosive
consequences as in the Niger Delta, the fifth-largest source of
America's imported fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very turbulent,'' said Ernest Ukocho, a community
leader in the villages surrounding Mobil's operations at Eket. ``We
are trying to maintain calm, but there has been some rioting. The
fact is, everyone wants a piece of the Mobil cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil _ 40,000 barrels of it, or roughly one-sixth of the
giant Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska _ drifted west, thus avoiding
nearby Cameroonian waters to the east and an international fiasco.
The fiercely secretive former regime of Nigerian Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died in June, also helped keep the Mobil spill largely out of
the news.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Niger Delta everyone quickly knew of it. Sansom has
been held hostage, repeatedly rebuked and now spends 70 percent of
his time on ``community issues'' _ essentially trying to stop
resentment from turning to rioting.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria approaches a delicate transition from military rule
to democracy, which is supposed to take place next year, the
delta's long-festering problems pose the threat of widespread
violence. In the wetlands, the world's largest mangrove swamp,
unrest now seems close to boiling over, with sabotage against
pipelines becoming routine and intermittent acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The spill _ dwarfing those caused by sabotage _ made Sansom's
position doubly difficult. Scientific evidence shows that
environmental damage was slight. But for people long subjected to
the stunted development apparently willed on the delta by Nigerian
military governments, that spilled oil was a bonanza beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand these people,'' Sansom said. ``They're poor. So
they think we're all Howard Hughes. One Saturday morning alone, I
had $4.5 billion in claims _ that's 45 percent of the total oil
revenue of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since oil was discovered here 42 years ago by Royal Dutch/Shell,
enormous wealth has been taken from the area by Mobil, Chevron,
Shell, Texaco and other Western companies, and by Nigeria's
generals, who have ruled for 28 of the last 32 years. But, as a
result of apparently gross neglect by the military government that
takes the bulk of the country's oil revenue, life for the people
living in the wetlands has scarcely improved.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa had the temerity to point
this out, demanding compensation on the grounds that the entire
region, and his Ogoni people, remained poor, Nigeria's generals
hanged him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The pretext was a flimsy charge of involvement in a murder,
upheld by a kangaroo court of military officers. The real issue was
_ and remains _ where and how the more than $10 billion Nigeria
receives annually from oil is invested.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other Western leaders expressed indignance
at Saro-Wiwa's execution _ although not enough to impose oil
sanctions on Nigeria, where U.S. investment totals $7 billion.
Three years later, the 7 million delta people _ of whom the Ogoni
form a minority of about 500,000 _ still appear mired in a
paralyzing web.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official at Nigerian National Petroleum Co. conceded,
albeit on condition of anonymity, that after years of taking oil
from the delta and plowing the profits into northern Nigeria _ the
base of the ruling generals _ that policy is increasingly fraught
with risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see an escalation,'' the official said.
``We're taking oil from one part of the country and investing it in
the north. I do not think you can go on taking money from a place
without enhancing life there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, Abacha's successor, has indicated
that he wants reform. He made a conciliatory gesture this month in
releasing several Ogoni prisoners who had been held on charges
similar to those against Saro-Wiwa. But the problems are so
deep-rooted that such gestures are unlikely to have immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of state investment _ Nigerian authorities have
built no schools in the Eket region for several years _ Mobil has
effectively become the local government: the object of all claims,
all hope of jobs, money or investment, all aspirations for
electricity, or hospitals or running water _ and all resentments.
</P>
<P>
   To travel the Eket region _ an area of about 100 square miles
that might reasonably be renamed Mobiland _ is to encounter a
fantastic array of complaints leveled at the U.S. company: gutters
not deep enough; roads and clinics promised but not built;
oil-polluted sea waters now allegedly emptied of fish all the way
to Cameroon; zinc roofs rusting because of the flares; even doors
and walls vibrating from earth tremors allegedly caused by Mobil's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to me asking for Mobil to build a water supply
system'' Sansom said, ``and I say, why don't you go to the water
board and ask the same question? And they say, because the water
board would shoot us!''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``You know, the naira these local governors get from
the military government would not buy you a piece of chewing gum.''
Yet more than 60 percent of the revenue from Mobil's joint venture
goes to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense the oil companies are unfairly criticized: the
government takes over 70 percent of Nigeria's oil revenue and could
clearly have invested more of it in the delta. But Western
companies effectively acquiesced in the region's impoverishment so
long as they could pump oil and get their money out: their push for
``community development'' in recent years, and especially since the
death of Saro-Wiwa, may have come too late.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   To Western oil interests, generally synonymous with Western
political interests, stability has been of paramount importance in
Nigeria: the country's oil is ecologically desirable to America
because it is unusually sulfur-free and strategically desirable
because it represents diversification from Middle Eastern sources.
</P>
<P>
   That stability has been preserved at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of interethnic tensions, and memories of Biafra's
secession in 1967, the northern generals who have governed Nigeria
have mainly sought to keep the delta area poor and backward on the
basis that a region with oil and development might be tempted to go
it alone again. The then-Republic of Biafra comprised much of the
oil-producing region; its independence was quashed in a three-year
war that cost 1 million lives.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies, meanwhile, have long taken the view that
their obligations are met by paying taxes and royalties to the
authorities. Oil production, not regional development, has been
their role. Although this approach is now changing, the delta still
bears heavy scars.
</P>
<P>
   Potholed roads, rundown schools and isolated villages without
running water dot an area that produces over 90 percent of
Nigeria's hard-currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Only the widely resented flares of the oil companies that light
the night sky betray the fact that this land is rich. Because the
oil companies are far more visible in the area than the military
government, they are the main focus of ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were from the delta, I would long ago have joined an
armed struggle,'' said Bola Ige, a prominent Lagos lawyer and
former governor of the southern Oyo state. ``What else can you
reasonably be down there but a guerrilla leader?''
</P>
<P>
   And what else could Mobil's oil spill reasonably provoke, in
such an environment, but dreams of sudden wealth?
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax, Va.-based company, which produces about one-third
of Nigeria's total oil output in a joint venture with the
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Co., moved fast as the oil
seeped into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous interests were at stake: Mobil has more than $2.5
billion invested in Nigeria; the Ubit offshore platform, pumping
250,000 barrels a day, is the company's largest single production
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom took over an emergency command center that he manned
almost uninterruptedly for over a month; helicopters and boats were
deployed to apply dispersants; containment booms and oil skimmers
were used; scientists and environmentalists were rushed in from
Lagos University and the United States to test the degree of
pollution; Mobil announced that it would compensate anyone
suffering injury.
</P>
<P>
   With disaster looming, weather and currents smiled on Mobil. For
a long time the bulk of the oil remained offshore, where warm winds
and the light nature of Nigerian crude favored evaporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Mother Nature and Mobil's highly effective and
targeted response,'' said David Page, a U.S. oil spill expert,
``the shoreline was spared what could have been a very serious
environmental event. The amount of oil that got ashore was minimal,
perhaps 1 percent of the spill, or 400 barrels, certainly no more
than 1,000 barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, a chemistry professor at Bowdoin College in Maine who has
visited Nigeria three times since the spill, says hardly any oil
entered the sensitive mangrove creeks that lace the delta.
Certainly none is visible today. ``I'm not an attorney,'' he added,
``but it's fair to say that because so little oil got ashore, I'd
be very surprised if fishermen's livelihoods were cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is emphatically not the view of hundreds of
thousands of poor Nigerians along the coast. Claims have been
pouring in to the U.S. company from Akwa Ibom state, home to Mobil,
from Delta state, from Cross River , from Bajelsa, from Lagos _
``the entire damn coast,'' in the words of Isong I Akpabio, a Mobil
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At Mobil headquarters in Lagos recently, Celia Onitiri, head of
the legal staff, was unavailable for comment. She was at home and
was said to be suffering from stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we wanted to be fair,'' said Paul Caldwell Jr., chairman
of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, as the company's Nigerian
venture is named. ``But this has turned into a major undertaking
and a big headache. The fact is, the communities look to us to
provide support that they are not getting from the Nigerian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Effiong Ikot, a fisherman and owner of a small business, is
among those who have made claims. He has demanded 490,000 naira of
Mobil _ about $5,700 _ for the loss of fishing nets. He regards
Mobil's offer of about $250 as insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Like other claimants, Ikot brought his bundles of nets to be
inspected by Mobil officials and insurance agents. Once the
inspection was completed, the nets were burned. ``How can I be
happy,'' Ikot said, ``when somebody burns my nets?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the area, the chorus of indignation at the burning of
nets is overwhelming, driven by a sense that, as one local leader,
Chief Daniel Utong, put it, ``this act added injury to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Akpakip, a mother of six, said her business had been
ruined. A single shark net, she said, cost at least $600, and ``how
can I live when my nets have been burned and I've yet to receive
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   But Grace Nwawo, a community affairs official for Mobil in Eket,
insisted that there had been no alternative but to burn the nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were usable,'' she asked, ``why were they brought in?
Where could we have stored them? How could we have found uncorrupt
guards to protect them? How would we have prevented them being sold
to the next village?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma of the nets illustrates Mobil's situation. In
strictly rational terms, the decision to burn them seems sound. But
in the world of poverty and vague fears that surrounds Mobil,
Shell, Texaco, Chevron and other oil companies in the delta,
symbols and fantasy tend to hold sway. And what could be a more
overwhelming symbol of a rich company trampling on poor fishermen
than the burning of their nets?
</P>
<P>
   The tranquil village of Itafre, a collection of mud-and-thatch
homes, lies in the midst of the mangrove swamp about 10 miles from
Mobil's Eket base. Like many settlements, it is inaccessible other
than by boat or helicopter. Mobil has built a school here and tried
_ with limited success _ to develop a cashew-nut farm.
</P>
<P>
   But resentment is strong, especially since the spill. Thomas
Ebitu, the village chief, acknowledged that Mobil had built his
house and the school and started the farm. But what about a road?
And why was the village without electricity? And where was the
running water that Mobil should provide?
</P>
<P>
   The assembled villagers nodded. They were asked if the federal
government might provide some of these services. Mobil, it was
pointed out, is an oil company, not a civil engineering company. It
spends over $8 million a year on improving conditions in delta
villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no government here,'' said Mike Maru, a
fisherman. ``Mobil is the only visible entity. They are making a
lot of money here, and we've been left like monkeys out here in the
swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Maru added that he had lost 350 bundles of nets as a result of
the oil spill and had put in a claim for 300 million naira, or $3.4
million. The figure, in the context of the village, appeared
utterly fantastic. Another fisherman, Monday Smith, said he would
settle for $11,500. Both men said their nets had been burned and
asked how they were expected to live in the absence of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In another village, Okuro Utip, a resident named James Nyoh
stood up and made a half-hour speech. He listed everything that
Mobil should provide: spill compensation, an education endowment, a
health center, a road network, clean water, jobs. The company, he
concluded, owes the village just under $100 million for the spill
alone.
</P>
<P>
   These claims are a very long way from Mobil's estimates. With
oil prices at a low ebb, the company is cutting costs. Of nine
exploration rigs that were operating in Nigerian waters, eight have
been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nwawo said the company believed that a little over $100 was
fair compensation for each lost net. Although some payments will be
higher, Mobil believes most validated claims should be settled by
payments not exceeding $600.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the spill of about $600,000 worth of oil may cost the
company about $40 million _ $10 million in cleanup costs and $30
million to settle the mountain of claims. Payments have started but
are being widely disputed, and the process seems likely to continue
for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom says he is determined to see it through. He is a
practical man, conveying a passionate sense of mission. In 21
months in Eket, he has been struck by the poverty, the lack of
family planning, the absence of state investment, the desperation.
``I want to do more than hold the line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He spends hours with community leaders in an attempt to find
middle ground. He is determined to maintain or increase the money
that Mobil spends annually on community projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planned parenthood is one key,'' he said. ``I had two women in
my office the other day with 28 children. Another key is
diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansom's dreams of a better delta appear to have found an echo.
Despite the flood of claims, chiefs in the surrounding villages
described him as popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny is admired,'' Ikot, the fisherman, said, ``because he
likes to engage in dialogue and he has some good ideas to produce
electricity and bring in investors and use the model that made
Texas rich. Even if he's not on our side, we feel he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The other factor that helps maintain a tenuous peace is clearly
the precedent of the Ogoni, whose region has been hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a warning to us,'' said Ukocho, the community leader,
who like most people around Eket is a member of the Ibibio ethnic
group. ``The military almost wiped them out. So now we think twice
about taking the law into our own hands.''  &QL;

CLINTON AND STARR, A MUTUAL ADMONITION SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Aug. 3, in the White House Map Room, President
Clinton rolled up his shirt sleeve in the presence of an agent of
the FBI and a prosecutor from the office of the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. The White House physician, Dr.
Connie Mariano, drew a vial of the president's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton considered it the ultimate indignity in a year of public
humiliations, a friend said. Starr would soon match the president's
DNA with a semen stain on a navy blue dress and would be able to
prove beyond almost all doubt that Clinton had engaged in some type
of sexual activity with Monica Lewinsky. Seven months of the
president's lies were about to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they took the blood from his arm,'' the friend said last
week, ``that's when it really hit home.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment in the Map Room was a culmination of years of
personal animosity and corrosive bitterness between Clinton and
Starr. Associates of both men say that their hatred _ and these
friends say that hatred is not too strong a word _ repeatedly
clouded their judgment and led to excesses on both sides that have
permanently tarnished both reputations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Lewinsky came to the attention of investigators,
Starr had spent 41 months investigating a variety of matters known
collectively as Whitewater. Although none of those issues were
included in Starr's impeachment referral to Congress, he and his
prosecutors had concluded that the Clintons and their lawyers had
sought to frustrate the Whitewater inquiry with legal challenges
and an aggressive, anti-Starr public relations strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allegations about Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the
president contributed to Starr's distrust and his suspicions that
the White House had sought to hush her up, as he believed the
Clintons had with previous witnesses in the Whitewater
investigation, according to interviews with associates of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton has acknowledged that anger at Starr colored his
response to the investigation, including his initial denials and
his Aug. 17 speech to the nation acknowledging an improper
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern _ a
speech his aides now say they view as a major blunder.
</P>
<P>
   In an illustration of the reciprocal frustration that keeps
driving the crisis forward, that speech and the grand jury
appearance earlier in the day that sparked Clinton's fury caused
Starr to include far more scathing detail in the report he later
submitted to Congress, according to prosecutors in Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   So intense is Clinton's obsession with Starr that he has gone so
far as to tell several members of his administration that the
prosecutor was partly to blame for his affair with Ms. Lewinsky,
according to an official who heard the remarks. Clinton told these
associates that he was so angry about the intrusiveness of Starr's
inquiries that he sought comfort in a relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the president told an associate recently, he wakes up
every day angry at Starr, not only for cornering him on the
Lewinsky matter but for revealing the excruciating details of what
he did with Ms. Lewinsky that mortified his wife and daughter,
according to several presidential aides.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton blames Starr for damaging his chances to win a place
among the great presidents, according to a friend to whom the
president made this complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's defenders admit that he, too, has been blinded by his
distaste for Clinton and has committed excesses in his desire to
hold the president accountable.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's 445-page report to Congress, packed
with almost pornographic sexual detail and damning commentary on
the president's motives, is the most glaring example of
prosecutorial overkill, some of Starr's associates say.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been others _ the parading of first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton past a phalanx of cameras into the federal
courthouse in Washington in January 1996; the threat, leaked to
reporters, to name Bruce Lindsey, the president's closest
confidant, an unindicted co-conspirator in a trial that ended in
speedy acquittals; the ostentatious display of the 36 boxes of
impeachment evidence on the steps of the Capitol the week before
last; the harsh treatment of the president in his Aug. 17
videotaped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought from day one, as I think today, that this was bad
for the country,'' said one of Starr's defenders who now questions
his tactics. ``Sometimes you have to exercise prosecutorial
discretion.'' Even though this defender of Starr said he believed
the president was guilty of significant misconduct, he said, ``the
cost to the country far outweighs the value of proving it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Starr denied that he or his office was motivated
by animosity toward the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made this personal,'' said Charles Bakaly III.
``We took an oath to uphold the law and we are doing that in a
professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   While many believe that Clinton demeaned the presidency with the
Lewinsky affair, some argue that Starr's obsession with the
president's sex life has done even more to harm the institution.
Starr argues in his report that he was forced to pile detail upon
salacious detail because of the president's persistent mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's experience with years of Clinton's evasions, court
challenges and clever legalisms compelled him to include such
detail to make an incontrovertible case of perjury, his allies say.
The same allies also wondered last week whether Starr and his
prosecutors had other motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Clinton disrespected the dignity of his office by
doing these things, making them public compounds the problem,'' one
associate of Starr said. ``One could argue that Starr has
contributed to it by making all this public as he did, for the
wrong motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job and his place in history are in jeopardy. Starr's
reputation is in tatters. It was, said one former White House
lawyer, a ``mutual suicide.''

   The First Shot?
</P>
<P>
   `Your Boy's Getting Rolled'
</P>
<P>
   James Carville claims in his coming book about Starr, ``... And
the Horse He Rode In On,'' that he had an encounter with Starr
almost a year before he was appointed Whitewater independent
counsel, replacing a moderate Republican, Robert Fiske.
</P>
<P>
   Carville, one of Clinton's closest political associates, says in
the book that he met Starr in October 1993, in the USAir executive
lounge at Washington National Airport, although at the time he had
no idea who Starr was. Carville recalled that a stranger walked up
to him and ``started spouting an unsolicited and shameful tirade
against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your boy's getting rolled,'' Carville said the stranger said
ominously to him before walking away.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he realized that Starr would be the new independent
counsel investigating Clinton, Carville returned his White House
pass and resigned his consulting post with the Democratic National
Committee so that he could attack Starr full time.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Leon Panetta, then the White House chief of
staff, Carville said that the appointment of Starr was ``a historic
and unconscionable violation of fairness and justice, and that his
appointment has been engineered by fanatical opponents of the
president and his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But Panetta, on the advice of Lloyd Cutler, then White House
counsel, persuaded Carville to stay. They told him that Starr was a
reasonable man and that attacking him would serve only to worsen
relations between the office of the independent counsel and the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Carville reluctantly agreed, a decision he now says was the
biggest personal mistake of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton rapidly came to share Carville's view. Mrs. Clinton
became convinced that Starr had set his sights on indicting her, or
at least embarrassing her. Clinton was furious at the treatment of
many of his friends and associates in Arkansas, who he believed
were mistreated by Starr's agents and indicted on trumped-up
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him rant about Starr on lots of occasions,'' said
Jane Sherburne, the former deputy White House counsel who
coordinated the Clintons' defense in the Whitewater investigation
from 1995 to 1997. ``He felt a deep sense of outrage about how
Starr was trampling through the lives of really tangential
witnesses in Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the early days of the inquiry, it was Mrs. Clinton who
felt the most hostility toward the independent counsel, Ms.
Sherburne said. And Ms. Sherburne said the feeling in the
independent counsel's office was apparently mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``From early 1995 on, I saw a hardening, a deteriorating in the
relationship, but it was much more focused on Hillary _ the venom,
the conviction she was a liar, a determination to get her that they
just exuded in every conversation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherburne recounted a conversation with Starr in which she
asked that prosecutors interview Mrs. Clinton at the White House
rather than subject her to a courthouse spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr just clasped his hands together and said, `I have
complete respect for the dignity of the White House and the first
lady, but I see this as a serious matter and she should be before
the grand jury,''' Ms. Sherburne said. ``It was unjustified
grandstanding. As we have seen from subsequent events, he is
capable of presenting information in a politically charged way to
inflict the maximum damage, whether legal or political.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, Carville began a campaign to raise questions
about the integrity of Starr and his assistants. Carville's efforts
were not lost on Starr, who soon realized that he was engaged not
merely in a legal inquiry but in what Carville has often described
as a war.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was one of the commanders, pressing aides daily to
find negative material on Starr and make sure it got into the hands
of reporters, according to a former White House official involved
in the effort. ``She was continually frustrated that progress on
that front did not happen more quickly,'' this official said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Carville, White House officials and Democratic Party researchers
delved into Starr's legal clients, the political affiliations of
groups he spoke to, the financial interests of his central
witnesses and the political ideology of his lieutenants. Much of
this material did find its way into newspapers and later into
online magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was disturbed by questions about his ties to conservative
groups, his outside law clients and his numerous speaking
engagements, said a White House official who dealt with him in this
period.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady
</P>
<P>
   Starr Subpoenas Hillary Clinton
</P>
<P>
   For many White House aides, any hope of a civil relationship
with Starr ended abruptly on Jan. 22, 1996. On that day, Starr
served Mrs. Clinton with a subpoena to appear before a federal
grand jury to answer questions about the reappearance in the White
House of her long-missing billing records from the Rose law firm in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Mrs. Clinton strode into the federal courthouse
here, besieged by reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   With a tight smile, she said afterward, ``I tried to be as
helpful as I could in their investigation efforts.'' But it was at
that point that the Clintons' legal defense team decided to be
anything but cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``His decision to humiliate the first lady was a turning
point,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the president's senior adviser. ``The
president had heard everything about what a reasonable man Starr
was, but he saw the only purpose of that grand jury appearance was
to intentionally hurt the first lady. For the president, that was
the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, Clinton's feelings toward Starr were
affirmed when he saw photographs of Susan McDougal, his former
business partner in the Whitewater land venture in Arkansas, led to
prison in handcuffs and leg irons for refusing to testify against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vented his anger about Mrs. McDougal's treatment
privately, but White House aides repeatedly warned him not to
discuss the matter in public. He was far ahead in his presidential
race against Bob Dole, they said, and no good would come of
answering any Whitewater questions.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent counsel's office asserted that Clinton, in
television interviews, did not rule out a pardon for Mrs. McDougal,
thereby perhaps encouraging her to maintain her silence. Clinton's
lawyers called accusations that he tried to insert himself into the
case ``reckless and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, a sometime political adviser to the president, said
that Clinton ignored the advice to never discuss the case in
public, and allowed his hostility to Starr to affect his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously hates Starr with every fiber of his being,''
Morris said in an interview. ``After being deposed by some of
Starr's people, Clinton told me he'd never been with seamier,
dirtier, viler, uglier people. He said he felt like taking a
shower.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Telephone Call
</P>
<P>
   A Change of Focus, From Land to Sex
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Starr's investigation appeared to be drawing to
a quiet conclusion. At the White House, senior aides were convinced
that Starr's prosecutors had come up empty. But on Jan. 12, Starr's
inquiry was abruptly and permanently altered by a telephone call
from Linda Tripp, a Pentagon employee whom Starr's prosecutors had
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp told Starr that she had recorded conversations that
proved the president had had a sexual relationship with a White
House intern and tried to cover it up. According to one Starr ally,
Mrs. Tripp's accusations were seized upon by prosecutors as ``a
gift from the gods,'' an opportunity to target the president for
possible crimes that were weeks old, rather than 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's information confronted Starr with a choice. He
could refer the accusations to the Justice Department and recommend
the appointment of another independent counsel. Or he could ask the
court to grant him jurisdiction to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no debate,'' one Starr ally said. ``Everyone wanted
this one, and no one was going to let it get away.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior Justice Department lawyer said last week that the
department had ``no choice'' but to allow Starr to go forward. ``I
don't think it was a viable option for us to refer it to someone
else,'' said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``We were boxed in'' by the evidence that Starr presented, the
lawyer said. But he added that ``we did get a glimpse of Starr's
zealousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno immediately referred the Tripp
accusations to a three-judge panel with a recommendation that Starr
lead the inquiry. In a matter of hours, the panel granted
jurisdiction to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But the tenuous connection that had won Starr jurisdiction
further infuriated the Clintons and deepened their belief that the
independent counsel's office was out to get them, their friends
say. ``The president just went ballistic,'' said a member of
Clinton's legal team, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a character in a novel,'' Clinton told Sidney
Blumenthal, a White House political aide, according to Blumenthal's
grand jury testimony. ``I feel like somebody who was surrounded by
an oppressive force that is creating a lie about me and I can't get
the truth out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Can Play
</P>
<P>
   White House Goes on the Attack
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the Lewinsky inquiry becoming public on Jan. 21,
prosecutors were confronted with a pivotal decision _ either
quickly offer Ms. Lewinsky immunity to get her to testify about her
sexual encounters with Clinton, or move on without her testimony
and turn over every stone to prove that the president and Ms.
Lewinsky had a sexual relationship and that the president and
others conspired to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   There were lengthy, heated debates in the office over what
course to take. One camp wanted to either indict Ms. Lewinsky or
conduct an exhaustive inquiry. Jackie Bennett, who had a reputation
as a pit-bull prosecutor, and Robert Bittman, a young, fiercely
aggressive prosecutor, led this camp.
</P>
<P>
   The other camp favored making a deal with Ms. Lewinsky and
conducting a short inquiry; this camp was led by a pair of
newcomers to the office, the career prosecutors Michael Emmick and
Bruce Udolf, voices of moderation on the Starr team.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the White House chose to unleash a furious
attack on Starr and his prosecutors. Led by Carville, White House
officials and allies portrayed Starr as an overzealous prosecutor
intent on destroying the president. Mrs. Clinton accused Starr of
being part of ``a vast, right-wing conspiracy'' against her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a senior White House aide was blunt about their
motives, saying the White House was engaged in a ``continuing
campaign to destroy Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was working. By late February, some Clinton loyalists
were openly gloating. They bragged to reporters that they were
surprised at how easy it was to change the subject from the
president's relationship with a former intern to Starr's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks had an even more profound impact inside Starr's
office. ``One of the biggest mistakes was they underestimated
Starr's resolve,'' a Starr ally said. ``They set out to kill the
investigation, and the rule of law is what survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors _ and Starr himself _ became so angry that
some of their allies now acknowledge they were baited into making
ill-advised strategic decisions that the public found to be highly
questionable, even deplorable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first blunders by Starr was calling a low-level White
House aide named Bob Weiner before the grand jury to question him
about whether he had referred Mrs. Tripp for prosecution in
Maryland for recording Ms. Lewinsky without her permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should send a message that people should not try to
impede our investigation,'' one prosecutor snapped at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors were also widely criticized for calling Ms.
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, before the grand jury. Videotape
of a distraught Ms. Lewis leaving court was played repeatedly on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing angered Starr more than what he believed was a White
House effort to smear two of his prosecutors, Emmick and Udolf,
allies said. In response, Starr subpoenaed Blumenthal and Terry
Lenzner, a private investigator with longtime Democratic Party
connections.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews at the time, Starr justified his office's actions
by arguing that ``misinformation or distorted information'' about
lawyers on his team had impeded his inquiry and may have been
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But these remarks were widely criticized, even by leading
congressional Republicans. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a former
district attorney in Philadelphia, said, ``Ken Starr went too
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of harsh criticism ``hardened the resolve of
everyone'' inside Starr's office, one of the prosecutors said at
the time. ``It became very, very personal,'' a Starr ally said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr was and is very protective of the personal integrity
of his career prosecutors and the overall integrity of the
investigation,'' said Bakaly, the office spokesman. ``But every
prosecutorial decision has been based on the right thing to do
under the law and was consistent with all legal and ethical
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the public clearly sided with the president over
Starr. In polls, Clinton's approval rating hovered around 70
percent. Starr's flirted with the single digits. The president was
keenly aware of the polls. A close friend of Clinton said last week
that the glaring disparity in the poll numbers comforted the
president and provided him and others inside the White House with a
false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy for the president to deny everything and put up
roadblocks,'' the friend said. ``Remember, for a long time, the
president was winning.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Sample
</P>
<P>
   Drawing Blood, Recrossing Swords
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, six months after the inquiry began, not only was
Clinton winning but it appeared he would most likely outlast Starr.
Polls showed that the majority of Americans wanted Starr to drop
his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   On July 17, Starr took the extraordinary step of sending a grand
jury subpoena to the president. Because Clinton had rejected six
separate invitations to appear voluntarily, lawyers in the office
felt they had no choice but to compel his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president was enraged, and he steadfastly refused to be
forced, as Mrs. Clinton was, to walk into the federal courthouse
before the television cameras. He told aides he did not want to be
the first sitting president to be subpoenaed to appear before a
grand jury in an investigation in which he was a potential target.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team, including David Kendall, his private
lawyer, and his political advisers agreed that the president should
refuse to testify and challenge the subpoena on constitutional
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The president rejected that advice and instead agreed to
testify, but only at the White House and only with Kendall present.
But Starr also won some concessions, including that the testimony
be videotaped in the event that a grand juror missed the live,
closed-circuit video transmission inside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to permit Starr to videotape the proceedings would
soon haunt the president.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton agreed to testify, it also became known,
through news reports, that Ms. Lewinsky had turned over the navy
blue dress that she told prosecutors contained DNA evidence from
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr informed Kendall on July 31 that the office needed to draw
a vial of Clinton's blood. Clinton and Kendall considered the
possibility that it was a bluff on Starr's part. But later that
day, Starr wrote in his report to Congress, prosecutors assured the
president that prosecutors ``had an evidentiary basis for making
the request.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then, several of the president's advisers said, that
discussions began about what to say to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided to insist that he had not lied in his deposition
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit, and to do that he
developed a strategy of acknowledging only ``improper intimate
contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, but refusing to answer specific
questions about their sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to give them anything,'' a friend said. ``He'd
only go so far. He refused to make it easy on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the issue of the potentially explosive grand jury
videotape, Starr and Clinton exchanged accusations of bad faith
last week. Kendall said that prosecutors had assured Clinton they
would destroy the tape after playing it for absent grand jurors who
missed the live feed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a scathing reply, Starr said he could not ethically
destroy the tape, because it was ``evidence of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Speech
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Seething, Not Much Contrition
</P>
<P>
   There is no more revealing and authentic artifact of the
president's tortured relationship with the prosecutor than his
four-minute address to the nation on Aug. 17. He delivered it at 10
p.m., after four hours of difficult questioning by Starr,
prosecutors and grand jurors in the White House Map Room.
</P>
<P>
   The president had several hours to prepare for his televised
speech. His aides, knowing that he was furious about his treatment
by Starr and his deputies, gave him a draft text that emphasized
``candor, contrition and closure,'' said Paul Begala, a senior
White House political adviser who helped prepare the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   When Carville left the White House shortly after 8 p.m., he was
convinced that Clinton was going to deliver a speech that did not
mention Starr. Carville said the president did not appear to be
angry. ``He looked tired, fatigued,'' Carville recalled. ``In
retrospect, it would have been smarter for him, and everybody, to
get a good night's sleep and take a crack at that speech in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8:15 p.m., less than two hours before he was to speak,
Clinton ripped up Begala's draft and began writing his own.
</P>
<P>
   It was raw and bitter. The statement was neither candid nor
contrite, and rather than bringing closure, it opened a gaping
chasm. The president has acknowledged in several recent public
statements that he allowed his fury at Starr to affect his
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after his televised speech, he said that anger and
``the desire for recrimination against people you believe have
wronged you _ they harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead
to self-inflicted wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The president promised a group of religious leaders on Sept. 11
that in his quest for forgiveness he knew that he must renounce
``the pride and the anger which cloud judgment, lead people to
excuse and compare and to blame and complain.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Starr has expressed no apologies for any of his
treatment of the president and little explanation for the contents
of his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Bakaly said: ``The statute provides no guidance to what form
or manner the referral should take. But we made every effort to be
fair and complete.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference outside his Virginia home in April, Starr
made his most extensive remarks on the Lewinsky scandal, saying
that he was not influenced by politics or by his personal feelings
about the president.
</P>
<P>
   He said that like Joe Friday on the television series
``Dragnet,'' he was interested in ``just the facts'' and was
certain that they would lead him to the truth.

AS FREE-FLOWING CAPITAL SINKS NATIONS, EXPERTS PREPARE TO `RETHINK
SYSTEM' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Pa., Miss., La.)  (bl) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ They were the world's richest and shrewdest investors,
and they rode a wave of globalization to buy bonds in a promising
developing country. When the country defaulted, they were livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be lunatic asylums for nations as well as
individuals,'' one investor wrote in The London Morning Post,
denouncing the defaulting country as ``a nation with whom no
contracts can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds a bit familiar, but the year was 1842 and the
developing country was the United States. After defaults by
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Mississippi and Louisiana, the entire
United States was blacklisted and scorned on global markets, with
Americans barred from the best London clubs and the Rothschilds
warning bitterly that America would be unable to ``borrow a dollar,
not a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Globalization, in other words, may not be quite as fresh as it
sometimes seems. Since at least the 14th century, when Florentine
merchants lent to the English to pay for King Edward I's wars,
international capital has roamed the world in search of high
returns. (The start was inauspicious: England defaulted, causing
the collapse of two Florentine banks.)
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, economists say, is the scale of the capital
flows and their ability to capsize small nations _ or even large
ones. Many experts say that behind the economic crisis that has
devastated Asia and Russia, wobbled South America, and now come
knocking on America's own door is the fantastic increase in the
pool of capital that sloshes from one country to the next in search
of safety and profit.
</P>
<P>
   The sums are so gargantuan _ far greater than the amounts that
governments can wield _ that a growing number of economists are
calling for new steps to control these capital flows or at least
soften their impact. Some say that the Bretton Woods economic
system, which has governed the global economy for half a century,
has been eclipsed by these vast pools of capital, and there are
calls to design a new ``architecture'' for the global economic
order.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is expected to be widely discussed at next month's
special meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the
Group of Seven industrialized countries, summoned by President
Clinton to discuss the global crisis. Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa has already discussed measures to ease the
volatility of capital flows with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and with their British counterpart, Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan weighed in this week
with a denunciation of rigid capital controls but a call to
confront the problem by tightening supervision over banks that
engage in international finance. All of a sudden, a vigorous debate
is under way, and it may shape the global economy for decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to rethink the system in a big way,'' said Jagdish
Bhagwati, a prominent scholar of international economics at
Columbia University. ``The President has called this conference,
and it should be the start of that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati urged that the new architecture should ``give up the
notion that the optimal world is one characterized by capital
flows, by capital account convertability, where you just press a
button and take out a billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has led a global push to free the
flow of capital around the world, and any new impediments to
capital flows would be an abrupt step back for its campaign. As
recently as last March, the International Monetary Fund newsletter
carried a front-page headline cheerily declaring capital
liberalization to be ``an irreversible trend.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it looks more reversible. Some economists believe
that despite a wealth of scholarly research showing the need for
caution, the United States pushed too hard for capital
liberalization. The result, they say, was that tides of investment
flooded into ill-prepared developing countries and created
speculative bubbles, and then surged out, leaving behind shattered
nations and a global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think the IMF was too pushy in going around the
accepted wisdom and encouraging countries to liberalize their
capital accounts too soon,'' said Ronald McKinnon, an economist at
Stanford University and author of a book on capital liberalization.
``And not the least of the reasons behind this was arm-twisting by
the United States Treasury, which always wants American banks and
Wall Street people to be in there, competing freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that freer capital flows have
brought tremendous benefits to the global economy, as well as
perils. Some places, like Hong Kong, have opened themselves to
capital flows without restriction and are examples of the
prosperity that free movements of capital can reap. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers likens the flows to jet planes,
observing that jets bring enormous efficiencies and benefits to the
world _ but that the crashes are more spectacular than ever.
</P>
<P>
   What are these capital flows?
</P>
<P>
   They are not some sinister force, but simply the result of
ordinary people's cash roaming in search of a good return. When an
American deposits money at the corner bank, some of that may end up
being lent to a Brazilian company, and the same person's pension
fund may dabble in the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, trading in foreign securities amounted to
2 percent of gross national product in 1975 and 213 percent last
year, according to data from the Bank for International
Settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, historians sometimes attribute the modern boom in
international capital, beyond the easy reach of any regulator, to
the Communists. In the 1950s, China and Russia kept their dollars
out of the United States, for fear Washington would freeze their
accounts, and instead deposited the dollars in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One result was the ``Eurodollar'' market and a growing
investment pool that flitted from country to country and currency
to currency in pursuit of higher interest rates. The amount of
foreign currency bank deposits around the world reached $1 billion
only in 1961 and now is almost $1.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, though, is that a lot of this is ``hot money,'' or
short-term flows that are particularly volatile.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 19th century, sailing ships used to carry gold to
distant countries in pursuit of higher interest rates. In 1849,
England raised its interest rate by 2 percentage points, prompting
an early demonstration of the volatility of capital flows: ships
that were already at sea, headed for America with their gold,
turned around and sailed to England to get the higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Most governments imposed capital controls early in this century
and then lifted them in the 1970s and '80s, and limitations on
changing money came to be seen as quaint. Paradoxically, it is the
holdouts with capital controls, like China and India, that have
weathered the financial crisis much better than others, because
they were not vulnerable to a sudden exodus of capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told, `China seems to be coming out of the crisis
well because it has capital controls, so what's wrong with
reimposing controls?''' said Linda Tsao Yang, the U.S. envoy to the
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yang and other U.S. officials are wary of capital controls,
however, particularly the rigid kind imposed by Malaysia that ban
most investments from being taken out of the country. Scholars say
that such capital controls offer short-term benefits but tend to
discourage investment in the long run and often get mired in
corruption and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant risk that over the next three or four
quarters short-term results from Malaysia will be seen as
beneficial,'' said William Cline, the chief economist of the
Institute of International Finance in Washington. ``An illusory
temporary success could tempt other countries to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development this week
backed the right of countries to adopt emergency capital controls
like Malaysia's. Even the Far Eastern Economic Review, a
conservative Hong Kong-based magazine owned by Dow Jones &AMP; Co.,
declared its sympathy for capital controls in a recent editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look to Malaysia's unorthodoxy,'' it said, ``we hold our
nose and cross our fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Western economists are mostly unimpressed by Malaysia's
controls, many speak highly of a quasi tax that Chile has imposed
on short-term borrowings from abroad. With that measure, which the
country is in the process of dismantling, Chile has been able to
attract foreign capital, but has been less vulnerable to a sudden
exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The specific proposals that G-7 finance ministers might discuss
to deal with capital flows are unclear. But there is vague talk of
increasing supervision over borrowing banks and of establishing
funds that could be used to insure depositors or counteract
speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outright controls on the flow of funds are virtually
impossible in this modern, integrated world,'' said Yuji Tsushima,
a finance expert in Japan's Parliament. ``But we should have some
device through which if the volatility of the market gets too
disturbing, it could be mitigated.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In more than four hours of testimony before the
grand jury, President Clinton painted a picture of himself as a
concerned and even tender friend to Monica Lewinsky, lawyers
familiar with the Aug. 17 proceeding said.
</P>
<P>
   That image is starkly at odds with that of the callous
manipulator conducting an illicit affair portrayed in the
impeachment report to Congress by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   At several points in the testimony, the president expressed
embarrassment and regret about the affair, the lawyers said. After
one five-minute break, he told the grand jurors, ``I'd give
anything in the world to not admit what I had to testify to
today,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Such moments of remorse were mixed with flashes of fury at the
prosecutors. As one of Starr's deputies pressed him on his efforts
to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job, the president lashed out, saying,
``You have made this the most important issue in America,'' the
lawyers said. Clinton even accused the prosecutors of impairing his
memory by increasing the already considerable pressure on him over
the previous four years, they said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the president delivered what one lawyer called
a ``diatribe,'' in which he criticized the prosecutors for swooping
down on Ms. Lewinsky upon learning of their relationship. ``Monica
was kept by five of your lawyers and five of your FBI agents,'' he
said, according to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when the videotape of Clinton's testimony is released
by Congress, the public will see a more complex president than the
one in Starr's 445-page report, Clinton's allies and friends have
argued. While Starr's report drew on many sources, particularly on
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, to painstakingly chronicle what the
independent counsel says are impeachable acts, it did not describe
in detail the president's justifications for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was not provided with a transcript or
videotape of the president's testimony in advance of the public
release of the material, which was approved by a House Judiciary
Committee vote on Friday. This account is based on descriptions
provided by lawyers with detailed knowledge of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's friends, advisers and supporters on Capitol Hill have
repeatedly argued that Starr's report did not fully present his
side of the story. ``The referral itself is an extremely one-sided
and unfair document,'' said a Clinton ally, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``It does not fairly reflect the
president's testimony and the only purpose of the excessive graphic
detail is to harm the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's supporters have argued that he was forced to include
such graphic detail. They say they did it to prove that Clinton
lied when he denied having ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky
in a deposition on Jan. 17 in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit and because he refused to answer in detail their questions
in his grand jury testimony last month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his grand jury testimony on Aug. 17 at 1:03 p.m.,
in the Map Room of the White House. In a high-backed chair, the
president sat facing three lawyers from his team, with Starr and a
row of prosecutors to his right and a lectern and a camera in front
of him. As four prosecutors took turns questioning him under oath,
Clinton was at times evasive, angry, cajoling and even
philosophical, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said that he believed that both Clarence Thomas
and Anita Hill thought they were telling the truth in their
confrontation over her accusations of sexual harassment before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most mysterious area of human life,'' the
president told the grand jury, the lawyers said. From the federal
courthouse a few blocks away, the grand jurors were watching
Clinton on a live, one-way closed-circuit transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The president then extended a rare olive branch to Starr and his
team, thanking them for having provided broad immunity from
prosecution to Ms. Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis. Referring
to Ms. Lewinsky, he added, ``It breaks my heart that she was
involved in this,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the exchanges with prosecutors may prove
embarrassing to Clinton when they are played and replayed on
television in the coming days, his advisers believe.
</P>
<P>
   One such exchange came at the beginning of the testimony, when
Robert Bittman, a member of Starr's team, spent about seven minutes
questioning Clinton about whether he understood the meaning of the
oath he had taken to tell ``the whole truth.'' As Bittman
repeatedly pressed him, Clinton skirted some of the questions, the
lawyers said without providing more details.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after that exchange, Bittman asked the
president if he had been intimate with Ms. Lewinsky, the lawyers
said. Clinton responded by reading a statement that he had had
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky ``on certain
occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that what began as a friendship came to include this
conduct,'' Clinton said, according to a copy of the statement that
was provided to The New York Times. ``And I take full
responsibility for my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton repeatedly rebuffed questions about the details
of his sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, referring back to the
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied trying to influence the testimony of his
secretary, Betty Currie, in conversations he had with her shortly
after his deposition in the Jones case, the lawyers said. He
characterized those talks as efforts to warn Mrs. Currie of an
impending media frenzy over his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky and an
effort to find out from her why the Jones lawyers had asked him so
many questions about the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At several points in the testimony, Clinton faced a barrage of
questions about gifts he exchanged with Ms. Lewinsky, in particular
two neckties she may have given him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked him why Bayani Nelvis, a White House steward,
wore a tie to a grand jury appearance that Ms. Lewinsky said she
had given to the president, lawyers said. They also asked why on
Aug. 6, the day Ms. Lewinsky first appeared before the grand jury,
Clinton, at a Rose Garden ceremony that day, had worn another tie
that she said she had given him.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors wanted to know if the ties were meant as signals
to keep Ms. Lewinsky in the president's camp, lawyers familiar with
the inquiry have said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was said to have smiled in response to the questions and
expressed bafflement. He said he did not know if the ties had come
from Ms. Lewinsky, and that he gave away some of the many ties he
received, the lawyers said. The president was asked about other
gifts he gave the former intern, especially some New York
souvenirs, including a Rockettes throw _ a small blanket or rug
from Radio City Music Hall _ the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has charged the president with trying to obstruct justice
by concealing such gifts from the independent counsel's office. The
Jones lawyers had subpoenaed Ms. Lewinsky to turn over any such
presents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly said that he did not consider the gifts an
important matter, the lawyers said. He testified that he
specifically told Ms. Lewinsky that if the Jones lawyers requested
the gifts, she should turn them over, a statement reflected in
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described his efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job
not as attempts to win her silence, but as sincere efforts to help
an anxious friend. ``I wanted to help her get on with her life,''
the lawyers quoted him as saying. If he was trying to keep her in
his camp, Clinton testified, he could have ordered that she be
hired at the White House, a step he did not take despite her
repeated pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pointed out that he had tried to keep Ms. Lewinsky
at arm's length after ending the affair in early 1997. ``When I did
the right thing and made it stick, she felt a greater need to
cling,'' the lawyers quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly said that he tried to be truthful in the
Jones deposition without answering more than they specifically
asked. The president accused the Jones lawyers of using a
``wrecking ball'' to damage him, one lawyer said. The lawyer said
that Clinton testified he deplored the work of the Jones lawyers,
adding: ``I was determined to walk through the minefield of this
deposition.'' He said that he believed he had, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But events leading up to the president's grand jury appearance
created an array of legal dangers for him. Clinton's lawyers began
negotiating to have him testify voluntarily before they knew that
Starr had obtained physical evidence, a dress of Ms. Lewinsky's
that was stained with the president's semen. That evidence meant
that any categorical denial of an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, such as
the unsworn public denials the president had issued in January,
would almost certainly trigger an impeachment referral on perjury
by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to his grand jury appearance, the
president and his lawyers built a new line of defense. Clinton
would admit to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, but deny perjury in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The pillars of this new defense were Clinton's opening statement
and a one-sheet definition of sexual relations that was used in the
Jones case. That page contained three definitions, only one of
which was permitted to be used by the judge hearing the case. The
president circled it with a pen. It defined ``sexual relations'' as
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   To the grand jury, Clinton testified that most people defined
sexual relations as sexual intercourse, which he did not have with
Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that oral sex did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. And he testified
that touching Ms. Lewinsky's breasts and genitalia would fit the
Jones definition, but he denied having done so, according to
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in August, after receiving immunity from prosecution,
Ms. Lewinsky told Starr's team that the president had touched or
kissed her breasts on nine occasions and described four contacts
with her genitalia, the Starr report said. She also said her affair
with the president began in late 1995. He testified that it did not
begin until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 11 impeachable offenses Starr referred to the
Congress involve accusations that Clinton lied in the Jones
deposition and in his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also questioned Clinton about his relationship with
Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer, the lawyers said.
They pressed him on why he had not turned over letters from Ms.
Willey to the Jones legal team. The White House released the
letters, most of which were warm greetings to the president, last
spring after Ms. Willey appeared on the CBS program ``60 Minutes''
and accused the president of groping her in the White House.
Starr's report said he was still investigating whether there were
efforts to influence Ms. Willey's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the questioning, Starr asked David Kendall, one of
the president's private lawyers, if they could exceed their
agreed-upon four-hour time limit, excluding breaks. Kendall
refused.
</P>
<P>
   It was only very late in the testimony that Starr himself put
two questions to the president, both dealing with his invocations
of executive privilege, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning and end of the testimony, which concluded at
5:55 p.m., Clinton and the prosecutors made a show of handshaking
and cordiality. But the anger in the room was palpable, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the anger was still there four hours later, when Clinton
returned to tell the nation of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
speaking from the same high-backed chair. He again lashed out at
Starr, demanding his privacy back.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANADARKO, Okla. _ Three years ago, the mayor and business
leaders of Wildwood, a struggling resort on the Jersey Shore, were
certain that the path to prosperity ran through this parched corner
of western Oklahoma. The idea seemed inspired: Take a bit of city
land _ a two-acre parking lot, actually _ and give it back to
Oklahoma's Delaware Indians, whose ancestors were pushed out of New
Jersey in the 1830s. The Indians would open a casino, and Wildwood
would finally tap into the river of dollars flowing to the mighty
resort casinos of Atlantic City, 30 miles up the shore.
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Far from gaining a small-scale gambling parlor to match its
small-town hopes, Wildwood has seen its redevelopment plan pushed
to the sidelines by battling lawyers who have literally made a
federal case out of it. The Delawares, once Wildwood's allies, have
instead teamed up with a well-heeled national Indian gambling
developer and filed a lawsuit claiming all of the city as their
ancestral land. Wildwood tried to give the tribe the parking lot,
but that only brought another lawsuit, from the state of New
Jersey, seeking to block any deal that might undermine Atlantic
City's casino monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the Delawares are raising the stakes. Unless the state
drops its opposition to an Indian casino in Wildwood, the
Delawares' lawyer said, the tribe would sue for thousands of New
Jersey acres outside of Wildwood that it says were taken in
violation of a 1790 federal law. A dozen or more tribes _ in
California, Maine, Washington State and elsewhere _ have won
thousands of acres and millions of dollars with such claims, and
any land won could be developed into an Indian casino without state
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what started out as a 2.2 acre-case to revitalize Wildwood
is turning into a suit involving potentially thousands of acres and
millions of dollars,'' the tribe's lawyer, Glenn McGogney, said.
</P>
<P>
   As Wildwood and its mayor, Fred Wager, have learned, the world
of casino development is not a penny-ante game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 26 percent unemployment, we've got businesses
boarded up right in the heart of downtown, we've got a high school
that isn't properly funded, and we've got kids who have to leave
town when they graduate,'' Wager said. ``That's what we're facing
in Wildwood, and all I can hope is that when this whole thing works
itself out, the city will get back some of what we've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   When he talked about small-town problems, the mayor could also
have been speaking of Anadarko, a town of 6,600 in one of
Oklahoma's poorest counties. From the Redskin Theater (closed) at
the west end of town to the Indian City Lanes, Anadarko and
surrounding Caddo County are propped up by their small farms and
ranches; some summer visitors to the Indian City USA theme park,
and the housing, education and health care that the federal
government provides the area's seven tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Of a dozen people interviewed here, no one was aware of the
Delawares' New Jersey project, but the idea that a tribe would want
to venture that far made sense to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they need to get some more business, the same as the
people in New Jersey do,'' said Wayne Gomez, a reporter at The
Anadarko Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Delawares refused to meet with a reporter who visited their
trust lands to discuss the Wildwood matter. The tribe's chief,
Larry Snake, even denied in a brief phone conversation that
McGogney was representing the tribe, an assertion that McGogney
disputed. ``We have a signed contract,'' said McGogney, who is
listed in court papers as the tribe's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say that Wildwood's experience, right down to
its abject failure so far, has parallels all over the country.
Governments or businesses seeking to revive depressed properties
are cutting deals with Indians whose tribal lands are too remote to
prosper. Bring Indian casinos to the customers, the thinking goes,
and everyone will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   This would be done by persuading the federal government to take
a property into trust for a tribe _ creating a mini-reservation, in
effect, that is under the tribe's sovereignty and removed from
local and state control, including zoning regulations. But federal
Indian policy frowns on creating trust lands for gambling. So far
only one such effort, in Wisconsin, has succeeded, and then only
because the entire state leadership supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has no federally recognized tribes and no Indian
trust lands, but it does have three state-recognized Indian tribes
_ the Ramapough, the Nanticoke and the Powhatan _ that are
demanding federal recognition and their own lands. So far, the
Bureau of Indian Affairs has rejected their pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Indian gambling is a $7 billion-a-year industry, federal
officials say, with 185 tribes running 285 gambling operations in
28 states. A sliver of that action belongs to western Oklahoma's
Delawares, a federally recognized tribe with 1,200 members on a few
thousand acres of trust lands.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's Gold River casino and bingo parlor occupies a low
steel building among the gnarled oaks and pines north of town.
Every day until 1 a.m., local cowboys, a few tourists and transient
retirees hunker down in the smoky air and the din of slot machines
to feed dollar bills into the tribe's 50 or so ``pull-tab''
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to report their earnings, but I doubt they do
very well up there,'' said Don Ashapanek, a land-use expert at the
Anadarko Indian Agency. The agency works with the seven tribes _
the Apache, Caddo, Comanche, Delaware, Fort Sill Apache, Kiowa and
Wichita _ that give Anadarko the nickname Indian City.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Delawares' gambling parlor offers relatively
low-stakes games, it is exempt from many of the federal and state
restrictions governing full-fledged casinos. Wager wants to open a
similar operation _ a so-called class two casino _ in Wildwood as
the only way to skirt the state's opposition. But he said he hoped
the casino would someday grow to have roulette, blackjack, slots
and the other games that class three Indian casinos offer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An Indian casino was not even Wager's first choice. While he was
still a city councilman, in 1994, he opened talks with a race track
operator who talked of bringing in riverboat gambling and even, the
mayor said, an airborne ``Zeppelin casino.'' But the promoter
dropped out and advised Wager and his supporters to see the
Delawares. The tribe had a plausible tie to the Jersey Shore: It
lived around the Delaware Bay before leaving for the West in the
1830s, and a splinter group of Delawares had already claimed _
though unsuccessfully _ a large part of ocean-front Asbury Park,
N.J., as a ``tribal homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildwood's gambling advocates formed a committee to bring home a
casino, and one of its leaders, John Nickels, the owner of Nickels'
Midway Pier, called Snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I would like to invite you to Wildwood, New
Jersey,''' Nickels recalled. ```Take a look around; maybe we have
some things to discuss.'''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, Wager and Snake signed a two-year contract:
For $1, Wildwood would transfer to the Delaware tribe an underused,
seagull-spattered parking lot of 2.2 acres on Schellenger Street,
behind the Red Owl All You Can Eat Buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The Delawares, asserting ancestral ties to the Jersey Shore,
would ask the federal government to take the land in trust for the
tribe. Once that was done, the Delaware would build a class two
casino, with or without New Jersey's blessing, and offer bingo,
poker and pull-tab machines, but no lodging, liquor or food service
that would compete with the surrounding town. The tribe would pay
the city $8 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton and in Atlantic City, reaction to Wildwood's plan was
swift and angry. Gov. Christie Whitman said she had ``serious
concerns'' about allowing gambling beyond Atlantic City, which pays
millions into the state's treasury each year, and whose gambling
franchise is protected by the state's constitution. The state
Assembly passed a resolution noting that the Delawares have had no
connection with New Jersey for more than a century and urging
Congress to give states more control over Indian gambling. The
Bureau of Indian Affairs was also uncooperative. Without the
governor's support, its officials said, the Wildwood project was as
good as dead. ``This is not going to happen in Wildwood,'' said Rex
Hacker, a Bureau of Indian Affairs spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When the city's two-year agreement with the tribe expired last
fall, the Indians looked for a new partner among the casino
developers who had followed the scent of business to Wildwood. A
deal with Ameristar Casinos, a big Las Vegas operator, fell
through, so the tribe turned to McGogney's Casino Financing
Consultants, a private partnership in Allentown, Pa., that McGogney
said had several other Indian casino projects in development. (He
declined to say which ones.)
</P>
<P>
   McGogney said his next weapon was the federal Nonintercourse Act
of 1790, which says that only the federal government can take
Indian land. New Jersey bought out all Indian land claims in 1820,
he said, but the deal was never approved in Washington. ``So it is
our position that the transfer was void from the beginning,''
McGogney said, ``which means that it never ceased being tribal
land, and so we are allowed to create a gaming facility without
permission of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, McGogney, acting for the tribe, filed suit against
Wildwood in a federal court, claiming that all of the town was on
ancestral land. In anticipation of the suit, the city transferred
the parking lot to the tribe as an offer of settlement. But on Aug.
10, the state filed suit against Wildwood to block the parking lot
giveaway, on the ground that the transfer would change city
boundaries without state permission. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, when we started out, we did not expect so many
twists and turns,'' Wager said. ``But we shall overcome.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Somebody finally took the time to make it right by
you, Robert Normand.
</P>
<P>
   Finally gave you a fitting memorial for the pauper's grave you
were buried in 78 years ago after being shot and killed in the line
of duty.
</P>
<P>
   His name is David Kleinfeld, and he's a Burbank, Calif., police
officer, just like you were. Only they didn't call you police
officers back then, did they? They called you lawmen and marshals
in 1914, when you and Luther Colson joined the department in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Both of your names are up on the wall behind the front counter
of the Burbank Police Department, right next to the pictures of two
Burbank motorcycle officers killed in the line of duty in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinfeld used to stare at that wall last year on slow days when
he was pulling counter duty and nothing much was happening.
</P>
<P>
   He got to wondering what you and Luther looked like, started
thinking it wasn't right that you only had your names on the wall,
not your pictures, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it all began, Robert. One cop looking for the
pictures of two old lawmen to properly memorialize them on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinfeld began his research on his days off, finding department
records on how you guys died and where you were buried _ Grandview
Memorial Park in Glendale. He even ran down the original newspaper
stories on your deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It was all there.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Marshal Luther Colson, shot and killed Nov. 17,
1914, while walking along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks
clearing out hobo camps.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank Deputy City Marshal Robert Normand, shot and killed July
30, 1920, at the U.L. Hood Tire Shop at 254 Second St. (now San
Fernando Boulevard). The story told how you and Township Constable
Henry Purrier caught four men burglarizing the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normand jumped onto the running board of the suspects'
Studebaker and told the driver to head towards the city jail,'' the
story said. ``Constable Purrier followed in his own vehicle. At
about Third and Tujunga, one of the men shot Normand, killing him
instantly. Purrier pulled his own car alongside of the suspects and
opened fire, wounding the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   It went on to say that even though hit by bullets himself,
Purrier drove you to the hospital, Robert, but it was too late. The
Burbank city trustees offered a $750 reward for your killers, who
were later captured.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating stuff, but there were no pictures with the stories,
so Kleinfeld continued searching, hoping to find any relatives you
and Luther might still have living.
</P>
<P>
   He was hoping to get lucky, maybe find your pictures stuck deep
in the back of some old family photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   To find relatives, Kleinfeld enlisted the help of Marsha Howard,
general manager of Grandview Memorial Park. She went deep into the
archives and found the yellowed interment records.
</P>
<P>
   The trail on Luther's relatives finally went cold up in Redwood
City, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Your trail never got started.
</P>
<P>
   ``His interment record was blank,'' Kleinfeld said. ``There were
no relatives listed. I was also shocked to find Normand's grave
unmarked. He was buried in a pauper's grave.''
</P>
<P>
   A pauper's grave. How could that be? No one from 78 years ago is
around to answer that one.
</P>
<P>
   It was right around this time, Robert, that Kleinfeld began
thinking less of finding your picture and more of correcting this
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   He went before the Burbank Police Officers Association with your
story and told his fellow officers it was only right that they chip
in for a headstone for a deputy marshal who was doing their job 78
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An old lawman lying in an unmarked pauper's grave not more than
10 miles from their own station house.
</P>
<P>
   The association anted up $590 to have a headstone made and
placed on your pauper's grave, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   It was put up on March 25 of this year without any fanfare. Only
Kleinfeld was there.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of guy he is, Robert _ quiet and unassuming. He
didn't want people thinking he was trying to take credit or make a
big deal out of finally making it right by you.
</P>
<P>
   Even this story came to me initially secondhand from another
Burbank police officer, Fay Malcolm. She had to talk Kleinfeld into
going public with it because he didn't want people thinking he had
done anything special.
</P>
<P>
   He has, of course. Very special.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing, Robert. For the first time ever, there were
flowers put on your grave July 30, the 78th anniversary of the day
you died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Kleinfeld again.

AEROSPACE FILLS VOID IN NORTH LOS ANGELES COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM SKEEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ After a decade of defense downsizing put it
into a financial tailspin, the Antelope Valley, in north Los
Angeles County, is transforming its aerospace industry and fueling
a new age of military might and space commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In top-secret laboratories and giant hangars, thousands are
working on state-of-the-art craft _ projects that not only
strengthen the region's economy but lead the way to the next
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a shift to the space side,'' said Vern Lawson Jr.,
executive director of the Lancaster Economic Development Corp.
``The future is going to be space.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling the void left by the dwindling defense industry are
aircraft prototyping, subassembly work and space ventures _ the
last category being one that may make the Antelope Valley a
``spaceport'' for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   At Air Force Plant 42, a production and flight installation
created at the dawn of the Cold War to take advantage of open
spaces, clear skies and proximity to Edwards Air Force Base, 9,800
workers are toiling on various aerospace programs.
</P>
<P>
   Covering more than 5,800 acres of concrete, asphalt and
sagebrush, Plant 42 is home to hangars and assembly complexes used
by America's largest remaining aircraft companies: Lockheed Martin,
Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works occupies
its own massive complex just outside the Plant 42 fence.
</P>
<P>
   Plant 42 employment is at the highest level this decade but
still below what it was during the Reagan administration's defense
buildup. In 1987, for example, B-1B bomber production pushed the
Plant 42's work force to nearly 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   B-1B production ended in 1989 and job cutbacks _ coupled with a
statewide recession _ put the region into a steep economic slide
from which it is just now emerging.
</P>
<P>
   The Antelope Valley has been fortunate to avoid military base
closures that have struck Long Beach and Victorville. Edwards,
where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier 51 years ago, remains a
job site for some 13,000 civilian and military personnel testing
the Air Force's latest jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we fared better than other regions. We are very
fortunate to dodge that bullet,'' said Howard Brooks, executive
director of the Antelope Valley Board of Trade, an organization
that lobbies for aerospace work.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects securing the valley's position is
VentureStar, a reusable spacecraft under development by Lockheed
Martin that would take off like a rocket and land like an airplane
without shedding any boosters or fuel tanks like conventional
rockets and the shuttle now do.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype for VentureStar _ the X-33 _ is being built in
Palmdale and is scheduled to blast off next July from a launch pad
at Edwards Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   California is among 17 states vying to build a permanent
VentureStar launch site, with Lancaster, Vandenberg Air Force Base
and San Bernardino County in the running for the exact location.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, successfully sponsored
legislation for a statewide sales tax exemption for commercial
space operations in a bid to strengthen the state's position in
attracting VentureStar, and he pushed for state aid for building a
launch site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever California does well in aerospace, Antelope Valley
does well in aerospace,'' Runner said.
</P>
<P>
   And a study commissioned by two Los Angeles development
organizations suggested that the Southland could pick up 73,000
aerospace jobs over the next 20 years and urged leaders to seek out
space work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial space is the state's best hope for the future of
aerospace and defense,'' said the report for the Los Angeles
Regional Technology Alliance and the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp. ``This segment alone has the potential to
contribute 40 percent of all aerospace and defense jobs in Southern
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Antelope Valley's optimism centers on Lockheed
Martin Skunk Works, which moved to Palmdale from Burbank in the
early 1990s. Today, Skunk Works has 5,800 employees, the largest
aerospace work force in the Antelope Valley and the highest level
since the company arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the X-33/VentureStar, aimed at significantly
lowering the cost of getting satellites and other cargo into space,
Skunk Works employees are developing prototypes for the Joint
Strike Fighter _ described by one analyst as ``the biggest defense
program out there in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 or 25 years, some 3,000 stealthy
fighter-bombers could be built for the Air Force, Navy, Marines and
British Royal Navy, replacing the Air Force F-16, the Navy F/A-18
and the Marine AV-8B Harrier.
</P>
<P>
   While the Joint Strike Fighter is due to be assembled in Georgia
if Lockheed Martin wins the contract, Skunk Works employees in
Palmdale would build parts for it.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin also recently moved its Aircraft Services Unit
to Skunk Works, bringing some 800 workers to Palmdale from Ontario.
They customize aircraft for the U.S. military, private companies
and other countries, such as C-130 cargo planes outfitted for U.S.
special forces or A-4 Skyhawks modernized for Argentina.

BRAZILIANS FRET AS ECONOMIC THREAT MOVES CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Until recently it seemed that Augusta
Aparecida Pettinari's fortunes and the country's economic reform
plan ran on parallel tracks, like twin locomotives taking the young
receptionist and the modern currency toward a steadily more
promising future.
</P>
<P>
   As once-rampant inflation was brought down to negligible levels,
Ms. Pettinari joined an emerging class of consumers, whose salaries
for the first time maintained their purchasing power from one
paycheck to the next. She smiles now as she remembers buying
appliances, going to the movies and writing a check for a new
dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to have a social life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The man Brazilians elected president four years ago in gratitude
for taming inflation was Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former
finance minister. To back the new currency that gave his Real Plan
its name, there was an array of proposed structural changes to
attract foreign investment, privatize state industries and reform
social security, the Civil Service and tax systems.
</P>
<P>
   But now, two weeks before the Oct. 4 election, in which Cardoso
is to seek another term in office, the financial tornado that has
devastated parts of Asia and Russia has begun spinning toward
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, nearly $1 billion a day in foreign reserves
has been flying out of the country, while the black-market rate for
dollars has veered from 2 cents above the official rate to more
than 30 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven trading days, the stock market has bounced
from 15.8 percent losses one day to 18.7 percent gains the next,
and then back down again last week after Alan Greenspan, the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board chairman, ruled out lowering interest rates.
The country has doubled the ceiling on interbank loan rates, to
49.75 percent from 24.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly the train that Ms. Pettinari once thought was
carrying her steadily upward toward prosperity feels more like a
roller coaster. Come Oct. 5, the day after the election, the
now-unemployed receptionist confesses, she has no notion at all
where this wild ride will take her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay along the same lines we've been on, we'll manage,''
said Ms. Pettinari, 28. Then she recalled her country's last
economic crisis in 1990, when Fernando Collor de Mello began his
presidency by freezing all personal bank accounts and allowing
Brazilians access to only $50 each. ``But who really knows what
lunacy is coming?''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the world's ninth-largest economy and the pace-setter
for Latin America, is once again in danger of collapse, this time
crippled by growing current account and fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil does not have the threat of political instability
or nuclear weaponry that makes a breakdown in Russia so fearsome,
the opening of its markets has drawn billions of dollars in U.S.
investment, and its fall would bring economic turbulence
dangerously close to U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's budget deficit, at 7.5 percent of gross national
product, and its current account deficit, at $35 billion, threaten
to swell further with the steep interest increases of recent weeks,
despite announcements of drastic budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two months, some $80 billion in Brazilian debt
will come due. According to Merrill Lynch, U.S. banks had $27.2
billion at stake in Brazil at the end of March. In Russia they had
only $6.8 billion tied up. Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's downgraded
Brazil this month.
</P>
<P>
   For now, voters are holding fast to Cardoso, as the most
responsible figure to face the looming crisis. In the most recent
poll, 49 percent of those who responded supported him, a 27-point
advantage over Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a former autoworkers
union president and three-time presidential candidate of the
leftist Worker's Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lula would be very strong on social issues, but a president
isn't only that,'' said Daniella Cristina Turri, a 20-year-old
office worker who has been trying to find work for four months.
``The most important thing is the economy. It's the basis for
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Already months behind on her night school tuition, however, Ms.
Turri is no longer sure that she will vote for Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's getting worse for us,'' she said. ``There are
times when you think about leaving the country, because it doesn't
give you any way to make a living.'' Unemployment in Sao Paulo, the
financial and industrial heart of Brazil, is 19 percent, and is
expected to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is still well liked on Wall Street, Cardoso has lost
credibility as investors battered by losses in Asia and Russia
weigh his failure to deliver needed reforms. On his first
presidential visit to the United States, in April 1995, Cardoso
visited New York before Washington, underscoring the importance of
investment to his country's future.
</P>
<P>
   The president won fans in world financial capitals by removing
exchange controls, opening markets and selling off state
industries. Last year, with $17 billion coming in, Brazil became
the world's third-largest market for direct foreign investment,
following the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso proved less successful at getting the government to
live by the same fiscal discipline forced on middle-class
Brazilians. Politically costly overhauls were put off, as with tax
reform, or fumbled, as with social security reform, or passed but
not carried out, as with civil service reform. An assembly line of
privatizations, however, helped offset soaring government costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso contends that Brazil's vulnerability is not his or the
country's doing, but the product of outside forces, and he is
calling for a new international monetary system for the global era.
</P>
<P>
   The market reacts to every sign of outside backing for Brazil,
in the form of reduced U.S. interest rates, a bailout by the
International Monetary Fund, or an IMF line of credit. But so far,
Brazil has not formally requested an IMF bailout and Cardoso is
loath to embrace IMF conditions before election day.
</P>
<P>
   The government had already announced cutbacks to raise a primary
account surplus of 0.87 percent, but reports here say the IMF would
demand a primary surplus closer to 3 percent next year as the price
of its bailout. The primary account covers revenues less expenses,
without interest on debts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These days, Cardoso is walking a delicate line to election day,
nudged by his politician's instincts that suggest that doomsday
speeches about tax increases, unemployment and sacrifice are not
the stuff of landslides, and by an international investment
community clamoring for proof that Brazil will get its fiscal house
in order soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only positive byproduct for Brazil is that he'll have to
do these fiscal reforms,'' said Joel Korn, president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's most likely initial steps will combine tax increases,
import restrictions and cost-cutting measures. Investors are
expecting Cardoso to push through reforms before the lame duck
Congress dissolves at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The president has ruled out a devaluation, which would
undoubtedly reignite inflation, but it is by no means certain,
investment analysts say, that the country will not be forced into
one. In recent days, the stream of reserves leaving Brazil has
slowed to under $500 million a day, and the difference between
official and black-market exchange rates has narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, it appears that Cardoso, who spent considerable
time and political capital pushing a constitutional amendment
through Congress allowing presidents to run for re-election, will
win on the first round. But he has never stood closer to seeing his
legacy crumble in his hands. His inauguration is expected to be not
so much a coronation, as his rivals once feared, but the threshold
of a new era of sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Even those struggling through a shrinking economy, though, say
they would prefer sacrifice over inflation. Ms. Pettinari has been
watching the sandwich boards with job offerings on Barao de Parana
Piacaba street since April, when she lost her last job.
</P>
<P>
   She got married five months ago, but both she and her husband,
who had been a bill-collector, are out of work, and have to live
apart, he with his parents, she with hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for them, I'd go hungry,'' she said.

CHRISTIAN COALITION LAMENTS LACK OF WIDESPREAD ANGER ABOUT
CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Maine, Minn., N.J., Va.)  (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-VIDEOTAPE, CLINTON-GORE,

 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This should be a time of triumph for the
conservative, overwhelmingly pro-Republican members of the
Christian Coalition. The Democratic, baby-boomer president they
have long considered a moral disgrace now faces talk of his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in the hallways and during coffee breaks at the
three-day Christian Coalition convention here, many delegates said
they were despondent about opinion polls showing that most
Americans do not share the conviction that President Clinton should
resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   They said they feared that the American people cared more about
the decline of the Dow than the decline of morals. And they
speculated that the libertine legacy of the 1960s still held sway
over American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is so grossly materialistic and so self-centered,''
said Brad Thomas, founder of Christ's Bride Ministries in McLean,
Va., as the convention joined in singing the national anthem. ``We
see that in the abortion debate. It's a matter of `me first.'
Supposedly there are many Christians in this nation, God-fearing
people, and yet Clinton can attend church and supposedly that makes
him godly, even when every policy he's had has been ungodly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, an operations consultant for US West in St. Paul,
said during the lunch break Friday: ``The polls could be accurate,
and that makes me worried that the so-called liberalism that has
taken root in the last 20 to 25 years means that people can't think
clearly about perjury and obstruction of justice. It seemed clear
when Nixon was in office. Why isn't it clear now?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Christian Coalition held its first convention eight
years ago, the group's founders, Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, have
issued dire warnings that the nation is facing moral collapse. They
have cited the end of prayer in the schools, the high rates of
teen-age pregnancy and the disturbing incidents of youth violence.
They have attributed social problems to the increasing
secularization of society, and said they were seeking to return the
nation to its ``Christian roots.''
</P>
<P>
   At this year's convention, which ends on Sunday, the group's
leaders used the Clinton scandal as the ultimate evidence that
Washington was in need of a restoration of ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Character matters, and the American people are hungry for that
message,'' said Reed, the coalition's former executive director and
now a private political consultant. ``We care about the conduct of
our leaders, and we will not rest until we have leaders of good
moral character.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the group's rank-and-file members, there was
speculation that many Americans do not share the same sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why isn't there outrage over this?'' said Ronald J. Mossberg,
31, a computer systems analyst from Maplewood, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think people have just gotten themselves too busy,
taking care of the kids. Everybody's working. They listen to the
evening news and they become disengaged. The baby boomers were
raised in a permissive age, and Bill Clinton is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who attended the convention voiced suspicions that
the news media were intentionally skewing the poll questions to
make the results appear more supportive of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sick of hearing TV constantly quoting the polls, as if
that matters,'' said Cecilia Huckestein, 50, a portrait artist from
Westlake Village, Calif. ``The law matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huckestein said that nobody she knew in Los Angeles wanted
Clinton to stay in office, so she could not imagine how the polls
were turning up such results. ``I haven't ever been polled,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted last week,
showed that of 1,813 adults nationwide who were surveyed, 6 in 10
Americans wanted Clinton to finish his term. And though 2 in 3
people polled said that Clinton did not share their moral values,
62 percent said they approved of the job he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such vexing poll numbers and convinced that the
American electorate is not as accepting of Clinton's behavior as
other polls indicate, the Christian Coalition sponsored its own
poll. Its survey asked 1,000 registered voters whether, regarding
morals and values, ``things are on the right track and getting
better, or on the wrong track and getting worse.'' In that poll, 63
percent said things were getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, the Christian Coalition's executive director, touted
the results of this poll at the convention, saying, ``The moral
crisis we now face is so obvious everybody sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me offer a small piece of advice to any candidate who is
on the wrong side of the values issue,'' said Tate, a former
Republican congressman from Washington state. ``You are going to
have one big problem on Election Day.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   From the podium at the convention, several speakers criticized
Congress for indecisiveness on whether to call impeachment
hearings. Oliver North, who once found himself at the center of the
Reagan administration's Iran-contra affair, told the crowd, ``It is
now time for the members of Congress to stop reading the polls, and
screw up their courage and do their duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in interviews, many Christian Coalition members said they
were confident that legislators would eventually call for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're moving in the right direction,'' said Nelida
Kuhlmann, 50, an office manager from Westwood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Finks, 51, a former administrator of a Christian school in
Falmouth, Maine, said the system was working. In fact, he added,
the Clinton imbroglio presented Christian conservatives with an
unprecedented opportunity to define their position on values.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic event,'' Finks said. ``We've probably never
had anything that raised the character issue so clearly before in
the history of the American republic.''
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the Christian Coalition attributed the gap in
outrage to the Christian conservatives' narrow definition of
morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most Americans there's a lot more moral ambiguity in the
world than the average member of the Christian Coalition is able to
see,'' the critic, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, said in an interview
during a break.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn attended the Christian Coalition's sessions Fridya and
offered a rebuttal at his group's noon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Coalition folks do measure morality on the basis
of sexual behavior,'' Lynn said in the interview. ``To other
people, morality is a balance and could even include questions
like, Are more children going to bed hungry under this president
than before?''
</P>
<P>
   The concern that the American people are insufficiently outraged
is not confined to the convention here in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a letter to about 2.4 million supporters, James
Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, a multimedia ministry in
Colorado, wrote, ``What has alarmed me throughout this episode has
been the willingness of my fellow citizens to rationalize the
president's behavior even as they suspected, and later knew, he was
lying.''
</P>

ANALYSIS: IN CAMBODIA, TWO RIVALS ARE YOKED IN FRAYED HARNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Wars, elections, coups and riots come and go
in Cambodia, but the unhappy entanglement of the prince and the
former communist, it seems, is never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after swearing he would not, the royalist leader,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, is to join his longtime antagonist, Hun
Sen, in a Parliament created by a disputed election nearly two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament is to convene on Thursday in Siem Reap, in the
shadow of the ancient monuments of Angkor Wat and under the
guidance of King Norodom Sihanouk, the constitutional monarch.
</P>
<P>
   If political horse-trading goes the way most analysts think it
will, the two antagonists will form a coalition government that
will in some ways replicate the disastrous recent partnership that
helped tear the country apart.
</P>
<P>
   That feuding co-premiership was created by the last election, in
1993, and lasted only four years, until July 1997, when Hun Sen
expelled the prince from government in a violent coup. The 1993
election followed a decade of civil war in which the prince was
part of an alliance that opposed Hun Sen's Vietnamese-backed
communist government.
</P>
<P>
   This time their uneasy coalition should be more stable, if only
because it is one-sided. Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party
will dominate, and the prince is unlikely to win a post with
far-reaching powers.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for an end to electoral protests, Sihanouk offered a
bottom line to Cambodia's long struggle to become a civil society:
Power still rules, he said, and the losers must submit, fair or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Cambodia that is not a state of law and not a fully
fledged democracy, I have no other choice than to advise the weak
to choose a policy that avoids misfortune for the people, the
motherland and themselves,'' the king said.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Hun Sen's coup succeeded. It fragmented the
prince's party and was followed by a campaign of intimidation by
Hun Sen's followers that reportedly included more than 100
political killings.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, and with the opposition almost entirely
excluded from the news media, many analysts say it is impossible to
consider the July election fair.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Hun Sen's opponents made a respectable showing.
While his party won 64 parliamentary seats, the opposition won
almost as many, with the prince's party taking 43 and the party of
a third candidate, Sam Rainsy, 15. Thus Hun Sen needs to form a
coalition with the prince and others to gather the two-thirds
majority required in the 122-seat National Assembly to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Such a coalition might have come more easily had it not been for
the aggressive election protests led by Sam Rainsy. Asserting that
the voting, the ballot-counting and the seat-allocation formula had
been manipulated by Hun Sen's party, Sam Rainsy refused to accept
the results.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, who may have been seeking to strengthen his
bargaining position in any coalition with Hun Sen, joined Sam
Rainsy in demanding recounts, an examination of the ballots and a
revision of the disputed formula.
</P>
<P>
   The protests received little backing from the foreign
governments that had helped finance the election; most endorsed the
results.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests appeared to tap into a deep strain of
discontent, at least among residents of the capital, Phnom Penh,
who had given Hun Sen's party only one-third of their votes. A tent
city of protesters grew outside the National Assembly, and when it
was torn down by soldiers early last week, the city was convulsed
by riots.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen responded with his characteristic tactic: force.
</P>
<P>
   When demonstrators supporting the prince and Sam Rainsy filled
the streets, they were clubbed and shot and then forced aside by
thousands of highly organized counterdemonstrators trucked in from
the countryside and armed with sticks, stones and slingshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it was hard bargaining, but not around a
table,'' a Western diplomat said. But something else emerged from
the week of turmoil. In a brief outpouring of something that looked
like ``people power,'' many thousands of Cambodians filled the
streets to cheer for peace and democracy. For the first time,
residents rose in defiance to demand an end to the violence and
power struggles that have ravaged their country for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``These protests revealed that, at least in the major city of
Phnom Penh, there is a growing middle class,'' a European diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was easily cleared from the streets by men with guns, but it
had announced its presence. &QL;

MAGAZINE HAS IDEAS FOR POST-CLINTON DEMOCRATS, AND THEY START WITH
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-VIDEOTAPE, CLINTON-CHRISTIANS,

(js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the debate intensifies over President Clinton's
political future, a new magazine will be introduced this week that
is devoted to the post-Clinton era in American politics _ and,
apparently, to the election of Vice President Al Gore in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, a slickly printed quarterly, is named Blueprint:
Ideas for a New Century and is being published by the Democratic
Leadership Council, a centrist organization that Clinton once
headed and turned to for help in starting his presidential campaign
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, Clinton is not going to be president for
that much longer,'' said Andrei Cherny, a former senior
speechwriter for Gore who is editor of Blueprint. ``And the
Democratic Party needs to figure out where it goes after him and
what it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Al From, the publisher and head of the leadership council,
insisted that the magazine, with a circulation goal of 35,000, ``is
a project to put the best thinking forward of the `New Democrat'
movement _ it's not just a project to help one person get
elected.'' The magazine dwells more on ideas than practicalities of
a presidential campaign. But Blueprint, which is financed with
donations to the Democratic Leadership Council, clearly looks like
a Gore vehicle. Most references are not to the Clinton
administration but to ``the Clinton/Gore administration.'' The
staff is stocked with Gore loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the articles in the premier issue were written by former
Gore aides or current advisers. One article, about demographic
changes in the electorate, was written by Elaine Kamarck of Harvard
University, who ran Gore's reinventing government initiative in the
first term, and by William Galston, a former Clinton domestic
policy aide who is close to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Penn, the White House pollster who is expected to sign on
with Gore for 2000, wrote an article analyzing the Democratic
electorate of the future and is expected to have a standing
analysis in each issue. Another article, which explores ``the
growing phenomenon of economic free agents,'' is by Daniel Pink,
Gore's chief speechwriter from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One well-established weekly magazine, The New Republic, has long
been viewed in political circles as a booster of Gore. The editor
in chief, Martin Peretz, is a longtime friend of the vice president
and was one of his instructors at Harvard University, where they
met in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, other magazines have cropped up to push one
political position _ or candidate _ or another. Just last week,
Salon, an online magazine that is widely viewed as friendly toward
Clinton, stirred a partisan frenzy by disclosing that Rep. Henry
Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had an affair three
decades ago. And The Weekly Standard was established after the 1994
elections to press Republican positions _ and as something of a
political antidote to The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Blueprint, with an estimated budget of $1.5 million, is expected
to cease publication after six or eight issues once the 2000
presidential campaign gets fully under way. The concept for the
magazine came from Donald Baer, a former Clinton communications
director and former assistant managing editor at U.S. News &AMP; World
Report who is close to Gore. He is the magazine's senior editorial
consultant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the Gore loyalists on the staff, the magazine does not
hew to all of the vice president's policy positions. Though Gore
has been mounting aggressive appeals to labor and liberal
constituencies to help him in the Democratic primaries, articles in
the magazine suggest that people who regularly use computers on the
job have become more important politically than union members.
Another article said Democratic candidates no longer have to gear
their appeals to the left in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   For all its focus on the post-Clinton era, Blueprint carefully
avoids injecting itself into the scandal that has engulfed the
White House and that has left Gore's advisers unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to frame the scandal in positive terms for centrist
Democrats, From and Will Marshall, the top officials of the
leadership council and its spinoff policy institute, wrote,
``President Clinton's ability to sustain support throughout much of
his presidency _ despite the miasma of scandals and investigations
that hangs over Washington _ shows that Americans are ready to
reward pragmatic problem-solving over reflexive partisanship.''

YELTSIN'S ROLE MAY BECOME LARGELY CEREMONIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin made a rare appearance in
public last Wednesday evening at a gala concert at Moscow's
Conservatory. At least, he was there for the start of a performance
by the Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and Seiji Ozawa, the
Boston Symphony's conductor.
</P>
<P>
   By intermission, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, struggled to
patch together a coalition Cabinet last week, Yeltsin's involvement
in the affairs of his crisis-ridden country has provided the
background noise, audible enough but increasingly distant.
</P>
<P>
   In an eerie sequence reminiscent of the stylized protocol of
Soviet times, television news broadcasts show him in his Kremlin
office, ushering a visitor to a table where the cameras silently
track opening remarks. The next news item shows an identical scene,
with a different guest. The images only support the growing
impression that Russia's once powerful president, weakened by
crisis and poor health, has been sidelined to a largely ceremonial
role.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies report his telephone conversations with world
leaders, and his decrees on ministerial appointments. But Primakov,
the artful diplomat, is clearly making the choices that will define
Russia's future course, as he sifts through opposing political
factions in the difficult search for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   How Yeltsin will figure into that consensus is no longer
relevant: His views on Russia's economic policies have been washed
over by events that have left him isolated, and humbled.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a career that capitalized on conflicts,
Yeltsin backed away from a certain showdown with the parliamentary
opposition over the nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister. In Russia's play-for-keeps politics, a compromise _ in
this case, the nomination of Primakov _ carries with it the faint
aroma of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, very little remains of President Yeltsin's clout,''
wrote Natalia Konstantinova in the newspaper Independent last week.
Even Boris Berezovsky, the Russian tycoon and master intriguer said
to have close ties to the president's family, told British
television last week that Yeltsin's time had run out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of statements of policy, or words of reassurance, the
Kremlin has been the source of tales of shadowy intrigue and petty
power plays in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Primakov's nomination was confirmed, two top Kremlin
aides _ Andrei Kokoshin, secretary of the National Security
Council, and Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's top press spokesman _
were summarily dismissed, reportedly for disloyalty to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has been available to provide his version of events, but
according to press reports, and people who know the details, their
transgressions consisted of going directly to Yeltsin with
unsolicited advice on how to get Parliament to confirm a new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   They reportedly argued that the situation was too volatile to
contain a conflict between the president and the Parliament, and
urged Yeltsin to drop Chernomyrdin for a compromise candidate.
According to one version, they pushed the candidacy of Moscow's
mayor, Yuri Luzhkov; according to another, they were advocating
anyone but Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Primakov, Yeltsin would seem to have heeded their
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradox, but it is in the tradition of Russian
paradoxes,'' said Pavel Voshchanov, a journalist who is also one of
Yeltsin's former press secretaries. ``When servants come to their
master with unwelcome advice with which he is obliged to agree, he
accepts it grudgingly, and resentfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the dismissal of the two highly respected advisers was
undoubtedly ordered by Yeltsin, it was pushed by his chief of
staff, Valentin Yumashev, a former journalist who became Yeltsin's
top aide and chief gatekeeper after he helped write Yeltsin's book,
``The Struggle for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, Yumashev and his close ally,
Yeltsin's daughter and adviser Tatyana Dyachenko, 38, had pressed
the president to stand firm against the Parliament. In the end,
they were overruled, but eventually took their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Kokoshin and Yastrzhembsky had acted without informing Yumashev,
who then preferred to insist on their dismissal ``rather than
undermine his power and ability to control the president,'' said
Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the Politica Fund, a Moscow
research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Their departure has depleted Yeltsin's already dwindling circle
of close advisers. His team of young free-market reformers _
figures like Anatoly Chubais, the architect of Russia's
privatization, and former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who used
to huddle under his long political shadow _ have been dispersed,
unlikely to return. His old allies from Russia's democratic
movement now lack a leader, or even a credible heir.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chernomyrdin, the yo-yo of Russian politics for his ability
to rebound in difficulty, has been left stranded, with little hope
of another reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Yumashev, 40, who began his career editing letters to the
popular weekly Ogonyok, has neither the skills nor the authority to
fill the widening gap left around Yeltsin, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him at a number of meetings during the 1996 campaign,
and afterward, and I don't remember him ever saying a word,''
Nikonov said. His former newspaper colleagues remember Yumashev as
an unimpressive, scruffy figure whose power lies in his total
loyalty to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing Yeltsin's weakness, the leftist opposition continues to
press its advantage. An impeachment process is still wending its
way to the floor of the Parliament, even though its chances of
clearing the constitutional hurdles remain slight. More
realistically, a series of legal changes to the constitution would

drafted and are also making their way through the
opposition-dominated Parliament.

<P>
   In tracking the decline of Yeltsin's influence, many look to
Berezovsky, seeing in him a political bellwether whose main loyalty
is to power, no matter who holds it. In his interview with the BBC,
Berezovsky was asked if Yeltsin should resign. ``I think yes,'' he
replied. ``Of course, that depends on what the alternative would
be, but I think we have an alternative better than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he gave no clues on whom he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's health is another handicap, although no one knows for
sure what ails him, other than the aftereffects of his 1996
quintuple bypass heart surgery and a history of heavy drinking. He
has his good days when his step is firm and his gaze focused. But
he also has his bad days, when his attention drifts and his
off-the-cuff remarks have to be interpreted by aides. Whatever the
nature of his medical problem, both he and his staff seem leery of
his being before the public for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in these past hectic weeks, Yeltsin has surprised his
harshest detractors by proving that he can still make decisions,
and even impromptu appearances. On Thursday, he paid a 15-minute
visit to a Moscow grocery store, although no reporters or
television crews were present to record the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts still caution against ruling him out of the
picture entirely, noting that as long as he still has power he will
try to wield it, if for no other reason than to insure his survival
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's retirement before the end of his term in 2000,
followed by early presidential elections, is a recurrent theme
among Moscow's political elite. Few who know the president expect
him to leave office of his own free will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give anything for Boris Nikolayevich to quit _ I would
promise him anything he wants,'' Pyotr Sumin, the governor of the
Chelyabinsk region, told the Russian magazine Profil. ``We could
live without him. But he will not quit.''

COMMENTARY: NOT SO GOLDEN AN AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago a guy said to me, ``If the economy is doing so
great, how come I'm broke?''
</P>
<P>
   A new study out of Washington shows that there are an awful lot
of Americans who might ask the same question.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Economic Policy Institute is titled ``The State
of Working America'' and has been published in book form. It
doesn't dispute that the economy has improved since the dark days
of the early-90s recession, but points out that there are still
enormous numbers of middle-class and working-class Americans who
have little or no reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings included the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The inflation-adjusted earnings of the median worker in 1997
were 3.1 percent lower than in 1989. Over that period, real hourly
wages either stagnated or fell for most of the bottom 60 percent of
the working population.
</P>
<P>
   _ Median family income was $1,000 less in 1996 (the most recent
year for which complete data are available) than in 1989.
Economists believe the final statistics for 1997, available later
this week, will show some improvement, but only enough to bring the
median income back to the 1989 level.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``typical married-couple family'' worked 247 more hours
per year in 1996 than in 1989 despite an 8 percent growth in the
economy's productive capacity. That's more than six weeks' worth of
additional work, just to stay even or keep from falling too far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that early this year unemployment fell to its
lowest point in three decades and, very recently, real wages have
begun to rise for most workers. But those improvements have come at
the end of a prolonged period of wage deterioration and other
setbacks that have had a profound effect on the standard of living
of most American families.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``The typical American family is
probably worse off near the end of the 1990s than it was at the end
of the 1980s or the end of the 1970s.'' It says, ``To the extent
that the typical American family has been able to hold its ground,
the most important factor has been the large increase in the hours
worked by family members.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the very wealthy, we are in something less than a
golden economic age. The heralded stock market advances of the '90s
have primarily benefited the wealthy few, despite the increased
popularity of mutual funds and the expansion of
defined-contribution retirement plans. Most families own no stock
at all. Those that do own stock usually have very small
investments.
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute's study, more than 85 percent of the
benefits from ``the increase in the stock market between 1989 and
1997 went to the richest 10 percent of households.''
</P>
<P>
   The very recent and very modest gains in the real wages of
American workers were largely linked to the tight labor market,
which heightened the bargaining power of workers, and increases in
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Jared Bernstein, a co-author of the report with Lawrence Mishel
and John Schmitt, applauded the policy decisions that led to those
improvements. But he added that the low unemployment rate is a
particularly ``thin reed'' for working families to hang onto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cyclical variable,'' he said, ``and the focus of the
Federal Reserve has been imbalanced. It has been overly concerned
about inflation and the erosion of the assets of the wealthy, and
has not appreciated the importance of persistently low unemployment
in reversing the long-term negative trends for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, the feeling of the
Republican majority in Congress is that we have gone far enough.
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., has proposed raising it by 50 cents
an hour in January, and another 50 cents a year later. That way, as
the senator put it, ``the minimum wage will reach the level of
$6.15 at the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians will tell you that terrible things will happen
if companies are required to pay American workers $6.15 an hour in
the year 2000. On Tuesday a key vote is scheduled on Kennedy's
proposal. The hunt is on for enough votes to save it.
</P>
<P>
   One of these days policy-makers will come to realize that you
can't sustain a real boom if workers and their families aren't
getting a fair shake. The value of low unemployment and an honest
day's pay for an honest day's work should not be matters for
debate.

PANAMANIAN OFFICIALS TAKING FORMER U.S. MILITARY RESIDENCES AS
THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY _ As minister of housing for the last four years,
Francisco Sanchez Cardenas was supposed to improve other people's
living conditions, not his own. But with the United States turning
hundreds of homes of departing military officers over to Panama as
stipulated by treaty, he and other leaders of the governing party
have got the best residences for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A result has been popular outrage and a political scandal that
threatens to cripple the governing Democratic Revolutionary Party
in elections scheduled for next spring. And with the United States
obligated to give up half a dozen more military installations over
the next 15 months, longstanding concerns about the willingness of
the government here to administer the Panama Canal and the
properties around it fairly and honestly are resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely serious because of the symbolism involved,''
said Roberto Eisenmann, a prominent businessman who is chairman of
the Panamanian chapter of the anticorruption group Transparency
International. ``The Panamanian populace has always felt that the
canal should be above the political fray, but the fact that these
homes were assigned to Cabinet ministers said to us that finagling
is going on that we never expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The homes are among 462 residences at the former Albrook Air
Force Station, which the U.S. Southern Command handed over to
Panama last October in compliance with two treaties requiring the
United States to end its presence here by Dec. 31, 1999. The houses
were supposed to be offered for public bidding this summer, but the
most coveted were suddenly withdrawn from the market days before
the auction was to take place.
</P>
<P>
   When the country's leading newspaper, La Prensa, looked into the
matter, it found that the housing minister, who is also a deputy
chairman of the governing party, the minister of labor, Mitchell
Doens, and several other party luminaries had been allowed to rent
the houses by the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, the ostensibly
independent government agency that administers ``reverted areas.''
As tenants, they have an option to buy the houses at a price about
half of market value.
</P>
<P>
   The affair has put President Ernesto Perez Balladares on the
defensive. His party has a long history of corruption and abuse of
power, most notably when it was controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega a decade ago, and this latest episode was seen as a clear
sign that it intends to treat the former Canal Zone as a gift to
the party, not the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact of being a minister in this or the previous
government obviously should not be a reason to receive a house,''
Perez Balladares said at a recent news conference. ``But neither
should it be a reason not to receive one. They have a perfect
right, like any other Panamanian, to compete and try to obtain, if
that is their desire, a residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Cardenas did not respond to requests for comment, but he
has previously denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Popular irritation with the real-estate deals has been cited as
a factor in the rejection last month by a margin of nearly 2 to 1
of a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the president
to seek a second term of office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sanchez Cardenas and Doens, who is also a party deputy chairman,
stepped down the day after the vote. With Perez Balladares now a
lame duck, the housing minister announced he would seek the
governing party's nomination for president, saying that his humble
origins make him the ideal candidate to administer the former Canal
Zone in the interests of the Panamanian people.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups have also aimed their fire at the director of
the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a
president in the Noriega years, demanding that he resign. But
Barletta complained in an interview here that the issue of the
houses has ``turned political'' and rejected any accusations of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to diminish what has been a task well done,''
said Barletta in an interview at the authority's headquarters in a
``reverted area'' that is being turned into a hotel and yacht
complex. ``Nothing illegal or immoral has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers and real-estate dealers here say that the two
Cabinet members should have been excluded from taking possession of
the houses as renters because they already own other homes.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the transfer of the Albrook Air Force Station, less
than half the 6,000 buildings and one-third of the land in the
former Canal Zone are under Panamanian control. The real windfall
comes in the next year, when the United States is scheduled to turn
over real estate valued at an estimated at $3.4 billion, including
nearly 2,500 houses at four different military bases.

COMMENTARY: SHAKESPEARE WAS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was inevitable, of course, that lawyers would
destroy civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare warned us to kill them all. We didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And now Washington is in a psychosexual meltdown so insane that
the rest of the country _ and the world _ can only watch in horror.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to update the notion of the best and the brightest. It
used to be politicians and their ambitious staffers who dragged us
into our long national nightmares. Now it's top-flight lawyers who
bollix up everything and make a ton of money doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is in a titanic twilight struggle between armies of
lawyers. The president and first lady came from a generation that
believed the law was the highest calling. Now the First Lawyers owe
more than $6 million to lawyers who have given them bad legal
advice and allowed Clinton to turn his White House into a lying
machine and dodge behind silly, tortured legalisms about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tim Allen's tool man, who has tools to fix tools, this
White House has a record number of lawyers, and more lawyers to fix
the problems of its lawyers. It even has spinner lawyers to put the
best light on stupid things the lawyers are doing.
</P>
<P>
   The capital's independent counsels have grown Brobdingnagian.
Congress is full of lawyers. Television is swarming with legal
pundits.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment exercised in Washington seems to be in inverse
proportion to the number of fine legal minds involved.
</P>
<P>
   Now David Kendall and Kenneth Starr are in a nasty little spat
about who is to blame for subjecting the country to the videotape
of the First Deponent squirming, dissembling, evading and blowing
his top.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall says Starr acted in bad faith. Starr says Kendall made a
bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a consensus that Kendall and the president
blundered horribly _ just as Bob Bennett and the president
blundered when they failed to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit that
ended up spawning Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts, and some White House aides, agree that the
president would have been better off doing the perp walk into the
grand jury, or inviting the jury to the White House, so that no
incendiary tape existed.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may have outfoxed Kendall. But handing over the videotape
he said he had made for absent grand jurors to Republicans, who are
salivating over its potential for further embarrassment to the
president, is another example of Starr's wretched excess.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor videotaped the president's testimony, just in
case any grand jurors missed it when it was broadcast live, via
closed-circuit feed, from the White House to the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall tried to persuade Starr to agree to destroy the tape
after it was played for the one or two absent grand jurors. (What
could they have been doing that was more important?) But after the
testimony, Starr refused, saying he would not destroy ``evidence of
a crime.'' Instead, he shipped it to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The avenging, evangelical prosecutor never seems to give a
thought to how his relentless chase is riving the nation. He seems
determined not only to overthrow the president, but to overturn the
'60s, and restore the black-and-white moral code that existed
before the decade of sex, drugs and draft evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is guilty of Orwellian language, but Starr is pressing
the ominous Orwellian concept of sex crimes against the government.
``The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct,'' Orwell wrote in
``1984,'' ``or if it could not be killed, then to distort it and
dirty it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of prosecutors set perjury traps and public relations
traps. But Starr is treating the president of the United States
like a Mafia don.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Starr would have destroyed the tape even if Clinton had
told the uncomfortable truth.
</P>
<P>
   As Jeffrey Rosen writes in this week's ``New Republic,'' the
Lewinsky affair is no longer a sex scandal, but a constitutional
crisis. By allowing Starr to decide which crimes are impeachable
offenses, the House creates ``a constitutional aberration: a
politically unaccountable and unconstrained officer who combines
the functions of prosecutor, legislator, judge and jury.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late. Let's kill all of them. &QL;

   CLINTON-NEWT _ Washington _ In another time, Newt Gingrich would
have relished an all-out attack on President Clinton as much as any
Republican in the House of Representatives. He would have scoffed
at party elders who tried to rein in his speeches on the House
floor, speeches that first made his national reputation. But as the
Republican Speaker of the House, Gingrich is managing the most
delicate issue of his long career in Congress and he is keenly
aware _ unlike at some moments in the past _ that people are
parsing his every word. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CHECK-CASHERS _ WASHINGTON _ Check-cashing stores, once thought
of as part of the fringe banking community, are taking a step
towards the economic mainstream as an unintended consequence of a
federal program to pay benfits through electronic transfers rather
than by paper checks. U.S. Treasury officials estimate that as much
as $16 billion worth of government checks every year are sent to
citizens who do not have a bank. In an effort to grab a piece of
that business, the check-cashing industry and major banks have
formed an economic alliance that allows check-cashing stores to
begin handing out ATM cards to the ``unbanked'' starting next
month. This is yet another step in creating dual banking systems:
one for the affluent and a separate more expensive alternative for
low-income families. (Shepard and Jaspin, Cox News Service).

   SCOTLAND-SCOTCH _ GLEN LIVET, Scotland _ Robbie Hughes casts a
stainless steel cannister into the small natural pool, breaking the
glassy surface. He reels in the metal container and pours some of
the cold, crystaline water into glasses. ``Take a taste,'' he tells
his visitors. When the water is consumed, he opens the doors behind
a cabinet built by the water and pulls out a half full bottle of
pale, golden Tormore single malt Scotch. ``Now,'' he says,'' Take a
taste of this.'' For 60 years the rainwater has been filtered and
amended by the hills before bubbling up in the cold springs of Burn
Auchmochsen. As it passes through the rocky layers, gaining
minerals and peat, the water emerges just a little bit shy of being
this drink. ``Best bar in the world, isn't it,'' Hughes says
without expecting or getting any argument. It is also just about
the only place to get a taste of Tormore. Despite a growing
American demand for the special, distinct flavors found only in
single malt Scotches, modern economics are leading to the
extinction of single malt brands by the dozens. (Roughton, Cox News

   NUWAUBIAN _ A separatist-group leader who relocated his base
from Brooklyn, New York to a farm in rural Georgia has been linked
to a wide range of criminal activity, including the re-activated
investigation of a 1979 assasination-style killing of a Brooklyn
community activist. Dwight York, also known as Dr. Malachi Z. York
and formerly known as Asi Muhammed, was from the late 1970s until
1993 the leader of a Muslim-oriented group called Ansaru Allah
Community, comprised of about 700 members living in a community of
about 20 to 30 apartment homes in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.
York, 53, purchased a 400-acre farm in Putnam County in 1993 and
moved there with about 150 members of his group, which he re-named
the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors. Though the group has kept a
relatively low profile since the move, Putnam County officials and
local black leaders have recently expressed concerns that York and
the Nuwaubians -- nearly all of whom are black -- are attempting to
stir up racial hostility and to build up their political power, to
the point where he can either dominate local politics or set up a
separate governmental entity. (Osinski, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 100-120.

<P>
   The center of Tropical Storm Hermine with wind gusting over 45
miles an hour will approach the eastern Gulf Coast on Sunday
accompanied by showers and some heavy thunderstorms. The heaviest
rain is expected Sunday afternoon from northern Florida to southern
parts of Georgia and Mississippi where local flooding is possible.
Farther west, scattered thundershowers will brush the coast of
northern Texas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly cloudy skies will linger near the central and southern
Appalachians, where moist winds ascend the sloping terrain.
Scattered showers and some afternoon thunder will occur in southern
sections. Meanwhile, partly sunny skies and rather humid air will
cover most of the northeast and middle Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   A band of showers and thunderstorms will accompany a front as it
moves into the eastern Great Lakes and central Mississippi Valley.
Cooler and drier air with gusty breezes will follow the front, but
some clouds and light showers will linger from northern Montana to
northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moist breezes from the east will promote clouds and showers
along the east slopes of the central and northern Rockies. Farther
south, ample sunshine will prevail from the southern Plains to the
southwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, some clouds and scattered showers will develop
under a whirlpool of chilly air aloft. Nevertheless, offshore
breezes will favor considerable sunshine east of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the center of powerful Hurricane Georges with central
winds over 120 mph will approach the northern Windward Islands.

   On Saturday, Typhoon Todd buffeted the coast of China while
Atlantic Hurricane Georges approached the Lesser Antilles. These
storms, like all tropical storms and hurricanes performed the
important function of moving heat from the tropics toward the
middle latitudes. In the cold season, powerful winter storms
transport frigid air toward the equator while circulating warmer
air toward the poles, helping to erase the natural global energy
imbalance. In summer, when midlatitude storms are weak, tropical
storms, both benign and destructive, help to balance the weather
budget.

 SOSA vs. McGWIRE: IT'S A RACE, BUT IS IT ALSO ABOUT RACE?  
(bl) 
 By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All across the country, Americans are talking baseball and home
runs. Or more basically, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Take a seat
at the bar in Denver, or at a hamburger joint in Los Angeles. The
questions are simple: Who are you rooting for in the home run race?
And why?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are not so simple. It does not take long for the
vexing issues of race and national origin to creep onto the field.
In Atlanta or Boston, in Houston or Miami, awkward pauses and
disagreements renew the long, uncomfortable relationship between
the national pastime and the national enigma.
</P>
<P>
   With only one week to go in the Home Run Derby of 1998, with two
players already past Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs in a
season, the overwhelming reaction of sports fans and nonfans has
been delight at the simple joy of the competition. McGwire of the
St. Louis Cardinals, who had 64 home runs going into Saturday's
games, and Sosa of Chicago Cubs, who had 63, are seen as
embodiments of power, sportsmanship and grace.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a fact remains, mentioned frequently by fans: One of the
sluggers, McGwire, happens to be a white, red-headed Californian, a
European American. The other, Sosa, is a dark-skinned,
Spanish-speaking Dominican, a Latin American.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of conversations in 10 cities in recent days, the
complexities of race emerged from the simplest questions about the
home run race. The answers raise more questions, unsettled and
unsettling: If it is a matter of pride for Latinos to root for
Sosa, why would many consider it racist for whites to root for
McGwire because he is white? And how precise are the racial labels
anyway? Which group may claim Sosa as a hero? And what of
citizenship? Will an immigrant, a U.S. citizen, be considered by
everyone an American hero if he wins?
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that many people of all races and
backgrounds are rooting for each player regardless of race. Both
players have received standing ovations in every city. Their
memorabilia fly off the home shopping channels.
</P>
<P>
   Fans love McGwire for his powerful physique, for his on-field
hugs of his son, the part-time bat boy. He is Big Mac, or Paul
Bunyan in Cardinals red with a white-ash bat instead of an ax.
Nearing his 35th birthday, he has been hitting home runs longer
than Sosa, and hitting longer home runs than practically anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Fans love Sosa for his exuberance, for the kisses he blows to
his mother, wife and four children. He is Slammin' Sammy, a
fairy-tale figure rising from poverty in the Dominican Republic to
the 55th floor above Chicago's Lakeshore Drive. Nearly 30, he is
the underdog having a career year for the Cubs, who are scrapping
for a spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Fans love both players for their humility and friendly
competition. To some, their hugs and smiles, without a taint of
animus, are signs of the country's progress in race relations. From
fans there is little of the rancor, and no talk of the threats that
accompanied the last assault on a home run record when Hank Aaron
went through the trauma of death threats as he passed Babe Ruth's
career mark in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a rich kid from USC, and a shoeshine guy from Puerto
Rico,'' said Don DeLew, a 49-year-old artist in Los Angeles. DeLew,
who is white, is a bit off on Sosa's homeland, but he is rooting
for the two players to finish in a tie. ``It's beautiful. It's
America.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who are picking a champion, race often seems to play a
role. Latinos, whites and blacks speak of choosing ``one of our
own'' or ``someone like us.'' This allegiance causes some to
flinch, and fills others with pride.
</P>
<P>
   In Latino neighborhoods across the country, Dominican flags are
flying, and Latinos of every origin are soaping Sosa's name and
uniform No. 21 onto windows. In South Florida, Cuban radio stations
have been preaching that all Hispanics should support Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Rodriguez doesn't need to be talked into it. ``I want the
world to know that who they see in the newspapers and the evening
news is in fact a good, positive Latino man,'' she said. Rodriguez,
who was born in Puerto Rico, is a 32-year-old executive
administrative assistant in Belmont, Calif., in the Silicon Valley.
She said she cried with pride when McGwire broke the record.
</P>
<P>
   But of Sosa she said: ``We've taken him as our hero. Why do we
do that? Because, in this country, unfortunately, Latins _ a lot of
Latins _ fear success.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics know the grim statistics. They are less likely than
other races in this country to finish high school or to own their
homes. But they have found success on the baseball field. One-third
of all professional baseball players come from Latin America, and
Sosa is following role models such as the late Roberto Clemente, a
Puerto Rican, from whom he adopted the No. 21. Now he is a model
for others.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego last week, 12-year-old Armando Flores III went to a
Padres-Cubs game to see Sosa. ``I've never hit a home run, so I
like to look up to Sammy and see how he does it, how he feels
hitting a home run. My team won the district, and I'm a shortstop,
and I want to be a major league player. I think because he is the
same color of skin as me, I like that. I don't have the same
feeling for Mark McGwire. I don't hate him or like him. I would
like Sosa to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, live jazz and racial identity were on tap at the Mead
Street Bar and Grill. Carolyn Butterfield, 49, who remodels homes,
said she is rooting for McGwire. ``I'm cheering for the hometown
guy, the white guy,'' she said. ``I grew up in New York, the
Brooklyn Dodgers, and I think of all the American sports, baseball
is the one that reflects our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew cautious at this admission, and felt the need to
explain. ``I think Sammy Sosa is a wonderful person, but I'm going
to be 50 in a few weeks, and I grew up in America. I think it's
natural that we relate to whites as our heroes, that Hispanics
relate to their own. It's an affirmation of all of our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The bass player, Dave Randon, 43, was taking his break. ``I
think it's bad to align like that,'' said Randon, who is black. But
his fellow musician, 35-year-old Paul Musso, who is white, said:
``I think it's inevitable that more whites will be in McGwire's
corner, and Hispanics in Sosa's corner. What it comes down to,
though, is two guys who love to play baseball. It's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the racial labels are hard to keep straight. In
Atlanta, with a large African-American population, Sosa is often
considered a black man. In Miami and Los Angeles, with larger
Hispanic populations, he is a Latino man, and the black label is
rejected as robbing Hispanics of a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race has nothing to do with it,'' said Phillip Santos, 19, a
pre-optometry student at the University of Houston. He said he
admires both men, but is rooting for Sosa, because he is Dominican.
``I think it's just natural for people to support someone they
relate to more closely.''
</P>
<P>
   And in all precincts, nationality is up for grabs. McGwire is
often referred to as ``the American,'' and Sosa as ``the
foreigner.'' Hardly anyone seems to know that Sosa has been an
American citizen for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I pull for McGwire because he's an American,''
said Ethon Vivion, 27, a black man, director of health and fitness
for a Boys Club in Atlanta. ``Sosa's a brother, and I'm a brother.
But McGwire's an American.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Texas, at a bar near the Ballpark, Bob Nab is
backing McGwire. ``Americans made the record, and Americans should
break the record. I'm not racist. I've got black and Hispanic
friends,'' said Nab, 29, a white man who works as a plumber in
Longview, Texas. Some of his friends, he said, call Sosa ``a
no-American. They don't like him even being there or having a shot
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, there has been talk for three months that
Sosa was being denied his due, or in street slang his ``props,'' or
proper respect. That talk smoldered at the convention of the
National Association of Hispanic Journalists, in Miami in June,
during Sosa's magical month of 20 home runs. At the start of the
month, he trailed McGwire, 27-13, and was not a threat to break
Maris' record. By month's end, Sosa trailed McGwire by only four,
37-33, and both were leaps above a record-setting pace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the national press corps did not fill the clubhouse of
Sosa's Cubs until mid-August. By then Sosa trailed McGwire by only
one home run, but McGwire's media cloud remained four times as
large. The talk of neglect ignited last Sunday, when Sosa's 62nd
clout seemed to sneak up on baseball. Five days earlier, when
McGwire broke Maris' record, there was a huge celebration.
Chagrined, Major League Baseball has said it will honor both
sluggers, no matter who ends up with the most home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It is understood by most sports fans that McGwire's 62nd and
Sosa's 62nd were not quite equivalent. After all, Sosa had merely
tied a five-day-old record. (If anything involving 62 home runs can
be mere.) As of Saturday, there had not been a morning this season
when Sosa had awakened with sole ownership of the home-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no prize for second,'' said Jamal Smalls, 20, a Sprint
employee in Boston, a black man squarely in McGwire's camp because
of his hitting dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is seeking no pity. ``Mark was there first,'' he said this
week in San Diego. But the question rests uneasily on the minds of
many fans, whatever their race. ``I don't want to see it as Sosa
didn't get the same treatment because he's Hispanic and he's
black,'' said Joe Someillan, 29, a native of Cuba who works for a
Miami hearing aid company. ``I guess you want to try and ignore it.
But it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago before Friday's game at Wrigley Field, two white men,
Cincinnati Reds fans, batted the topic around as they waited for
Sosa to hit a batting-practice home run toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right,'' said E.J. Nemeth, 45, a builder
from Detroit. ``Where's all the fanfare for Sosa? Because he's not
white?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said his friend, Ron Weitz, 44, an iron worker from
Cincinnati. ``I think it's because McGwire got there first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Nemeth said, ``maybe he's right. The bottom
line is, Sammy deserves his due. Maybe it's not all race, but it's
time we dissolve this color issue.''

TOUGH INSIDE LOOKS AT THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Colo.)  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two recent football books do something that most books of their
type don't: paint a realistic portrait of what happens in the lives
of the people who make up professional football.
</P>
<P>
   One is by Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf, titled ``The
Packer Way.'' In it, Wolf discusses some of the key decisions he
made to develop the Packers, the dominant team of the 1960s, into
one of the dominant teams of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the early 1990s, Wolf told the Packers' board of directors
that the player who was going to turn the franchise around was a
guy named Brett Favre. ``I even told them he would wear No. 4, and
he would be like what Lou Gehrig meant to the Yankee franchise,''
Wolf writes. ``You should have felt the silence and seen the
looks.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When Mike Holmgren was going through the interview process
before becoming head coach, Wolf writes, the general manager told
Holmgren that he had interviewed Bill Parcells. When Parcells
removed himself from the search, Holmgren was the guy Wolf wanted,
though he thought about Bill Cowher, now the coach of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before joining the Packers, defensive end Reggie White was the
most coveted player in free agent history. A number of teams
offered White all kinds of perks, and Wolf writes that the wife of
Art Modell gave White's wife, Sara, a $900 leather coat during
White's visit to Cleveland. How did Wolf wine and dine White when
he finally made it to visit the Packers? White and Wolf went to
lunch at a Red Lobster in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wolf, whose personnel decisions were among the main reasons
the Packers won the Super Bowl two years ago, the team's first in
29 years, credits Al Davis, Chuck Noll, Dick Steinberg and Ken
Herock with helping him form his drafting practices. Wolf also
writes that when he was with Davis in Oakland in the early 1970s,
helping to run the personnel department, Davis did not pay Wolf
what Wolf thought he was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Does Wolf worry that his book might upset some people? ``This
isn't that kind of book,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It's
more of a how-to book, how to run a business or an organization.
I'm sure I'll offend someone, though, but I hope people
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The other book, written by Terrell Davis, the Denver Broncos
running back and Super Bowl XXXII most valuable player, is much
more gritty. In ``TD: Dreams in Motion, The Memoirs of the Denver
Broncos' Terrell Davis,'' the player writes that when he was young,
his father, who Davis says served several prison terms on robbery
and weapons charges, once lined up Davis and his brothers against a
wall in their bedroom and started shooting a .38-caliber handgun in
their direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to living with my pops,'' Davis writes, ``my
brothers and I saw guns so often, it became as routine as seeing
the ice cream truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' brother Bobby assaulted a pregnant woman during a robbery
in San Diego when Davis was young. The woman survived, but the baby
was stillborn and the case became a landmark event when it ignited
a debate over the legal status of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   As for his football career, Davis, who just signed the richest
contract in team history with a nine-year, $56.1 million deal, came
close to quitting the Broncos his rookie year, 1995, because he was
frustrated with football. Two days before a preseason game against
San Francisco in Tokyo, he was trying to book a flight back to the
United States. But no operators spoke English, so he eventually
gave up and stayed. The Broncos are happy he did.

NFL NOTEBOOK

<P>
   JETS MAY BACK SEMINAR TO AID PLAYERS OFF THE FIELD
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets are among seven teams considering taking part
in an experimental program aimed at keeping National Football
League players out of trouble off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The program is modeled after the league's successful rookie
orientation symposium. The league wants to use a yearly three-hour
seminar to advise players on how to deal with such issues as
domestic violence, drug use, gambling, anger management, safe sex
and managing finances.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL hopes the seminar, which features lectures from experts
and skits performed by actors, will better educate its players and
thus cut down on what has been an embarrassing number of
off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   While many professional sports teams put on such seminars for
rookies _ and the NFL's symposium for rookie players is considered
the best _ the league's attempt to reach veteran players on a
team-by-team basis would be the first of its kind in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The league approached the Jets first because Bill Parcells is
one of the game's most respected coaches, and the NFL figured that
if Parcells agreed to the symposium, then other teams would follow.
Parcells was excited about the idea and has been pushing for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were scheduled to hold the symposium during this week,
when the team has a bye after playing its third game Sunday against
the Indianapolis Colts. But the Jets are in an 0-2 minicrisis, and
Parcells may want to postpone the symposium until later.
</P>
<P>
   The league has at least six teams committed to using the seminar
this season. If the seminar is successful _ and most teams think it
will be _ it could spread to every team within several years. Some
league officials think the seminars may be the most important tool
to combat what they say is a growing concern.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATELY SEEKING QUARTERBACKS
</P>
<P>
   How desperate are teams to find good quarterbacks? After Rick
Mirer washed out in Chicago, he recently got a four-year, $8.55
million deal from Green Bay that included an $800,000 signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the payout is in the final two years. The
Packers think they can turn his career around.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many NFL personnel men think Scott Mitchell, recently
relegated to third string by the Lions' coaching staff, is done as
a starting quarterback. Look for the Lions to release him at the
end of the season and for Mitchell to be playing with a team like
Miami or Dallas as a backup next year.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL SAVVY
</P>
<P>
   A sign that times have changed in sports: With concerns that the
year 2000 computer bug could wreak havoc with some banks, one NFL
player called his agent last week and said that several players on
his team were going to pull all their money out of banks _ millions
of dollars _ and keep it in their houses. The agent advised the
player that it was a bad idea.

IT'S A `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' FIRST FOR 32 GIANT PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These impressionable New York Giants, the youngest team in the
National Football League, all grew up watching ``Monday Night
Football.'' As safety Sam Garnes said: ``I missed it once, when I
was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Since just 11 current Giants were born before the inaugural
``Monday Night Football'' game in 1970, and none were born before
1967, pro football's longest-running television series has been an
enduring backdrop to their football lives _ something that players
all around the locker room acknowledged this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, then, is a big day for them. Thirty-two Giants from the
team's active roster get their first chance to play Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants haven't been on ``Monday Night Football,'' the
league's grandest regular-season showcase, since their
season-opening game in 1995 _ a hope-dashing 35-0 home defeat by
the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   This Monday, when the Cowboys return to Giants Stadium, the
Giants will have only eight starters from that 1995 game.
</P>
<P>
   How the young Giants handle what can be a daunting atmosphere
will be one of the more revealing stories of this 1998 game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel remade the Giants in 1997, weeding out players
from the Dan Reeves era in an effort to recast the team in a more
youthful, aggressive mold. When the Giants won the National
Football Conference East last year, Fassel's transformation of the
team was seen by many as a changing of the guard in the division _
especially since the Giants became the first NFC East team to go
undefeated in the division.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Fassel's charges have already staggered to an
inconsistent 1-1 start. Now they must show they can grow accustomed
to playing in the spotlighted games. It will be one of the foremost
challenges the Giants face this season. Monday's game is just the
first of three nationally televised Monday or Sunday night games
for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are old ghosts the new Giants must expunge, and
one of them is defeating the Cowboys on ``Monday Night Football,''
something the Giants have not done in five attempts since 1971.
Just playing on Monday night, and getting experience for a young
team, is a step.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants take the field with just four players who have
started more than one Monday night game. Across the line will be
the Cowboys, and while they may not be the power they once were, 17
of their 22 probable starters are NFL veterans who have started a
``Monday Night Football'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, too, will be making his first appearance as a head coach
on ``Monday Night Football,'' although as an offensive coordinator
and quarterbacks coach with other teams he worked the sideline for
several Monday night games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the second-year Giants head coach admitted it was a
special step for the franchise and his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about getting the organization back on `Monday
Night Football' when the schedule came out,'' Fassel said. ``It's
special and different. It means you did some things right the year
before or they wouldn't want to see your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the players if handled properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is also a division game, in a division where no
team won a game a week ago, a division in which a 1-1 record is
good enough for first place after the second week. In the 1998 NFC
East, an 8-8 record might be good enough for first place after the
17th week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real excited about playing on `Monday Night Football,'''
said Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead. ``But I'm more excited
about playing Dallas and getting some edge in the division. It
would be nice to play well so the world can see that we're a good
team, but the best way to do that is to start defending our title
the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants quarterback Danny Kanell will be making his first
``Monday Night Football'' appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm psyched,'' he said Friday. ``I've been watching it since I
was a little kid. There will be more adrenaline flowing, but for me
as a quarterback, I have to tone that down so I don't get too
emotionally involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel, whose debut as a NFL assistant coach _ with the
Giants in 1991 _ was on a Monday night, said last week: ``Once the
game starts, I put all the rest of the stuff away. It never occurs
to me. It could be Tuesday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for Fassel to say. The Giants won that Monday night
game, Sept. 2, 1991, against the San Francisco 49ers. The Giants
haven't won a Monday night game at Giants Stadium since.

U.S. DRUG CHIEF SEEKS OVERHAUL OF STRATEGY AT BORDER

   WASHINGTON _ U.S. border inspectors searched slightly more than
a million commercial trucks and railway cars entering the United
States from Mexico last year. They found cocaine stashed in cargo
compartments on only six occasions, said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the
White House director of drug-control policy.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the dispiriting statistic in pressing for an overhaul
of the strategy for stanching the flow of illegal drugs into the
United States. Slightly more than half of the cocaine smuggled into
the United States, and much of the heroin, marijuana and
methamphetamines, comes through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is proposing that interdiction operations along the
2,000-mile-long southwestern border be coordinated by a single
federal official, who would assume responsibility for all
counter-drug efforts by a half-dozen government departments and no
fewer than 22 federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, who holds Cabinet-level rank as the
administration's top drug-control official, is getting a cool
response from other government institutions like the Justice and
Treasury departments, where spokesmen said last week only that his
proposal was under review.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials who follow drug policy in Washington said that
the proposal failed to spell out whom a new border drug ``czar''
would report to and who would control actual operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some departments and agencies fear that the proposal could
infringe on their authority and their budgets. McCaffrey presides
over a federal drug-control budget exceeding $16 billion this year,
but actual allocations are proposed and controlled by the
departments and agencies involved.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said in an interview that his proposal harbors no
hidden agenda. He said that more efficient cooperation and superior
technology were needed to interdict illegal drugs at the
southwestern border and its 24 ports of entry and 39 other
sanctioned crossing points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a big deal,'' McCaffrey said. ``It's organizing 39
places so that manpower, technology and intelligence make it very
risky to smuggle things that are, by weight, more valuable than
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   For the proposed border czar, McCaffrey said he envisioned a
politician, lawyer or law-enforcement professional who speaks
Spanish, is highly regarded in the border community and favors
close cooperation with Mexico. He did not mention any names.
</P>
<P>
   Buying more sophisticated radar, scanning and night-vision
equipment, he said, would cost a fraction of the $2 billion that
the government already spends annually to combat border smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about the Marshall Plan,'' McCaffrey said.
``I'm talking about better organization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 11,000 U.S. inspectors, agents and other officials are
deployed along the border with Mexico. But their resources are
strained by the cross-border traffic that has burgeoned since the
North American Free Trade Agreement was carried out nearly five
years ago. Such traffic amounted to 254 million crossings by
people, most of them in 75 million cars, and 3.5 million trucks and
railway cars entering the United States from Mexico in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Information about border smuggling is so fragmented and
incomplete, McCaffrey said, that it leaves some drug operations
running blind. ``Whether we and the traffickers end up at the same
point is all too often left to luck and gritty, individual police
work,'' he said in a speech in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   A draft summary of McCaffrey's proposal, which has been sent to
some members of Congress as well as to other government officials,
identified some specific obstacles to be overcome in fighting drug
smuggling along the border:
</P>
<P>
   _ Communications systems used by different agencies are
sometimes incompatible, leaving them isolated or relying on
``jerry-built solutions'' to keep in touch with law-enforcement
operations working the border.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agencies collecting intelligence often fail to share it with
other organizations that are in a position to catch drug smugglers,
and sometimes cannot reach everyone in their own ranks in time to
stop a drug shipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Efficient technology for screening vehicles for smuggled drugs
without a time-consuming physical search is seriously lacking. Only
three devices capable of scanning trucks for hidden compartments
are deployed along the border. ``Traffickers quickly adjust to the
construction of such devices and shift drugs elsewhere,'' the
summary said. As a result, the report said, the number of cocaine
seizures at checkpoints and traffic stops last year was less than
half the number made in 1995. Cocaine seizures as a result of
investigations were only one-quarter of those in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno picked a federal
attorney in New Mexico, John J. Kelly, as her representative for
the southwest border region. Reno created the post in 1995 to
coordinate the efforts of the FBI, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
Border Patrol, which all fall under the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement does not include the Customs Service, which
conducts most border inspections, and the financial crimes units of
the Treasury Department, which tracks money laundering. The State
Department and the Pentagon run their own anti-drug programs in
Latin America. The Department of Transportation watches
cross-border traffic and supervises the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Conscious of looking tough on drugs in an election year,
Congress disregarded other advice from McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved its version
of a new Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, which calls for
an 80 percent cut in the flow of illicit drugs into the United
States by the end of 2001 and authorized $2.6 billion that has yet
to be appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, McCaffrey
called the target of 80 percent ``completely unrealistic.'' He has
set a target of a 10 percent reduction for the same period.

   AN INTERN, AN AFFAIR AND A STATE SENATOR
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, Dan Burton, Helen Chenoweth, Henry Hyde _ from the
halls of the White House to the halls of Congress, the list of
lofty elected officials who have admitted engaging in extramarital
affairs grows ever longer.
</P>
<P>
   Now add to that list the name of a somewhat less lofty but no
less deeply red-faced elected official from beyond the Beltway:
state Sen. Steven Johnson of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, The Kokomo Tribune reported that Johnson, 50, a
Republican who represents four counties in central Indiana, had
engaged in an adulterous relationship with a woman. But that was
not the news.
</P>
<P>
   The news _ the real news _ was that the woman was a 23-year-old
college intern who worked in the senator's office in the 1997
legislative session. The parallel between Johnson-intern and
Clinton-intern was undeniable. And demands for an investigation and
the senator's resignation have since been voiced.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president, the senator has refused to resign, saying at
one point last week, much like the president, that he still had ``a
great deal to offer'' and was committing himself to being ``a great
legislator.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the president, the senator has engaged in no denials
and no verbal hairsplitting about his relationship with the intern,
whose name has not been disclosed. He confessed and apologized up
front, on Day One.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot and will not attempt to excuse my actions,'' he said
in a statement released when the first news article appeared. ``The
relationship was with a person that worked with me, and I accept
full responsibility for my actions. I have committed a moral and
ethical wrong. For that I am forever sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Will such an admission of guilt and expression of regret be
enough to satisfy members of the Indiana Senate's Ethics Committee,
which is pondering whether to intervene?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say, given the scandal-singed political atmosphere
enveloping the nation. One of the committee's first and toughest
considerations must be that Johnson is its ranking Republican
member.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who is unopposed this fall for re-election to a
fourth four-year term, said that he had discussed his indiscretion
with his wife and that they were in counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Will she stand by her man? Or show him the door?
</P>
<P>
   She told The Indianapolis Star News the other day that she still
loved him and always would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgive him,'' she said.
</P>

<P>
   WILSON'S LOVE-HIM, LOVE-HIM-NOT POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Pete Wilson has fought a lot of tough battles in almost eight
years as governor of California. But his toughest fight has always
been with the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his respectable successes in pushing through legislative
programs, despite his mostly middle-of-the-road brand of
Republicanism and despite his impressive come-from-behind
re-election victory in 1994, he has never gotten very high job
performance ratings from his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exception, they have always viewed him more negatively
than positively when approached by poll-takers, with many saying
the problem is not so much what he does in office as the dry,
hard-edged way he tends to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken over the last eight years _ and there have been
dozens _ have typically found that roughly 35 percent of the
respondents give the governor a poor to very poor job performance
rating, compared with only about 27 percent rating him very good to
good. Thirty-five percent or so have rated him fair and the
remaining 3 percent have been undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But as Wilson prepares to leave office in early 1999, his poll
numbers are starting to change, according to the latest survey
conducted by the Field Poll, perhaps California's best-known public
opinion organization.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's negatives vs. positives have essentially flip-flopped,
with about 35 percent of the respondents now rating his job
performance very good to good, compared with less than 30 percent
rating it poor to very poor. The fair and the undecided ratings
remain about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Why the flip-flop?
</P>
<P>
   The governor may have mellowed a bit recently. But the real
reason for his improved poll numbers, the poll-takers say, is a
perception among Californians that with the economy up, crime down,
roads better, the environment cleaner and taxes holding steady,
life is better in the Golden State _ and Wilson should get some of
the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pollsters caution the governor about reading his
current numbers as an all-clear for him to run again for president,
something he has been considering.
</P>
<P>
   Californians didn't want him to run in 1996 and, according to
the new Field Poll, close to two of every three don't want him to
try it again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Without biggest-of-all California, a second Wilson candidacy
almost certainly would be doomed, too.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   LACK OF GREEN ALTERS THE TINT OF THIS RACE
</P>
<P>
   If a Green Party candidate had not siphoned off dissident
Democratic votes four years ago in New Mexico's governor's race,
the Republican candidate, Gary Johnson, might still be running a
big construction company instead of running for re-election. But
this time around there is no Green on the ballot and Democrats are
confident that their candidate, Martin Chavez, a former Albuquerque
mayor, has a real shot at taking Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll commissioned by The Albuquerque Journal indicates
that such confidence is probably not misplaced. The poll found the
race to be a dead heat at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Political pros are not surprised. They have said all along that
because the governor, a conservative, has spent much of his time in
office cutting programs and vetoing bills sent over by the
Democrat-dominated Legislature rather than pressing his own
legislative agenda _ some Democratic leaders call him Dr. No _ he
very well could lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasn't always shown great political skills,'' Stuart
Rothenberg of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report wrote in
one of his analyses of the race.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the pros note that Chavez, a Democrat and a
Hispanic in a heavily Democratic and heavily Hispanic state, is
best known as an aggressive doer, a political moderate who when
mayor of Albuquerque won national recognition for his anti-crime
and job-creation programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very good candidate,'' Charles Cook Jr., editor of The Cook
Political Report, another nonpartisan publication, wrote when he
looked at the race.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's conclusion: ``The playing field here is pretty level. May
turn out to be one of Democrats' best opportunities to knock off a
Republican incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Republican governors outnumber Democrats almost 2 to

ACCESS TO CLINTON DATA ABETS E PLURIBUS UNUM, '90S STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Mass., Minn.)  (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-VIDEOTAPE, CLINTON-GORE,
CLINTON-CHRISTIANS) 
(js) 
 By AMY HARMON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Ericson was not one of the millions of Americans scrolling
through the report by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr in
cyberspace last week. He read it in his local paper. Nor does he
plan to waste bandwidth downloading the videotape of President
Clinton's testimony when it is made available this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Ericson, a 33-year-old graphic designer from St. Paul, has
spent hours composing and absorbing a flood of e-mail about the
report from an online discussion group of about 400
fellow-Minnesotans. ``People have very different opinions, and I
haven't seen anyone giving way too much,'' Ericson said. ``But it's
only been a week. Our debate over carrying concealed weapons has
been going on heavily for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress' decision last week to release Starr's report over the
Internet was seen as a defining moment for the global computer
network, a test of both its technical infrastructure and its
ability to play a critical role in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the ad hoc experiment in electronic democracy was
a success. The extraordinary run on government and news sites _ by
one count, 20 million Americans had read parts of the report online
within 48 hours of its release _ reflected a public thirst for
instant, unfiltered information driven in part by the technology
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling web of chips and fiber strained under its heaviest
load ever but did not snap.
</P>
<P>
   But as part one of the stampede for the Starr report abates and
Webmasters brace for part two _ the expected release of the
videotape on Monday _ the real test of the Internet as a tool of
citizenship lies in politics beyond scandal and salacious details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'll see millions of people downloading
Social Security reform legislation, but we could,'' said Jonah
Seiger, co-founder of Mindshare Internet Campaigns
(www.mindshare.net), a political consulting firm based in
Washington. ``This event on the Internet is changing the way people
perceive their role in our political system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, invented as a communications network for
scientists and academics and financed by the Department of Defense,
has had plenty of other milestone moments in the last three years
as it evolved into a mass medium and a global platform for
everything from electronic commerce to dating.
</P>
<P>
   When Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash last year,
people the world over convened in cyberspace to mourn. When NASA
published Pathfinder's first pictures from Mars last summer,
millions logged on for a glimpse of the red planet. And when the
stock market took a nosedive last month, traffic surged to record
highs at some financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in an unfolding national political
crisis, the Internet has become a place to turn both for
information and debate.
</P>
<P>
   From the rumors of President Clinton's affair with an intern,
first reported in January on the Web site of the Internet gossip
columnist Matt Drudge, to the revelation last week by the online
magazine Salon of Rep.Henry Hyde's extramarital affair 30 years
ago, the Internet has played a central and controversial role in
informing the public about the presidential sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And at least for the moment, the medium seems inseparable from
that particular message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers go out with the recycling,'' said Jonathan
Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and
Society at Harvard University. ``Once it's on the Web digitally,
your sister-in-law can send you the best parts by e-mail. It forces
a level of engagement with the primary material there's no way you
would have had otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marilyn Lyon, 54, of Mission, Kan., who read Starr's report
on the Internet the day it appeared, there is another advantage.
``The news today is so loaded with emotion and opinion that it
irritates me.'' Ms. Lyon said. ``This way I can read it without
commercials popping in all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet online activists warn that surfing the Web for alternative
news sources is very different from using the Internet to forge
political consensus over an issue as fraught with emotion as the
impeachment of a president. Access to raw data may make for a more
informed electorate, but not necessarily a more united one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy means more than just reading a document,'' said
Steven Clift, chairman of Minnesota E-Democracy, the group that
runs the e-mail list that Ericson subscribes to. ``What will
determine how the Internet does is what happens in the next few
months as we move from the reading phase to the discussing phase.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some longtime ``netizens'' argue that many Americans have formed
an Internet political habit that will extend beyond the current
scandal _ and beyond the Internet. Others argue that to exploit the
democratic potential of the medium, legislators will have to do
more than just publish the occasional high-profile document online;
they may actually have to interact in cyberspace with their
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would be nice to see Congress come out on the Net a
bit and talk to people about these things,'' said Clift. He noted
that the Web site where the House of Representatives published the
Starr report has no area for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in private e-mail, on Web site forums and chat rooms and
voluntary online polls, Americans found a way to type their
politics into the ether in record numbers all last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clift tried to direct his discussion list back to
its regular diet of Minnesota politics, with only limited success.
It was a phenomenon not unique to Minnesota: As of Friday morning,
subscribers to America Online had posted more than 400,000 messages
in the area set aside for discussion of the president's affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conversations over the dinner table are fleeting,'' said Barry
Schuler, America Online's president for interactive services.
``With message boards, what you have is a real-time
member-published journal. Especially with a topic where there's so
much dissonance, it helps to have an ongoing dialogue that's taking
shape over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, part of the Internet's appeal is that it resonates
with an American political ideal of unfiltered, unmediated
communication. Now, at a time when national political participation
has been at one of its lowest ebbs _ turnout in the November
election is expected to be sparser than ever _ there is some hope
among the politically and digitally inclined that expanded access
to the Internet will encourage a more activist electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find most interesting about all of this is the way in
which the Internet has changed our expectations,'' said Jeffrey
Eisenach, president of the conservative Progress and Freedom
Foundation. ``It makes people expect information about government
and everything else to be available instantly and at almost no
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent events in Washington have been exploited for
commercial purposes as well. Already, marketers have used the Starr
report in mass e-mailings known as spam as a way to tempt consumers
to read advertising pitches.

HARD TO TELL, BUT IT SEEMS AS IF SWEDES ARE VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Sweden this weekend is staging its
quadrennial political fete, a national election, and the exercise
is uneventful and unimpassioned _ indeed, barely detectable.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Swedes will go to the polls to choose the 349 members
of their parliament, the Riksdag, and a multitude of municipal
officials. The results will determine whether the Social Democratic
prime minister, Goran Persson, will remain in office or if Carl
Bildt of the Moderate Party, the one-time chief foreign peace envoy
to Bosnia, will succeed in returning to the prime minister's post,
which he occupied from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of the 6.7 million registered voters are
expected to cast ballots, and that is not the only evidence that
Swedes take their elections very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish politics have their focus more on bread-and-butter
issues of domestic security and stability than on exotic foreign
concerns or the personal appeal of the candidates, and the
campaigns follow this purposeful pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Since the administrations that emerge are generally cooperative
groupings of parties, the competition between them is respectful,
aimed at leaving few wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards and posters that festoon buildings and light
poles in other democratic societies during voting seasons are
limited here to tasteful size and presentation and are permitted
only in public spaces. One can travel blocks through Stockholm and
its suburbs without sighting a single slogan. No sound-truck
summonses to action disturb the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies conducted by the leaders of the eight parties are
orderly and unobtrusive, with some crowds as sparse as 10 to 15
people. There are no surprises on the stump. The party
presentations across the country are controlled from headquarters,
and candidates resolutely keep to the message.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one scandal: Gudrun Schyman, the candidate
of the formerly communist Left Party and an ardent opponent of
illegal jobs and exploitation of women workers, was found this week
to have paid a 16-year-old girl to clean her house without
declaring it.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical standards in Swedish public life are exacting. Mona
Sahlin, a former deputy prime minister, had to abandon her campaign
for the top job in 1995 when it was found that she had used her
government credit card for auto rentals and chocolates and diapers
for her children.
</P>
<P>
   No party is expected to win an outright majority. The outcome
will depend on whether the party getting the most votes can forge a
loose coalition with other parties. The eight Swedish parties break
down into a socialist group led by the Social Democrats and a
nonsocialist one led by the Moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats, who have run Sweden for 57 of the last 66
years, promise to increase welfare spending and lower unemployment,
now at 7.3 percent, a high figure for Sweden, which had negligible
joblessness until this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats have been alert to opinion polls that
portray a longing among the aging population for a restoration of
cuts in the country's vast welfare structure, which now already
consumes 46 percent of the gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   The Moderates propose lower taxes _ the rate is now nearly 60
percent on middle-class incomes _ and a reduction in labor costs,
which now oblige employers to pay up to 41 percent of salaries into
social security and pension plans. They also back Sweden's entry
into the European single currency, a position that enjoys scant
public support from Swedes. ``I don't care whether it's popular or
not _ it's right,'' the party leader, Bildt, said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show the Social Democrats with 36.8 percent of
the vote, the Moderates with 24.8 percent and the remaining parties
with vote projections that would give the Social Democrats a sure
grip on power leading a minority government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an effort to inject some color into the gray goings-on this
year, the Social Democrats appealed to the 385,000 expected new
voters with a promotional video portraying a young couple in bed
with titillating copy about the ``first time.'' The ad provoked
objections and was pulled.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the party's youth wing, Niklas Nordstrom, said the
film was an effort to present politics ``with a glint in the eye''
and he protested people's characterizing it as pornographic.
``Those who think it pornographic,'' he said, ``must have awfully
drab lives.''

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif left for the

for a getaway, with people here feeling he has just tried to
eliminate democracy from the constitution.

<P>
   Whatever lies ahead for him this week _ and his schedule
includes meetings with President Clinton and Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee of India as well as a speech before the United
Nations _ the days should seem tranquil compared with those he just
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two of Sharif's pet measures ran into unruly
opposition in Parliament. One was a bill that gave the prime
minister more power, all in the name of Allah, and the other was a
permission slip to sign a nuclear test-ban treaty as a means to
solicit aid from Western donors. In both instances, however worthy
his intentions, Sharif's political antennae relayed all the wrong
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem to ever think before he does something,'' said
Maleeha Lodhi, a newspaper editor and former envoy to the United
States. ``He makes sudden moves and then ends up governing by
retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's plans to amend the constitution were announced Aug. 28,
an unhappy time for him when the only distraction from rising
prices in this near-bankrupt nation was the recent U.S. missile
attack on suspected terrorist bases in neighboring Afghanistan.
Sharif was widely thought to be insufficiently irate about the
bombardment of an Islamic neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   He chose this difficult moment to propose that Islamic justice
be made the supreme law of the land, a tactical mix of politics and
religion with a long history here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must go down on our knees and bow before Allah,'' said
Sharif, a millionaire industrialist. By his reckoning, holy
practices were the only way to end the nation's many years of
``corruption, gratification and maladministration.''
</P>
<P>
   What he meant by full Islamic law was left vague, although he
did promise to protect individual and minority rights. He denied
trying to remold moderate and modern Pakistan into something like
the Afghanistan of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Even a number of the devout questioned the need for the
proposal. The constitution already proclaims Pakistan an Islamic
state, subject to the religion's fundamental principles.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the true motive for Sharif's bill rested less in piety
than in politics. It would change some essential numbers: in
matters of Islam, a simple majority in both houses of Parliament _
rather than the current two-thirds _ would suffice to amend the
constitution. Also, the prime minister would be empowered to issue
decrees that further entrenched Islamic practices.
</P>
<P>
   What would then stop him, critics asked, from pushing bills
through the legislature in the name of Allah? Could he dissolve
Parliament if he considered its actions un-Islamic?
</P>
<P>
   If Sharif expected support from Pakistan's small but vocal
Islamic parties, he was mistaken. ``He is exploiting the Koran to
serve his own interests,'' said Amir-ul-Azeem of the
Jamaat-e-Islami. ``If the government really wants to enforce
Islamic law, the laws are now sufficient. The problem is in the
practices, not in the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opposition, Sharif expected his bill to pass last
week. Instead even members of his own majority party, the Muslim
League, rebelled. They, too, questioned his motives. Some
threatened to quit. And, after a stormy late-night meeting
Thursday, Sharif announced that he was in no great haste to see the
law passed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to get comment from Sharif's Information Ministry as
well as his minister for religious affairs received no response.
</P>
<P>
   Similar political pratfalls accompanied Sharif's request for a
resolution of support on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He
seems inclined to forswear any further nuclear tests, such as the
ones he ordered in May after India, Pakistan's great rival and
neighbor, had exploded its own nuclear devices. But first he wants
the United States to end economic sanctions imposed after the
blasts _ and to help Pakistan get an aid package that would, at
least temporarily, keep it from defaulting on $30 billion in
international debt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prime minister does not need legislative approval
to sign the treaty, he asked for it anyway. He had reason to expect
little resistance. His chief political opponent, Benazir Bhutto,
head of the Pakistan People's Party, has urged him to sign.
</P>
<P>
   But many members of Parliament were reluctant to agree without
knowing the details of negotiations with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharif was not forthcoming, most opposition parties
boycotted a special session of Parliament. The resolution was
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been termed a laudable effort at building
consensus instead became ``another bit of confused theatrics,'' the
newspaper Dawn noted in an editorial.

RANCHERS BEING SABOTAGED IN MODERN RANGE WAR

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERVAY, Wyo. _ Robert Hendry should feel at ease, running a vast
cattle ranch smack in the center of a state that since 1936 has
treasured its trademark logo: a cowboy riding a bucking bronco.
</P>
<P>
   But this real live cowboy darkened last week at the memory of a
rash of vandalism that struck ranchers along the Rattlesnake Range
here as fundamentally ``un-Wyoming.'' In mid-June, as the Wyoming
Stock Growers Association was meeting in Casper, 40 miles east of
here, a carload of vandals traveled 100 miles up and down dirt
roads here, cutting 260 sections of barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in time for the welfare cowboys' convention,'' read
leaflets nailed to fence posts. No group has taken responsibility
for the action and no arrests have been made. But two months
earlier, Earth First Journal, a clearinghouse for the radical
environmental movement, hailed ``rampant fence cutting'' in central
Wyoming, concluding with an appeal, ``Dust off those wire cutters,
folks!''
</P>
<P>
   In this modern range war, radical environmentalists seek to
force grazing cattle off public land by cutting fences and
otherwise carrying out economic sabotage against ranching
operations. With beef prices low, many Western ranchers already
have their financial backs to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a throwback to the 19th century when fence cutting was a
hanging offense in the wilder parts of the West, violence looms
over barbed wire in big sky country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For their own safety, they better lay off,'' Hendry warned of
the people who cut his fences in 60 places. ``If the right group
finds them, they might get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came from Chuck Sylvester, a neighboring rancher who
was also a target of the fence cutters, who drove a sports utility
vehicle. He said: ``Some day, they are going to make a mistake. Any
number of my neighbors are now carrying rifles. They could knock
out a tire, knock out a knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, stakes are rising in the battle between
mainstream society and radical environmentalists and animal rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in one of the toughest sentences handed down in a
case of animal rights terrorism, a Salt Lake City judge gave a
seven-year sentence to Douglas Joshua Ellerman, a 20-year-old
Animal Liberation Front member, for his role in the 1997
firebombing of Utah's principal mink breeders' cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   (On Thursday, an Earth First member, David Chain, was killed by
a falling tree as he tried to block the logging of ancient redwoods
in Northern California. It is the first time a member of the group
has been killed in more than a decade of confrontational protests.)
</P>
<P>
   In cattle country, vandalism has escalated to the point where
more and more ranchers are starting to speak out. In Wyoming, a
crackdown on fence cutters has become a campaign issue in this
fall's county sheriff races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going on for three or more years, but we have
kept it quiet,'' said Ken Hamilton, a leader of the Wyoming Farm
Bureau, an agricultural group. ``We didn't want to give the
terrorists more oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   In central Wyoming, batches of fences were cut four times last
year. But the public did not become aware until June 20, when the
wide-scale attack on fences here was reported in The Casper
Star-Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is: How far are they going to go?'' said Sgt.
Michael Sandfort, who is investigating the case here for the
Natrona County Sheriff's Department. ``Cut fences are an
irritation. But what if we get shot livestock, destroyed windmills,
shot up water tanks? Then we are talking big bucks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Across the West, many environmentalists oppose allowing ranchers
to graze livestock on federal lands, whether national forests or
lands of the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cows munch the trees, they destabilize the stream banks by
tromping up and down, they compact the soil with their hooves,''
said Peter Galvin, a conservation biologist for the Southwest
Center for Biological Diversity, a Tucson group that seeks to
curtail ranching on public lands through lawsuits. ``Millions and
millions of acres have been stripped bare, just like in logging and
strip mining. Only grazing has done it in a slightly more subtle
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Most opponents of livestock grazing on public lands, like the
Southwest Center, use legal means in their effort to turn the
region's ecological clock back to 1875, the year that barbed wire
began to fence the West's wide open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But a radical fringe prefers to take direct action, ranging from
snipping barbed wire, to burning down cattle auction barns, to _ in
one case in southern New Mexico _ mowing down cattle with an AK-47.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 incidents of cattle shootings have occurred in the last
three years, said Barry Clausen, private investigator in Northern
California who monitors environmental extremist activity. Talking
by phone from Tucson, where he was lecturing to ranchers, Clausen
said of Arizona: ``There have been 20 cases of fence cutting in the
last six months. Water tanks have been damaged. Windmills have been
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, David Foreman, a founder of Earth First, published a
technical manual to ``monkey-wrenching,'' which is jargon for
sabotage. The book, which has been through eight printings,
dedicates 14 pages to vandalizing ranches _ stealing salt blocks,
plugging water pipes, smashing water tanks, disabling windmills and
cutting fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some experts estimate that 100 people cutting fences on a
regular basis around the West could put the public-land ranchers
out of business,'' wrote Foreman, who is chairman of the Wildlands
Project, an environmental group in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1997, Earth First Journal published a step-by-step
guide to cutting barbed-wire fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Journal does not take a position on monkey-wrenching,''
said Theresa Kintz, an editor for the Oregon publication. ``But,
personally, I think it's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There should not be ranching on public lands _ it's like
welfare,'' she added, stressing that these were her personal
opinions. ``If people are out there using monkey-wrenching to keep
ranching off public lands, I'm all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ranchers have kept a low profile in the face of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are upset,'' said Jack Roddy, a central California
rancher who has lectured stock-grower groups about the sabotage
campaign problem. ``But I can't see a lot of them stepping forward
to organize to get this stuff stopped.'' ``A lot of people fear
retaliation,'' he said. ``I am a perfect example. I had 14 head of
cattle killed because I talked.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here in the rural areas of Natrona County, where 10,000
people are scattered over an area the size of Connecticut, people
are angry, suspicious and frightened. Ranchers, some of them
deputized by the county sheriff, have begun to stop unknown
vehicles, asking drivers what their business is, and writing down
license plate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only shocking and frustrating, it's a little
frightening,'' Gaynell Park, a rancher whose fences were cut, said
as she sat in her living room. ``These people are faceless. We
don't know what else they might do.''

PARCELLS MOTIVATES TEAM WITH `SAME OLD JETS' WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the most hated phrase any of them knew: ``Same Old
Jets.'' You remember, those three little words that fans,
announcers and headline writers paraded out at one of those
customary New York Jets moments _ failure when victory was
expected, and bizarre failure, at that.
</P>
<P>
   And who brought up that phrase last week? It was none other than
Jets coach Bill Parcells plotting for Sunday's game against the
Indianapolis Colts. For he admits he sees this game as a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was last Sunday's mistake-filled loss to the Baltimore
Ravens official than Parcells addressed the team. He told the
players to be prepared this week for the ``Same Old Jets'' mantra
from the cynics.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not happened. And more significant for the Jets, they
do not believe it. Because losing, even on the 0-2 Jets, is not
what it used to be. But the players knew exactly what Parcells was
talking about, even though only 17 of them had been on the 1996
team that hit rock bottom, winning only once.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars was not even here last year, but the 34-year-old
fullback understood. He faced the Jets twice a year with the New
England Patriots, and before that with the Miami Dolphins, after a
long career with the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the ones in the other locker room helping make
them the Same Old Jets,'' Byars said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning and losing is all about attitude. This organization
hasn't had a lot of success the last 10, 15 years. Come Halloween,
you start thinking about next year's draft.''
</P>
<P>
   So Parcells will still not allow his crew to forget the sins of
the past, including the Jets' distinction as the only National
Football League club around since the 1970 merger that has not won
a division title.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps many Jets thought they had heard the last of the Jets'
original sins last year, when Parcells helped transform them into a
9-7 team. Along the way, he scolded them for their record of
blowing second-half leads, or their failure to win on the road, or
their failure to win at home, or their failure to win late in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   And after each lecture, they usually responded. They believed
they were not the Same Old Jets. How could they be, if they won by
coming from behind, or holding a lead, or playing on the road?
</P>
<P>
   They may be in crisis, and they may have spent dozens of hours
preparing for the Colts, but Parcells found time this past week to
look at 11 tapes of special-teams players from around the league.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I might do something about that next week.'' He is
always tinkering. There has not been one business-as-usual moment.
</P>
<P>
   Next week is a bye week, presumably giving him time to augment
the team, if he wants to. While Parcells talks about the ``crisis''
of an 0-2 start, and while he says there are times he thinks that
``we'll never win another game,'' he has enough confidence in his
and the club's ability to turn it around.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in a moment of candor, he did something most professional
coaches will never admit: he allowed himself to think of games down
the road. He suggested that if the Jets defeat the Colts on Sunday,
and then the Dolphins in two weeks, the Jets would not only be at
.500, they would have a 2-0 record in their division.
``Indianapolis would have three losses in the division and the
Dolphins would have at least one,'' he said. ``We wouldn't have
any.''
</P>
<P>
   A 2-2 start would actually make the Jets healthier than at the
same time last year, when they also started at 2-2 but lost both
times to division rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Same Old Jets coaches would not have allowed themselves to
publicly suggest such things. And Same Old Jets players would never
imagine them. ``Bill's like me. I thought of different scenarios,''
said Corwin Brown, one of the coach's pets on the special teams.
``What being 0-2 means to me is that I know we can't slip up.
You'll see. We won't slip up. We don't do that anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Aaron Glenn is responsible for one of the more
egregious mistakes in recent Jets history, getting suckered by Dan
Marino in 1994 in the famous faked spike incident. Glenn relaxed,
Marino threw a touchdown over him, and the Jets fell into a vortex
until rescued by Parcells three years later. Glenn knew exactly
what Parcells meant when he brought up the Same Old Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it crossed my mind even before he said it,'' Glenn
said. ``We don't want people to think of what we did last year as a
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the locker room is an indication, if the players are
being honest, then they truly have shaken off that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   If some of them do a little research, they will discover that
getting into the playoffs following an 0-2 start is far from
impossible. Two teams in the last five years have got to the Super
Bowl after starting 0-2 _ the 1993 Cowboys and the 1996 Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 seasons, 10 teams made it to the playoffs
following an 0-2 beginning, and two of them were coached by
Parcells. His 1994 Patriots also made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to call us the Same Old Patriots in New England,''
Byars said. &QL;

MOTHER WINS RIGHT TO STOP HIV DRUGS FOR HER SON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGOR, Maine _ As 4-year-old Nikolas Emerson ran across the
grass in a public park on Friday, he spun like a top and shrieked
with glee. Watching him, his mother, Valerie Emerson, said that
Nikolas, who is infected with HIV, has never been happier or
healthier.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed his good condition to her refusal to treat him
with the drug therapy recommended by infectious-disease specialists
in Maine and Boston as the way to suppress HIV and prevent the
infection from progressing to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Emerson, who also is infected with HIV and has stopped her
own drug therapy, contends that the devastating side effects of the
drugs could kill her child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the medication on the market now will be unheard of in
five years,'' Miss Emerson said. ``Why should we be guinea pigs?''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Maine District Court judge agreed with her
reasoning and turned down a request by the state's Department of
Human Services for custody of the boy, if his mother continued her
refusal, so that he could have the treatment. The state contends
that withholding drugs is child abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The case raised questions about appropriate medical treatment
for HIV-infected youngsters and the degree to which states should
intervene in parents' decisions on medical care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Emerson's battle has drawn the attention of a group that
does not believe that HIV causes AIDS, said her lawyer, Hilary
Billings. Billings identified the organization as the Group for the
Reappraisal of the AIDS Hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   Two scientists, testifying on behalf of Miss Emerson at the
daylong trial, said that the recommended treatment of a combination
of medications administered as a drug cocktail could cause more
harm than good. A Florida man sent $3,000 to help cover her legal
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Emerson has already lost an HIV-infected child, her
daughter, Tia, who was taking the anti-HIV drug AZT, primarily by
itself. Tia died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 1996 just before her
fourth birthday. Miss Emerson said she believed that AZT made her
daughter sicker.
</P>
<P>
   In his seven-page ruling, Judge Douglas Clapp of District Court
said that AZT administered alone was no longer a top treatment in
combating HIV. AZT is now one of the medications given in
combination with other drugs in fighting HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Emerson ``feels that she has willingly and in good faith
surrendered up the life of one child to the best treatment medicine
has to offer, and does not want to do the same with the next,''
Clapp wrote, saying, ``The state of Maine is now in no position to
tell her, in the case of her unique experience, that she is wrong
in her current judgment to wait for better and more reliable
treatment methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Nikolas appears to be healthy, Kevin Concannon,
Maine's commissioner of human services, said he did not plan to
appeal the court ruling. But he said he supported his agency's
decision to take the legal action and said his department would
continue to monitor Miss Emerson's children. Miss Emerson, 27, has
two other children, neither of whom has tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If the condition begins to deteriorate, we hope the mother
would be more disposed to seek an updated, orthodox opinion,'' he
said. ``If she took no action, we would certainly review the
situation again.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Emerson said she gave AZT to Nikolas for 10 weeks in 1997,
but in that time he became fussy, whimpered in his sleep and
suffered from continuous stomach aches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two months after I stopped the AZT, he was on the road
back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state became involved in the case about a year ago, soon
after Miss Emerson's family physician referred Nikolas to Dr. John
Milliken, a Bangor pediatrician who specializes in infectious
diseases. When Miss Emerson refused the aggressive drug treatment
he recommended, Milliken referred the case to the state. He
suggested that Miss Emerson could not adequately manage her son's
medical care, according to court records. Milliken has declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The state solicited a third opinion, from Dr. Kenneth McIntosh,
a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, chief of the
Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital in Boston
and head of a trial on aggressive drug therapy for HIV-infected
children. McIntosh testified that while he recommended enrolling
Nikolas in his drug trial, he also supported the mother's decision
to withhold treatment.

SPORTS COLUMN: FRANCO, OLD WARRIOR, HAS BRUTAL NIGHT FOR METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco knows the drill for the drive back to
Staten Island, with the yowls of the pack still baying in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Punch the FM dial on the car radio. Stay away from the sports
shows on the AM dial, the Mets fans calling for his pelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to listen to it,'' he said dryly, after giving up
three runs that produced a 7-6 loss to the Florida Marlins on
Friday night, a defeat that kept the Mets a game behind the Cubs in
their race for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   What would Franco put on the radio going home?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what kind of music? These details are important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he brightened, adding, ``Maybe, `The sun comes up
tomorrow,'' referring to the signature song, ``Tomorrow,'' from the
musical ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun did indeed come up again, and Franco would report to
Shea Stadium for another game with the Marlins late yesterday
afternoon. He would follow the ritual of relief pitchers _ hours of
tedium, moments of terror.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night, Franco had pitched 830 times in the major
leagues without appearing in a post-season game.
</P>
<P>
   Franco and his manager, Bobby Valentine, share a certain lack of
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, the manager has now filled out 1,937 lineup
cards from Texas, to Norfolk, Va., to Chiba, Japan, to Shea
Stadium, without finishing first, ever. Of course, these two
grizzled legionnaires could not afford to think about that as they
go about their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' Franco said, talking about reaching the
playoffs. ``But you can't do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the last days of a baseball season _ a torture more
exquisite than any other sport because it happens daily _ one man
really does stand alone. Before the term closer was invented, Ralph
Branca strode in from the bullpen in 1951 to pitch to a man named
Bobby Thomson. Twenty-nine years later, Goose Gossage allowed a
girder-rattling, playoff-killing home run to George Brett.
</P>
<P>
   However, few relief pitchers have faced a jury of their vocal
hometown peers, eager to ream him out in the native patois, as
often as John Franco, originally from Brooklyn. He has seemed to
make the occasional gesture back to the fans, when leaving the
field after a brutal performance, but his hide is tough. He wants
to play in a post-season game, but will not consider himself some
Ernie Banks of the bullpen set. ``If I would retire tomorrow, it
would not be a thorn in my side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco remembers coming into September in good position with
Cincinnati in 1987, then coming to the Mets in 1990 and being in
first place in September before being swept by Pittsburgh. ``Last
year we were close to Florida, but every time we won, they won,''
Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco called the recent series in Houston, with its long games
and its clutch home runs and three Mets victories, ``the best
single series I've ever been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned 38 on Thursday and showed up Friday with a birthday
cigar in hand, ready for the daily ritual. ``You've got to do the
same stuff,'' he said. ``You can't try to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Some closers need the solitude of the clubhouse to prepare
themselves for the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage used to sit in his cubicle and listen to Willie Nelson
on the headset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of guys who slept for the first few innings,''
Franco said, shaking his close-cropped, energetic head. ``I've got
to be on the bench, being around the guys. Then I go to the bullpen
for a while. Around the sixth inning I go in and get my arms and
legs stretched. Then I go back to the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The chorus at Shea was not universally delighted to see Franco
emerge Friday into a pristine ninth inning, the Mets ahead by two
runs. We really do not need to dwell on the bloop, the two
bleeders, the line drive, Lenny Harris overthrowing the cutoff man,
and the sacrifice fly that delivered the third run. Franco was left
with no victories, eight losses, and eight bungled saves to go with
37 official saves, a Met record, for which he received absolutely
no slack amid the boos and screams and imprecations from the
so-called faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they think _ or if they think,'' Valentine
said of the fans who boo Franco. ``But, they pay their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Very soon after the game, a large contingent of news media
camped in front of Franco's locker. The pitcher materialized _ hey,
not all ballplayers do _ and he talked about his dreadful outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the job tonight,'' he said. ``The Cubs lost, we
lost, we could have tied them. Tonight I probably won't sleep
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Footnote: when I left the ball park around 11:30 p.m., two guys
in suits were standing near an expensive car outside the Diamond
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was the clubhouse, pretty quiet?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``About as quiet as you'd imagine,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's Franco?'' the other asked. ``What's he got to say about
this one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a professional,'' I found myself saying. ``He's got a big
heart. He'll be back tomorrow.''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A RADIO GET-TOGETHER, IN TWO LANGUAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a glorious home-run summer that owes almost as
much to Sammy Sosa's ebullient salsa as Mark McGwire's meaty
decency, Julio Pabon's eight-year campaign to ``raise the
visibility of positive Latino role models'' seems to be reaching a
peak.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Pabon's Latin Sports Ventures awarded its ninth
Latino most valuable player award to Pedro Martinez, the Cy Young
Award winner now with the Boston Red Sox. Pabon owns the Latin
Sports Clubhouse (Roberto Clemente is the reigning idol), a
sportswear and collectibles shop on East 149th Street in the South
Bronx. He is publishing a print magazine. And with Ramon Jimenez, a
lawyer and writer, he hosts what they think is the only bilingual
sports talk show in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began in 1990 when Pabon was strolling through the
lobby of a Puerto Rican resort hotel and overheard a group of men
muttering the words ``discrimination'' and ``outrage.'' He wanted a
piece of that; in those days, Pabon was a political activist who
worked for the president of the New York City Council. He was
disappointed at first. The men, local sportswriters and
broadcasters, were merely angry that Robin Yount of the Milwaukee
Brewers had been picked over Ruben Sierra of the Texas Rangers as
the American League's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time his family vacation was over, Pabon was
convinced that he had found another way to put Latinos on the happy
news network. He rashly promised on Puerto Rican talk shows to
sponsor an award for Sierra, despite the outfielder's initial
sheepishness at making a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, the Yankees refused to sanction a Stadium
ceremony; they offered the parking lot. But when the newly elected
mayor, David Dinkins, for whom Pabon had campaigned, said he would
show up at the parking lot, the Yankees opened their gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in politics,'' Pabon said, ``there's a way to make the
underdog the top dog. Sammy may be the one to crack this thing.
He's bubbly, I think he loosened McGwire up. And he put it all in
perspective when he said that this is no pressure compared to
working two factory jobs in the Dominican Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics consider themselves to be the most fanatic sports
fans in the country, particularly during beisbol season. The
growing importance of the Latino player in the major leagues (they
represent about one-third of the player population) is a source of
great pride. Pabon's other Latino most valuable player winners _
Bobby Bonilla, Julio Franco, Carlos Baerga, Moises Alou, Edgar
Martinez, and, twice, Juan Gonzalez _ could be the core of a
franchise. Such Yankees as Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez and
Mariano Rivera have kept Yankee Stadium, according to Jimenez,
``the St. Patrick's Cathedral of sports,'' despite George
Steinbrenner's attacks on its South Bronx neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Hispanics have also complained that Latin ballplayers,
particularly darker-skinned ones (activists call this ``shadism'')
have rarely received as much journalistic and commercial attention
as comparable Anglo players.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, perhaps the most complete outfielder of his time,
certainly the greatest humanitarian in the game, was almost
willfully misinterpreted as a sullen prima donna; a case could be
made that a comparable white player would be lauded for his
``intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Race and language are clearly factors, but Pabon, now a
businessman, is less interested in root causes (``I don't want to
politicize this'') than in pushing product; there are some 20,000
trading cards with pictures of Latino ballplayers in his South
Bronx store. He says he bought the cards, in Puerto Rico, for only
$380 and has already sold one Rey Ordonez for $100 and an Alex
Rodriquez for $55. But he sees the stacks of cards as still
tantalizingly out of reach of what he estimates as a $300 billion
American Latino market.
</P>
<P>
   Can Sosa bring them together?
</P>
<P>
   That theme ran through a night two weeks ago that began in New
Rochelle, at the studios of WVOX (1460 AM), a pot-luck, mostly
music, community radio station, where Pabon, 46, and Jimenez, 50,
yammered in sportspeak about Sosa, the Yankees and the Mets. The
weekly show, Tuesday nights from 7 to 8, is called ``La Hora
Deportiva'' _ ``The Sports Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Pabon, who mostly speaks Spanish on the show, is a measured Mets
fan who says it is possible to love both New York teams. A frothing
Yankee fan, Jimenez, a Harvard Law graduate who was once a housing
court judge, plays the provocateur, shouting in English that ``you
can't love both God and the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners have also gone into the stands at the Stadium to
recruit listeners and to interview them, and have addressed
mainstream issues from a Latin perspective. According to Pabon, two
years ago when they asked Roberto Alomar why he didn't act ``more
manly'' in his confrontation at home plate with John Hirschbeck, he
told them he would have hit the umpire instead of spitting on him
if his arms hadn't been held at the time.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 62nd home run had a salsa flavor, too. We watched it
on the big screen at Giovanni's on the Grand Concourse around the
corner from the Latin Sports Clubhouse. When Sosa ran in from right
field to hug his rival, Pabon shouted: ``Can you believe this? When
have you ever seen this before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a cliche,'' said Jimenez, almost apologetically,
``but sports does bring people together.''

TALIBAN RELEASES FIVE IRANIAN PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ In a gesture of good will, the Taliban movement
of Afghanistan released five Iranian prisoners on Saturday, but
Iranian news accounts said the move would not be enough to ease
tensions that have raised the prospect of a military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A Taliban spokesman said the prisoners had been freed ``as a
sign of our willingness to improve relations'' with Tehran. But in
Iran, where tens of thousands of people turned out at nationwide
protests on Friday to threaten holy war against the Taliban, the
move was portrayed as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban, the militant Islamic
movement that controls most of Afghanistan, have been growing since
the Taliban acknowledged that their forces killed at least eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month in the northern
Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif. In response, Iran has built up its
military forces along the Afghan border to what Iran says is more
than 250,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Iranian prisoners was among the steps that Iran
has demanded from the Taliban as a condition for averting military
action. But Iranian officials said Saturday night that many more
Iranians remained in Taliban custody, and they expressed anger at
suggestions by the Taliban spokesman, Abdul Hai Mutmean, that it
was time for Iran to make some gesture in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, is scheduled to address
the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Monday. Iranian officials
have said he may suggest that Iran could see no option but to
resort to military force against the Taliban unless other countries
agreed to join in forcing a halt to what Iran and various human
rights organizations have portrayed as a Taliban campaign of
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazzi,
was quoted by Iranian television as having told his Pakistani
counterpart, Sartaj Aziz, that ``there is significant pressure on
the Iranian authorities to resort to military means to avenge the
crime'' of the diplomats' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, one of the few countries to recognize the Taliban as
Afghanistan's legitimate government, served as an intermediary in
arranging the release of the Iranian prisoners who were freed
Saturday. According to Taliban officials, all had been caught
driving trucks loaded with Iranian military goods when the Taliban
captured Mazar-i-Sharif, which had been the headquarters of an
Iranian-backed anti-Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   The five were flown from an undisclosed location in Afghanistan
to a air base outside the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, where they
were met by Iranian Embassy officials. They made no statement,
Reuters reported from Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban officials have acknowledged that they still hold at
least 45 Iranian prisoners. But before any more Iranians are
released, they have said, Iranian-backed rebels ought to free
Taliban prisoners, and Iran should halt what they have alleged is
mistreatment of some among an estimated 2 million Afghan refugees
who have taken shelter in Iran during 20 years of civil war in
their country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iran has so far brushed aside the Taliban demands, saying it has
no control over any Taliban rebels and denying that it has
mistreated refugees. It has insisted that the Taliban release their
remaining Iranian prisoners and surrender the diplomats' killers,
whose slaying has been condemned by the United Nations, the United
States and governments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the bodies of six of the slain Iranians were carried
through the streets of Tehran as part of the demonstrations. With
shouts of ``Death to the Taliban!'' emotions ran so high on the
street that most Iranians interviewed at random said the Taliban's
conduct merited some kind of Iranian military response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything for Islam, and what the Taliban is doing is
against Islam,'' said Shireen Saidpur, a 35-year-old government
employee. ``They are criminals.''

6 GET LASKER AWARDS FOR CANCER-RELATED WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill., Wash., Calif., Texas, Canada, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six scientists who made discoveries dating to 1960
that identified the genetic basis of cancer and improved the
diagnosis and treatment of certain types of the disease will
receive this year's Albert Lasker awards.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients' findings and subsequent research have
established that alterations in genes are the initial step in
producing human cancer, and these discoveries are helping to shape
the design of future cancer therapies, the Albert and Mary Lasker
Foundation said in announcing the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical research awards are going to three scientists: Dr.
Alfred Knudson Jr., a former president of the Fox Chase Cancer
Center in Philadelphia; Dr. Peter Nowell, a professor of pathology
at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and Dr. Janet
Rowley of the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The three scientists receiving basic medical research awards are
Dr. Lee Hartwell, president of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center and a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle;
Dr. Yoshio Masui of the University of Toronto, and Dr. Paul Nurse
of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh scientist, Dr. Daniel Koshland Jr. of the University
of California at Berkeley, will receive a special achievement
award.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be made at a luncheon in New York City on
Friday. They are often called America's Nobels because 59 Lasker
recipients have gone on to receive Nobel Prizes in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The clinical researchers to be honored came up with the first
evidence that cancers develop from mutations in particular genes
and rearrangements in chromosomes, the bundles of hereditary
material.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, few scientists believed that cancer had a genetic
basis. But in that year, Nowell, working with the late Dr. David
Hungerford, shattered that widespread belief by showing such a link
to a form of leukemia. Nowell's team discovered that individuals
with chronic myelogenous leukemia had an abnormally small
chromosome in all their cancerous white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Goldstein of the University of Texas Southwestern in
Dallas, a Nobel Prize winner who headed the selection jury for the
Lasker awards, said, ``The discovery provided the first clear
evidence that a specific genetic defect in a single chromosome can
give a malignant cell and its clonal descendants an advantage in
growth over other cells.'' The defective gene occurred in the 22nd
chromosome and it became known as the Philadelphia chromosome after
the city where Nowell worked.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Rowley used a new chemical staining technique
developed in Sweden to discover that the Philadelphia chromosome's
small size resulted from exchanges of pieces of genetic material. A
crucial piece of chromosome 22 broke off and moved to chromosome 9,
while a piece of chromosome 9 jumped to the breakpoint on the 22nd
chromosome. The finding provided clear evidence that leukemia could
result after a segment of a chromosome detached from the nearby
genes that controlled its behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley went on to identify 10 of the 70 such translocations that
are now known to cause cancers by producing a cancer-promoting gene
_ an oncogene _ or by inactivating a tumor-suppressing gene, which
suppresses cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Knudson published a theory based on complex mathematics
to explain why an eye cancer in children known as retinoblastoma
occurred in both hereditary and sporadic forms.
</P>
<P>
   Knudson theorized that two mutations that arose differently were
needed to produce the hereditary and sporadic forms of
retinoblastoma. In the inherited form, one mutation was present in
every body cell. The cancer developed only when eye cells underwent
a second mutation, or a second hit, that was triggered by exposures
to environmental toxins, dietary factors, radiation or at random in
the normal process of cell division. Children who did not inherit
the mutation had to suffer two such hits in the eye cells to
develop retinoblastoma.
</P>
<P>
   Later research has shown that a segment of chromosome 13 is
missing in some individuals with the eye cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Knudson's work paved the way for understanding a whole new
class of cancer-causing genes called tumor suppressors, such as the
two breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, and another that causes
colon cancer,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The basic science awards honor research beginning in the late
1960s that led to the discovery of the universal machinery that
tells cells when to start and stop growing. The machinery controls
the division of cells containing nuclei in such different forms of
life as yeast, frogs and humans. Cancer results from uncontrolled
growth of cells.
</P>
<P>
   From yeast needed to brew beer and bake bread, Hartwell and
Nurse identified genes that are crucial to controlling the
intricate program of instructions that determines how a cell grows,
rests and divides to replicate itself.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell discovered a gene needed to complete the several steps
of cell division. Nurse identified the first protein in humans that
plays a role analogous to that of proteins found in yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Masui discovered a protein known as MPF, for maturation
promoting factor, that controls cell division in fertilized frog
eggs. Scientists later found that MPF contained a protein similar
to those that Hartwell and Nurse discovered in yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Koshland, a former editor of the journal Science, is being
honored for his work on insights into the functioning of enzymes
and proteins, including the ways cells receive and respond to
external cues. Koshland also showed that bacteria have a
rudimentary memory that affects their response to their outside
world.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Giants weighed running back
Tyrone Wheatley before Saturday's practice and he was more than a
pound below the 235 pounds he played at last season, a goal that
coach Jim Fassel had set for Wheatley last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said Saturday that he expected Wheatley, who was held out
of last week's game because of his weight, to play Monday against
the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go into a Wheatley watch,'' Fassel said.
``But he's right on target for what I want him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants only weigh players on a weekly basis two days before
a game. Team officials would not be specific about Wheatley's
weight. Wheatley has run on a treadmill after practice throughout
the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Tyrone Monday I want you do this,'' Fassel said
Saturday. ``He said: `I can't do that.' I said: `You're going to
have to do that.' His lesson in life is don't say you can't.''

3 NL PLAYOFF TEAMS ARE PACKED AND READY TO GO, BUT TO WHERE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three National League teams have made their reservations for the
playoffs; they just don't know where those reservations are for and
might not know until next weekend, the final one of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to go to the last day,'' said Bobby Cox, manager of
the Atlanta Braves, winner of seven successive division
championships. ``I believe that. We could play one of three teams.
We don't know if we're going to open at home or on the road. It
complicates things a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two factors prevent the Braves, the Houston Astros and the San
Diego Padres from knowing where and whom they will play next week:
the identity of the wild-card team and the identity of the team
among the three of them that will have the best won-lost record
come next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first season that record counts for the playoffs. In
previous seasons, the sites of the series were pre-determined by
division on a rotating basis. In the first round, one team would
have the first two games of the three-of-five game series at home,
and the other would have the next three. The sites of the
four-of-seven league championship series would also be set by
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The only definite was the wild-card team, once the wild cards
became part of the playoffs in 1995, could not have the home-field
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But people inside and out of baseball complained that teams were
not being rewarded for their regular-season records. The Braves
last year won 17 more games than the Astros, but the Astros had
what was considered home-field advantage, though some people
questioned the value of that advantage, too.
</P>
<P>
   This season the division champion with the best won-lost record
gets home-field advantage in the form of the first two games of the
first series and the fifth, if necessary, at home. That goal has
kept the Braves, the Astros and the Padres playing hard beyond the
day they clinched their division championships. It has also kept
the post-season schedule completely up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker, for one, acknowledged that he has adopted a
different strategy from the one he would have used in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to kind of walk a fine line between trying to get
guys rested and trying to keep winning,'' the Houston manager said.
But he quickly added that he had no complaints about the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' he said about the quest for the best record. ``I
think it's the best thing there could be. I'd rather not be where
winning or losing doesn't matter. Guys might want to rest, and we
might lose our edge and the momentum that we've had in getting
where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in format has created yet another new race. First,
there is the race for first place in the three divisions in each
league. Then there is the race for the wild-card spots. Then there
is the race for the best record and home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win games,'' said Padres manager Bruce Bochy.
``It's added incentive. We do think it means something. We have
been caught a little bit between the health of the ball club and
winning games. It's a fine line. You don't want to drive guys into
the ground to win games; I think the priority is to be healthy when
you get to the playoffs. But if guys are healthy they're going to
be out there. We want to win as many games as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   This new race has undergone changes in the past few weeks. The
Braves entered September with the best record among the three
teams, leading the Padres by one game and the Astros by three. The
Padres caught the Braves Sept. 5 but dropped back again the next
day. In the few days after that, the Astros leapfrogged past the
Braves and the Padres and held ``first place'' for five days as the
Braves slumped slightly, losing six of seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Braves recharged themselves, clinched
first place in the East Division and snatched first back from the
Astros, who lost three of four to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, the Braves led the Astros by one game
and the slumping Padres (with five losses in six games) by four
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 priority is getting the team ready for the
playoffs,'' Cox said, ``but we always try to win. We have two off
days this coming week so it's not like we have to sit down guys to
give them a breather.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he, too, would take advantage of off days this
week. ``I'm going to play the main lineup and try to win,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the first series in the Astrodome would be a huge
advantage for the Astros because, as Dierker said, Randy Johnson
has been almost unhittable there. The dominating left-hander would
pitch the first game and the fifth, if that game becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cox pointed out, none of the three teams would take
extraordinary measures to gain home-field advantage. ``I don't
think Houston is going to pitch Randy Johnson the last day of the
season to win that thing,'' the Braves' manager said.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres seem to have little chance to catch the Braves in
this new race. Should two teams tie with the best record, they
would not play a playoff game for home-field advantage in the
playoffs. Records in the season series between the teams would
determine the ``winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres would lose a tie with either of the other teams
because the Braves and the Astros each have a 5-4 record against
them. The Astros beat the Braves, 5-4.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Wild-Card Twist
</P>
<P>
   The division champion with the best record will play the
wild-card team unless they are members of the same division. That
part of the playoff format will add intrigue to the final series of
the season for two of the division winners.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the wild card would presumably be easier than playing
one of the division champions. In addition, the team that plays the
wild card gets an extra day of rest because that series starts
Sept. 30 instead of Sept. 29, when the other series starts. Next
weekend the Braves play the Mets in Atlanta and the Astros play the
Cubs in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Houston manager Larry Dierker said he would rather the Cubs did
not win the wild-card slot but he added, ``I'd rather play at home
and I wouldn't care who we played than to open on the road. The big
incentive to me is get the home field.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, beating the Cubs next weekend would serve a dual
purpose, as would the Braves' beating the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes any difference,'' Bobby Cox of Atlanta
said when asked for his preference. ``You've got to play good to
get through it. The talk is nobody wants to face Johnson, but you
have to face him eventually.''

THE ANTI-SLUGGER RACE  
 YANKEES' NOT-SO-HEADY DAYS

<P>
   The Anti-Slugger Race &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this season that has featured the greatest home run race of
all time and will end with perhaps five players hitting 50 or more
home runs, Rey Ordonez of the New York Mets hit his first home run
last Tuesday in his 466th time at bat. Ordonez had easily led the
no-homer race, but his home run against Shane Reynolds left Walt
Weiss of Atlanta as the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, entering yesterday's games, had not hit a home run in 336
at-bats. Lance Johnson of the Chicago Cubs was second with 269
at-bats without a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees' Not-So-Heady Days
</P>
<P>
   Where oh where have those heady days gone, the ones where the
New York Yankees' record was compared with the daily records of the
greatest teams in history and found to be as good, if not better?
</P>
<P>
   Where are those days when it was a given that when the season
ended, the Yankees would have the most victories in a major league
season?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days, we thought they'd never end. But they have.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a month ago that the Yankees were ``on a pace'' to
win 122 games, six more than anyone has ever won. But that was
before they lost 16 of 28 games and a chance to break the major
league record. Now they may not even become the ninth team in
history to finish with a .700 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, must the Yankees do to make this a successful season
and not, based on earlier promise, a disappointing one?
</P>
<P>
   1. (a) Tie or (b) break the team record for victories (110)?
</P>
<P>
   2. (a) Tie or (b) break the American League record (111)?
</P>
<P>
   3. Tie the major league record (116)?
</P>
<P>
   4. Win the first round of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   5. Win the American League pennant?
</P>
<P>
   6. Win the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   If one positive development has emerged from the Yankees' first
serious skid of the season, it is that the difference between
having the most victories ever and the highest winning percentage
ever will not have to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees long threatened to eclipse the 116 victories the
1906 Chicago Cubs amassed, but the Cubs that season played only 152
games and had a .763 percentage.
</P>
<P>
   To exceed that percentage, the Yankees would have needed 124
victories, a total that seemed beyond the reach of even the
immortal team the Yankees were touted to be not long ago.

TEXANS CALL TERROR SUSPECT APOLITICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ By the accounts of those who worked for him
at a ramshackle Fort Worth tire shop and lived near him in a
rundown apartment block on a dead-end street in Arlington, about a
mile from the stately mosque where he prayed every Friday, Wadih el
Hage was even-tempered, devout and utterly apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when I heard that he was arrested for being part
of these terrorists,'' said Mahmoud Mazouni, who worked for el Hage
at Lone Star Wheels &AMP; Tires and now is trying to run the place
until his boss' return. ``He never said anything political. Never.
You know, he had a wife and seven children, and he was worrying for
them all the time. That is what he talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, 38, was arrested in New York on Wednesday night by
federal officials who said he was a close associate of Osama bin
Laden, once serving as the wealthy Saudi financier's private
secretary, and of many other members of Al Quaeda, the alleged
terrorist organization run by bin Laden that federal officials say
is responsible for the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa last
month.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage is the first U.S. citizen to be charged with being part
of bin Laden's terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe that it's true,'' said Mary Silburn, the
manager of the Campus South Apartments in Arlington, where el Hage
lived with his wife, April Ray, and their four sons and three
daughters, ages 12 years to 3 months. ``They were very nice,
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage's three-bedroom apartment, for which he paid $510 a
month, is halfway down a dark, first-floor corridor in a
whitewashed, two-story building surrounded by old, rusted cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going on,'' his wife said Thursday
night, shortly after she had been informed of her husband's arrest.
``I'm pretty much shell-shocked. I just barely heard what's going
on, and I'm having a hard time dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silburn said the apartment complex was overrun with
reporters and television crews Friday, though el Hage's family
declined to talk to anyone. Saturday, no one was answering the door
at the apartment, and Ms. Silburn asked reporters to leave the
family alone and get off the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a proper Muslim wife, so she does not want to say
anything, you understand,'' Mazouni said. ``Her feeling is, if you
have a question for my husband, you must ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage is being held without bail in New York, charged with two
counts of lying to federal officials in their investigations of bin
Laden's organization. Officials said more charges against el Hage
were likely to be filed in the coming week. Thus far, he has not
been charged with any complicity in the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, which left 258 people dead,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials described el Hage as a Lebanese Christian who
had converted to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said el Hage, who had lived in the Forth Worth
area in the 1980s, was with bin Laden in the Sudan in 1994, acting
as his private secretary. That year, el Hage moved to Kenya, where
he established a gem business and was in contact with other
associates of bin Laden. One of them, Haroun Fazil, who shared a
house with el Hage in Nairobi, played a role in the Aug. 7
bombings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal have offered a $2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of Fazil.
</P>
<P>
   el Hage returned to the United States in 1997 where he has
lived, it is believed, in modest apartments in the same
neighborhood near the University of Texas Arlington campus.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial affidavit that el Hage completed at the time of
his arrest, he said that his wife was unemployed, that his earnings
at the tire store were $1,600 a month and that the only items of
value that he owned were a 1981 Honda Prelude and a 1984 Chevy
Caprice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has one big car for the children and one little car for
himself,'' Mazouni said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County officials said on Friday that in 1986, when he
was living in a working-class neighborhood on the north side of
Fort Worth, el Hage was charged with writing $2,400 worth of
worthless checks to 22 businesses in a little more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Before a hearing, el Hage disappeared, but resurfaced in 1992
and posted a $500 bond before disappearing again, officials said.
In 1993, the case was closed and the file stamped ``the defendant
has never been apprehended,'' the Fort Worth Star-Telegram
reported.
</P>
<P>
   How el Hage found his way into bin Laden's employ is unclear,
but he was known to anti-terrorist officials by the time he was
living in Nairobi in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage was questioned by federal agents in October 1997, after
his return to Texas, and again Aug. 20, two weeks after the embassy
bombings. He is charged with lying to the authorities during those
interrogations about his knowledge of some of the principals in the
Quaeda organization and faces five years in prison on each of the
two counts.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage had managed his business in partnership with Braham
Kheidar, the owner of another tire shop, A-Quality Tires and
Wheels, in nearby Arlington, Mazouni said. A worker at the
Arlington shop said Saturday that Kheidar was out of town and could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Mazouni looked around the dark, musty tire ship on a
commercial stretch of Fort Worth's industrial east side and said he
did not know how long he would have to run the place by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here with my television on when the news of the bombings
came on the air,'' Mazouni said. ``When el Hage came into the shop,
I asked him if he had heard about it, and he said yes, but he
showed no emotion and said no more about it. He didn't act like a
man who had been involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage's business cards were still lying on a rack on the tire
shop's counter, each one stamped ``$2 off next visit,'' just a few
yards from the spot where he knelt and prayed five times each day.
</P>
<P>
   He had left the shop on Monday afternoon and told Mazounithat he
was flying to New York for business but would return in two or
three days. Mazouni did not know that his employer of six months
was responding to a federal subpoena, and did not know of his
arrest until informed by reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always very quiet, very calm,'' Mazouni said. ``Who
knows what is going on? Only God knows, as we say in Islam. Not the
FBI, not the journalists. Only God.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a glorious home-run summer that owes almost as
much to Sammy Sosa's ebullient salsa as Mark McGwire's meaty
decency, Julio Pabon's eight-year campaign to ``raise the
visibility of positive Latino role models'' seems to be reaching a
peak.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Pabon's Latin Sports Ventures awarded its ninth
Latino most valuable player award to Pedro Martinez, the Cy Young
Award winner now with the Boston Red Sox. Pabon owns the Latin
Sports Clubhouse (Roberto Clemente is the reigning idol), a
sportswear and collectibles shop on East 149th Street in the South
Bronx. He is publishing a print magazine. And with Ramon Jimenez, a
lawyer and writer, he hosts what they think is the only bilingual
sports talk show in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began in 1990 when Pabon was strolling through the
lobby of a Puerto Rican resort hotel and overheard a group of men
muttering the words ``discrimination'' and ``outrage.'' He wanted a
piece of that; in those days, Pabon was a political activist who
worked for the president of the New York City Council. He was
disappointed at first. The men, local sportswriters and
broadcasters, were merely angry that Robin Yount of the Milwaukee
Brewers had been picked over Ruben Sierra of the Texas Rangers as
the American League's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time his family vacation was over, Pabon was
convinced that he had found another way to put Latinos on the happy
news network. He rashly promised on Puerto Rican talk shows to
sponsor an award for Sierra, despite the outfielder's initial
sheepishness at making a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, the Yankees refused to sanction a Stadium
ceremony; they offered the parking lot. But when the newly elected
mayor, David Dinkins, for whom Pabon had campaigned, said he would
show up at the parking lot, the Yankees opened their gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in politics,'' Pabon said, ``there's a way to make the
underdog the top dog. Sammy may be the one to crack this thing.
He's bubbly, I think he loosened McGwire up. And he put it all in
perspective when he said that this is no pressure compared to
working two factory jobs in the Dominican Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics consider themselves to be the most fanatic sports
fans in the country, particularly during beisbol season. The
growing importance of the Latino player in the major leagues (they
represent about one-third of the player population) is a source of
great pride. Pabon's other Latino most valuable player winners _
Bobby Bonilla, Julio Franco, Carlos Baerga, Moises Alou, Edgar
Martinez, and, twice, Juan Gonzalez _ could be the core of a
franchise. Such Yankees as Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez and
Mariano Rivera have kept Yankee Stadium, according to Jimenez,
``the St. Patrick's Cathedral of sports,'' despite George
Steinbrenner's attacks on its South Bronx neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Hispanics have also complained that Latin ballplayers,
particularly darker-skinned ones (activists call this ``shadism'')
have rarely received as much journalistic and commercial attention
as comparable Anglo players.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, perhaps the most complete outfielder of his time,
certainly the greatest humanitarian in the game, was almost
willfully misinterpreted as a sullen prima donna; a case could be
made that a comparable white player would be lauded for his
``intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Race and language are clearly factors, but Pabon, now a
businessman, is less interested in root causes (``I don't want to
politicize this'') than in pushing product; there are some 20,000
trading cards with pictures of Latino ballplayers in his South
Bronx store. He says he bought the cards, in Puerto Rico, for only
$380 and has already sold one Rey Ordonez for $100 and an Alex
Rodriquez for $55. But he sees the stacks of cards as still
tantalizingly out of reach of what he estimates as a $300 billion
American Latino market.
</P>
<P>
   Can Sosa bring them together?
</P>
<P>
   That theme ran through a night two weeks ago that began in New
Rochelle, at the studios of WVOX (1460 AM), a pot-luck, mostly
music, community radio station, where Pabon, 46, and Jimenez, 50,
yammered in sportspeak about Sosa, the Yankees and the Mets. The
weekly show, Tuesday nights from 7 to 8, is called ``La Hora
Deportiva'' _ ``The Sports Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Pabon, who mostly speaks Spanish on the show, is a measured Mets
fan who says it is possible to love both New York teams. A frothing
Yankee fan, Jimenez, a Harvard Law graduate who was once a housing
court judge, plays the provocateur, shouting in English that ``you
can't love both God and the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners have also gone into the stands at the Stadium to
recruit listeners and to interview them, and have addressed
mainstream issues from a Latin perspective. According to Pabon, two
years ago when they asked Roberto Alomar why he didn't act ``more
manly'' in his confrontation at home plate with John Hirschbeck, he
told them he would have hit the umpire instead of spitting on him
if his arms hadn't been held at the time.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 62nd home run had a salsa flavor, too. We watched it
on the big screen at Giovanni's on the Grand Concourse around the
corner from the Latin Sports Clubhouse. When Sosa ran in from right
field to hug his rival, Pabon shouted: ``Can you believe this? When
have you ever seen this before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a cliche,'' said Jimenez, almost apologetically,
``but sports does bring people together.''

SWISS HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH SOUND OF DIESELS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALTDORF, Switzerland _ At 4:45 a.m. sharp, the Alpine stillness
is broken by the roar of dozens of trucks. Having parked outside
the St. Gotthard Tunnel to observe the Swiss ban on overnight truck
traffic, the drivers now start their engines, and the noise echoes
down the narrow Reuss Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes a stream of trucks descends from the Alps. Since
the tunnel was opened in 1980, the number of trucks has risen from
80 a day to more than 4,000. ``It used to be just cowbells,'' said
Brigitte Camenzind, a homemaker who lives nearby. ``Now it is
absolutely impossible to open the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the tunnel was opened, cars and trucks had to use the St.
Gotthard Pass, which was closed in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up from the Camenzind house, one sees a gorgeous expanse
of snow-capped mountains. Looking down, one sees the valley sliced
by a rail line and a four-lane highway, a major European truck
route.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's location means that much of Europe's north-south
traffic must cross this mountainous terrain. But the Swiss have
been at loggerheads with neighbors about how best to accommodate
the traffic without spoiling the scenic valleys.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the pollution and noise of heavy trucks, the Swiss
have adopted various measures aimed at forcing freight traffic onto
trains. In 1994 the Swiss approved a ``polluters pay'' tax on heavy
trucks that was expected to raise about $1 billion a year to help
remedy trucking's effects and improve rail networks.
</P>
<P>
   The tax is the centerpiece of a plan to balance the transport
needs of the 15-member European Union with the environmental
concerns of the Swiss, and Swiss voters face a referendum on Sept.
27 to finally approve the tax, four years after they voted to adopt
it in principle.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of the truck problem are fully apparent in Uri
canton. A few miles south of Altdorf, its capital, the St. Gotthard
Tunnel spews traffic into one of Switzerland's narrowest valleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning, when the traffic starts, the bedroom shakes,''
said Lori Epp-Zgreggen.
</P>
<P>
   At first locals did not oppose the highway, she recalled. Now
her husband, Urban, a retired postal worker, finds the noise so
intrusive that he rarely goes outside. They bought their
centuries-old farmhouse decades ago, knowing the freeway was
coming. ``But then the noise doubled, then tripled, and went on,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In this mountain valley, prone to rock falls and avalanches, the
thundering noise from the motorway has been known to shake loose
rocks that could set off bigger landslides. Mountain forests and
the tingling air have suffered too, locals insist.
</P>
<P>
   Dire predictions in the 1980s that Alpine forests would vanish
have not come true, but the tops of trees have fewer needles, said
a forest ranger for the canton, Toni Zberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, you can smell the air and get the feeling
something is wrong here,'' observed Martin Furrer, a local farmer.
``I don't mind the noise but I am really worried about pollution of
the soil and the air.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No one has documented pollution's potential effects on Uri's
36,000 inhabitants. But Dr. Toni Moser, a local physician, said,
``It is well known that truck diesel fuel has particles that are
not good for health.''
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide study in 1996 calculated that each year truck
pollution causes acute bronchitis in 10,000 children and 7,000
adults and sharply increases suffering for asthmatics. Moser said
his patients, particularly children, suffer from bouts of eye, ear
and throat irritation, especially in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic trucking interests oppose the tax, arguing that it will
cause widespread job losses and add $350 a year in haulage charges
to each Swiss household's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Crippa, chief executive officer of the Swiss Road
Transport Association, also insists the tax will not achieve its
goal. Transit trucks, he argued, are only a small portion of
overall truck traffic and will not generate enough money for the
two new Alpine rail tunnels that are scheduled to be built by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland is in a bind. If it wants to join in European
economic activity, it must align key policies with the European
Union. It is currently the only European country, for example, that
bars trucks over 28 tons.
</P>
<P>
   When neighboring Austria _ a European Union member since 1995 _
eased its truck restrictions, it experienced a 30 percent increase
in truck traffic, mostly through the Brenner Pass to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland is trying to strike an accord with the European
Union that would gradually raise the allowable truck weight to 40
tons, with big trucks paying a $225 fee for each trip through
Switzerland. Germany, for one, feels that is too high.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss government ministers warn that an accord permitting larger
trucks _ which would benefit Swiss farmers by increasing access to
the European Union market _ is doomed without the tax.

   MILWAUKEE _ It's always better when there are two, especially
when each needs to do more because of the other. It was this way
with Ali and Frazier, with Palmer and Nicklaus, with Russell and
Chamberlain, with Evert and Navratilova, with Affirmed and Alydar.
And now it's this way with Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing, nobody's ever done,'' McGwire was saying
after hitting his 64th homer here Friday night. ``Wherever the
number lands, that's where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The number, of course, is the eventual record total of home runs
that one or the other will hit.
</P>
<P>
   The sentimental scenario would be for them to finish with the
same number, to share the record. But whenever Sosa has approached
McGwire's latest number, the Cardinals' slugger has jumped ahead
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over it,'' McGwire said when asked about why
he has responded so often to Sosa's challenge. ``I just try to get
a pitch to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   On this next-to-last weekend of the National League season, they
are swinging for homers some 90 miles apart along Interstate 94,
which moves up the Lake Michigan shore from Illinois into Wisconsin
_ McGwire here at County Stadium against the Milwaukee Brewers,
Sosa at Wrigley Field against the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Mark hits one tonight,'' Sosa had said Friday after
going 0 for 4 in a Cubs' afternoon loss. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, McGwire did just that. When the great
home-run hitters are up, any stadium is always silent in
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   When they really connect in that silence, the sound is that of a
thunderclap. And on Friday night, McGwire really connected with the
left-hander Rafael Roque's fastball, smashing it into the
left-center-field bleachers, an estimated 417 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability to concentrate and take his swing is his biggest
strength,'' said Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager. ``He can
shut everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McGwire isn't thinking about Sosa's challenge, but he
often has responded, and quickly. Only once has Sosa been ahead of
him. Back on Aug. 19 in Chicago, the Cubs' right fielder hit his
48th homer in the fifth inning, but in the eighth inning McGwire
hit his 48th and in the 10th inning he jumped ahead again with his
49th.
</P>
<P>
   Going into September, each had 55, but McGwire quickly hit his
56th and 57th in Florida. The next afternoon, Sosa hit his 56th in
Cincinnati, and that night McGwire hit his 58th and 59th in
Florida. When Sosa hit his 57th and then his 58th, McGwire hit his
60th, and then his memorable 61st and 62nd in St. Louis as Sosa
watched. But on a five-game road trip to Cincinnati and Houston,
McGwire did not hit any homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically didn't know where I was for a couple days,'' he
recalled, referring to what might have been a mental letdown in
Cincinnati after the 62nd homer that broke Roger Maris' record.
``And in Houston they pitched me very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Sosa hit four in three games last weekend in Chicago
to tie McGwire at 62, the Cardinals' first baseman whacked his
63rd. And after Sosa tied him again with his 63rd on Wednesday,
McGwire hit his 64th.
</P>
<P>
   Even though McGwire insisted he has ``no control'' over
responding to Sosa's latest total, he hinted that he does have
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about being focused,'' he said Friday night, about
hitting homers in general. ``Because your mind controls everything
you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever McGwire has known he needs another homer to stay ahead
o Sosa, he somehow has been able to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, of course, could get the last shot in this day-to-day duel
if the Cubs and Mets tie for the National League wild-card berth.
Their one-game playoff would be Sept. 28 at Shea Stadium. Any
homers Sosa were to hit in that game would count in his
regular-season total.
</P>
<P>
   But barring a wild-card playoff, that eventual number of homers
_ the hope here is that they tie at 67 _ will be determined this
week with McGwire and the Cardinals at home against Houston and
Montreal, while Sosa and the Cubs finish on the road in Milwaukee
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything happens from here on, it is a gift for me,'' Sosa
was saying after Friday's game. ``I just want to go out there and
hit and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' last regular-season game Sunday at Wrigley Field will
be ``Sammy Sosa Day.'' Among the dignitaries will be Commissioner
Bud Selig and Leonard Coleman, the National League president,
neither of whom was there a week ago when Sosa hit his 61st and
62nd homers.
</P>
<P>
   Told that opinion polls showed that baseball fans thought he had
been slighted, Sosa had the perfect answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of myself,'' he said with a serious smile, ``because
I know that people care about me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an instinctively nice man who spent Friday night in his
sprawling 55th-floor condominium with his mother and other family
visitors from the Dominican Republic as they celebrated the first
birthday of Michael, the youngest of the four children that he and
his wife, Sonia, have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most beautiful thing that God gave me,'' Sosa said, ``is
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday is Sosa's last chance to hit any more homers this
season at Wrigley Field, where he is considered a civic treasure
and is expected to hit homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was that easy,'' Sosa said, laughing, ``I'd have 100 by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Mark McGwire. On second thought, he would probably have
101.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Sept. 20:
</P>
<P>
   A potentially deadly season of cold and starvation is rapidly
closing in on Kosovo's Albanian refugees. The Clinton
administration must marshal U.S. diplomatic and military resources
to persuade Yugoslavia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to stop
terrorizing Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population. Washington must
also help protect and assist those already displaced until they can
return to their original homes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has denied political and civil rights to Kosovo's
Albanian majority and turned the once-autonomous region into a
minority-ruled Serbian province. His repression has spawned an
armed guerrilla movement seeking full independence for Kosovo.
Serbian security forces, in the name of fighting the rebels, have
been carrying out the same kind of ``ethnic cleansing'' of
civilians that Milosevic's allies practiced in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians have been driven from their
homes. Tens of thousands remain trapped in open country, many with
only sheets of plastic to protect against the snows already falling
at higher elevations. International relief agencies are trying to
help. But they cannot do so until Milosevic calls off his thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader hints he might be willing to restrain his
forces and explore political solutions. But in Kosovo today as in
Bosnia a few years back, he seems to respect diplomatic appeals
only when they are buttressed by threats of force.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must therefore begin reinforcing its diplomacy with
preparations for possible military action to protect refugees. The
United States has no interest in encouraging Kosovo's independence
or in going to war with Serbia. But military action may be needed
for the limited objective of helping the refugees. President
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright should use their
visit this week to the United Nations to mobilize European leaders.
Britain has hardened its line against Serbian atrocities. Germany
is anxious to prevent a huge new influx of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright should then go to Belgrade and tell Milosevic he
has until mid-October to restrain his forces or face air strikes on
military targets in Serbia. Diplomacy is the preferred method for
solving the refugee problem, but it will not work unless Milosevic
knows the alternative is force.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. diplomacy cannot persuade all other NATO leaders to
press ahead, Washington should assemble a coalition of those
willing to act. If necessary, America should act on its own.
Otherwise, tens of thousands of civilians may freeze or starve to
death this winter.

 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EKET, Nigeria _ Denny Sansom of Mobil Oil has the ocean behind
him, 7 million restive Nigerians of the Niger River Delta in front
of him, huge reserves of oil beneath him and hundreds of thousands
of angry complaints against his corporation threatening to sink
him.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began on Jan. 12, he recalled. Sansom, a Texan who
is Mobil's operations manager, walked into his 6:45 a.m. staff
meeting and was told that despite full production at Mobil's 57
offshore wells, oil was not reaching shore. ``Shut it down!'' he
hollered. ``Shut everything!''
</P>
<P>
   The order came too late. A 24-inch underwater pipeline from
Mobil's Idaho production platform three-and-a-half miles offshore
had snapped. Flying 26 miles out over the Atlantic in a helicopter
that afternoon, Sansom saw 26 miles of oil. ``The slick was moving
like a giant ship,'' he said. ``That thing about killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Nigerian coast, the spilled oil has now become a
subject of vehement dispute, a catalyst for pent-up claims fed by
poverty and state neglect. In few places on earth do the West's
richest corporations and millions of the world's poorest people rub
shoulders with such intensity or such potentially explosive
consequences as in the Niger Delta, the fifth-largest source of
America's imported fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very turbulent,'' said Ernest Ukocho, a community
leader in the villages surrounding Mobil's operations at Eket. ``We
are trying to maintain calm, but there has been some rioting. The
fact is, everyone wants a piece of the Mobil cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil _ 40,000 barrels of it, or roughly one-sixth of the
giant Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska _ drifted west, thus avoiding
nearby Cameroonian waters to the east and an international fiasco.
The fiercely secretive former regime of Nigerian Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died in June, also helped keep the Mobil spill largely out of
the news.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Niger Delta everyone quickly knew of it. Sansom has
been held hostage, repeatedly rebuked and now spends 70 percent of
his time on ``community issues'' _ essentially trying to stop
resentment from turning to rioting.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria approaches a delicate transition from military rule
to democracy, which is supposed to take place next year, the
delta's long-festering problems pose the threat of widespread
violence. In the wetlands, the world's largest mangrove swamp,
unrest now seems close to boiling over, with sabotage against
pipelines becoming routine and intermittent acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The spill _ dwarfing those caused by sabotage _ made Sansom's
position doubly difficult. Scientific evidence shows that
environmental damage was slight. But for people long subjected to
the stunted development apparently willed on the delta by Nigerian
military governments, that spilled oil was a bonanza beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand these people,'' Sansom said. ``They're poor. So
they think we're all Howard Hughes. One Saturday morning alone, I
had $4.5 billion in claims _ that's 45 percent of the total oil
revenue of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since oil was discovered here 42 years ago by Royal Dutch/Shell,
enormous wealth has been taken from the area by Mobil, Chevron,
Shell, Texaco and other Western companies, and by Nigeria's
generals, who have ruled for 28 of the last 32 years. But, as a
result of apparently gross neglect by the military government that
takes the bulk of the country's oil revenue, life for the people
living in the wetlands has scarcely improved.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa had the temerity to point
this out, demanding compensation on the grounds that the entire
region, and his Ogoni people, remained poor, Nigeria's generals
hanged him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The pretext was a flimsy charge of involvement in a murder,
upheld by a kangaroo court of military officers. The real issue was
_ and remains _ where and how the more than $10 billion Nigeria
receives annually from oil is invested.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other Western leaders expressed
indignation at Saro-Wiwa's execution _ although not enough to
impose oil sanctions on Nigeria, where U.S. investment totals $7
billion. Three years later, the 7 million delta people still appear
mired in a paralyzing web. Among them are Ibo and several large
minority ethnic groups; the Ogoni form a small minority of about
500,000.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official at Nigerian National Petroleum Co. conceded,
albeit on condition of anonymity, that after years of taking oil
from the delta and plowing the profits into northern Nigeria _ the
base of the ruling generals _ that policy is increasingly fraught
with risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see an escalation,'' the official said.
``We're taking oil from one part of the country and investing it in
the north. I do not think you can go on taking money from a place
without enhancing life there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, Abacha's successor, has indicated
that he wants reform. He made a conciliatory gesture this month in
releasing several Ogoni prisoners. But the problems are so
deep-rooted that such gestures are unlikely to have immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of state investment _ Nigerian authorities have
built no schools for several years _ Mobil has effectively become
the local government here: the object of all claims, all hope of
jobs, money or investment, all aspirations for electricity, or
hospitals or running water _ and all resentments.
</P>
<P>
   To travel the Eket region _ an area of about 100 square miles
that might reasonably be renamed Mobiland _ is to encounter a
fantastic array of complaints leveled at the U.S. company: gutters
not deep enough; roads and clinics promised but not built;
oil-polluted sea waters now allegedly emptied of fish all the way
to Cameroon; zinc roofs rusting because of the flares; even doors
and walls vibrating from earth tremors allegedly caused by Mobil's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to me asking for Mobil to build a water supply
system'' Sansom said, ``and I say, why don't you go to the water
board and ask the same question? And they say, because the water
board would shoot us!''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``You know, the naira these local governors get from
the military government would not buy you a piece of chewing gum.''
Yet more than 60 percent of the revenue from Mobil's joint venture
goes to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense the oil companies are unfairly criticized: the
government takes over 70 percent of Nigeria's oil revenue and could
clearly have invested more of it in the delta. But Western
companies effectively acquiesced in the region's impoverishment so
long as they could pump oil and get their money out: their push for
``community development'' in recent years, and especially since the
death of Saro-Wiwa, may have come too late.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To Western oil interests, generally synonymous with Western
political interests, stability has been of paramount importance in
Nigeria: the country's oil is ecologically desirable to America
because it is unusually sulfur-free and strategically desirable
because it represents diversification from Middle Eastern sources.
</P>
<P>
   That stability has been preserved at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of interethnic tensions, and memories of Biafra's
secession in 1967, the northern generals who have governed Nigeria
have mainly sought to keep the delta area poor and backward on the
basis that a region with oil and development might be tempted to go
it alone again. The then-Republic of Biafra comprised much of the
oil-producing region; its independence was quashed in a three-year
war that cost 1 million lives.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies, meanwhile, have long taken the view that
their obligations are met by paying taxes and royalties to the
authorities. Oil production, not regional development, has been
their role. Although this approach is now changing, the delta still
bears heavy scars.
</P>
<P>
   Potholed roads, rundown schools and isolated villages without
running water dot an area that produces over 90 percent of
Nigeria's hard-currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Only the widely resented flares of the oil companies that light
the night sky betray the fact that this land is rich. Because the
oil companies are far more visible in the area than the military
government, they are the main focus of ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were from the delta, I would long ago have joined an
armed struggle,'' said Bola Ige, a prominent Lagos lawyer and
former governor of the southern Oyo state. ``What else can you
reasonably be down there but a guerrilla leader?''
</P>
<P>
   And what else could Mobil's oil spill reasonably provoke, in
such an environment, but dreams of sudden wealth?
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax, Va.-based company, which produces about one-third
of Nigeria's total oil output in a joint venture with the
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Co., moved fast as the oil
seeped into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous interests were at stake: Mobil has more than $2.5
billion invested in Nigeria; the Ubit offshore platform, pumping
250,000 barrels a day, is the company's largest single production
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom took over an emergency command center that he manned
almost uninterruptedly for over a month. (At one point during that
time, as he was meeting with community leaders, a mob rushed into
the Eket site and held him captive. It took him about 10 hours to
talk his way out of the crisis.) Helicopters and boats were
deployed to apply dispersants to the oil slick; containment booms
and oil skimmers were used; scientists and environmentalists were
rushed in from Lagos University and the United States to test the
degree of pollution; Mobil announced that it would compensate
anyone suffering injury.
</P>
<P>
   With disaster looming, weather and currents smiled on Mobil. For
a long time the bulk of the oil remained offshore, where warm winds
and the light nature of Nigerian crude favored evaporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Mother Nature and Mobil's highly effective and
targeted response,'' said David Page, a U.S. oil spill expert,
``the shoreline was spared what could have been a very serious
environmental event. The amount of oil that got ashore was minimal,
perhaps 1 percent of the spill, or 400 barrels, certainly no more
than 1,000 barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, a chemistry professor at Bowdoin College in Maine who has
visited Nigeria three times since the spill, says hardly any oil
entered the sensitive mangrove creeks that lace the delta.
Certainly none is visible today. ``I'm not an attorney,'' he added,
``but it's fair to say that because so little oil got ashore, I'd
be very surprised if fishermen's livelihoods were cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is emphatically not the view of hundreds of
thousands of poor Nigerians along the coast. Claims have been
pouring in to the U.S. company from Akwa Ibom state, home to Mobil,
from Delta state, from Cross River , from Bajelsa, from Lagos _
``the entire damn coast,'' in the words of Isong I Akpabio, a Mobil
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At Mobil headquarters in Lagos recently, Celia Onitiri, head of
the legal staff, was unavailable for comment. She was at home and
was said to be suffering from stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we wanted to be fair,'' said Paul Caldwell Jr., chairman
of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, as the company's Nigerian
venture is named. ``But this has turned into a major undertaking
and a big headache. The fact is, the communities look to us to
provide support that they are not getting from the Nigerian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Effiong Ikot, a fisherman and owner of a small business, is
among those who have made claims. He has demanded 490,000 naira of
Mobil _ about $5,700 _ for the loss of fishing nets clogged by oil.
He regards Mobil's offer of about $250 as insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Like other claimants, Ikot brought his bundles of nets to be
inspected by Mobil officials and insurance agents. Once the
inspection was completed, the nets were burned. ``How can I be
happy,'' Ikot said, ``when somebody burns my nets?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the area, the chorus of indignation at the burning of
nets is overwhelming, driven by a sense that, as one local leader,
Chief Daniel Utong, put it, ``this act added injury to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Akpakip, a mother of six, said her business had been
ruined. A single shark net, she said, cost at least $600, and ``how
can I live when my nets have been burned and I've yet to receive
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   But Grace Nwawo, a community affairs official for Mobil in Eket,
insisted that there had been no alternative but to burn the nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were usable,'' she asked, ``why were they brought in?
Where could we have stored them? How could we have found uncorrupt
guards to protect them? How would we have prevented them being sold
to the next village?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma of the nets illustrates Mobil's situation. In
strictly rational terms, the decision to burn them seems sound. But
in the world of poverty and vague fears that surrounds Mobil,
Shell, Texaco, Chevron and other oil companies in the delta,
symbols and fantasy tend to hold sway. And what could be a more
overwhelming symbol of a rich company trampling on poor fishermen
than the burning of their nets?
</P>
<P>
   The tranquil village of Itafre, a collection of mud-and-thatch
homes, lies in the midst of the mangrove swamp about 10 miles from
Mobil's Eket base. Like many settlements, it is inaccessible other
than by boat or helicopter. Mobil has built a school here and tried
_ with limited success _ to develop a cashew-nut farm.
</P>
<P>
   But resentment is strong, especially since the spill. Thomas
Ebitu, the village chief, acknowledged that Mobil had built his
house and the school and started the farm. But what about a road?
And why was the village without electricity? And where was the
running water that Mobil should provide?
</P>
<P>
   The assembled villagers nodded. They were asked if the
government might provide some of these services. Mobil, it was
pointed out, is an oil company, not a civil engineering company. It
spends over $8 million a year on improving conditions in delta
villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no government here,'' said Mike Maru, a
fisherman. ``Mobil is the only visible entity. They are making a
lot of money here, and we've been left like monkeys out here in the
swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Maru added that he had lost 350 bundles of nets as a result of
the oil spill and was claiming 300 million naira, or $3.4 million.
The figure, in the context of the village, appeared utterly
fantastic. Another fisherman, Monday Smith, said he would settle
for $11,500. Both said their nets had been burned and asked how
they were expected to live in the absence of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In another village, Okuro Utip, a resident named James Nyoh
stood up and made a half-hour speech. He listed everything that
Mobil should provide: spill compensation, an education endowment, a
health center, a road network, clean water, jobs. The company, he
concluded, owes the village just under $100 million for the spill
alone.
</P>
<P>
   These claims are a very long way from Mobil's estimates. With
oil prices at a low ebb, the company is cutting costs. Of nine
exploration rigs that were operating in Nigerian waters, eight have
been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nwawo said the company believed that a little over $100 was
fair compensation for each lost net. Although some payments will be
higher, Mobil believes most validated claims should be settled by
payments not exceeding $600.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the spill of about $600,000 worth of oil may cost the
company about $40 million _ $10 million in cleanup and $30 million
to settle the claims. Payments have started but are being disputed,
and the process seems likely to continue for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom says he is determined to see it through. He is a
practical man, conveying a passionate sense of mission. In 21
months in Eket, he has been struck by the poverty, the lack of
family planning, the absence of state investment, the desperation.
``I want to do more than hold the line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He spends hours with community leaders seeking middle ground. He
is determined to maintain or increase the money that Mobil spends
annually on community projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planned parenthood is one key,'' he said. ``I had two women in
my office the other day with 28 children. Another key is
diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansom's dreams of a better delta appear to have found an echo.
Despite the flood of claims, chiefs in the surrounding villages
described him as popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny is admired,'' Ikot, the fisherman, said, ``because he
likes to engage in dialogue and he has some good ideas to produce
electricity and bring in investors and use the model that made
Texas rich. Even if he's not on our side, we feel he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The other factor that helps maintain a tenuous peace is clearly
the precedent of the Ogoni, whose region has been hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a warning to us,'' said Ukocho, the community leader,

COLLEGE HUNT IS EARLIER AND TRICKIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Minn.)  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRONXVILLE, N.Y. _ Like the proverbial tourist who knows he's in
Belgium because it's Tuesday, Philip Lutgendorf scratched his head
to reconstruct where he and his daughter Claire had been the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday they flew from their Iowa home to Boston to interview at
Tufts. Wednesday they were in Providence at Brown. Thursday, it was
New Haven and Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Lutgendorfs came to Westchester County to tour the
snug Tudor campus of Sarah Lawrence College. Saturday would take
them to the high rises of New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every school you meet the same people doing the same
pilgrimage,'' said Lutgendorf, a professor of Asian studies at the
University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, he and Claire were on tour here with Belinda
Jackson and her daughter Briana, and Karen Mandabach and her
daughter Marisa. All three families had NYU on their schedule
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This is high season for campus visits. While high school seniors
cram for another go at the Scholastic Assessment Test, parents are
booking trips like seasoned travel agents and refinancing mortgages
to get spare cash for the first year's tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But life has accelerated for baby boomers and their children.
Those visiting colleges as the leaves turn gold find themselves
behind the curve, especially if they're competing for the most
prestigious schools. There, up to half of each class is chosen
through early decision, which is advantageous for the college but
forces unsure youngsters to rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   With early decision the norm, campus visits have been pushed
back to July and August, replacing lazy days at the shore or one
last summer at camp. In some cases, candidates are visiting during
their junior year in high school, if not before.
</P>
<P>
   Thyra Briggs, dean of admissions at Sarah Lawrence, said
families from the Northeast are the most aggressive in pursuit of a
child's education, because competition for slots is most intense
here. For such families, the blood sport of college applications
now includes private counselors in addition to those the high
school provides, and $100-an-hour tutors for the SATs rather than
the plebeian courses offered by Kaplan or Princeton Review.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briggs gets calls from parents asking advice on ``summer
options.'' Would their children be disadvantaged by spending the
summer working rather than going to science enrichment camp? The
parents do not give their names lest their pushiness mean a black
mark on the youngster's file.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Lawrence employees are not immune to such machinations.
The offspring of professors or administrators often have a practice
interview here, even if they have no intention of applying. Only a
rube would have interview No. 1 at a school that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Homans, a Minneapolis cardiologist touring with his
son Charlie, confirmed that Midwesterners were more relaxed about
the process. ``Most farmers know you can't make it rain based on
where you went to college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Homans is considering Harvard. But, by and large, the
artsy types interested in Sarah Lawrence, with its arts and
creative writing programs, are not as ferocious as Ivy League
contenders. ``I don't feel a huge amount of pressure,'' said
Charlie, who wants to study political science and jazz guitar, easy
to arrange at a school like this one, with no formal majors.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Friedman-Cohen, an aspiring dancer, is way behind her
friends at a Massachusetts prep school. Until this week, her
research had been confined to viewing California campuses from the
car window while on a family vacation. Zoe's mother asked lots of
probing questions of the spiky-haired tour guide at Sarah Lawrence,
but confided that she hoped her daughter would take a year off ``to
find herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutgendorf offered proof that the college frenzy is an American
fixation. His daughter spent her junior year as an exchange student
in France. Returning in midsummer, Claire was greeted by the same
question from everyone she bumped into, adults and teen-agers
alike: What college are you thinking about?
</P>
<P>
   ``She hadn't thought about it at all,'' Lutgendorf said. ``So
she got a little flustered. But now she's getting into it.''

   WOMEN-INSPORTS _ Twenty-five years ago, the Bobby Riggs-Billie
Jean King tennis match was one of the most talked-about sports
event -- but as a circus-like exhibition. From that farce, women's
sports have gotten serious. Now there are so many more
opportunities, with two pro basketball leagues, soccer and hockey
in the works and thousands of college scholarships available to
young women. They are getting on TV and in the print media. And
their stars are becoming role models as well as marketing tools.
Women's sports is at a crossroads, with several road bumps ahead.
This sweep story will look at how big women's sports has gotten,
what's driving it, who the big names are. Plenty of numbers, TV,
marketing. (Schultz/Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 117.

Championship. The final weigh-in is done under a big top tent that
is transformed into a TV studio (there are even commercial breaks).
Around 1,500 to 2,000 fans are allowed in the ``studio'' for the
weigh-ins, but many, many more are outside. Similar to NASCAR fans,
they'll buy the products their favorite angler endorses. Fans at
home get to watch a made-for-TV event as television coverage jumps
from angler to angler, similar to golf coverage. (Bernarde, Atlanta
Journa-Constitution) 20-25.

   (NYT9) WASHINGTON-- Sept. 19, 1998 -- CLINTON-STARR, 9-19 -- It
is no secret that independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, left, and
Bill Clinton, have nothing but the highest disregard for each
other. Associates of both men say that their hatred - and these
friends say that hatred is not too strong a word - repeatedly
clouded their judgment and led to excesses on both sides that have
permanently tarnished both reputations (Stephen Crowley, left, and

were just looking for a decent place to live, a quiet place to
raise children,'' says Hinton, 88, recalling why he and his wife
moved to Queens. The Hinton's were not the only ones. Many jazz

Billie Holiday and Illinois Jacquet also called Queens their home.

the city offered to Oklahoma's Delaware Indians to build a casino.
But now the Delawares have filed a lawsuit claiming the entire city
as their ancestral land. An Indian casino was not even Wager's
first choice. While he was still a city councilman, in 1994, he

along the ranch she operates with her husband Norman just southwest
of Casper. The Park's Dumbell Ranch runs cattle on 100,000 acres,

repair a section of fence on his family's 150,000 acre ranch west
of Casper. In June vandals calling themselves ``Islamic Jihad'' cut
miles of fence on ranches in the area. ``For their own safety, they

``They're poor. So they think we're all Howard Hughes.'' Sansom a
Texan who is Mobil's operations manager, spends 70 percent of his
time on ``community issues'' or keeping the people happy. ``One
Saturday morning alone I had $4.5 billion in claims - that's 45
percent of the total oil revenue of the country.'' (Roger Cohen/New

   (NYT1) ITAFRE, Nigeria -- Sept. 19, 1998 -- NIGERIA-OIL-1, 9-19

Ebitu, chief of Itafre - which has seen no Nigerian Government aid
- are making enormous demands. Ebitu acknowledges that Mobil had
built his house and the school, but that is not enough. (Roger

PILOTS SAY AN EXTRA PERSON CAN HELP DEFUSE A CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before anyone knows what caused the fire that
brought down Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2,
aviation experts are debating whether the 229 people who died would
have had a better chance in a plane with a cockpit crew of three,
not two, and whether the airlines' continuing drive to economize
with automation and smaller crews has taken a toll on safety.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Halifax, Nova Scotia, hinted on Thursday that
the investigation was still far from complete. But a suspicion
persists among some experts that the computers that replaced the
flight engineer on the Swissair jet, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11,
left the captain and first officer without a colleague who could
troubleshoot or innovate in a crisis. Others, though, say the
difficulties faced by Flight 111 _ and its failure to descend
immediately _ made the size of the crew irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Flight engineers, who keep track of a jet's fuel flow, engine
performance and other details, are usually pilots-in-training. With
an engineer, ``you've got that pilot mind there, a second pair of
eyes, and he's not that busy, he's not wrestling with the
airplane,'' said Donald Tynan, a retired American Airlines pilot
who once confronted a smoke emergency in flight. On Nov. 15, 1979,
on a flight from Chicago to National Airport in Washington, a bomb
exploded in the baggage hold of his Boeing 727, filling the plane
with smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Tynan said he was able to assign the other pilot to
communications, fly the plane himself, and dispatch the flight
engineer to the passenger cabin to assess the situation. Experts
say a captain is much less likely to send a crew member outside the
cockpit if there are only two of them.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the engineer saw smoke filling the cabin and
called for an immediate landing; Tynan brought the plane down at
the nearest airport, Dulles, so fast that, by his own account, he
never got clearance from air traffic control, came too close to a
plane already on the runway, and broke a Federal Aviation
Administration speed limit on the way down. But 12 of his
passengers suffered smoke inhalation; any delay, he said, and it
would have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Another oft-cited example of an extra crew member saving the day
is the July 1989 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 near Sioux City,
Iowa, after an engine disintegrated in flight and severed the
hydraulic system. A training pilot who was traveling in the
passenger cabin came forward to join the three-member flight crew,
and figured out that some control could be obtained by varying the
speed of the two remaining engines. Without that novel technique _
which required an extra person to manipulate separately the two
throttles that are normally moved together _ experts believe that
everyone aboard would have died; in the end, 112 died and 184
survived.
</P>
<P>
   But three-person cockpits are a historical artifact now _ all
the manufacturers have eliminated the flight engineer. The Boeing
747 was one of the last holdouts, but the current version, the
747-400, flies with a crew of two.
</P>
<P>
   The flight engineer contributes to safety, said Dr. Earl Wiener,
an expert on human factors in aviation and an emeritus professor at
the department of management science at the University of Miami.
``He may be the most mechanically sophisticated of the three people
in the cockpit,'' Wiener said. And if there is any thought to
pulling up the hatch cover behind the captain's chair and looking
down into the electronics bay beneath the cockpit, where
investigators think the Swissair fire may have occurred, a
three-person crew is much more likely to do that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiener added that captains never find it easy to supervise
flight engineers, who sit over their right shoulders, and the
dynamics of three people working together are more difficult than
with two. ``There's a coordination problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert van der Linden, the Smithsonian's curator for air
transportation, said the flight engineer was doomed by the
airlines' demands for lower operating costs and the arrival of
computers that can do the work of engineers. ``A third man wouldn't
have made a whit of difference'' in the Swissair accident, he said.
``He'd have died, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Van der Linden and others say that what killed the pilots and
their passengers was not immediately recognizing the severity of
their problem. Investigators in Halifax said on Thursday that the
cockpit voice recorder showed the first mention of a smell of smoke
about 3 minutes before the crew sent its first distress call, or 13
minutes before communications ceased, and 19 minutes before the
crash, relatively short periods for a plane flying at an altitude
of six miles, over water.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of smoke in airplanes is not rare, pilots say, and
they often hesitate to begin descent, for fear of crying wolf.
Tynan, who broke rules and saved his passengers and plane, had the
advantage of hearing the bomb explode and knowing quickly that
there was a problem; more often, smoke is slowly recognized and
turns out to be minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the last time, it was a Pop-Tart,'' said another MD-11
pilot, who spoke on condition his name not be used. Someone had
left it in a galley oven too long, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another MD-11 pilot said that the computers that effectively
replaced the flight engineer were very useful in an emergency
landing. The fuel dump system, for example, automatically sets
itself to get the plane down to maximum landing weight; the pilot
has only to push one button, one time. And no matter what the
weight, the computers tell the pilots what the minimum safe air
speed is, automatically taking into account flap position and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA expert on how pilots use computerized cockpits, Kevin
Corker, noted, however, that the flight engineer had been replaced
by several smart computers. ``There are more than three intelligent
entities on the flight deck now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, in Prescott, Ariz.,
William Waldock, the associate director of the university's Center
for Aerospace Safety Education, said that no matter how many people
had been in the Swissair 111 cockpit, the problem was the ambiguity
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either one of them thought they had that serious
a problem,'' he said. ``By the time it got upgraded to a point
where the captain's beginning to think he's got a real emergency,
probably it was past the point where a third person would have made
a difference,'' he said.

YOUNG DEVILS GET A LOOK IN NIEDERMAYER'S ABSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ The longer Scott Niedermayer continues to
demand a $4 million-a-year contract to join the Devils, the better
the chances are for several promising players to take a spot on the
defense that was second-best in the National Hockey League last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's absence will enable coach Robbie Ftorek to get a
closer look at his promising young defensemen starting with
Sunday's exhibition opener against the Montreal Canadiens at
Albany, N.Y., home of the Devils' top affiliate in the minor
leagues, the River Rats of the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek has reminded reporters every day since the opening of
training camp here last Sunday that returning veterans will have to
lose their jobs to younger players by a wide margin, or a knockout,
as the first-year coach says. But without Niedermayer, someone will
have to be added to the list of at least seven defensemen the
Devils are expected to open the season with.
</P>
<P>
   The captain Scott Stevens, Ken Daneyko, Lyle Odelein and Sheldon
Souray will take the first four spots. If Niedermayer returns,
Souray, who was a rookie last season, will be relegated to the
fifth spot.
</P>
<P>
   The other three of four spots will be contested by Brad
Bombardir, Kevin Dean, Colin White, Geordie Kinnear, Vlastimil
Kroupa and Ken Sutton. Bombardir and Dean appear to have the edge
because they each played more than 40 games last season, but White
could jump two or three notches on the depth chart with solid
performances in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek will not single out anyone in training camp, but he has
said that the 20-year-old White has been ``progressing well _ that
he has sacrificed short term for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   White was sent back to his junior team when he was drafted 49th
overall two years ago. He was sent to Albany last season, when he
played 76 games in the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready; I've got to play like I'm ready for this
league,'' White said after a recent practice. ``I can't make
decisions for anybody. All I can do is open their eyes that I can
play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek will take a good look at White in the exhibition opener.
Ftorek had White paired with Odelein in Saturday's practice, and he
is expected to use him with Odelein against Montreal. The other
defensive pairings on Sunday will be Daneyko with Bombardir and
Souray with Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Niedermayer here,'' White said, ``it's an opportunity
for some of us guys to show what we can do. But the thing is that
this team needs Niedermayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Devils and their president and general
manager, Lou Lamoriello _ who is holding the line at a $2.5 million
offer in his negotiations with Niedermayer and his agent, Don
Meehan _ none of the other defensemen come close to having
Niedermayer's offensive attributes.

D'AMATO ACCUSES OPPONENT OF NAME-CALLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato assailed his Democratic
opponent, Charles Schumer, on Saturday for ``character
assassination,'' asserting that he was running a campaign based on
personal attacks, and predicting that it would fail by Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, in his first return to New York state since Schumer won
the Democratic nomination, complained that Schumer, in his
advertisements and public statements, had engaged in
``name-calling'' unbecoming a candidate for the U.S. Senate. The
two candidates exchanged harsh attacks last week, though on
Saturday the senator mentioned only Schumer's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is unfortunate that he has gotten into the
character assassination by the use of the pejoratives and the very
personal,'' D'Amato said as he waited at Fifth Avenue and 63rd
Street to begin the uptown march of the German-American Steuben Day
parade.
</P>
<P>
   And then, reminding his listeners of his opponent in 1992, the
senator said of Schumer: ``He said he was going to run on issues,
but I see that he's following the same pattern _ unnecessarily _
that Bob Abrams did in personalizing it with a whole series of
statements: sleaze, liar, untrustworthy. We have legitimate issues
that we differ on and I would hope that we would concentrate on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   With his remarks on Saturday, the Republican senator took
advantage of a waiting New York City press corps to assume what has
been a stance he had some success using against Abrams in 1992:
presenting himself as a victim of unfair attacks, while
simultaneously pummeling his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato made his remarks after Schumer broadcast a series of
television advertisements that contended that the senator had
distorted Schumer's record in Congress. ``D'Amato _ too many lies
for too long,'' the advertisements say. They appeared within hours
of D'Amato's commercial attacking Schumer as a ``New York City
liberal who proves it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign dismissed D'Amato's complaints as unfounded.
``Al D'Amato has spent his entire career misrepresenting his
extremist record and that of his opponents,'' said Schumer's
campaign manager, Josh Isay. ``We're not going to let him get away
with it anymore. For someone who has run slash-and-burn,
slice-and-dice campaigns for three decades, Al D'Amato has an
awfully thin skin.''
</P>
<P>
   In offering his harsh assessment of Schumer's candidacy, D'Amato
referred to a number of things that Schumer had said about the
senator since winning the nomination, asserting that Schumer had
crossed the line between legitimate political discourse and unfair
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you begin to personalize attacks by saying people are
untrustworthy or calling them liars or sleaze, that's unacceptable,
and after all, he's running for the United States Senate,'' D'Amato
said. ``If that is the manner in which he's going to conduct
himself, I think he'll have the same result as his predecessor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   D'Amato said he had acted appropriately in calling Schumer
liberal at every opportunity, thereby making his political ideology
one of the two major themes of his criticism. But D'Amato seemed
flummoxed Saturday when asked about the second large theme of his
criticism: repeatedly reminding voters that Schumer lives in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know _ I'm trying to ask you, to what ad do you refer
to?'' D'Amato asked. The advertisement D'Amato put on the air last
week describes Schumer as a ``New York City liberal congressman''
and his campaign statements routinely refer to Schumer as a
``Brooklyn liberal congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said his campaign was not trying to stoke upstate
animosity toward New York City. ``I was born in Brooklyn,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me say something to you,'' D'Amato continued. ``There
are more than just people who live in any one community and I think
he ought to understand that this is a whole state and we should be
proud of representing the entire state. And I don't think the
congressman really understands this.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said he was unable to discuss any strategic
considerations in stressing that Schumer was from Brooklyn. ``I
can't get into the exact why that you make it exactly this way,''
D'Amato said of his ad. ``But it's an accurate description.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay declined comment on D'Amato's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato spent much of Saturday discussing Schumer's record,
pointing to votes on a number of issues _ in particular, against
some measures to restrict welfare, in favor of some increases in
taxes _ as he tried to portray Schumer as ideologically out of
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has voted as the classic liberal for more big government,''
D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, D'Amato complained about the way Schumer had
attacked him, which he described as mud-slinging. ``It's
unfortunate that the congressman has seen fit to engage in a series
of name-calling,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mona Hinton led a visitor through her Addisleigh Park
neighborhood in Queens the other day, recalling the old haunts that
she and Milt, the legendary jazz bassist and her husband of 59
years, frequented long ago.
</P>
<P>
   She drove by what was once the trumpeter Jimmy Nottingham's bar,
Sir Jimmy's, now a strip of shops and restaurants. On Linden
Boulevard, she found Sisters, a now-abandoned diner where the
cornbread would melt in your mouth. Then, she circled around
Baisley Boulevard, where once, she remembered as clear as day,
stood a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say,'' she summoned a passer-by, ``you know where Club Ruby
used to be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' she was told.
</P>
<P>
   She asked another and another, and finally someone pointed to a
duplex on the corner of 120th Avenue and Baisley. Out front was a
man who ran an accounting office inside. ``Did you ever hear of the
name Milton Hinton?'' she asked. ``He used to be called `The
Judge.'''
</P>
<P>
   He politely shook his head, offering an apologetic smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone remembers the things Mona Hinton, 79, does. But
not all that long ago, in this city of jazz, Queens was, quite
literally, the home of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs were mostly in Harlem and on Broadway. But Queens is
where Louis Armstrong settled for good, in a wood-frame house with
a small, second-floor study where he created countless scrapbooks
and filled journals chronicling a remarkable life. It is where
Count Basie and his wife, Catherine, threw the finest parties of
summer, in a back yard that took up a whole city block. It is where
Milt and Mona Hinton came after years on the road, spent in
``Colored Only'' motels in the Jim Crow South and in rented rooms
in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1930s and '40s, they and other musicians who had
flocked to New York City had made enough money to leave the cramped
hotels and apartments of Manhattan. While white musicians scattered
to the suburbs, African-American jazz musicians, thwarted by
segregation, clustered in two corners of Queens: Corona, where
Louis Armstrong's wife, Lucille, bought a two-story house in 1943,
soon drawing fellow musicians in droves, and southeast Queens,
where the composer Clarence Williams and his wife, the singer Eva
Taylor, moved in the '30s, with dreams of starting a black artists'
colony.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians who followed were among the first
African-Americans to move into these neighborhoods, helping to
establish what would later become a mecca for the city's black
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Hinton, 88, remembers it this way: ``Colored people like us were
just looking for a decent place to live, a quiet place to raise
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Hintons are among the few survivors of that era. The
Basies' back yard in Addisleigh Park, a section of St. Albans, has
made way for a cluster of houses, and except for the Armstrong
house, which is a city landmark, the homes of the other artists are
known only to a few jazz aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the history of that era is beginning to be
noticed. Flushing Town Hall, an arts center in downtown Flushing,
will begin a series of weekend bus tours next month to explore the
homes and neighborhood haunts of many of these artists.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night, a concert in Milt Hinton's honor inaugurated
the center's fall jazz series and drew a handful of the old Queens
players, including the saxophonist Jimmy Heath. There is also an
exhibit featuring the photographs taken by Hinton, who chronicled
the era he helped to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of that history survives only in the memories of its
last living players _ and in Hinton's photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, in a sunny alcove off their living room, the
Hintons sat poring over old photographs and recalling the pictures
still vivid in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   There was a photograph of a picnic in Cunningham Park: Miles
Davis was embracing a woman Mrs. Hinton remembered to be his wife
at the time _ ``Frances, I'm pretty sure that was her name,'' she
said _ and the guitarist Barry Galbraith was seated at a picnic
table with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hinton has published two books of photographs, mostly of his
friends. There is Billie Holiday, dejected by the sound of her own
voice at a recording session in Manhattan. There is Dizzy
Gillespie, wrapped in a wool coat, sleeping on a bus. There is Mrs.
Hinton standing with the trumpet players Doc Cheatham, Mario Bauza
and others in front of a ``Colored Only'' motel in Alabama in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show the way we lived, the conditions we lived
in,'' Hinton said of his photographs. ``Our young black kids _ they
don't know the suffering we have gone through, just to get by in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In these quiet, tree-lined streets, many African-American
musicians found respite. To recall the jazz denizens of southeast
Queens and Corona is to recall many of this century's musical
giants. Gillespie moved into a house a few blocks from the
Armstrongs. Ella Fitzgerald once lived nearby. By the 1960s, a
co-op building erected for war veterans became home to Clark Terry,
the trumpet player; Cannonball Adderley, the saxophonist, and
Heath, who still lives there with his wife, Mona, in a
three-bedroom apartment with a view of Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice atmosphere, coming from the inner city out here
to the trees,'' recalled Heath, who moved to the building, the
Dorie Miller Co-ops in Corona, in 1964. ``I was born in the
tenements, in West Philly. Manhattan was just like Philly, where I
came from. I wanted a little more space, a nicer atmosphere to
raise my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In southeast Queens, James Johnson, the pianist and composer,
settled close to Clarence Williams' home in Jamaica. In 1929, Fess
Williams, the band leader who inaugurated the Savoy Ballroom in
Harlem, bought a house in nearby St. Albans. ``The neighborhood was
mostly German, and you saw `For Sale' signs all over the place,''
his daughter, Estella Williams, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, sometime in the 1930s, a white policeman who worked the
beat in Harlem sold his house in Addisleigh Park to a black man _
deliberately, as local lore would have it, because he was feuding
with a neighbor. In moved Fats Waller to a Tudor-style house on the
corner of Sayres Avenue and 173rd Street, forever transforming the
affluent, white pocket that was once home to Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz men and women came to Queens for many of the same
reasons that others did: to grow tomatoes in the back yard, as many
of them remembered doing in their childhood days in the South; to
let their children ride bicycles up and down the streets without
fear and to give big, welcoming feasts in the summer. They also
could rehearse in their basements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had a barbecue, you'd just stop by and start
eating,'' recalled Clarence Irving, a former jazz record shop owner
and a historian of Queens. ``You'd eat as much as you want and then
you moved on. There was nobody there that wouldn't eat rice. There
was nobody there that wouldn't eat pig feet. It was a culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hintons first moved to a Jamaica neighborhood known as
Bricktown in 1949, renting an apartment that had been recommended
by a friend, J.C. Johnson, a music arranger. Nine years later, they
bought a two-story Tudor in Addisleigh Park, where they live today.
``I was raised in Sandusky, Ohio, a small town,'' Mrs. Hinton said.
``I just couldn't imagine raising a child in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   They were a stone's throw from the Wallers' home. Mercer
Ellington, the band leader and son of Duke Ellington, was around
the corner. Lena Horne bought a house with a low-lying stone fence
on 178th Street, and Billie Holiday briefly owned a home nearby,
but then moved to an apartment in nearby Flushing. The saxophonist
Illinois Jacquet lives there still. Just down the street from the
Hintons, the Basies gave their famous back yard barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very charitable person,'' Mrs. Hinton said of her
friend, Catherine Basie. ``She always gave parties for her
charities and social events. They had a fence up, and they had
roses covering the whole fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Harlem of old or the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn,
where many contemporary jazz musicians now live, Queens did not
spawn a particular jazz style. Still, jazz historians say, it was
vital to the development of the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created a social strata apart from Harlem, where a whole
generation of musicians got together, made connections, and that
affected the recordings they made, the bands they made,'' said Gary
Giddins, a jazz critic whose book, ``Visions of Jazz: The First
Century,'' was recently published by Oxford University Press. ``It
seems to me more sociological than musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for jazz fans, little of this history has been preserved
or publicized. (The Savoy Ballroom has not been designated a
landmark for that matter either, they point out.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If Donald Manes or somebody like that who had some power, had
been a jazz fan'' Giddins said, referring to the late Queens
borough president, ``maybe something would have happened. It takes
somebody to say, `Hey, this is Louis Armstrong, this is Dizzy
Gillespie. These are major American icons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Schaap, a music historian and disk jockey whose family has
lived in Hollis, Queens, for several generations, was a child when
the icons moved to his neighborhood. He remembers when Lester
Young's wife, Mary, signed up for a library card at the public
library in Jamaica, where his mother, Marjorie, worked; she and his
father, Walter, a jazz critic, were huge fans of Young, the
saxophone and clarinet player.
</P>
<P>
   Schaap also remembers when he tried to make the acquaintance of
trumpeter Roy Eldridge's daughter, Carol, at her sixth-grade
graduation; striving for integration, their schools _ his,
predominantly white, hers, predominantly black _ had a combined
graduation that year.
</P>
<P>
   And he can never forget the transit strike of January 1966, when
New Yorkers were urged to give rides to stranded schoolchildren and
when he, a boy of 13, strategically positioned himself along Hollis
Court Boulevard, along Count Basie's preferred route to Manhattan.
He stuck out his hand when the Count's chauffeur-driven car pulled
up, and he rode with the Count all the way into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My awareness of jazz comes from growing up in Hollis,'' said
Schaap, who is regarded as a living jazz encyclopedia. ``The entire
jazz community had moved into my neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   They have mostly left by now. Just the other night, Schaap
attended a memorial service for the clarinetist Benny Waters, who
once lived nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hollis is known for another kind of popular music. One of
the earliest, most influential rap groups, Run-D.M.C., came from
Hollis. The trio A Tribe Called Quest and the one-man cultural
empire known as L.L. Cool J. grew up nearby.

ANNABELLE IRWIN, 82, CO-AUTHOR OF TEEN NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annabelle Irwin, a retired Iowa State English professor who drew
on her experience as a high school teacher in collaborating on an
acclaimed series of books for young teen-agers, died Sept. 13 at a
daughter's home in Des Moines, Iowa. She was 82, and with Lee
Hadley had formed the writing team known as Hadley Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Sara Thompson said the cause was complications from
hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Irwin and her partner, Lee Hadley, also an Iowa State
English professor, put their heads and names together in the early
1970's, their target audience was 12- to 16-year-olds, an age group
known in the publishing trade as young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Specializing in what are known as problem books, the women
produced 13 Hadley Irwin titles for the McElderry imprint at Simon
&AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   The books dealt with serious themes in such detail that it is
little wonder that Mrs. Irwin's children, who appear in various
guises throughout the series, would want the world to know that
their mother did not draw on their experiences in exploring
problems like teen-age suicide (``So Long at the Fair''),
alcoholism (``Can't Hear You Listening'') or racism (``Kim/Kimi''),
let alone incest, the breakthrough subject of the 1985 Hadley Irwin
book, ``Abby, My Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Irwin really did not need her children as models. A
native of Peterson, Iowa, Mrs. Irwin, whose maiden name was Bowen,
grew up on a farm, majored in music at Morningside College in Sioux
City, Iowa, and spent 30 years teaching, first music and later
English, at a series of high schools in Iowa and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she returned to school at age 50 to pick up a
master's degree at the University of Iowa and qualify for a college
position, Mrs. Irwin, who joined the Iowa State faculty in 1969,
had seen enough teen-agers to fuel her literary career.
</P>
<P>
   In a collaboration in which she took the lead in plotting and
Ms. Hadley specialized in characters, Mrs. Irwin drew on the
experiences of students she had taught in high school in developing
the books' anguished themes.
</P>
<P>
   Over a quarter of a century the women developed a sure-fire
system, beginning their books during summer vacations at Mrs.
Irwin's lakeside home in Lake View, Iowa, and revising them during
the school year, sometimes sitting side by side at the same
typewriter and finishing each other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The novels won respect in the publishing industry, led to a
couple of television movies and sold steadily in the United States,
Europe and Japan, though not enough to make the authors wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The last Hadley Irwin book, ``Sarah With an H,'' which dealt
with anti-Semitism, was published after Ms. Hadley's death at 60 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Mrs. Irwin sought to carry on alone under the name Ann
Irwin, writing an as yet unpublished novel, ``The Wild Seedling.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Irwin, whose husband, Keith, died in 1994, is survived by
two other daughters, Jane Croll of Des Moines, and Ann Bauer of
Dubuque, Iowa; a son, Rees, of Ames, Iowa, and four grandchildren.

PROSECUTORS SAY DEFENDANT DESERVES EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the Brooklyn neighborhood where he lived, Jermaine
Page called himself the ``main man,'' prosecutors say. They are
happy to call him that, though not for a reason that makes Page
happy.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say that Page, 24, was one of two armed robbers
who shot Marvin McIntosh while stealing his jewelry on a street in
the East New York section of Brooklyn in May 1996. Page, they say,
was the main assailant because his bullets were the ones that
killed the 28-year-old victim.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, as arguments and testimony began last week in
Page's trial in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn, prosecutors
maintained that he should be convicted of first-degree murder and
should be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Page's lawyers responded that the person who fired the fatal
shots was the one the prosecutors called the second gunman _ a
teen-ager to be tried later for second-degree murder, which is not
punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the defense lawyers told the jury, there had been no
robbery, but rather a dispute over a dice game that ended with the
teen-ager's shooting and killing McIntosh. The defense also
suggested that Page did not fire any shots at all in the incident,
which occurred not far from the building where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   And so the issues were joined in New York City's second
death-penalty trial since capital punishment was revived in the
state three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution clearly wanted to rivet the attention of the
jury immediately, because its opening witness was Latisha Mitchell,
McIntosh's 12-year-old goddaughter, who was with him when he was
gunned down two and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, who lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and worked for a
private mail-delivery service, was slain outside a girlfriend's
apartment, prosecutors said, after he refused to hand over some
conspicuous jewelry he was wearing: a gold chain and a pendant
shaped like a bulldog's head, with rubies for eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Latisha began crying as she told the jury in Justice Priscilla
Hall's courtroom that Page and a second man had approached
McIntosh. Under questioning by an assistant district attorney,
Joseph Alexis, Latisha said that the second man demanded what she
called ``the bulldog gold chain'' and that McIntosh _ whom she
referred to by his middle name, Naquan _ refused and began fighting
with that man.
</P>
<P>
   She then nodded toward the defense table, where Page, a man with
closely cropped hair and a slight goatee, regarded her without
expression. ``Him _ the man over there _ took Naquan and turned him
around,'' she said. ``He stepped back about 3 feet and started
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not remember the other man firing or even
having a gun. Prosecutors have identified him as the teen-ager
awaiting trial _ Darryl Gilmore, 15 at the time of the killing and
17 now. He has pleaded not guilty to the second-degree murder
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, a defense lawyer, Gary Villanueva,
sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Latisha's testimony by
establishing that shortly after the killing she told investigators
and a grand jury that both men had shot McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   When the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, announced in
late 1996 that he would pursue the death penalty against Page, he
did not say why he had chosen to make a capital case out of this
killing, other than to say he had reviewed the ``aggravating and
mitigating factors'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But in his opening statement to the jury last week, a deputy
district attorney, Barry Schreiber, hinted at a possible reason
when he termed McIntosh's killing an execution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the state's first capital trial under the 1995 death-penalty
law, also in Brooklyn, the defendant, Darrel Harris, was accused of
the execution-style killings of three people in a robbery. In June,
a jury convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to
death, rejecting the alternative of life in prison without the
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Page's jury heard the first witnesses, at least
one spectator made it clear that she was already convinced that he
deserved the ultimate sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should get the chair,'' said Martha Reese, 71,
McIntosh's grandmother. ``He didn't give my child a chance,'' she
added of her grandson, whom she had reared from age 2.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Reese's wish is fulfilled, it will not be through the
electric chair, which was last used in the state in 1963. The
state's present method is lethal injection.

WIN ELLIOT, 83, SPORTSCASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Mass., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Win Elliot, whose affable broadcasting style colored his calls
of Rangers hockey games and whose sports reports were marked by
sophisticated writing, died on Thursday at Norwalk Hospital in
Connecticut. He was 83. The cause of death was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot's diverse career was typical of broadcasters in the 1940s
and 1950s who hustled for jobs in radio and in the fledgling medium
of television. Besides calling Rangers games on Channels 9 and 11,
he anchored World Series pre- and postgame shows, reported on
boxing and horse racing, and was host of radio call-in shows as
well as the ``Schaefer Circle of Sports'' on television.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1960s to the early '80s, Elliot anchored the
Sports Central USA reports on the CBS Radio Network, which culled
sound bites from sports events on Saturdays and Sundays from around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd leave home at 3 in the morning Saturday and come back at
1 in the morning Monday,'' said Michael Elliot, one of Elliot's
sons. ``In between, he'd do 10 five-minute shows a day, always at
six minutes after the hour.''
</P>
<P>
   As a student at the University of Houston, Jim Nantz of CBS
Sports transmitted taped interviews to Elliot's program in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a master at taking tape and writing cleverly around
it,'' Nantz said. ``I'd feed him interviews and couldn't wait to
hear what he'd say.''
</P>
<P>
   Nantz added that Elliot had a dramatic flair and occasionally
dropped his voice to a whisper during his sports reports. ``He
said, `Don't be afraid to bring your voice down, it'll make people
pay attention.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot was also host of television quiz shows like ``Tic Tac
Dough'' and ``On Your Account'' and the radio variety show
``Borden's County Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born Irwin Elliot Shalek in Chelsea, Mass., but changed
his name early in his career. A zoology major and a hockey
goaltender at the University of Michigan, Elliot took a
communications class to get the credits he needed to graduate, and
an impressed professor suggested sportscasting as a career.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Michael, he is survived by his wife, Rita, of Weston,
Conn.; four daughters, Sue Elliot-Bearce, Marilyn McDonough, Patti
Elliot and Kathy Cobb; four other sons, Richard, Peter, Robert and
Douglas, and 17 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth son, Chuck, is deceased.
</P>
<P>
   The MSG Network sportscaster Marv Albert said Elliot would be
recalled by older New York fans primarily for his Rangers
announcing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very charming style,'' Albert said. ``He was very
glib. He was folksy and very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot's hockey play-by-play style was more conversational than
that of today's announcers, but it still conveyed excitement during
fallow Rangers seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching a rare Rangers playoff game,'' Michael
Elliot said. ``My family gathered in the living room. In the third
period, the Rangers tied the Chicago Blackhawks. We were going
nuts. He was dramatizing the game, but always in control. We were
throwing pillows. And he said, `Stop beating on the furniture!' The
world stopped because it was like he was in the room with us.''

 ROOKIE MAKES MISTAKE AND McGWIRE DOESN'T  
 (DUPLICATION WARNING: This is a rewritten and expanded version of
BBN-CARDS-BREWERS, which moved Friday night.)  
(nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ For the most part, the Milwaukee Brewers had been
smart this season when facing Mark McGwire. They had pitched him
low, high, inside, outside, whatever was necessary to avoid being
bashed.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy had been as successful as any against McGwire, the
St. Louis Cardinals' barrel-armed slugger, allowing him only two
home runs in eight games. But on Friday night, the rookie Rafael
Roque scrapped his team's plan and challenged McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a blast into the left-center-field bleachers,
estimated at 417 feet, that drove the crowd of 48,194 at Milwaukee
County Stadium into a frenzy, even though the two-run shot tied the
score at 2-2 and helped the visiting Cardinals win, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Amid flashing cameras and screaming fans, Roque's fastball
rocketed off McGwire's bat, driving in Ray Lankford and increasing
McGwire's record-breaking season home run total to 64. It also
broke the deadlock that Chicago's Sammy Sosa had forged with his
63rd home run, a grand slam, on Wednesday night in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It was McGwire's 451st career home run, and moved him to within
one of Carl Yastrzemski for 20th place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who of late had been the hotter half of the
record-breaking duo, was 0 for 4 Friday at Wrigley Field in the
Cubs' 6-4 loss to Cincinnati and remained at 63.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, McGwire had not homered in 18 at-bats since he
had surpassed Roger Maris' record of 61 on Sept. 8. Now, two homers
in four games had given him back the lead in a race in which he
trailed only once this season, and then for less than a game.
</P>
<P>
   While all of America, and much of the world, is keeping tabs on
the race between McGwire and Sosa, McGwire insisted that it meant
little to him _ that it would not bother him if Sosa had more
homers when the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a big deal who finishes on top, but if you ask
Sammy or I, I don't think it really matters,'' McGwire said. ``What
we've done in the game of baseball nobody has ever done, so I don't
think it matters where we end up. We're both rooting for each
other, so where the numbers end up, that's where it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Roque walked McGwire on six pitches in the first inning and
appeared headed that way in the fourth. It did not seem the Brewers
would give McGwire much to hit. But with the count at 3-1, the
rookie left-hander threw a fastball over the outside of the plate,
and McGwire got all of it. There was no doubt the ball would land
at least 400 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch,'' McGwire said. ``It crossed the plate
over the corner and I just drove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason King, a 23-year-old waiter from Madison, Wis., dived from
the stands and into an exit well to retrieve the ball. He was at
the park in place of his brother, Dave Wilshire, who took care of
King's daughter so that King could come to the game. King said he
did not know what he would do with the ball eventually, but he
would take it home for now to show to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to hold it in his hands because this is just as
much his as it is mine,'' King told The Associated Press.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The crowd almost got another treat in the fifth inning. After
throwing two balls high, reliever David Weathers put one in
McGwire's power zone. With one of his mighty cuts, McGwire drove
the ball high and into the upper deck, just 15 feet to the left of
the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Weathers' next pitch looked like No. 65 as well,
but McGwire's drive to right-center was caught by right fielder
Jeromy Burnitz at the front of the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire walked in the first inning and fouled out to the catcher
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will have two more games to thrill Milwaukee's fans,
facing the Brewers Saturday night and Sunday. Ticket sales for
those games, plus Friday night's attendance, add up to more than
154,000. Unless a game is rained out, there will be a new stadium
record for a three-game series, eclipsing the mark of 153,974 set
against Boston in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish every player could feel what I'm feeling,'' McGwire
said. ``There's nothing better than playing a baseball game in
front of a full house. A lot of fans all over America are coming
out specifically to watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got an extra boost from the crowd because Green Bay
Packers' All-Pro quarterback Brett Favre was in attendance and took
batting practice with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you get to play in front of other athletes from other
sports, it's nice to do well,'' McGwire said. ``He admires the way
I go at it, and I admire the way he goes at it.''
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire is done taking his cuts at Milwaukee pitching, it
will be Sosa's turn. The Cubs play the Brewers on Tuesday and
Wednesday, and it's a safe bet that Sosa will put one, two or three
balls over the fences. In his 10 games this season against the
Brewers, he has homered 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire admitted that he was not himself during his recent
homerless stretch. ``There was so much built up to do what I did
that I didn't know where I was for a couple of days,'' he said.
``Then we went to Houston and they pitched me well. Then we went
home and I started to feel better. Everything goes in cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning that the Brewers had better watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McGwire said he would love it if he and Sosa
finished the race in a dead heat, and Saturday he implied that Sosa
had received less attention from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to you,'' McGwire said to reporters. ``I would give
him as much publicity as I've gotten and I encourage you to.''

 CAROL HOCHBERG, 40, ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS OF BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carol Hochberg, an investment banker who turned a
diagnosis of breast cancer into a life of advocating for fellow
sufferers, died of the disease on Wednesday at her home on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 40.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Hochberg learned of the cancer, her first reaction was
to fight, said her mother, Audrey Hochberg, a Democratic
assemblywoman from Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get out there and kick,'' Carol Hochberg said in a
New York Times interview in 1995. She channeled her anger and
energy into Share, a lobbying and self-help group for women with
breast or ovarian cancer. After seeking advice there, she rapidly
became a volunteer, a board member and a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer arrived, she once said, at a ``most opportune time.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and earning
an MBA at Harvard, she began working on Wall Street. Eight years
later, in 1994, she was an investment banker at Schroder Wertheim &AMP;
Co., with a six-figure salary and a substantial personal portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, she said, she had decided that there was ``more to
life than making rich men richer,'' as she put it. She quit her job
and gave herself a year to figure out how to spend the rest of her
life. She read, visited relatives and friends, and traveled to
Antarctica, Brazil and the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Before the year was over, she learned that a lump in her left
breast was cancerous. ``She leaned into it,'' said Alice Yaker, who
recently retired as Share's executive director, referring to both
the disease and the cancer support center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hochberg recalled in 1995: ``I was waiting for something to
be committed and enthusiastic about. I guess I took cancer as a
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hochberg, who believed that knowledge was control, read
every article, book and online file she could find about breast
cancer. She volunteered on the Share phone line, answering the
questions of other women with the disease. She kept in touch with
callers who seemed to be especially alone, like a young Chinese
woman who had recently arrived in New York. She introduced a more
sophisticated system of budgeting and financial planning to Share.
And she helped to raise money, persuading relatives and Wall Street
friends to contribute, and donating some of her own money.
</P>
<P>
   And she immersed herself in the politics of breast cancer,
working to get insurance coverage for women who were uninsured or
entering clinical trials, and in the financing of medical research.
</P>
<P>
   She became a dedicated lobbyist, frequently traveling to Albany
and Washington to persuade legislators to support breast cancer
issues. She spoke to President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, about
the need for more money for cancer research, and, on a panel with
Vice President Al Gore, she described her experiences as a cancer
patient. She was the sole layperson on some panels at several
medical conventions.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned last year that her cancer had spread to her
brain and bones, she intensified her activism. ``She wanted her
metastasis to have a dramatic impact on the world of breast
cancer,'' Ms. Yaker said.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of cancer researchers at the Sunnybrook and Women's
College Health Science Center in Toronto, she made a dry
presentation of metastatic medical issues vivid with her presence
and words.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her mother, Ms. Hochberg is survived by her father,
Herbert Hochberg; and two sisters, Brenda Hochberg of Boston and
Judith Hochberg of Los Alamos, N.M.

SEVERAL STREETS NEAR U.N. TO BE CLOSED OFF

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In addition to several dozen heads of state, this
year's annual debate at the U.N. General Assembly will bring even
tighter security _ and more detours for drivers and bus riders _
than usual in the wake of the American Embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, a weeklong marathon of speeches by world leaders,
begins Monday with President Clinton's address.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, police began closing off streets around the United
Nations. First Avenue between 42nd and 46th Streets is closed until
Sept. 28, as is a northbound lane on Second Avenue between 42nd and
50th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   During the Assembly's hours, the blocks between First and Second
Avenues from 42nd to 47th Streets will also be closed until Sept.
28, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that the 42nd Street exit off the
Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive would also be closed during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers include President Nelson Mandela of South Africa;
the president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, who is making his first
trip to New York, and Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, the interim
president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that the
security precautions were actually lighter than they were for the
50th anniversary of the United Nations in 1995, and urged New
Yorkers to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does create a burden for our citizens,'' Giuliani said,
``but there are tremendous benefits we get from being capital of
the world.''

A MODEL OF GOVERNOR WHITMAN'S CONSOLIDATION PLAN IN AN UNLIKELY
CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST NEW YORK, N.J. _ In this densely populated town in northern
Hudson County, where municipalities bunch up like boxcars in a
train wreck, Dan McEldowney would often sit outside Engine Company
No. 1, where he works, and watch the fire trucks from adjacent
North Bergen barreling by toward fires on that town's eastern end.
</P>
<P>
   That North Bergen's firefighters have to go through West New
York to get to sections of their own town on the Hudson River has
long been a fact of life here. But it has never made much sense to
McEldowney and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy, because we would be closer to some of those
fires than they were,'' he said, shaking his head. ``We would just
wave at them as they went past.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the encouragement of Gov. Christie Whitman's
administration, the mayors of four tightly packed municipalities in
the area have embraced a plan to consolidate fire services, to save
money and to lower or at least stabilize property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, formally introduced last Wednesday at the town council
meetings of West New York, Union City, Weehawken and North Bergen,
would cut nearly $5 million from the towns' fire service budgets,
which now total $25 million. The job now being done by 347
firefighters would eventually be done by 302, and the area's 19
firehouses and 59 pieces of equipment would eventually decrease as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has made the area the poster child of Mrs.
Whitman's campaign to encourage local governments to consolidate
services, which she says could result in a savings of about $1.2
billion and lower local property taxes statewide.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the report by her Property Tax Commission, she
rejected shifting local costs to the state, as many had urged, and
instead offered a package of $35 million in incentives for local
and regional consolidations. And at a news conference in Trenton,
she singled out Mayor Albio Sires of West New York and his fellow
mayors for their willingness to take such steps.
</P>
<P>
   In this, the most densely populated section of the nation's most
densely populated state, consolidation would seem to fly in the
face of New Jersey's history of home rule. Addition, and not
subtraction, has been the predominant municipal math _ there are
566 municipalities, 611 school districts and more than 400 local
authorities in the state's 21 counties. If this has succeeded in
forging distinct local identities, it has also contributed to the
state's having the nation's highest average local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And that northern Hudson County, of all places, should be
blazing a trail toward consolidation has prompted bemusement among
many in the state for other reasons. The area's storied past has
included such colorful characters as the political boss Frank
Hague, whose machinations made area politics as byzantine as its
boundary lines are serpentine. Patronage, turf wars and political
corruption have been the hallmark here, not government efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody plays the game, but we get the name,'' said Union
City's mayor, Rudy Garcia, lamenting the area's reputation for
corruption. ``I wasn't even born when that stuff was going on, and
the truth is that we in this area have been progressive for a long
time because our relatively low incomes have challenged us to find
savings without increasing taxes. The real question to me is, why
isn't it happening in places other than northern Hudson?''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to personalize services helps explain why
fragmentation has been more common than consolidation, many local
officials said. And once in office, those same officials have a
vested interest in maintaining their ability to control, target and
get credit for services.
</P>
<P>
   James McGreevey, the Democratic mayor of Woodbridge Township in
Middlesex County, said that while consolidation was ``good public
policy,'' few had been able to square the political risks with the
fiscal benefits. The governor's incentives had done little to alter
that situation he said, adding: ``Municipalities are not going to
rush to merge themselves out of existence. Survival is still the
prime motivation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cannon, the mayor of Old Bridge Township in Middlesex
County and chairman of the Property Tax Commission, said one
problem was that people tended to see consolidation as synonymous
with disappearing. That need not be the case, and she predicted
that economies from consolidation would wind up looking different
all over the state. As an example, she pointed to her town, where
the local school district and the various public works and fire
departments had consolidated their vehicle fuel-purchase operations
in a town-built fuel dump.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities consolidate their recycling programs at the
county level, but that is the outgrowth of another broader
consolidation in the state that left a bad taste in the mouths of
many localities. New Jersey's nearly 20-year-old program of waste
flow control, which established county entities to control waste
disposal of all of their towns, was found unconstitutional by
federal courts, but for years many local officials viewed this
consolidation as both costly and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   John Rooney, the mayor of Northvale in Bergen County and a
critic of that system, said that unlike flow control, the
consolidations encouraged under the governor's proposals were
voluntary and mirrored things that local governments have been
asking the state to help promote.
</P>
<P>
   Sires of West New York said that he and the other mayors had few
misgivings about consolidating their fire departments. Weehawken,
West New York, North Bergen and Union City are scheduled to vote
Sept. 30 on the plan, which would establish a single department
called the North Hudson Regional Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   More than 165,000 people live in the 80-by-30 block area of the
four municipalities. The idea of consolidation had been studied and
restudied since the '60s, but it was not until a new generation of
mayors, all in their 40s, began to replace longtime incumbents that
the process took hold. The other two mayors are Richard Turner of
Weehawken and Nicholas Sacco of North Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opposition of Sires' predecessor, Anthony DeFino, a
24-year incumbent, that was the last barrier to fall away when
Sires succeeded him three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legacy of the past dies hard, and in proposing a
five-member commission to run the fire services, the mayors put in
a requirement that there be a ``super majority'' of four-to-one to
approve most actions. It was a recognition, Sires said, that
politics can still be ``hardball,'' and is often a ``team sport''
with coalitions arrayed against a single opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in pressing the plan, the mayors were determined not to
alienate the politically powerful firefighters unions _ all eight
of them among the four towns _ by promising to use attrition,
retirements and buyouts in cutting personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Joseph McLean, a 17-year veteran of the West
New York Fire Department, is that the unions like the plan and
younger members of the various departments see it as opening up
chances for advancement that were few in the smaller units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, it means greater safety because under the plan there
will be twice as many firefighters responding to a fire than there
are now,'' he said. ``They aren't forcing something on anybody,
because it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the incentives announced by Mrs. Whitman was one to
promote consolidations by giving localities state funds to assist
in offering early retirement and buyout packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been heading in that direction,'' Sires said, ``but
the governor's plan for early retirement incentives is a real boost
for what we are doing.''

EDITORIAL: THE PACE OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Sept. 20:
</P>
<P>
   As the nation uneasily ponders the prospect of impeachment,
Americans should be grateful that the Constitution was conceived
when weighty decisions of state were not expected to be made
overnight. There are no time lines or deadlines in the impeachment
provisions, and the Congress would be wise not to bend the
procedures to fit the era of instant communication and lightning
news cycles. The constitutional blueprint will work if it is
followed faithfully and with due regard for the welfare of the
nation rather than that of a political party or any individual.
</P>
<P>
   That solemn obligation grows more relevant as the House of
Representatives moves inexorably toward the initiation of
impeachment proceedings. A week after the delivery and publication
of Kenneth Starr's report, with a new wave of material soon to wash
across the country, there is a collision of strategies and
constituencies in Washington. Neither side seems prepared to blink
first, at least before impeachment hearings begin or impeachment
itself is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's strategy, narrowly constructed by his
lawyers and widely rejected within his own party, is to admit
improper relations with Monica Lewinsky, deny criminal conduct and
hope that high job-approval ratings and a public distaste for
impeachment will ultimately deter Congress from removing him from
office. It brazenly defies the abundant evidence in the Starr
report that he lied under oath in his federal grand jury appearance
last month and in his testimony in the Paula Jones civil suit.
Clinton's denials are likely to seem even less tenable once the
country gets a look this week at the videotape of his grand jury
appearance and 2,800 pages of other Starr evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans seem determined to move ahead with
impeachment proceedings, convinced that Clinton broke the law and
heartened by polls that show potential Republican gains in the
midterm elections this fall. That, too, could be a miscalculation
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are courting their core constituency, the
conservative loyalists who oppose abortion, favor school prayer,
fight gun control and turn out in November to vote for their
candidates. Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, and Trent Lott, the
Senate majority leader, played unabashedly to this audience on
Friday in appearances before the Christian Coalition in Washington.
Much of this constituency would be delighted to see Clinton
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the broader tide of public opinion opposes
impeachment or resignation, even though disapproval of Clinton's
character is growing. The Republicans must be mindful about
overplaying their hand and generating a public backlash. The issue
of fairness will be pivotal. If the Republicans seem to be
punishing Clinton for partisan sport, they will surely lose the
larger battle for public support and may pay the price in the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   With this tempest roaring in Washington, the nation should rely
on the principles that have served the country well throughout its
history. One of the most important is that full disclosure and the
free flow of information are the oxygen of a democracy. In the
Clinton case, the broad interests of the body politic will be best
served by the publication of evidence assembled by Starr and new
information gathered in the weeks ahead by Congress. Only rare
exceptions may be justified to protect the privacy of individuals
peripheral to the case. The Judiciary Committee properly decided to
make public the Clinton videotape and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment proceedings may be painful and prolonged, but they
need not traumatize the nation. The constitutional blueprint is
sound and will bear the weight of this case, provided Congress
maintains some discipline and neutrality. As we have suggested
before, a settlement short of impeachment, such as Congressional
censure, would suffice if Clinton stopped mocking the law and
admitted that he lied under oath. The worst outcome for the country
would be to let this or any president stand above the law without
consequence.

ORIOLES WILL DISCUSS ENDING RIPKEN'S STREAK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Baltimore Orioles are on the verge of
elimination, and after a extremely disappointing season, they are
headed for a period of upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Roberto Alomar and first baseman Rafael Palmeiro
will become free agents after this year, and owner Peter Angelos
must select a new general manager to replace Pat Gillick, who is
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But Orioles Manager Ray Miller said the team will put off a
decision on how and when to end Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive-game
streak, which has reached 2,632. Ripken, 38, is batting .275 with
14 home runs and 61 RBIs, giving the Orioles the worst third-base
run production in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   There has been sentiment in the organization for some time to
end Ripken's streak, rest him more often and incorporate other
players.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the streak would be discussed during the off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like that to be his option,'' Miller said. ``If it's
the right thing to do'' _ meaning ending the streak _ ``it will be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles recently promoted Willis Otanez, a Class AAA third
baseman, after he had a great minor league season. But because
Ripken remains the everyday third baseman, Otanez was shifted to
right field, a position he has rarely played, and he broke his
wrist trying to make a diving catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles also promoted a young power-hitting third baseman,
Ryan Minor, for the final weeks of the season, but on Friday, Minor
started at first base, instead of third, because of Ripken's
streak.
</P>
<P>
   But maintaining Ripken's streak, and maintaining Ripken's status
as an icon, would also maintain his status as financial asset for
the club. Ripken, too, has financial reasons to continue the
streak, because his marketability is as an ironman who plays every
single game.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the club's front office said the issue of the streak
would most likely be discussed during the last week; if the Orioles
or Ripken wanted to end it without fanfare, they could do so in the
final days, when the team is playing on the road.

WITH ARRESTS, A DENOUEMENT IN THE MYSTERY OF THE PURLOINED BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, people in the book industry have assumed
that the best sellers available from New York City street vendors
at bargain prices were stolen. But publishers and booksellers said
they had no idea how these books made their way onto the sidewalk
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mystery is beginning to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   One publisher recently determined that books were disappearing
from its TriBeCa warehouse, apparently with the help of two
warehouse workers who have since been fired. When that avenue was
closed off, the police said, a longtime employee of the publisher
was offered the chance to make fast money by stealing books from
his employer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he told his bosses about the overture, and the police
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sting operation led to the arrest on Sept. 11 of
two men on charges of receiving $35,000 worth of stolen Zagat
Survey restaurant guides.
</P>
<P>
   New York City police officials said on Friday that the arrests
were part of a citywide investigation into the wholesale illegal
distribution of books.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests also represented the culmination of several months
of efforts by Tim and Nina Zagat, co-publishers of the restaurant
guides, to end an escalating problem that they estimate has cost
them $100,000 in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Zagats said they first learned from a reporter about six
months ago that heavily discounted copies of their guides were
turning up on sidewalk tables throughout Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, they said, owners of some of the stores that
carry the guides began complaining that the books, which have a
cover price of $11.95, were being sold by street vendors for as
little as $4, well below the wholesale cost of $6. Some vendors
displayed signs boasting of their low prices for Zagat surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the books had to be stolen,'' Zagat said. But under
state law, he said, they needed proof that the vendor was knowingly
selling stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it became clear that the books were coming from the Seeford
Organization warehouse on Varick Street, the only warehouse the
Zagats had used since the early 1980s. One clue was that some
street vendors were also offering copies of ``Miss Lea's Bible
Stories,'' a book that the couple had published in 1994. Copies
could only have come from the Seeford warehouse, the Zagats said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeford's president, Samuel Goldstein, said the books were
pilfered behind his back, and the Zagats said they believe him.
Goldstein fired two employees in his shipping department, including
one who had worked for him for more than nine years, but they have
not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Zagats switched warehouses. They also hired a
lawyer, Robert Tucker, with experience representing companies whose
products have been copied by counterfeiters and sold by street
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker brought in private investigators, who staked out street
vendors in various neighborhoods. At the end of August, vendors at
18 stands were photographed and given a letter informing them that
the Zagat books they were selling had been stolen, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the vendors responded by removing the books, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Zagats' decision to switch warehouses resulted in a lucky
break for them _ and for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Using an alias, Oscar Rosa, 32, a deliveryman for an office
supply company next to the Seeford warehouse, approached a longtime
Zagat Survey employee in charge of the shipping department at the
publishers' Columbus Circle offices and, describing himself as ``a
friend of a friend,'' asked to buy copies of the 1999 Zagat survey,
the police said. The Zagats and the Manhattan district attorney's
office asked that the employee remain anonymous for his protection.
</P>
<P>
   The employee reported the offer to the Zagats and arranged to
sell Rosa 3,000 copies of the 1998 guide for $3,000. (The 1999
survey does not go on sale until November.) On Sept. 11, Rosa gave
the Zagat employee _ who was wearing a taping device _ a partial
payment of $700, and Rosa's co-defendant, Timothy Cromwell, 34,
loaded the books into a van, according to a court document, as the
police videotaped the transaction from the Zagat Survey offices on
the fifth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa and Cromwell were arrested and charged with grand larceny
and receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell's lawyer, Robert W. Jones, said his client worked for
the same office supply company where Rosa was employed, and thought
he was making a routine pickup. ``He didn't even know he was doing
anything wrong,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, who has been convicted twice for armed robbery and was on
parole at the time of his arrest, according to the district
attorney's office, was released on $5,000 bail. He was arrested
again on Friday after surrendering to the police to face an
additional charge of tampering with a witness. The police said he
called the Zagat employee a snitch and told him, ``I'm going to get
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa's Legal Aid Society lawyer, Gene Pudberry, said his client
would plead not guilty. Rosa has been fired from his job.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the wake of Rosa's arrest, the Zagats say they believe that
they have solved a puzzle that had bedeviled them for months.
</P>
<P>
   They say they have spent $20,000 on the investigation but
maintain that they had to act to avoid giving the impression that
they were dumping books on the street because of poor sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to spend whatever it took to dry it up,'' Ms.
Zagat said. ``It wasn't just because we were trying to do the best
thing for society. It was also because we felt it was really
damaging our brand to have our books out there on the street.''

CONGREGANTS UPROOTED BY FIRE FIND HOME FOR HOLY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only three weeks ago, flames engulfed Central
Synagogue in midtown Manhattan, badly damaging the 126-year-old
architectural landmark.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, the synagogue's members will have a huge,
but temporary, house of worship, big enough to fit all 3,500
congregants. For the first time in memory, the entire congregation
will be able to honor the High Holy Days of Judaism together,
starting Sunday night with Rosh ha-Shanah, the first day of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've been able to pray together in one
place at one time,'' said Laurence Rubinstein, a rabbi and
congregant.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary synagogue is the Seventh Regiment Armory on the
Upper East Side _ a cavernous space covering an entire block at
66th Street and Park Avenue. The armory was the only place in the
region that was available for 10 days and big enough to fit
thousands of worshipers. Rubinstein, for one, sees a ``wonderful
irony'' in the site: ``We are going to pray in a building meant for
weapons and military drills.''
</P>
<P>
   But before any praying can begin, Gov. George Pataki issued a
declaration of emergency to suspend a law that bars the use of
public spaces by religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   And the task of turning a drill hall into a synagogue has been
enormous, requiring the help of hundreds of people: from buildings
and fire inspectors to a high-society party designer to a Lutheran
mover and a 6-year-old boy who donated his tooth fairy money.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you create an environment for a congregation that feels
dislocated at sea?,'' said Peter Rubinstein, Central Synagogue's
senior rabbi. ``How do you make a place that feels proper and
spiritual?''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with an impossibly tight deadline. Until midnight
Saturday night, there was an antiques show at the armory. Robert
Isobel, who arranges expensive parties, and his staff can not begin
work until 2 Sunday morning. That gives them 18 hours to set up the
pulpit, lectern and ark, 3,800 folding chairs, and the carpets and
30-foot-long curtains around the armory's perimeter. There will be
a sound system and video screens projecting the services to
congregation members sitting in the back or on the sides.
</P>
<P>
   The armory design, said Rabbi Rubinstein, ``will evoke as much a
sense of our own sanctuary as possible.'' The floor is to be
carpeted in dark red, and the interior will be surrounded by dark
red curtains, allowing congregants to focus on the rabbi and the
ark. Some fire-damaged pieces will be carried over: four heavy
wooden pews and the ornately carved pulpit, as well as prayer
books. The five Torahs _ a synagogue's most sacred and essential
objects _ were undamaged because they were being stored outside
Central Synagogue at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll use the scarred pulpit, and use the water-stained
mantels to cover the Torah,'' said Rabbi Rubinstein. ``That's OK.
Life isn't beautiful all the time but it's still to be
celebrated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But many other items were donated by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The classical-style organ, for instance, was lent by a Long
Island organ shop. Claire Arnold, co-owner of the shop, even
persuaded a devout Lutheran mover to deliver it on Sunday.The huge
ark, which contains the five Torahs, came from a synagogue just
outside New York City. And a downtown Manhattan manufacturer of
religious objects contributed holders and mantels of fine fabric
for the Torahs.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue has bought hundreds of new prayer books, yarmulkes
and prayer shawls. A trailer parked outside will provide facilities
for the men's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   All this is costing more than $200,000, Rabbi Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the initial shock of the fire has passed, many
congregants are feeling philosophical and excited about the idea of
worshiping in the huge makeshift synagogue. Judith Hertz, the
congregation's secretary, said: ``The idea we could all come
together lends a certain power and energy to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Old habits, said Edward Skloot, director of the Surdna
Foundation in Manhattan, are being shaken. For one thing, people
will not be sitting in the pews reserved by the amount of a
family's donation. ``We will have to mix and mingle and sit next to
new people. It's a remarkable way to begin something new.
Everybody's going to be talking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, his 15-year-old son and the chaplain of the youth group,
said that people are becoming closer, more of a community. ``It was
devastating,'' he said. ``But a lot of people that usually only
come once or twice a year are really connecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Rubinstein said that this new year will be ``very powerful
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one we would have chosen,'' he said. ``You can't
choose the hand that's dealt you. But you can make the best of
it.''

HOME INSPECTIONS FOR MEDICAID SEEKERS STIR DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lilia Cuji did not dare ask for welfare last summer
when she ventured inside the Jamaica, Queens, outpost of the city's
Human Resources Administration, a six-story brick building wedged
between Caribbean delis and a topless bar called Dreams. Ms. Cuji,
who immigrated from Ecuador six years ago, applied only for
Medicaid health-insurance benefits for her 2-year-old son, and she
provided all the documents necessary to prove his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But in a little-noticed pilot project that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani plans to expand to the rest of the city next year, the
Jamaica center required something more of anyone seeking Medicaid:
a home investigation by the same city unit that screens welfare
applicants for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The two investigators who went to Ms. Cuji's apartment on Aug.
5, 1997, examined the same documents she had shown at the Medicaid
office, she said, and sharply questioned her about her lack of a
green card. Then they walked into her bedroom, peered into her
closet and spotted the evidence they later used to recommend
rejection: a pair of blue jeans _ men's jeans, they insisted _
hanging among her dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cuji's son was one of more than 4,480 Medicaid applicants
recommended for rejection by Eligibility Verification Review
investigators. That figure represented 36 percent of the applicants
who underwent home investigations between October 1996 and June 30,
1998, according to city figures.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for denial include an applicant's failure to keep an
appointment with investigators, providing false information, or
withholding information about income, resources or living
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say home investigations are a reasonable way to
screen out people who lie on their Medicaid applications. But many
advocates and health-care providers assert that home investigations
for Medicaid raise a frightening and unnecessary new barrier to
health care for many low-income children and adults, just when
federal and state officials are trying to make it easier for
families to obtain government-sponsored health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, New York City appears to be alone in imposing such a
requirement, federal health officials said; 33 states allow
application by mail.
</P>
<P>
   To advocates for the poor, it illustrates how a get-tough
approach in welfare is spilling over into health-care programs,
despite a congressional decision to preserve Medicaid as a federal
entitlement and to uncouple it from cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the city is doing is in direct conflict with what's going
on in health-insurance policy and health-care policy,'' said Suri
Duitch, a health specialist at the Citizens' Committee for
Children, a nonprofit advocacy organization in New York. ``It just
doesn't make sense to be limiting access in somewhat arbitrary
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources
Administration, defended the investigations, calling them a way to
ensure that applicants told the truth about residence and income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program integrity initiative was established to make sure
that only eligible people receive Medicaid,'' she said. ``People
who don't need it and aren't eligible for the service, we don't
want them on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sproles said she could not discuss the case of Ms. Cuji, who
says that the jeans in her closet were her own. But Ms. Sproles
added: ``If they based their conclusion just on pants without
further investigation, that would not be the general rule. You
would investigate that further. If the investigation should find
out that the woman has misrepresented her situation and is living
with her spouse, you could understand their drawing that
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   About one out of three Medicaid applications is rejected
citywide, advocates say. The 36 percent rejection rate by home
investigators in the pilot project represents a 3 percentage point
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel costs for the city's pilot project in Jamaica and
Bushwick, Brooklyn, will be $585,000 this year, officials said.
Citywide costs are projected at $6.2 million for the investigation
unit and another $715,000 for additional Medicaid employees.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for poor people acknowledge that the investigations
will allow the city to uncover genuine cases of fraud, but question
how these can be worth the cost. Some say the home investigations
are reminiscent of the indignities of welfare in the early 1960s,
when inspectors routinely poked through recipients' medicine
cabinets looking for men's toiletries and staged midnight raids to
see whether female welfare recipients were living with men.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the chilling effect of such examinations, they say,
the Medicaid application process is too difficult and intimidating
for many who are eligible, especially the disabled, elderly and
mentally ill, and illegal immigrants applying for their American
children, like Ms. Cuji.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after little people, and it doesn't seem fair when
there's a lot more fraud and abuse at other levels,'' said Mark
Laster, a specialist in managed and geriatric care at New Hope
Guild, a nonprofit network of clinics for the mentally ill in
Queens and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The city and the state equally share half the costs of Medicaid
and the federal government pays the other half. Last year, 414,000
people who were not on welfare were certified for Medicaid by the
city, and their medical expenses totaled $5.1 billion, according to
state figures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money goes to institutions that bypass the new
investigation unit, however, like hospitals billing retroactively
for inpatient care, and nursing homes at which Medicaid patients
include elderly people who have legally transferred their assets to
their children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To state and federal officials, who have been trying to stem
recent declines in Medicaid enrollment and to reduce the welfare
stigma associated with government health coverage, the Jamaica
project and its expansion came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the State Department of
Health, said the city's use of welfare-fraud workers to screen
people seeking health care constituted a change requiring a formal
filing with the State Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Wescott, a spokeswoman for that office, said a letter
from the city proposing to expand the pilot to eight or nine new
sites was received late last month, and was being reviewed to
determine if it was consistent with department regulations meant to
ensure that eligible children and adults receive needed medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent August morning, the applicants who crowded the
Medicaid office in Jamaica included Rosalina Bulatao, 77, who said
she had worked as a home health aide until she suffered a stroke
last year, but now could not afford to buy blood-pressure
medication, costing $50 a month, on her monthly Social Security
stipend of $518.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bulatao had no complaints about the two investigators who
had spent about 20 minutes in her home politely reviewing documents
she had already shown in two previous visits to the Medicaid
office. The problem, she said, was that the Medicaid card she had
finally received in the mail still had not been activated.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the home investigation had added a new obstacle
to many others. One woman, speaking on the condition that only her
first name, Minerva, be used, said this was the third day she had
been forced to take time from her $6-an-hour job in a supermarket
to reapply for Medicaid for herself and her sons.
</P>
<P>
   Her first Medicaid application had been rejected, she said,
because she took nine days instead of seven to return a form from
her employers stating that they did not provide health insurance.
Because she was working when investigators came to her home, she
said, the resulting denial for failure to cooperate delayed a fresh
application for another month.
</P>
<P>
   Minerva, 27, said she could not afford medical care for her
children, an 8-year-old with asthma and a 3-year-old whose care at
the St. Joseph's Hospital emergency room recently left her with a
bill for $180. She said she and the children originally lost
Medicaid coverage in May after her public assistance case was
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I still have two asthma pumps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To some analysts, the kind of hard-line approach used to deter
welfare fraud can backfire when applied to health care, in part
because preventive care is often much cheaper than trips to the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 295,000 children in the state and 4.5 million children
nationwide are now eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled,
according to estimates by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social
research organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cuji's case illustrates the contradictions that can result
when health and welfare policies pull in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after investigators discovered the blue jeans, Betty
Perez, an advocate at the Center for Children and Families, a
nonprofit maternal and child health program in Queens, called the
Medicaid information line to check on the family's Medicaid status.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez said she was told that Ms. Cuji's son had been denied
``because they found men's clothing,'' but that Ms. Cuji herself
had active Medicaid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation? Ms. Cuji was pregnant, and under state policies
intended to lower infant mortality, her prenatal clinic had been
able to process her application directly, bypassing the Jamaica
center.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Perez said, it took another six months and a new
application before the boy was finally enrolled. There was never
any legal basis for denying his application, Ms. Perez said. Even
if the boy's father had been living with them, it is unlikely that
the family income would have exceeded Medicaid limits.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cuji, who recently lost her job in a nail salon, is
afraid her son and the new baby will lose Medicaid again when she
has to apply for yearly recertification.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, the children's father, who has no green card and
works irregularly in day-labor demolition jobs, recently rejoined
the family after being injured, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' she said in Spanish. ``I only apply for
my children. Why do they have the power to go into my home asking
questions about my intimate life?''

DE LA HOYA STANDS AND FIGHTS, SENDING CHAVEZ TO HIS CORNER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It was not the outcome that anyone expected. Great
Mexican champions do not go out on their stools. They go out on
their shields. But Julio Cesar Chavez, a six-time world champion
and arguably the greatest boxer in Mexico history, quit on his
stool at the end of the eighth round against Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez went out with a golden parachute, earning $6 million for
the loss. And De La Hoya (29-0) retained his World Boxing Council
welterweight championship with the victory on Friday night before a
screaming throng of 17,125 fans at the Thomas and Mack Center here.
</P>
<P>
   More ignominious than the loss for Chavez (101-3-2) was that De
La Hoya beat him at his own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar fought a stupidly brilliant fight,'' said Lou DiBella,
HBO's senior vice president of programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stupid of Oscar to stand right in front of Chavez and
trade punches with him. But he knew he was going to have to do that
in order to ever get Chavez's respect and the respect of the
Mexican fans. They wouldn't have accepted a victory by him any
other way.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's full frontal assault against Chavez was against the
wishes of his corner. Trainers Robert Alcazar and Gil Clancy wanted
De La Hoya to outbox Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans in the stands, many of them Chavez fans from
Mexico, wanted to see De La Hoya trade punches with Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught up in the whole event,'' De La Hoya said. ``So,
for a few rounds I went toe-to-toe and fought his fight. I'm sure
the fans enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's face paid the price. He wore dark sunglasses after
the fight to hide the large swelling around his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   A Chavez fan yelled to De La Hoya at the post-fight news
conference to take off the sunglasses. De La Hoya said he couldn't
because he was doing a promotion for the sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez landed a highest percentage of punches against De La Hoya
(47 percent) than any of De La Hoya's previous 28 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth and deciding round when a total of 173 punches
were thrown, Chavez landed 38-of-90 punches and De La Hoya landed
45-of-83. They took a toll on Chavez, who could be seen shaking his
head ``no'' in his corner before the fight was stopped by his
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, Chavez walked around the ring waving his
glove as if to say goodbye.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps his corner decided to stop the fight because they didn't
want to see Chavez battered and embarrassed over the final four
rounds. Chavez, his lower lip split open and blackened with dried
blood, appeared at a post-fight news conference set up in the ring
and vehemently denied any involvement in the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make something clear,'' Chavez said. ``I wanted to
continue to fight. My corner was the one that stopped the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   That was contrary to what Chavez told De La Hoya in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he did,'' De La Hoya said. ``He told me: `You beat
me. I don't want anymore.' I was more satisfied that he quit.
Believe me when I tell you he quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he quit in this fight, Chavez announced that he wasn't
giving up the game.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to fight once more at 140 pounds and then call
it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum, president of Top Rank Boxing, said he will
try to make a fight between Chavez and Vince Phillips, the
International Boxing Federation junior welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   As for De La Hoya, he has a Nov. 21 date in the same arena
against Ike Quartey, the former World Boxing Association
welterweight champion who is nicknamed ``The Bazooka.'' He didn't
get that moniker by handing out love taps, so De La Hoya will
probably be more cautious against a younger former champion than he
was against an aging legend.

HYPERION USING WORLD'S LARGEST MAINSAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (lb) 
 By CAITLIN KELLY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest mainsail ever made flew from New York to Amsterdam,
the Netherlands, last week, a staggering 1,040 pounds of high-tech
monster strapped to two pallets in an airplane cargo hold. It is
the mainsail for Hyperion, the $30 million, 155-foot vessel built
for the founder of Silicon Graphics and co-founder of Netscape, Jim
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The boat, equipped with four sails worth $350,000 _ main,
gennaker, jib and staysail _ will start sea trials in early
November off the Dutch coast. It is anyone's guess whether the
sails will actually work. None this large has ever been made.
</P>
<P>
   The sails are constructed of cutting-edge materials: two layers
of Spectra, which is used for bulletproof vests, sandwiching thin
strips of carbon fiber that is more often used in solid form for
everything from golf clubs to the wings and tail of jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   While software enabled testing of a model of the mast and sails
in an analytical wind tunnel, their use on this scale is relatively
unknown, said Peter Mahr, the president of the firm that produced
the sails, North Cloth, a division of North Sails in Milford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, it's scary for us, too,'' Mahr said. ``If anything
goes wrong, we'll suffer along with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who envisioned his boat as a working showpiece of
nautical computer integration, was initially eager to have 3DL
sails, the most advanced in the world, which North makes only in
its Minden, Nev., plant.
</P>
<P>
   There, sails are created from spun threads of high-tech,
low-stretch fibers sandwiched between laminate on huge machines.
But Hyperion's sails were simply too big for this method: The main
is 5,400 square feet, the jib 4,462 square feet, the gennaker
12,701 square feet and the staysail 1,560 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the sails were made the traditional way, laid out on
the floor of North's Milford sail loft, and run through the loft's
six $24,000 sewing machines. The sails are so large and heavy that
workers had to wear gloves to avoid cutting their hands on the
edges, and back braces in order to drag the heavy pieces forward
through the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Sewing needles had to be air-cooled in order to puncture the
tough material. The stitches are zigzagged in double rows for
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Not every job North undertakes is so complex. Named for founder
Lowell North, an engineer who used to test sailcloth durability by
flying strips of it on his car antenna, North Sails is today the
industry leader, with annual sales of $34 million. It supplies the
world's top racers with custom-designed sails for the Whitbread and
America's Cup, but also sells ready-made sails for tiny Lasers and
Sunfish; dinghies represent 15 percent of its business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   North has supplied sails for the Spanish navy and even equipped
the Mary Rose, a square-rigged bark based next door in Bridgeport,
Conn., with sails made of Oceanus, a combination of polyester yarns
that are twice the strength of traditional cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some smaller sailmakers who buy material only from
manufacturers, North also designs and makes some of its own cloth.
(Cloth is somewhat of a misnomer; today's materials are all
synthetics, highly processed polyethylene of varying strengths.)
</P>
<P>
   Even a sail that costs $175,000, as does the one now being built
for the sailor and balloonist Steve Fossett's next adventure, a
multihull round-the-world race, isn't guaranteed against wear or
breakage. Many of the materials, costing up to $100 a pound, remain
highly sensitive to ultraviolet rays and only last for 60 hours of
high-level racing.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion isn't a racing boat, so that isn't an issue for it.
There is a more basic question: Will the sails do their job?
</P>
<P>
   Scott Zebny, a sales consultant for North Sails, spent two years
on the project, working closely with skipper Allan Prior, Dutch
builder Wolter Huisman and his team of engineers, and with the
chief engineer, Jaap Kwakman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all worked as a team to make sure the mast, sails, boom
and handling equipment all fit and work together, and hopefully
don't break under load. The loads with a boat and sail plan this
large pretty much go off the charts because there isn't anything
else to compare them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the first to build something this big is exciting, but
scary as well. I hope we did our math OK''

   PETER GILMOUR, the top-ranked skipper on the world match-racing
circuit, is expected to compete this week in the $80,000 CIGNA
Knickerbocker Cup in New York Harbor. The yachting event will
include 16 teams from nine countries competing in identical 35-foot
sailboats known as J/105s. Other sailors in the round-robin regatta
include two prominent America's Cup skippers: ED BAIRD, helmsman
for the New York Yacht Club's 1999-2000 cup team; and PETER
HOLMBERG, skipper for Team Caribbean of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The four-person crews will compete in races that extend from
Wednesday through next Sunday on a course between the North Cove
Yacht Harbor in Lower Manhattan, in New York, and the Statue of
Liberty.

 PRINCETON DEDICATES NEW STADIUM WITH 6-0 WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ The home team scored on its first two drives
in its new home Saturday, and went on to dedicate Princeton Stadium
with a 6-0 victory over Cornell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' ace place-kicker, Alex Sierk, made field goals of 47
and 37 yards following impressive drives, and that was good enough.
Perhaps the team in orange, black and white was inspired by the
first capacity crowd at a Princeton home game in four decades.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 27,800 tickets, bargains at $5 each, were sold and most of
the seats occupied for the unveiling of the $45 million stadium,
the Ivy League's first new football facility in 14 years and only
its second in 71 years. It was the largest crowd at a Princeton
game since 38,000 saw the 1989 game with Yale in Palmer Stadium,
which had 45,750 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The sparkling new stadium was more exciting than the game, a
dull one because the defenses limited big plays and scoring
threats. Dropped passes on both sides also crimped the offenses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornell's only scoring threat came late in the first half, and
failed. A 48-yard completion from Mike Hood to wide receiver Kevin
Farese brought the Big Red to the Princeton 16-yard line. But
penalties and losses followed before John McCombs' 27-yard field
goal attempt went wide.
</P>
<P>
   A Cornell drive ended in the last minute of the fourth quarter
with an interception by Tigers cornerback Gerry Wilson at his
21-yard line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornell had something new too in Pete Mangurian, the Big Red's
first-year head coach. Mangurian spent the last 10 seasons as an
assistant in the National Football League, and he has on his staff
Bill Arnsparger, head coach of the Giants from 1974 to 1976. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last season Princeton won five of 10 games, but only one in Ivy
competition, against Yale. Cornell was 5-5 and 3-4. Expectations
are that both will finish in the middle of the league this season.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton Stadium, which may get a new name should a major donor
come forth, went up in 18 months on the site of Palmer Stadium,
which was built in 1914 and was deemed beyond the point of repair
by engineering studies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the first new Ivy facility to be built since 1984, when
Columbia's Lawrence Wien Stadium opened. The other six were built
between 1903 and 1927. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Princeton, officials at Harvard and Pennsylvania
chose to keep their stadiums and have poured thousands of dollars
into their ongoing rehabilitations. Harvard Stadium, 95 years old,
is the nation's oldest. Penn's Franklin Field, in its present
conformation, dates to 1921. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the kickoff all former Princeton football players
present, 280 of them, paraded onto the field and spread over it
from one goal to the other. The youngest were those from the 1997
team, which played all of its 10 games on the road while the
stadium was being built, and the oldest from the 1927 squad. They
marched beneath huge orange and black banners designating their
years. &QL;

YANKEE PLAYOFF SALES TEST LOYALTY AND LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one told The Ant about The Random Number Wristband
Distribution Procedure. So when Antoine ``The Ant'' Hill and his
friend Lee Boogie heard that Yankees postseason tickets would go on
sale Saturday morning, they arrived Thursday night to be first in
line.
</P>
<P>
   For 36 hours, they crouched, sat, slept and curled up on the
cold concrete outside Yankee Stadium. By Saturday morning, tickets
weren't all they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparation H,'' Boogie said. ``You sit on that concrete all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet after all their devotion and discomfort, Boogie and Hill
were not assured of getting tickets. Why? As a means of
discouraging ticket scalping and preventing a stampede on the
ticket booths (as happened in 1996), the Yankees were using a
random distribution system that rewards luck as much as loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the playoff tickets are already taken. But the 2,000 or
so fans who waited Saturday morning in 19 police crowd control pens
were hoping for a chance at the limited, but unspecified, number of
tickets available to the public. They could choose either a blue
wristband for Division Series tickets or a red wristband for League
Championship tickets. Each wristband was numbered, and tickets
would be sold after a number was picked in a random drawing later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Donald Simpson, 38, a member of the Section 39
``Bleacher Creatures,'' got wristband No. 1111 and the chance to
buy as many as four tickets. But if the number selected in the
random drawing was 1112, then Simpson would be considered last in
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, in previous years, has always accommodated us because
we're an integral part of the stadium,'' he said, speaking of the
Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner. ``Without us, it's
like you woke up and you're not wearing your underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bleacher Creatures sit in the cheapest outfield seats. They
chant the name of outfielder Bernie Williams until he tips his cap.
They call new initiates CITs, for ``Creatures in Training.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hill and Boogie arrived Thursday, no one else appeared
until Friday, when Dirk Bernold and Kurt Snyder, both 26, arrived.
Others, like Simpson, began arriving as well. Even when everyone
learned it was not first come, first served, they stayed anyway.
The police prohibited tents, sleeping bags (though some people
brought them anyway), chairs, coolers and alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stupid experience,'' grumbled Snyder, a student at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Then, explaining why he
stayed: ``I was too lazy to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment was hard to come by. The Friday morning crash of a
freight train on the nearby Metro-North tracks provided some
excitement. When newspaper photographers arrived late Friday night,
people responded with what Bernold called the ``paparazzi'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You killed Lady Di!'' the crowd chanted. ``Bring back Lady
Di!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bernold reached page 480 of James Michener's 1,130 page
``Hawaii.'' Snyder concentrated on ``The Catcher in the Rye.'' One
group of fans managed, miraculously, to sleep almost without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Snyder stretched, then unwrapped the remains
of a Wendy's chicken sandwich from the night before. He ate it for
breakfast. It was no comfort that the fans who came Saturday
morning had just as good a chance to buy tickets. And they smelled
better, too.
</P>
<P>
   What all the waiting did provide, though, was time for fans like
Simpson to assess the greater meaning of the Yankee universe. ``Oh,
it was terrible,'' he said of the concrete. ``But being so close to
home _ Yankee Stadium _ it was warm from that.''
</P>
<P>
   His father first took him to Yankee Stadium in 1967 at the end
of Mickey Mantle's career. So when the Yankees made the World
Series in 1996, he took his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Simpson said the Bleacher Creatures are desperate. He
cannot imagine a Yankees postseason game without himself. He said
there are more than 100 Bleacher Creatures, and they insist on
sitting in Section 39. ``Creatures sitting all over the place isn't
good,'' he said. ``We've got to be united to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday morning, Simpson called on a power even higher than
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody say a prayer for the Creatures,'' he solemnly
intoned. ``We need them.''

A BIG ONE THAT OFTEN GETS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GREG THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida Keys tarpon is an impressive, intimidating animal.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the foredeck of a flats skiff, 40 feet of fly line
coiled near an angler's feet, a 3/0 tarpon fly resting in one hand,
a 12-weight flyrod clutched in the other, an angler must ask
himself, ``Do I really want to hook that fish?'' when a
hundred-plus pounder swims by. Instead of casting, he might
consider dropping the rod and securing a life vest.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpon, by virtue of their size and disposition, are capable of
swamping small, shallow-water flats skiffs. Large tarpon have an
ability to jump _ as high as 10 feet and up to 20 feet horizontally
_ and some anglers have endured a giant tarpon in their lap. But
most anglers are willing to take that chance; it is said that a
giant tarpon is the consummate game fish and that an angler who
catches one may never feel equal elation. At the moment of capture,
some may have one word for the world: perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The world-record tarpon, a 283-pound Goliath, was landed in
Venezuela in 1956. However, an estimated 350-pound tarpon was
caught by commercial fishermen at Hillsboro Inlet in Florida in
1912. That fish measured 8 feet 2 inches long. Typically, a
six-foot tarpon weighs about 100 pounds. A seven-footer goes about
200 pounds and a 300-pounder measures eight feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   There are several places in the world where flyfishers harbor a
chance to hook a fish meeting those dimensions and one of those
spots is the Florida Keys, where fish that average 60 to 110 pounds
invade the shallow, fertile flats each May and June. That is
exactly where my father, Fred, and I found ourselves in June, fully
revved up for our first saltwater fly-fishing excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the late 1800s, giant tarpon, those fish that range
between 70 and 300 pounds, were considered not catchable on
conventional sport tackle, let alone on a flyrod. But, in 1898
Edward Von Hofe landed a 210-pound tarpon on sport gear. By 1933, a
136-pound fish had been taken by George Bonbright near Long Key,
Fla. In 1967, Stu Apt landed a 151-pound tarpon that ranked as the
largest ever taken on a flyrod.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, 1980s and through this decade, advances in
fly-fishing equipment, including reliable monofilament leaders and
fast-action graphite rods, led a wave of fly-fishers to pursue
tarpon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tempted to say those advances swayed the odds in favor of
the angler, but that simply is not true. Each large tarpon tests
equipment and an angler's ability to the max. Some experts estimate
that, even today, anglers lose nine of every 10 tarpon hooked.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget my first tarpon, although I must admit, it
wasn't one of the big boys. We were motoring out of a channel, 15
minutes into my inaugural day chasing saltwater fish, when I
spotted several large shadows stalking across the shallow flats. We
cut the engine and just before those silver slabs reached the edge
of the flat, I cast a fly over the grass, let it rest momentarily,
then stripped the pattern twice. A fish peeled out of the pack,
hesitated, then engulfed the fly. I hollered gleefully and set the
hook. As the line came taunt, the tarpon felt the sting of a hook
and leaped into the air, just the tip of its tail scraping the
ocean's surface. I let out another scream, kept solid pressure on
my eight-weight rod, and settled in for a fight. Fifteen minutes
later, I stood on the stern, cradling a 60-pound silver king, a
grin extending from ear to ear, confidence beaming from my bones.
</P>
<P>
   There are many epic tarpon battles to relate, some won by the
fish, others, much less often, by the angler. Unfortunately,
battles lost are often more memorable than those that end with a
tarpon in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The depression involved in losing a large tarpon cannot be
overemphasized. That mental roulette stems from difficulties that
must be overcome just to get a fly in front of a tarpon's mouth,
let alone to achieve a take.
</P>
<P>
   During our trip, I repeatedly stumbled on the rocking boat,
gathered my footing and attempted to shoot line through the guides,
trying desperately to punch that tarpon fly and a 12-weight line
through the tropic wind.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the running line wrapped around my sandal's Velcro
strap or looped around the anchor cleat. My cast might stop dead in
the air, snap back toward the boat, short, again, of my target. All
incredibly frustrating, especially because our host, an art
publisher, had bought my plane ticket from Seattle to accompany my
father, the artist, on a reference-gathering trip. We needed
close-ups and underwater shots of giant tarpon and I, the hot-shot
Rocky Mountain fly-fisher, was supposed to catch them. As our trip
dwindled, I realized that I'd failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, on the last day of our nine-day stay we encountered
a huge school of tarpon, maybe 100 or more fish, all balled up in
the shallows.
</P>
<P>
   I was using a standard 3/0 tarpon fly, as I had engaged the
entire trip. But now, instead of inspecting the streamer, those
tarpon just whirled away from my offering. Time was running out,
the sun rising higher in the sky, our departure imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic, I pilfered my fly box and tied on a size-6 crazy
Charlie _ a bonefish fly of all things.
</P>
<P>
   I backcast, shot the line and stopped the fly about 10 yards to
my side of a pod. The fish charged, I saw the telltale underwater
silver flash, then felt the line tighten. That tarpon made a quick,
30-yard run that terrified me (when would the line go slack, I
wondered), leaped into the air, then settled back into the glassy
sea to test my endurance.
</P>
<P>
   I worked that fish for 20 or 30 minutes, bowing the rod when it
jumped. Then, the leader parted and my big tarpon slid over some
dark turtle grass and disappeared. We reluctantly headed home.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m. we were strapped into our seats, settled on the
tarmac, our Florida Keys trip hitting its end. I engaged a man in
conversation before the props fired up, and told him about my
experience: about a first-day tarpon, a permit hooked and lost, six
tarpon takes one morning, and the crazy Charlie. The man, who had
fished extensively around the tropics with a flyrod, told me
bluntly, ``If I were you, I'd change my flight plans in Dallas.
Don't fly to Seattle. Go straight to Las Vegas. You're the luckiest
man alive.''

   SHERMOBIT _ Robert W. Sherman, the first president of The Palm
Beach Post and its sister publications after they were acquired by
Cox Enterprises, died early Saturday. He was 88. Mr. Sherman
devoted 50 years to the newspaper business, starting as a
classified ad salesman for the Dayton Daily News in 1928 at age 18.
He retired Jan. 1, 1979, as executive vice president and a member
of the board of directors of the Atlanta-based chain which now owns
16 daily newspapers -- including ones in Atlanta, Dayton and Austin
_ and 11 weeklies. (O'Meilia/Cooper, Palm Beach Post). 15-18. WITH

   CLINTON-NEWT _ Washington _ In another time, Newt Gingrich would
have relished an all-out attack on President Clinton as much as any
Republican in the House of Representatives. He would have scoffed
at party elders who tried to rein in his speeches on the House
floor, speeches that first made his national reputation. But as the
Republican Speaker of the House, Gingrich is managing the most
delicate issue of his long career in Congress and he is keenly
aware _ unlike at some moments in the past _ that people are
parsing his every word. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   CHECK-CASHERS _ WASHINGTON _ Check-cashing stores, once thought
of as part of the fringe banking community, are taking a step
towards the economic mainstream as an unintended consequence of a
federal program to pay benfits through electronic transfers rather
than by paper checks. U.S. Treasury officials estimate that as much
as $16 billion worth of government checks every year are sent to
citizens who do not have a bank. In an effort to grab a piece of
that business, the check-cashing industry and major banks have
formed an economic alliance that allows check-cashing stores to
begin handing out ATM cards to the ``unbanked'' starting next
month. This is yet another step in creating dual banking systems:
one for the affluent and a separate more expensive alternative for
low-income families. (Shepard and Jaspin, Cox News Service).

   SCOTLAND-SCOTCH _ GLEN LIVET, Scotland _ Robbie Hughes casts a
stainless steel cannister into the small natural pool, breaking the

the cold, crystaline water into glasses. ``Take a taste,'' he tells
his visitors. When the water is consumed, he opens the doors behind
a cabinet built by the water and pulls out a half full bottle of
pale, golden Tormore single malt Scotch. ``Now,'' he says,'' Take a
taste of this.'' For 60 years the rainwater has been filtered and
amended by the hills before bubbling up in the cold springs of Burn
Auchmochsen. As it passes through the rocky layers, gaining
minerals and peat, the water emerges just a little bit shy of being
this drink. ``Best bar in the world, isn't it,'' Hughes says
without expecting or getting any argument. It is also just about
the only place to get a taste of Tormore. Despite a growing
American demand for the special, distinct flavors found only in
single malt Scotches, modern economics are leading to the
extinction of single malt brands by the dozens. (Roughton, Cox News

   NUWAUBIAN _ A separatist-group leader who relocated his base
from Brooklyn, New York to a farm in rural Georgia has been linked
to a wide range of criminal activity, including the re-activated
investigation of a 1979 assasination-style killing of a Brooklyn
community activist. Dwight York, also known as Dr. Malachi Z. York
and formerly known as Asi Muhammed, was from the late 1970s until
1993 the leader of a Muslim-oriented group called Ansaru Allah
Community, comprised of about 700 members living in a community of
about 20 to 30 apartment homes in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.
York, 53, purchased a 400-acre farm in Putnam County in 1993 and
moved there with about 150 members of his group, which he re-named
the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors. Though the group has kept a
relatively low profile since the move, Putnam County officials and
local black leaders have recently expressed concerns that York and
the Nuwaubians -- nearly all of whom are black -- are attempting to
stir up racial hostility and to build up their political power, to
the point where he can either dominate local politics or set up a
separate governmental entity. (Osinski, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 100-120.

<P>
   After a rocky and sometimes violent start, American colleges
were so swiftly and quietly integrated that a miracle slipped by
unnoticed. What the country reaped is partly explained in a new
report from Princeton University Press, showing that a mere 20
years of affirmative action at the elite universities has
integrated the professions, dramatically expanded the black middle
class _ and dismantled a racial caste system that was 400 years in
the making.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative ideologues discount this progress out of hostility
to affirmative action. But some civil rights activists minimize
progress too, fearful that celebrating it would suggest that the
struggle for justice is finished. This preference for pessimism has
dominated the debate and clearly shaped the latest study from the
Southern Education Foundation, which monitors the 19 Southern and
border states that once maintained segregated college systems.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Miles to Go,'' the SEF's report focuses on public
colleges in those states _ and finds worries aplenty, with little
cause for joy. Reading the grim headlines that described this
report, one might conclude that the North was gliding toward racial
equality while the South stubbornly stifled it. But a fair
examination of the facts shows that the South has indeed made great
strides.
</P>
<P>
   The SEF report makes the legitimate point that African-Americans
in the South go to college at a lower rate than whites. The report
also notes the need for more financial aid, given that many
Southern black families earn less than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the SEF loads its case by limiting its analysis to public
colleges _ when almost a third of black students in the South go to
private schools. It also focuses on comparisons between the black
enrollment rates in Southern public colleges and the percentage of
blacks in the general population, rather than on the more
meaningful comparison between black enrollment rates in the South
and the same rates elsewhere in the country. The unintended message
here is that 25 years of federal intervention on behalf of
affirmative action has made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that its mission was being undermined, the United Negro
College Fund issued a blistering rebuttal through its policy arm,
the Frederick Patterson Research Institute, saying that the SEF had
``consistently selected data that would show negative ... while
ignoring positive data.'' The Patterson data show that black
enrollment and graduation numbers have risen steadily each year in
every state, including the states that made up the Confederacy.
Black enrollment at traditionally white schools in the South has
grown 35 percent over the last 20 years _ about 10 percentage
points more than the nation as a whole. The number of bachelor's
degrees awarded to blacks at white public institutions has grown
107 percent in the South _ more than three times the growth rate in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The South resisted integration longer than the North. But when
major research universities are ranked by percentage of black
enrollment, 13 of the top 20 are in states covered by the SEF
report. Of the 13, the University of Alabama-Birmingham has the
highest percentage of black enrollment. Twenty-two percent of its
students are black and its black doctoral enrollment has risen 133
percent in the last decade. Also on the list are Emory University,
Georgia Tech, the University of North Carolina, the University of
Virginia and Louisiana State University. The SEF should have
studied how these schools succeeded so that other schools might
replicate the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The SEF intended to bring national attention to a serious
problem. The same Southern states that created Jim Crow college
systems _ and starved the black public colleges _ have responded to
desegregation lawsuits by raising standards at the black colleges
while ignoring the dismal primary and secondary schools that make
it impossible for the bulk of Southern blacks to qualify under the
new standards. Though grave, this problem is hardly limited to the
South. State systems all over the North _ including historically
liberal New York _ are inching toward policies that will shut out
black and Latino students. Unless the states wake up, the policies
will result in a new social catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The SEF clearly meant to spur the old Confederacy to action on
this problem. But by ignoring progress, the report played into the
hands of affirmative action's enemies and placed its own motives in
question.

TESTIMONY OVERVIEW: CLINTON VOICES CONCERN FOR LEWINSKY AND REGRET
OVER AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In more than four hours of testimony before the
grand jury, President Clinton painted a picture of himself as a
concerned and even tender friend to Monica Lewinsky, lawyers
familiar with the Aug. 17 proceeding said.
</P>
<P>
   That image is starkly at odds with that of the callous
manipulator conducting an illicit affair portrayed in the
impeachment report to Congress by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   At several points in the testimony, the president expressed
embarrassment and regret about the affair, the lawyers said. After
one five-minute break, he told the grand jurors, ``I'd give
anything in the world to not admit what I had to testify to
today,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Such moments of remorse were mixed with flashes of fury at the
prosecutors. As one of Starr's deputies pressed him on his efforts
to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job, the president lashed out, saying,
``You have made this the most important issue in America,'' the
lawyers said. Clinton even accused the prosecutors of impairing his
memory by increasing the already considerable pressure on him over
the previous four years, they said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the president delivered what one lawyer called
a ``diatribe,'' in which he criticized the prosecutors for swooping
down on Ms. Lewinsky upon learning of their relationship. ``Monica
was kept by five of your lawyers and five of your FBI agents,'' he
said, according to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when the videotape of Clinton's testimony is released
by Congress, the public will see a more complex president than the
one in Starr's 445-page report, Clinton's allies and friends have
argued. While Starr's report drew on many sources, particularly on
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, to painstakingly chronicle what the
independent counsel says are impeachable acts, it did not describe
in detail the president's justifications for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was not provided with a transcript or
videotape of the president's testimony in advance of the public
release of the material, which was approved by a House Judiciary
Committee vote on Friday. This account is based on descriptions
provided by lawyers with detailed knowledge of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's friends, advisers and supporters on Capitol Hill have
repeatedly argued that Starr's report did not fully present his
side of the story. ``The referral itself is an extremely one-sided
and unfair document,'' said a Clinton ally, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``It does not fairly reflect the
president's testimony and the only purpose of the excessive graphic
detail is to harm the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's supporters have argued that he was forced to include
such graphic detail. They say they did it to prove that Clinton
lied when he denied having ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky
in a deposition on Jan. 17 in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit and because he refused to answer in detail their questions
in his grand jury testimony last month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his grand jury testimony on Aug. 17 at 1:03 p.m.,
in the Map Room of the White House. In a high-backed chair, the
president sat facing three lawyers from his team, with Starr and a
row of prosecutors to his right and a lectern and a camera in front
of him. As four prosecutors took turns questioning him under oath,
Clinton was at times evasive, angry, cajoling and even
philosophical, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said that he believed that both Clarence Thomas
and Anita Hill thought they were telling the truth in their
confrontation over her accusations of sexual harassment before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most mysterious area of human life,'' the
president told the grand jury, the lawyers said. From the federal
courthouse a few blocks away, the grand jurors were watching
Clinton on a live, one-way closed-circuit transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The president then extended a rare olive branch to Starr and his
team, thanking them for having provided broad immunity from
prosecution to Ms. Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis. Referring
to Ms. Lewinsky, he added, ``It breaks my heart that she was
involved in this,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the exchanges with prosecutors may prove
embarrassing to Clinton when they are played and replayed on
television in the coming days, his advisers believe.
</P>
<P>
   One such exchange came at the beginning of the testimony, when
Robert Bittman, a member of Starr's team, spent about seven minutes
questioning Clinton about whether he understood the meaning of the
oath he had taken to tell ``the whole truth.'' As Bittman
repeatedly pressed him, Clinton skirted some of the questions, the
lawyers said without providing more details.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after that exchange, Bittman asked the
president if he had been intimate with Ms. Lewinsky, the lawyers
said. Clinton responded by reading a statement that he had had
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky ``on certain
occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that what began as a friendship came to include this
conduct,'' Clinton said, according to a copy of the statement that
was provided to The New York Times. ``And I take full
responsibility for my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton repeatedly rebuffed questions about the details
of his sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, referring back to the
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied trying to influence the testimony of his
secretary, Betty Currie, in conversations he had with her shortly
after his deposition in the Jones case, the lawyers said. He
characterized those talks as efforts to warn Mrs. Currie of an
impending media frenzy over his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky and an
effort to find out from her why the Jones lawyers had asked him so
many questions about the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At several points in the testimony, Clinton faced a barrage of
questions about gifts he exchanged with Ms. Lewinsky, in particular
two neckties she may have given him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked him why Bayani Nelvis, a White House steward,
wore a tie to a grand jury appearance that Ms. Lewinsky said she
had given to the president, lawyers said. They also asked why on
Aug. 6, the day Ms. Lewinsky first appeared before the grand jury,
Clinton, at a Rose Garden ceremony that day, had worn another tie
that she said she had given him.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors wanted to know if the ties were meant as signals
to keep Ms. Lewinsky in the president's camp, lawyers familiar with
the inquiry have said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was said to have smiled in response to the questions and
expressed bafflement. He said he did not know if the ties had come
from Ms. Lewinsky, and that he gave away some of the many ties he
received, the lawyers said. The president was asked about other
gifts he gave the former intern, especially some New York
souvenirs, including a Rockettes throw _ a small blanket or rug
from Radio City Music Hall _ the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has charged the president with trying to obstruct justice
by concealing such gifts from the independent counsel's office. The
Jones lawyers had subpoenaed Ms. Lewinsky to turn over any such
presents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly said that he did not consider the gifts an
important matter, the lawyers said. He testified that he
specifically told Ms. Lewinsky that if the Jones lawyers requested
the gifts, she should turn them over, a statement reflected in
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described his efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job
not as attempts to win her silence, but as sincere efforts to help
an anxious friend. ``I wanted to help her get on with her life,''
the lawyers quoted him as saying. If he was trying to keep her in
his camp, Clinton testified, he could have ordered that she be
hired at the White House, a step he did not take despite her
repeated pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pointed out that he had tried to keep Ms. Lewinsky
at arm's length after ending the affair in early 1997. ``When I did
the right thing and made it stick, she felt a greater need to
cling,'' the lawyers quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly said that he tried to be truthful in the
Jones deposition without answering more than they specifically
asked. The president accused the Jones lawyers of using a
``wrecking ball'' to damage him, one lawyer said. The lawyer said
that Clinton testified he deplored the work of the Jones lawyers,
adding: ``I was determined to walk through the minefield of this
deposition.'' He said that he believed he had, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But events leading up to the president's grand jury appearance
created an array of legal dangers for him. Clinton's lawyers began
negotiating to have him testify voluntarily before they knew that
Starr had obtained physical evidence, a dress of Ms. Lewinsky's
that was stained with the president's semen. That evidence meant
that any categorical denial of an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, such as
the unsworn public denials the president had issued in January,
would almost certainly trigger an impeachment referral on perjury
by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to his grand jury appearance, the
president and his lawyers built a new line of defense. Clinton
would admit to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, but deny perjury in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The pillars of this new defense were Clinton's opening statement
and a one-sheet definition of sexual relations that was used in the
Jones case. That page contained three definitions, only one of
which was permitted to be used by the judge hearing the case. The
president circled it with a pen. It said that a person engages in
``sexual relations'' when that person ``knowingly engages in or
causes contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner
thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   To the grand jury, Clinton testified that most people defined
sexual relations as sexual intercourse, which he did not have with
Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that oral sex did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. And he testified
that touching Ms. Lewinsky's breasts and genitalia would fit the
Jones definition, but he denied having done so, according to
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in August, after receiving immunity from prosecution,
Ms. Lewinsky told Starr's team that the president had touched or
kissed her breasts on nine occasions and described four contacts
with her genitalia, the Starr report said. She also said her affair
with the president began in late 1995. He testified that it did not
begin until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 11 impeachable offenses Starr referred to the
Congress involve accusations that Clinton lied in the Jones
deposition and in his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also questioned Clinton about his relationship with
Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer, the lawyers said.
They pressed him on why he had not turned over letters from Ms.
Willey to the Jones legal team. The White House released the
letters, most of which were warm greetings to the president, last
spring after Ms. Willey appeared on the CBS program ``60 Minutes''
and accused the president of groping her in the White House.
Starr's report said he was still investigating whether there were
efforts to influence Ms. Willey's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the questioning, Starr asked David Kendall, one of
the president's private lawyers, if they could exceed their
agreed-upon four-hour time limit, excluding breaks. Kendall
refused.
</P>
<P>
   It was only very late in the testimony that Starr himself put
two questions to the president, both dealing with his invocations
of executive privilege, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning and end of the testimony, which concluded at
5:55 p.m., Clinton and the prosecutors made a show of handshaking
and cordiality. But the anger in the room was palpable, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the anger was still there four hours later, when Clinton
returned to tell the nation of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
speaking from the same high-backed chair. He again lashed out at
Starr, demanding his privacy back.

REAL ESTATE: FURNISHING A HOME OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As telecommuting and home-based businesses become increasingly
common, the traditional home office _ the card table in the corner
of the family room or the kitchen table cleared after dinner _ has
become a thing of the past. These days, home-based-business
consultants say, establishing an efficient home office generally
entails carving out a dedicated space _ a whole room or part of one
_ and adapting it to suit the business's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to ensure that you have as much privacy as possible,
both visually and acoustically,'' said Albert Zaccone, an architect
who works out of an office in his home in Ridgefield Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of a solid-core door, for example, can go a
long way toward keeping household noises and annoyances away. And
if a home has significant noise producers, such as young children,
it might be worthwhile to install acoustic insulation in the walls
and ceiling separating the office from the rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The insulation ``can be installed relatively easily by taking
the sheetrock off one side of the wall,'' Zaccone said.
</P>
<P>
   It is often also useful, he said, to separate the utility
service. ``We'll often recommend installation of an electrical
service and subpanel exclusively for the office,'' he said. In
addition to making it possible to keep track of office utility
expenses, he said, a separate service prevents home-office computer
systems from suddenly shutting down if someone in the house turns
on another appliance and inadvertently trips a circuit breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps to separate the heating and air-conditioning if
possible,'' Zaccone said, explaining that portable heaters and
window air-conditioners can save money in the long run by
eliminating the need to heat or cool an otherwise empty house just
to make it comfortable in the home office.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Gordon, president of Gil Gordon Associates, a telecommuting
consultant in Monmouth Junction, N.J., said that those without a
spare room for an office should focus on buying the right kind of
home-office furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, a tremendous number of
home-office furniture suites have come on the market,'' Gordon
said. ``They look like they belong in a home, but they have design
qualities equal to that of good office furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Such home-office suites, available at most office-supply stores
at prices ranging from about $500 to about $2,000, typically make
more efficient use of limited space.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a small footprint and lots of vertical storage,''
Gordon said, adding that consumers should be cautious about
elaborate, expensive furniture that sacrifices ergonomic qualities
for a fancy appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fall into the trap of becoming enticed with the nice
oak-grained finish and ignore the fact that the unit may be poorly
designed,'' he said. Before spending hundreds, perhaps thousands of
dollars on an elaborate office-furniture suite, a consumer should
spend time sitting at the desk to determine whether drawers,
keyboard platforms and storage spaces are conveniently placed,
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprisingly efficient office furnishing strategy, he
said, is to use a stained or painted solid-core door set
horizontally on bricks or cinder blocks, and get movable plastic
file boxes on wheels or casters. The door provides plenty of desk
space, its height is easily adjustable, and the file boxes can be
rolled underneath when they are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   If the budget is limited, he said, all other office furniture
considerations should take a back seat, so to speak, to the office
occupant's back and seat. ``I urge clients to put every available
dollar into buying a good chair,'' Gordon said. ``You want
something that has five legs, wheels or casters, and as much
adjustability as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But comfort goes only so far, he said _ it is usually wise to
resist the temptation to be too comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `Here's my chance to put my desk by the window
and get a view of the backyard,''' he said. ``But what you end up
getting is a headache when your eyes have to constantly adjust from
the computer screen and the bright outside light.'' And reversing
the setup _ with the desk facing away from the window _ can be just
as difficult if glare from the window falls on the monitor's
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably better off setting the desk at an angle to the
window,'' he said, adding that the furniture should be arranged on
a sunny day so that any problems are immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Edwards, a Santa Monica, Calif., writer who with her
husband, Paul, has written several books on working from home, said
that those considering a home-based business should determine the
maximum number of telephone lines available.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume they can have as many lines as they want,'' Ms.
Edwards said. ``But in some buildings _ particularly older New York
City apartment buildings _ there are only a limited number of lines
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards said that although she and her husband have five
telephone numbers in their California town house, they had to
borrow the fifth line from a next-door neighbor _ a strategy that
those who live in apartment buildings might also be able to use.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, anyone who depends on a computer or fax
machine in the home should invest in the best backup power supply
they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy a big unit for the whole circuit or a small one
just for the computer,'' she said, adding that a small unit, also
known as an ``uninterruptible power supply,'' or UPS, can be
purchased for less than $100.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For those whose attempts to organize their home office are
little more than a cyclical battle between order and chaos, there
is always professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk for hours on this topic,'' said Harriet
Schechter, an organization consultant in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schechter said that the most important thing for anyone
working at home to remember is that the only way to stay organized
is to establish a system for dealing with the reams of paper that
the so-called paperless office seems to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to set up stacking-tray systems so you can see where
things are and still have a way of organizing them,'' Ms. Schechter
said, adding that for those who would rather not see where things
are, filing cabinets are usually a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't get stuck thinking that you need a big four-drawer
vertical cabinet,'' she said. ``There are some nice lateral file
cabinets available that actually work much better in a home
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ms. Schechter said, it is possible to keep the home
office organized even when the office is the dining room and the
desk is the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure you keep as much as possible on flat trays that
you can move when you have to,'' she said. ``That way you can get
everything off the table, eat and still be able to find what you're
looking for when you put everything back.''

REAL ESTATE: A SWISS BANK'S INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH TRADING CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES S. RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If investment banking has always seemed tradition-bound,
presenting a reassuring solidity through hushed, dark-paneled
quarters swaddled in deep carpets and soft leathers, a 960,000
square-foot complex in Stamford, Conn., offers a revisionist view.
Within the ruddy granite-like precast-concrete exterior, the
Warburg Dillon Read Center works more like an industrial plant than
a brass-lamped men's club.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour or so before the East Coast markets open, traders
spill out of five levels of parking into a glass-walled atrium
where elevators whoosh them up to a factory-sized trading room.
There are few pinstriped suits and no power ties. The trading floor
is a place of polo shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   There is wood paneling and carpeting _ even backlit onyx stone
panels at the lobby _ but the 800 men and women who sit
elbow-to-elbow on what Warburg Dillon Read claims is the largest
column-free trading floor in the world, measuring 158 feet by 240
feet, for a total of 38,000 square feet, have little time to
appreciate it. They each face up to four computer screens and a
bank of phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   This trading operation is the heart of the Warburg Dillon Read
Center, which is entirely devoted to the investment-banking
operations of UBS AG, the Swiss-based banking giant. The trading
floor occupies only one level of the complex. Elsewhere, 1,400
additional staff members are involved in other aspects of
investment banking or in supporting the trading operation (running
the training center or conference areas, for example). As the
newest and perhaps most ambitious large-scale investment-banking
operation to be built in America, UBS has made a $180 million
commitment so far to its vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   In a business as volatile as financial services, a building
project of this scale risks obsolescence the day it opens. During
the project's more than four years of planning and construction,
the Internet and such other middleman-threatening technologies have
become part of the financial scene. Competitors became ever larger
and more diversified _ including UBS itself.
</P>
<P>
   The project was instigated by Swiss Bank, which later bought the
Warburg and then the Dillon Read operations. In June, Swiss Bank
completed a merger with the Union Bank of Switzerland, so the
center, which opened last October, has already been rechristened.
Instead of trying to predict the future, UBS hopes it has built a
facility flexible enough to adapt to it.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the trading center, for example, is a 13-story
office building. The master plan for the center envisions the
addition of two more towers, but if business conditions change, any
or all of the towers could be rented to other tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the center's adaptability is its expression
of the bank's horizontal organization. ``The bank was not
interested in creating lavish suites that distinguish hierarchy,''
said Mustafa Abadan, the architect in charge of the project for
Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill. ``The managers sit on a mezzanine above
the trading floor. The cafeteria can spill out to terraces. They
put the meeting areas and training areas at the top of building
where the views are best. The idea is that amenities are accessible
to all.''
</P>
<P>
   The trading floor is among the most technology-intense
white-collar environments, and this, too, is in the service of
flexibility and quick response. The wiring for the telephones and
computers alone fills a 4-foot- deep cavity under the floor. It is
readily accessible for the constant rewiring needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can raise the floor level or lower it to make a tiered
trading floor,'' said Markus Buergler, UBS's executive director of
corporate real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement would form ``pits'' such as the ones at
commodity exchanges. ``We have elected to go with a level trading
floor, but we could change it at any time,'' Buergler said. At
present, the company trades in stocks, bonds and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the wiring cavity is a 1-foot-deep cavity for the
air-exhaust system that draws off the enormous heat generated by
the computer displays. Below that, an entire floor is devoted to
the data systems that support the traders.
</P>
<P>
   Four adjacent pantries and a nearby cafeteria minimize the time
traders are off the floor. They can also refuel at UBS's own
Starbucks coffee bar.
</P>
<P>
   With the immense number of information resources available at
traders' fingertips, crowding so many people into a single room may
seem anachronistic. For all its high-tech trappings, the UBS
trading room bears more than a little resemblance to the grand
skylighted spaces of the great 19th-century bourses, under which
shouting traders frantically waved buy and sell orders.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Buergler said, the trading operation is
appropriately old-fashioned. ``Trading is a group effort,'' he
said, ``not an isolated effort of people looking at a screen or
working by themselves.''

   He described an intricate hierarchy akin to a conductor and
orchestra. Senior traders, or ``market makers,'' use voice and
gesture to guide the work of trading subgroups and junior traders.
Also, a sudden spike in activity across the room may cue traders to
important breaking news outside their market segments. The traders
can react before the news is broadcast. These seconds or minutes
offer his traders a key competitive edge, Buergler said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an environment is not unique to UBS, said Steve Apking, the
interior design partner at Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill. ``Senior
traders everywhere demand these large floorplates,'' Apking said.
``They want visual contact with everyone else and they want maximum
flexibility to grow and shrink groups according to the demands of
clients or markets.''
</P>
<P>
   To offer maximum visibility and layout flexibility, Skidmore
designed the trading floor without columns. Unusual in modern
trading floors, but akin to historic ones, UBS's north face is
wrapped in glass. The daylight balances the electric light for
better screen viewing, and the changing light offers welcome relief
to the stresses of trading, Buergler said.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Bank's expansion outside of its two principal locations in
Manhattan _ most of the employees now in Stamford came from offices
in midtown and downtown _ was controversial. According to Buergler,
30 sites were considered, most within existing buildings, and most
in Manhattan. But there are few New York City sites that could have
accommodated the floor size wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In Stamford, the biggest floor is 106,000 square feet, according
to Abadan, 65,000 of which are devoted to the trading floor _
38,000 square feet of which has no columns. A biggish Manhattan
office building has 40,000 square feet on a floor, and the stairs
and elevator shafts run right up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   No small consideration for Swiss Bank, too, were the financial
incentives and development assistance offered by Stamford and the
state of Connecticut. The state forgave corporate taxes on a
sliding scale that reflects profits and employees at the site. The
writeoffs have been valued at $125 million. Stamford also gave some
of the 12-acre site to the bank and condemned the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford and the state's commitment appear to have paid off in
other ways as well. When Swiss Bank first approached Connecticut
officials in 1993 (actually calling the state's toll-free
business-development line), the city's Class A office-space vacancy
rate was 24 percent, said Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, and ``two
or three'' buildings were entirely empty. Stamford's vacancy rate
today, he said, has dropped to 6 percent in Class A buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many positive developments in Stamford,'' Malloy
said, ``but Swiss Bank is a flagship and has certainly assisted in
focusing people's attention on the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stamford did not want another corporate behemoth that
spilled cars but not people onto local streets, so it asked for
design concessions. The architects placed building lobbies and
retail space (including a Morton's steak house) along the street
edges, disguising five levels of parking for 1,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The company built a small park on the western edge of the site.
It improved sidewalks and planted trees along the side of the site
that parallels Interstate 95. And it contributed funds to extend a
store-lined concourse under the highway, restoring a
downtown-to-rail station link that had been severed by the highway.
</P>
<P>
   If UBS grows as planned, the trading floor can be extended 120
feet east. Full buildout would bring the project to over 2 million
square feet, with 8,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Buergler would not say when the next stage might begin, but he
did say that the trading floor had opened with 800 positions,
thanks to the Swiss Bank-UBS merger, when the original plan was to
start with only 600. For now, at least, the building is adapting to
the financial world's volatility.

ONLY RACE THAT COUNTS IS THE ONE ON THE FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-run history. McGwire-Sosa. Sosa-McGwire. First, the chase
for 62. Now, the race for the most. These most glorious of baseball
moments have created a scene remarkably close to goodwill on earth.
</P>
<P>
   How does it compute that a couple of ballplayers swinging for
the fences could have had such a feel-good impact on so many
people, including the nonsports fan?
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully you weren't naive enough to assume Utopia would last.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in today's social environment, the shelf-life for
something this good figured to be about a week. Bingo. Within a
week, a large crane moved in with a wrecking ball attached to its
cable. Let the tearing down process begin.
</P>
<P>
   Racism has become the new focal point. Sammy Sosa, so I've read
and heard, has become the victim of racist motives by the national
sports media and by baseball's hierarchy. In truth, I haven't come
across a definitive charge of racism. But there's been plenty of
hints at it by small minds, many of whom are the usual suspects
when it comes to hiding behind the R-word.
</P>
<P>
   It's an outrageous assumption, and a discredit to Sosa and
everything he's stood for throughout this home-run chase.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Sosa has become the most popular Latino
athlete this country has ever known. This means he's been embraced
by mainstream America. This means white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's been another Latinino even close to
Sammy in reaching the masses _ not just in baseball, but in any
sport,'' said Luis Mayoral, of the Rangers front office. ``Roberto
(Clemente) became very much respected, but the acclaim for him came
after his death.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral was a long-time media voice in Puerto Rico, and a close
friend of Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy touches everyone in this country, no matter the color or
the nationality,'' he added. ``Sammy really has an angel on his
shoulder because he has the personality and the lifestyle to go
along with his awesome talent. Very, very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who once shined shoes and sold fruit on the streets of the
Dominican Republic, taught himself English. He speaks well and with
confidence when dealing with a mostly gringo media. But Sammy also
speaks from the heart, and that's why he has become special. Along,
of course, with his home-run swing.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Sosa rained home runs out of Wrigley Field, and
five days after Mark McGwire hit No. 62, so did Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the social commentary from some quarters. Why was
Sosa's No. 62 not given the same national media hysteria treatment
as McGwire's No. 62? And where was commissioner Bud Selig to emcee
the same elaborate postgame ceremony as was held for McGwire? Was
it racism?
</P>
<P>
   Listen closely to the answer. At that particular point, Sosa
didn't deserve what McGwire had received.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy was the second in history to hit 62. Who was the second
person to fly the Atlantic? Did your junior high history book ever
give you that name? There was no record available when Sosa hit his
62nd. McGwire already had done it.
</P>
<P>
   Selig screwed up one thing. Once Sosa reached 60, his office
should have ordered the baseballs used in Cubs' games to carry the
special mark. For Sammy's No. 62, the ball needed to be immediately
identified and shipped to the Hall of Fame. Otherwise, get off
Selig's back.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's regular season ends Sunday. What happens between now
and then will determine if Sosa earns more of the spotlight than
McGwire. The first to reach 62 was once the emphasis. But hitting
the most is the ultimate goal. Who knows, it could be an
achievement that stands for another 30 or 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a week, and home-run history will come full circle. It
will be glorious again. But I do dread to think what might happen,
media-wise, in the next seven days. It was ``racism'' last week.
What's next, Kenneth Starr releasing testimony Monica Lewinsky was
spotted this summer in the clubhouse of both the Cardinals and the
Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   As far as a personal preference for the player who hits the
most, I defer to commentary made a month ago in this newspaper. My
choice then was Sosa, and it's still Sosa. As a Rangers' farmhand,
he was a kid with a delightful personality and outlook on life.
Fame has not changed him one bit.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, I guess, could claim reverse racism. If not, somebody
else probably will.

TEXAS ARCHERS TAKE AIM AT THE YEAR'S FIRST BIG-GAME SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first big-game hunting season of the year is right around
the corner, but you won't hear any shots fired. Stealth, quietness
and a bit of luck will determine which hunters bag a deer during
the monthlong archery-only season.
</P>
<P>
   The season runs Oct. 3 through Nov. 1 statewide. In addition to
a valid Texas hunting license, archery hunters are required to
purchase a $7 archery stamp, which can be bought separately or when
combined with a Super Combo or Texas resident hunting license.
</P>
<P>
   Because the archery stamp is included in the two license
packages, it is difficult for parks and wildlife officials to
estimate the number of hunters who will take part in the
archery-only season. In 1996, when hunters had to purchase the
stamp separately, the number was estimated at more than 76,880.
</P>
<P>
   In most counties, deer-bag limits are for all seasons. In Brown
County, for example, the limit is four deer, no more than two bucks
per year regardless of whether the deer are taken during the
archery-only season, general season or both.
</P>
<P>
   Turkeys also can be taken during the archery-only season,
although few are harvested by archers, parks and wildlife officials
said. Also, crossbows can be used during the archery season for
deer and turkey only by hunters with an upper-limb disability.
</P>
<P>
   When hunters take to the fields Oct. 3, they likely will find
lots of fresh rubs made by white-tailed bucks. The deer have begun
scraping the velvet from their antlers, although no signs of
rutting have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Recent observations of deer in the Palo Pinto County area, for
example, indicate bucks began losing their velvet about two weeks
ago. Although some deer remain in the velvet, virtually all bucks
are expected to have hardened antlers when the archery season
opens.
</P>
<P>
   The number of white-tailed deer in Texas is estimated at 4
million. Most are in good physical shape despite drought conditions
recently broken in several parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Late-summer rains have turned some areas, such as Lampasas and
portions of Southwest Texas, green almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Antler development might be slightly below average in some areas
hardest hit by the drought. Overall, most adult bucks are expected
to be found with average-size antlers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's archery-only season was plagued by warm to hot
weather. The type of weather hunters can expect this season remains
a mystery, but the recent cool spell at least has given hunters
some hopes for a pleasant opener.
</P>
<P>
   Acorns, one of the deer's favorite natural foods, have begun
falling throughout much of the Cross Timbers and Hill Country
areas, but reports indicate the acorns might be in poor condition
in dry areas. If so, hunting around wildlife feeders might be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   During any archery-only season, archers should take extra
precautions in mild to warm weather. Rattlesnakes and copperheads
will be moving about, and snake-proof leggings would be a good
addition to hunting gear.
</P>
<P>
   Although the archery season begins more than a month before the
regular season (Nov. 7 in most counties), that doesn't mean archers
have an advantage over hunters who use firearms.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, archery hunting is regarded as the most challenging
type of deer hunting. To be successful, a hunter must be extremely
close to his quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Most firearm hunters will agree that a reasonable shot can be
made at a deer 200 yards away or less. With a bow and arrow, most
archers will not attempt to make a shot at more than 30 yards. Many
hunters limit their shooting range to about 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Many archers will go the entire season without letting a single
arrow fly. The hunting experience and the fellowship with other
hunters will bring them back again next season.

WHICH IS MORE EXCITING _ OPEN-WHEEL OR STOCK-CAR RACING? OPEN
ROCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get two things straight about real race cars:
</P>
<P>
   1. Real race cars have engines in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   2. Real race cars are open-wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Tradin' paint at 180 mph in a fake ``four-door'' NASCAR Winston
Cup Ford Taurus at a venue like Texas Motor Speedway rightfully is
considered an art.
</P>
<P>
   If so, where does that place the art of racing an open-wheel
Indy-car at 220-plus mph at TMS?
</P>
<P>
   On the cutting edge of both chassis/engine technology and driver
courage.
</P>
<P>
   The margin for error in a 1,500-pound Indy-car powered by an
engine cranking out 700 horsepower is next to zero. Every fight for
position has to be measured against the consequences of rubber tire
contacting rubber tire and a probable trip into a concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   Long before NASCAR's act was spiffed-up by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. and neatly packaged by ESPN, A.J. Foyt was making a name for
himself in the Indianapolis 500 against an international field.
When Mario Andretti, another Indy 500 champion, felt compelled to
measure himself against the greatest drivers of his day, he went
Formula One racing and won the World Driving Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In their spare time, both icons raced in NASCAR _ and won a deal
called the Daytona 500.

   Let's see. Open-wheel racing has the Dallara/Aurora, Lola T-9800
and Nissan Infiniti Indy V-8. ... Stock-car racing has Fords,
Chevrolets and Pontiacs.
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel racing has Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and the
1.82-mile, 14-turn street circuit winding around Concord Pacific
Place in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. ... Stock-car racing
has ``the lady in black'' and the ``Bristol stomp.''

<P>
   Open-wheel racing has Mauricio Gugelmin and Marco Greco. ...
Stock-car racing has ``Rainbow Warriors'' and ``The Intimidator.''
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel racing has Robby Gordon. ... Stock-car racing ``had''
Robby Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   There's simply no comparison. Even at open-wheel racing's
ultimate arena, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, it's stock-car racing
that rules.
</P>
<P>
   And little wonder. After all, this American original has actual
``fenders''. Sure, the days when you could drive your Hudson Hornet
from the car lot to the speedway to race are over. But for a real
adrenalin rush, there's nothing better than a Ford and Chevy
tradin' paint on the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, let fans settle the matter. Today's Indy Racing League race
at Texas Motor Speedway might draw 70,000. The Texas 500 NASCAR
Winston Cup race in April drew an estimated 200,000.

NBA NEEDS TO BE SMACKED BACK TO REALITY

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling David Stern to the principal's office, David Stern to
the office. Now!
</P>
<P>
   It's time for a paddling.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel a sudden swoosh of air during this painful process,
that's Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and America's born-again past-time
leap-frogging your NBA in our popularity poll.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't feel a rush of guilt melting over you for
basketball's impending work stoppage, we're prepared to make you
feel it via a swift kick in the ... right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Plain and simple: You and your greedy owners are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of NBA training camps opening Oct. 6 and the regular
season tipping off Nov. 3 are slimmer than Shawn Bradley, and it's
your fault. In 1995 you signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement so
lucrative that owners rewarded you with a five-year, $40 million
contract. Now you're telling us it's a bad deal and that the league
isn't profitable enough.
</P>
<P>
   We've had one gray-haired leader lying to us all summer, don't
you start.
</P>
<P>
   How much is enough? You are the highest-paid commissioner in
sports, your deputy commissioner (Russ Granik) takes home $4
million and your coaches average more than your players. Above and
beyond that, just last year you signed a new television contract
worth $3 billion. Excuse us if we don't feel moved to pass the hat
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, your stubbornness is a public relations
disaster. If you haven't noticed, baseball is back and Michael
Jordan probably won't be. Despite a riveting Finals in June, us
fans were already getting turned off by rising ticket prices,
falling scores and Gen-X thugs like Latrell Sprewell and Chris
Webber.
</P>
<P>
   If you draw your line in the sand any deeper, just keep on
digging your own grave.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the salary cap has become a mockery with 24 teams and
Jordan by himself over it last year. But how can we believe your
claim that half your 28 teams lost money last year if you refuse to
open your books to an independent auditor?
</P>
<P>
   The way we hear it, the players are willing to compromise. On
Aug. 6 you were presented with a proposal that included testing
players for marijuana use, upping the three-year rookie wage scale
to five and lowering the automatic salary increase from 20 percent
to 11, a move that would save your owners $50 million. And your
reaction? You walked out.
</P>
<P>
   We understand you want a hard salary cap with no exceptions and
that you're seemingly willing to jeopardize the season to get it.
Understand this: you're not going to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The Larry Bird exception _ the one that allows teams to pay its
own free agents regardless of the salary cap _ must fly in some
form. It's called free agency, and it's here to stay. Deal with it.
Seems like the best compromise is to limit it, say allowing a team
to use it only once every five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   After the players miss a couple of checks, you say you will see
their unity crumbling. You can then herd them into a favorable CBA
and harness salaries back to 50 percent of all NBA revenue, even
though both the NFL and baseball operate at a figure over 60
percent. And as for us fans? You're figuring the reason baseball
took such a hit was because it cancelled the 1994 World Series. No
big deal to lop off a month of regular-season games in November,
right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There's a drastic difference between the ``financial
instability'' propaganda you promote and the ``yeah, but we could
be making a lot more if we didn't give it to the players'' truth
you feel. As fans we usually don't pick sides in labor wars, but
this one's too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Now get back to class and remember, if it ain't broke ... don't
stall trying to fix it, or hockey might run you over in the hall.

THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL

<P>
   BARRETOS, Brazil _ Behind the bucking chutes at the largest
rodeo in South America, Brazil's most popular rodeo athlete
finishes a TV interview then squats for a photo between two small
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Adriano Moraes is larger than life at Brazil's premier rodeo in
Barretos. A massive billboard picturing Moraes stands at one of the
fairground's entrances. Inside booths on the grounds, Moraes is
displayed on life-sized cardboard cutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Moraes, who migrated to Keller five years ago to launch his
bull-riding career in North America, is one of the ``Boys from
Brazil.'' Bull riding was implemented into Brazilian rodeos only 18
years ago, but the country now is producing some of the best bull
riders in the world, like Moraes, a multiple world champion who
makes enough money to commute to North American shows by jetting
from South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most popular cowboy in Brazil,'' said Jose Wilson,
promoter of the annual Professional Bull Riders show in Barretos
that pits North American and Australian competitors against
Brazilians during the city's annual August rodeo. ``Even before
Adriano went to the United States, he was a champion rider in
Brazil. With Adriano doing so well in the United States, it helps a
lot here. It also helps get good cowboys to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, bull riding has become as big as the humps and horns
on the country's rampaging bulls. But the daredevil sport virtually
was non-existent 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many Brazilian rodeos offer trucks and motorcycles
winning bull rider. There are about 150 competitors on the
Brazilian rodeo circuit led by stars like Moraes, the 1994
Professional Bull Riders champion, and Rogerio Ferriera, who is a
nationally ranked competitor on the PBR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started liking the challenge that bull riding
represented,'' said Tiao Procopio, who is credited with introducing
bull riding to Brazil 18 years ago. ``Until then, prizes were
really low; the bigger prizes were offered in the horse riding
events. But when bull riding prizes were raised in 1989, bull
riding became a big challenge.''  &LR; subheds:Brazilian shuttle
</P>
<P>
   The successful transplant of Moraes' career from South to North
America has spurred the sport's burgeoning growth in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Moraes was inspired to compete in North America
after attending a 1991 bull riding school in Brazil taught by
another ground-breaker, Charlie Sampson, who in 1982 became the
first African-American to garner a Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association world title.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Moraes attended the 1992 National Finals Rodeo in
Las Vegas with Sampson and decided to compete in the United States.
In early 1993, Moraes announced his serious arrival on the North
American rodeo circuit by winning in Tucson, Ariz., which ranks
among the PRCA's top 20 rodeos in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Moraes, then living in Keller, turned heads by winning
the inaugural Professional Bull Riders Bud Light Cup Series title.
The same year, he became only the third man to make qualified rides
on all 10 bulls at the National Finals Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has endured groin injuries and two broken legs the
past four years, Moraes has been a regular world title contender.
He now flies to each show from Brazil, making him the first rodeo
competitor to regularly commute to North America from another
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Each trip begins with a two-hour drive from his 150-acre
Brazilian ranch to the Sao Paulo airport. From there, it's a
5,000-mile, 10-hour flight to Dallas. Then there's usually another
connecting flight lasting one to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Though a round-trip ticket might cost $1,000, the shuttle from
Brazil is financially feasible. A win at a PBR cup series show
offers a competitor about $20,000, making commuting affordable for
a high-profile bull rider like Moraes.
</P>
<P>
   When Moraes stays in the U.S. longer than a weekend, he resides
in the Fort Worth area, his home between 1994 and 1996. But staying
more than a weekend has become a rarity for Moraes, who anxiously
returns to Brazil to join his wife, Flavia, and their first-born,
seven-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so bad,'' Moraes said of commuting. ``I usually can
find a row of seats to lie down on and sleep on the plane. I think
it's a pretty normal way to travel. It's only a 10 hour flight.''
 &LR; subheds:Brazil's blue-chippers
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed as South America's star fullback of rodeo, Moraes, 28, is
among several hard hitting front runners produced in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Among Brazil's bull-riding backfield are colorful players
ranging from Rogerio Ferreira, who has than $100,000 in the PBR
earnings the past two years, to 18-year-old Paulo Klimber who may
be the Brazil's next big international star after pocketing $18,000
in Barretos, to 36-year-old Miltom Rosa, a hearty competitor
despite losing an eye in a rodeo accident.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, a relatively elderly age for a prize winning bull rider,
Rosa probably never will compete in North America. He appears to
love the simple life, working on a cattle ranch about 11/2 hours
away from Barretos. When he is bored, Rosa rounds up a bull and
takes a wild ride, which prepares him for a weekend rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Zealous of bull riding, the sport has been unkind to Rosa. Two
years ago, Rosa lost his right eye when he was hit by a bull's
horn. He declined to compete at Barretos this year after sustaining
an arm injury.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries usually don't deter Rosa's upbeat attitude. ``When
I make a good ride, I feel like Superman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rosa, Klimber is among a new breed of Brazilian bull
riders with big dreams traveling and accelerating to stardom in
North America. The son of a restaurant worker, Klimber said his
parents at first balked at his bull riding career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents thought it was dangerous,'' he said. ``But now that
I'm doing well, my parents are happy. I'm surprised with the
success because I'm so young. But I work hard at this. I train and
exercise every day. I ride about four bulls a week. I swim, I ride
bikes and horses. I don't drink or smoke and I go to church
regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Klimber turned heads at Barretos, winning the first round and
finishing second overall after staying on four of five bulls to
earn $18,000, which should be enough to qualify for the PBR
November Las Vegas finals.
</P>
<P>
   Like a blue-chip college player being signed in the pro draft,
Ferreira, 25, was recruited to the North American circuit a year
ago after finishing second in Barretos for $15,000. It was enough
to advance Ferriera, who regularly stays in the Fort Worth area
when competing in the U.S., to the PBR's 45-man finals last
October.
</P>
<P>
   The boys from Brazil are a special lot in their country. Not
only do they receive some of the billboard treatment Moraes enjoys,
but the sport has afforded them an opportunity to escape the
low-wage life (more than two-thirds of Brazilian households have
total annual incomes of less than $4,300) working on a farm or a
ranch or even in a store in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can to work for $300 a month on a farm or they can put
their lives on the line and ride bulls and make $18,000 in a
week,'' said Forth Worth cowboy Philip Elkins, who has competed in
Brazil on 11 different occasions. ``For them it's a chance of a
lifetime.''

BARRETOS RODEO IS A SPECTACLE OF SPORT AND CARNIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARRETOS, Brazil _ On a sunny Sunday afternoon at one of the
world's largest rodeos in this country-and-western craving,
agricultural-oriented city, more than 40,000 romping and stomping
fans pack a bowl-shaped rodeo arena, sporting the same look and
hype as a New Year's Day football game.
</P>
<P>
   An invigorated announcer paces the arena floor, kicks up the
dirt and dances a jig as loud, upbeat music cranks. Then, like a
raging bull, he charges toward the crowd, pointing and chanting
into his wireless microphone:
</P>
<P>
   ``Segura!''
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd chants back:
</P>
<P>
   ``Segura!''
</P>
<P>
   The echoing refrain in Portuguese, often repeated before a ride,
translates into ``hang on tight,'' and it pumps the adrenalin of a
cowboy readying himself to lock spurs in a high-leaping, twisting
2,000-pound bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding in Brazil is like the time I went to a big-time fight
at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas,'' said Adam Carrillo, a former
National Finals Rodeo qualifier from Stephenville who competed in
bull riding at Barretos. ``It was jam-packed and people were
chanting. It's the same atmosphere at the rodeo in Brazil. They're
yelling loudly because they're loving what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barretos rodeo in Brazil, an 11-day event traditionally
staged in mild August South American winter weather, is like the
Super Bowl in the United States or any NASCAR race with its massive
attendance, spectacles in and around the competition and a carnival
midway surrounding the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger than the nationally acclaimed Southwestern
Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth, Barretos stages the
marquee livestock and rodeo entertainment extravaganza in Latin
America, this year drawing 1.3 million attendees.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo has grown so much in Brazil that promoters pay all the
expenses for renowned Fort Worth area bull riders such as Tuff
Hedeman, Adam and Gilbert Carrillo, Philip Elkins, Scooter Hamilton
and Troy Dunn to compete. The sport may be second only to soccer
with 1,200 events contested last year, luring an estimated 45
million fans.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, rodeo has emerged as a big-time,
booming sports business with the 43rd Barretos rodeo billed as
Brazil's inaugural and premier show. Barretos is a remote, small
city, comparable to Waco or Wichita Falls, and located about six
hours northwest of the massive metropolis of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed as the Festa do Peao, or the Festival of Cowboys, the
Barretos stages the nation's equivalent to North America's National
Finals Rodeo, the grand round-up of the nation's elite horsemen and
cattle punchers.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally conducted over the last two weekends in August,
the Barretos rodeo gorges its final performance with more than
twice the spectators as North America's marquee shows such as the
century-old Cheyenne (Wyo.) Frontier Days and the Fort Worth Rodeo
.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Houston Livestock Show Rodeo, which recruits
high-profile singing stars for each performance, fills the
Astrodome with up to 60,000 fans and holds a rodeo in conjunction,
would rival Barretos' attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Through performances running six hours or more, fans sit and
wave their arms and stand and dance the ``Macarena'' atop concrete
bleachers. In Barretos, this is the party of all parties, featuring
fire-works that rival Las Vegas lights, air shows with
smoke-streaming jets and the traditional roping and roughstock
riding events to boot. Eventually, the bull-riding event bucks
between midnight and 2 a.m., the average running time of an entire
performance at Fort Worth's Stock Show Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if people don't know much about the bulls, they come to
the rodeo because they enjoy the party atmosphere,'' said Jao
Marcelino, a Brazilian cowboy who has visited the United States
several times to hone his cutting horse riding skills. ``Ten years
ago, rodeo wasn't respected very much in Brazil. But the mentality
about rodeo is changing. Now, the middle- and high-class people are
beginning to get involved.''  &LR; subheds:A festive outing
</P>
<P>
   At the massive Barretos fairground, which encircles the rodeo
arena, rows of people camp in tents, cook out and bask in the
festive atmosphere, similar to the rush of activity of the infield
during a Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Cowboys football game at Texas Stadium, the rodeo arena
in Barretos is crowned with skyboxes inhabited by high-profile
corporate sponsors ranging from Chevrolet to Brahma, a bullish beer
company. Large balloons with corporate business logos dangle over
the sports facility.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-based American Airlines, which carries about the
majority of air traffic between North and South America, is another
key player. The airline's logos are painted across a bucking chute
and printed on riders' shirts. When sponsors are introduced in the
arena by flag carrying horseback riders, American's slogan,
``Something special in the air'' is sung in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   When fans converge on the town of 110,000 for the weekend, local
residents often rent their homes and leave during the bustling
celebration. In Barretos, on the final Saturday night, the town's
streets are abuzz with cars, rumbling motorcycles and loud music.
Neighborhood streets are lined with vehicles. Amid a brick street
in a residential area, several young girls stand in a straight line
and dance in unison to loud, upbeat music.
</P>
<P>
   At the fairgrounds, which consists of blocks of booths and
exhibits, the influx of patrons turns the facility into a trash
heap, with little effort to toss litter in the scarce drums. As a
result, many locals garner a few extra dollars for bagging the mass
of aluminum cans in this lean area where the minimum wage is $130 a
month. In Brazil, only 1.5 percent of wage earners have annual
incomes of above $17,000, and 52 percent earn less than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are warned to stuff their wallets inside their boots to
avoid thievery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, the police say they will control it and manage''
the unruly behavior, said Nonota de Oliveira, a local English
teacher who served as a translator for North American competitors.
``The police are tolerant as they can be because they are afraid if
they do too much, the tourists won't come back. As a result, it's
pretty dangerous to drive around. People drink, they fight and the
paint the town red.''  &LR; subheds:Southern exposure
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and
Professional Bull Riders circuits that have garnered a loyal fan
base from cable television, Brazil has no national television
contract that exploits its top rodeos and stars. Yet many TV
cameras converge on the Barretos rodeo, shooting local news pieces
and documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are clued in on the prowess of the nation's top rodeo
athletes by a fast talking announcer who points at a rider in the
chute and rapidly reels off his accomplishments. There's a massive
television screen in the arena end zone that posts competitors' mug
shots and televises their rides live and by instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, no national association existed to sanction all
of Brazil's rodeos. But during the Barretos rodeo, it was announced
that a national organization had been formed to better organize the
burgeoning growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodeo here is not as professional as in the United States,''
said Antonio Carlos Rodriques da Masengo, a popular Brazilian
bullfighting clown. ``The rodeo here is less than 50 years old. By
comparison, it's more than 100 years old in the States. We're still
learning how to rodeo here. The cowboys are good, maybe as good as
the United States, but professionally, we've still got lots to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian rodeo events are almost identical to those in
North America, with calf and team roping, bronc and bull riding and
women's barrel racing. Trucks, however, are awarded to winners in
each event. A $20,000 (U.S.) prize was awarded to the bull riding
winner and the event was sanctioned by the PBR.
</P>
<P>
   All that attracted prominent North American competitors such as
former National Finals team roping qualifier J.D. Yates, Calgary
Stampede $50,000 Ride-off bareback riding winner Roger LaCasse and
Dunn, an Australian transplant from Stephenville. Last year he won
the average at the Professional Bull Riders World Finals in Las
Vegas and finished the year with more than $250,000 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was among 23 bull riders from the PBR, a thriving North
American organization, to compete in Barretos and each traveled at
least 5,000 miles and stayed in South America almost a week. With
competitors from the U.S., Canada, Australia and the United States,
Barretos officials boasted on posters and T-shirts of conducting
South America's largest international rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding at the Olympic games,'' Dunn said.

REAL ESTATE: THE MANSIONS OF CHICAGO'S PRAIRIE AVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They are the Chicago equivalent of the Easter Island
monoliths _ a handful of enormous Victorian-era mansions poking up
inexplicably from a late-20th-century landscape of factories and
parking lots on the city's Near South Side.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, they _ and Prairie Avenue, the street where many
of them are situated _ were famous. ``The guidebooks called it the
most expensive street west of Fifth Avenue,'' said Mary Alice
Molloy, a local writer and architecture historian who has done
extensive research on the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She estimates that at one time more than 20 millionaires lived
on a four-block stretch of the street, including such Gilded Age
tycoons as Marshall Field, the department-store magnate; George
Pullman, creator and manufacturer of the Pullman car, and Philip
Armour, the meatpacking baron.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of houses by some of the most famous
architects of the period _ Richard Morris Hunt, Henry Hobson
Richardson and Daniel Burnham among them.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous is Glessner House, a fortress-like mansion at
the corner of Prairie Avenue and 18th Street designed by Richardson
for John Glessner, one of the founders of International Harvester
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which the American Institute of Architects describes
as Richardson's ``finest urban residence'' and ``a dwelling of
extraordinary distinction,'' is currently a museum and the
centerpiece of what is essentially a tiny historic district, for
the most part on the west side of Prairie Avenue between 18th and
Cullerton Streets. The district was was designated in the 1970s in
an effort to save some of the remaining houses.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood itself has, however, been altered almost beyond
recognition. ``As a district, it's bits and pieces,'' said James
Peters, acting deputy commissioner of the city's Landmarks
Commission. ``The point was to try and save the little that was
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 20th century has not been kind to the area. The
houses started coming down in the '20s and culminated in a great
orgy of destruction that reached its peak in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Simmerling, a local artist and co-author with Wayne Wolf of
``Chicago Homes,'' a book on historic houses, remembers working on
one of the wrecking crews that leveled much of the neighborhood for
office buildings and warehouses during this period. ``Many of the
houses looked like the owners had moved out yesterday,'' he said.
``They were in perfect condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 14 mansions remain, nine on Prairie Avenue and the rest
on nearby streets. About half are still at least partially used for
residential purposes while the rest have either been converted to
other uses or are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that, after years of steady decline, the
neighborhood is starting to come back as a trendy residential area.
Immediately to the north is Central Station, a new town house and
apartment house condominium development with architecture modeled
on the turn of the century styles that predominated on Prairie
Avenue. The development is the home of Mayor Richard Daley, who has
taken an active interest in the redevelopment of the Near South
Side.
</P>
<P>
   To the west and east, many of the old industrial buildings are
being converted to striking lofts. But even with the influx of new
residential buildings, the remaining original mansions are
something of an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like beautiful islands amid all the factories and
warehouses,'' said Susan Baldwin, former president of the Illinois
Landmarks Preservation Council and the president of Baldwin
Historic Properties, a real estate consulting firm. ``And it's
tough to find uses for them that will support the kind of major
restoration many of them need.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough, but not impossible. Over the last two years, four of the
mansions have changed hands and a fifth is currently up for sale.
The differing fates of the four that have been sold demonstrate
both the advantages and the challenges of figuring out new uses for
historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest success stories are the Kimball and the
Coleman-Ames mansions, side by side at 1801 and 1811 Prairie Avenue
and across from the Glessner House Museum. The Kimball, a
three-story turreted chateau designed by Solon Beman, is the more
spectacular of the two. The architect is probably best known for
laying out the town of Pullman, one of the first planned
communities in the United States and now part of Chicago. The town
contained Pullman Palace Car Co. factory and homes for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses were owned for many years by R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons
Co., a printing company that used them for offices and later
donated them to the Chicago Architectural Foundation, a civic group
dedicated to promoting and preserving local architecture. Since
1991, the houses, which are connected by a passageway, have served
as the headquarters for the U.S. Soccer Federation, the governing
body for the sport. The federation initially leased the houses and
then last year bought them outright for $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Henry Steinbrecher, secretary general of the
federation, the houses have given the organization _ and the sport
_ a new visibility. ```The houses give us a hook and a base,'' he
said. ``Across the country, we're better known as Soccer House than
as the Soccer Federation. And they're spectacular for parties and
receptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That they are. Since acquiring the houses, the federation has
spent close to $1 million on everything from renovating the
original sliding doors between rooms to refinishing the lavish
carved woodwork and parquet floors. ``The normal maintenance is
higher than for a standard office building, but we got the houses
at a very good price and there are lots of advantages,'' said
Steinbrecher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advantages is that the Kimball house in particular has
become a popular location for movies filming in the area. In the
last few years, the mansion was featured prominently in the Richard
Gere movie ``Primal Fear'' as well as a number of television shows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another house being renovated is the Wheeler Kohn Mansion, a
10,000-square-foot Second Empire dwelling at 2018 South Calumet
Ave., a block east of Prairie Avenue. Late last year, the house was
purchased by Scott and Debra Seger, both with managerial jobs in
real estate. The Segers are midway through an extensive renovation
effort and plan to reopen the house as a bed-and-breakfast sometime
after the first of the year. Ms. Seger estimated that they will
have invested a total of $800,000, including the purchase price, by
the time the renovation is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The house _ which was built in 1870, a year before the Chicago
fire _ has been through some hard times. Starting in the 1920s, it
was occupied first by a publishing company and then by a
butter-and-egg wholesaler. When the Segers purchased it, it had
been vacant for a number of years and was scheduled for demolition.
``It's basically a beautiful shell,'' said Scott Seger.
</P>
<P>
   The facade of the house includes a two-story copper bay window,
carved limestone trim and an elaborate covered front porch. The
Segers are also painstakingly restoring the original cornice and
installing a slate roof.
</P>
<P>
   The original house had 10 bedrooms; the renovated house will
have 11 and each will have its own bathroom. The bed-and-breakfast
will be known as the Wheeler Mansion and rooms will go for $200 to
$360 per night.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the last of the quartet of recently sold mansions _
the Robbins house at 2126 Prairie Ave., designed by Mann, MacNeille
&AMP; Lindeberg of Manhattan _ is more problematic. The house, a
three-story Georgian Revival residence with 21 rooms, was built for
Edward Robbins, a meatpacker, in 1905 and may have incorporated
parts of a much older house. It was the last mansion to be built on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   The house's last official use was as a methadone clinic several
years ago. Last year, it was purchased at auction by Theodore
Nicholas, a local real estate investor who plans to build a parking
lot on land he owns next door to the house. Nicholas does not rule
out demolishing the house but said he has no current plans to do
so. He also said he would be willing to give the house to anyone
who would move it off its current site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is worth more than the house,'' he said. ``Restoring
old houses is a labor of love, but it's very costly and I don't
have the stomach for it.''

HIS BACK NO LONGER ACHING, STARS' BELFOUR FORESEES `BETTER' SEASON
AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Ed Belfour walked through Stars training camp like
a tourist on a fall retreat.
</P>
<P>
   There were no on-ice incidents to spark controversy, few
requests for interviews, and little time spent camping out in the
training room. Instead, the Stars' emotionally mercurial goalie was
the picture of calm and perfect health _ almost a non-factor.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour passing through camp problem-free might be the best sign
of the times to come out of the five-day workouts in the Rocky
Mountains. The man who fought physical and emotional demons last
year and still posted the lowest goals against average in the NHL
is predicting an even better season in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back feels better than it ever has,'' said Belfour, who
spent an average of three to five hours a day last season tending
to his tender muscles. ``So yeah, I think I should have a better
season. I think I'm going to have a better season.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, to coach Ken Hitchcock, is like the sweet drones of the
bluegrass music he loves so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare him to the start of camp last year when he was
just trying to fit in, I remember he was such a big factor that
everyone was worried about,'' Hitchcock said. ``Now, he just slides
in and slides out, gets his work done and moves on quietly. He
hasn't been a big story here by design, yet we know how important
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense will be the focus this season in part because
Belfour has helped take care of the defense. After coming to the
Stars as an unrestricted free agent, struggling to fit in with his
new defensemen and nursing a back that was constantly a concern,
Belfour still was able to post one of the best campaigns of his
career. Along with the career-best 1.88, the second most wins in
the NHL (37) and the eighth best save percentage (.916), Belfour
also registered the lowest goals-against average in the playoffs
(1.79) among goalies with more than three decisions.
</P>
<P>
   While he finished on a sour note, giving up a some bad goals
while losing a 4-2 Western Conference Finals series to the Detroit
Red Wings, Hitchcock said he couldn't have asked for much more from
the man behind the mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who blames Eddie for us losing, I don't agree with that
at all,'' Hitchcock said. ``If (Red Wings goalie) Chris Osgood had
lost that series, everyone would have been blaming him. He had as
many mistakes as Eddie. Where we fell short is we didn't score
enough goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour twice lost 2-0 games and lost once 3-2. The 3-2 Game 4
loss in Detroit might have been the most difficult because Belfour
took a costly penalty by slashing Martn Lapointe in the groin _
leading to a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no finger-pointing on this team, and that's what makes
it a good team,'' Belfour said. ``I could have made fewer mistakes,
but so could have the rest of the team. You always want those games
back, but you learn from them and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, in fact, earned even more respect from his teammates
when he made an emotional speech to the team after the series loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what kind of personality he has, that he has his
oddities about conditioning and equipment,'' defenseman Craig
Ludwig said of Belfour's back therapy and skate-sharpening routines
that often kept him around the locker room for hours a day last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing about Eddie is he doesn't want any excuses. He
doesn't want to look back and say he didn't give it his best, and
that's the kind of guy you need in there.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars moving out of the Central Division and playing
the Red Wings two fewer times this season, there will be less made
of Belfour's career struggles with the Red Wings. The 33-year-old
Belfour has a 14-24-7 lifetime regular season record against the
Wings. What's more, his past three playoff campaigns have ended in
losses to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and I swept them in four games in 1990,'' he said.
``Those were old times with a different team. I don't think I have
any problem with them. They're a good team and I like playing
against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour acknowledges the Stars' path likely will go through
Detroit if they hope to capture the Stanley Cup this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely one of the teams we'd have to play,''
Belfour said. ``All I can say is if it happens, I know we'll be
ready.''

LIONS OVERCOME WORRIES TO ROUT IVY CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Columbia's football team had worries to spare. It was
not sure its quarterback, Paris Childress, was good enough to beat
Harvard, the defending Ivy League champion. It feared that its
secondary could not stop Rich Linden, Harvard's dangerous passer.
It did not know how a team that finished a shaky 4-6 last year
would fare against a team that finished 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Saturday, in the season opener for both teams,
Columbia all but humiliated the Crimson in winning, 24-0. The Lions
shut down Harvard's vaunted offense. They made key interceptions,
one putting the ball on the Harvard 1-yard line. They piled up
running yards. They even used Jason Bivens, their strong safety, as
an occasional and successful quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard had won seven straight games, its longest streak since
the 1968 team won eight in a row. The 6,000 or so Homecoming Day
spectators at Columbia's Wien Stadium were hardly prepared for
this.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia dominated from the start. In the first quarter, Bivens
ran a yard for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Neal Kravitz
kicked a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Childress
connected on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mark Cannan and, 27
seconds later, after linebacker Paul Roland returned an
interception 35 yards, Norman Hayes crashed a yard for the final
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   No part of this upset was more intriguing than the heroics of
Bivens, a 5-foot-7-inch, 185-pound senior from Richmond, Calif. In
high school, he was an all-league quarterback. Two years ago, he
was Columbia's starting tailback. Last year, he injured a knee in
the second game of the season and did not play again. This year, he
was listed as a strong safety (or, in Columbia's terminology,
rover) and played there Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's offense normally plays from a pro set. Here, it mixed
in occasional split backs and I formations. It also had a few
Bivens specials, all run from an old-fashioned wishbone. One of
those plays, a naked bootleg, gained 11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For a university renowned more for academics than athletics,
Harvard has a distinguished and wide-based sports history. It
fields teams in 41 men's and women's varsity sports, more than any
other Division I college in the nation. Almost one of every five
Harvard students is a varsity athlete, and the school has more of
them than Michigan and Ohio State combined.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Ivy League football title last year was its first in
10 years. The nine victories were its most since its 1919 Rose Bowl
champion won nine. Last year's 301 points were the most for a
Harvard team since the 1894 _ that's right, 1894 _ Harvard team
scored 334 in 13 games. And that 1894 team fattened up by beating
two prep schools (Exeter and Andover), the Chicago Athletic Club
and the Boston Athletic Association by a combined score of 170-0.

 &HT;    Racial, legal issues cloud `Egypt'
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTON, Ga. _ The ``Master Teacher'' and his followers left a
tough Brooklyn neighborhood in New York five years ago for 400-plus
acres of Putnam County cow pasture and piney woods.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped their connections to Islam and their Muslim garb.
They changed their group's name from Ansaru Allah Community to the
United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, a 53-year-old New Jersey native who was born Dwight
York, changed his name from Isa Muhammad to Dr. Malachi Z. York.
And the part of their new home base that fronts the highway between
Eatonton and Shadydale is elaborately landscaped with icons of
their new identity: statues of Egyptian deities, pyramids, an
obelisk and a sphinx.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their move to this small dairy farming county of 14,000 has
not been free of legal and cultural clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The group has an annual Savior's Day festival in late June
coinciding with York's birthday, when thousands of adherents and
curious outsiders gather at the farm, coming from around the
country and from several nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they stay to themselves on the property they call Egypt
of the West, but in public hearings over matters such as the
commerical rezoning of the farm and their operation of a nightclub
without a permit, hundreds of their members have filled the main
county courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   York vehemently denies his group is a cult. He prefers to call
it a fraternity, specifically Lodge 19 of the Ancient Mystic Order
of Melchizedek.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Putnam County see cult-like signs in the group's
deference to York as its pre-eminent leader; in its requiring new
members to make a secrecy pledge and fill out an application that
contains questions about their sex life, their bank accounts and
their willingness to break ties with the outside world; and in
claims in Nuwaubian publications that soon there will come a day
when more than 100,000 members will be transported by spaceship to
another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cult issue, other questions have arisen concerning
York's past. He has acknowledged he spent three years in a New York
prison in the 1960s for assault, resisting arrest and possession of
a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past few months, a 1993 FBI intelligence report has
surfaced, and it describes the New York version of the group as a
front for a wide range of criminal activity, including arson,
welfare fraud and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The report also links a former member of the New York group to
the unsolved 1979 killing of Horace Greene, a community activist
who was opposing the group's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuwaubians have leveled charges of racism, conspiracy and
harassment at some officials in Putnam County, where about
one-third of the residents are black. In response, county officials
and black leaders have expressed concerns that York and the
Nuwaubians _ nearly all of whom are black _ are trying to stir up
racial hostility and build their political power so they can
dominate local politics or set up a separate government.
</P>
<P>
   York denied the criminal allegations and claimed the surfacing
of the report is part of an effort by opponents in Putnam County to
discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the game,'' York said. ``They don't want a positive
black image here. They're making me out to be a monster. I'm not a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Grieg, who has been a spokesman for the group, said the
Nuwaubians ``came to live in peace.'' However, he added, ``The good
ol' boys are not accustomed to people of color controlling their
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner Sandra Adams-Prevost said she resents the
Nuwaubians' claims of racially motivated harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is the divisions they've caused in the
community, black and white,''said Adams-Prevost, who is black.
``Because they can't get what they want, it's racial.''
</P>
<P>
   York acknowledges he is trying to build political power, partly
by encouraging some followers to move to the area and register to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our own county, our own fire department, our own
hospital,'' York said. ``That way, we won't have to deal with the
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of Ga. 142 between Eatonton and Shadydale seems an
unremarkable road _ until it passes what looks like a large-scale
model of the ancient Egyptian City of the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100 to 150 people live in a collection of about 15
double-wide trailers in a treeless section of the property.
</P>
<P>
   York, who owns the land, lives in a modern home set back off the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our paradise, this is our Mecca, in a sense,'' said
York, who is described in the group's publications as the Master
Teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuwaubians are, for the most part, urban black people who
have come to Middle Georgia to establish York's farm as the base
for their renewal of an ancient culture.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nuwaubian publications have said the plan is to turn
the property into an Egypt of the West, York recently said he does
not intend to make it a tourist attraction, that he only wants to
operate concessions to raise money for the group.
</P>
<P>
   County officials estimate that up to 500 people living in Putnam
County are affiliated with the Nuwaubian group.
</P>
<P>
   In some Nuwaubian publications, York is described as the
embodiment of a being from the planet Rizq. Followers believe that
a select group of 144,000 will be transported by spaceship to
another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Other group literature states that York is a descendant of Ben
York, the black crewman who accompanied the Lewis and Clark
expedition; still others depict him as Chief Black Eagle, a
reincarnated leader of the lost tribe of Yamassee Indians. In real
life, he joined the Black Panther Party after his prison stint and
later _ in the early 1970s _ formed a black nationalists group on
the streets of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   York said his main pursuits outside the group lie in the field
of popular music, where he has been a performer and a producer.
York said he resents any comparisons of the Nuwaubians to infamous
cult groups such as those who followed Jim Jones in Guyana or David
Koresh in Waco or Heaven's Gate, the mass suicide cult in
California that also was awaiting a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no suicide cult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that people who become affiliated with the
Nuwaubians never are required to turn over all their possesions and
cash to the group's coffers or to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   People can inquire about the Nuwaubians through Internet sites
or through bookstores in dozens of metro areas around the country
and in most larger cities in Georgia. In some of the stores,
classes are offered in Nuwaubian teachings and language, which York
devised and named Nuwaubic.
</P>
<P>
   To join the fraternity, applicants must sign a secrecy pledge
and fill out a 10-page application. Questions on the application
form include:
</P>
<P>
   Do you have ties in the world that you feel you cannot break?
(Explain).
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a bank account? Where? Amount in account?
</P>
<P>
   How many times do you have sex a week?
</P>
<P>
   What are your feelings about homosexuality?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a communicable disease?
</P>
<P>
   York contends the Nuwaubians are not out to subvert any
established religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in all the holy books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tenets of the Nuwaubians' beliefs, often referred to in
group publications as ``right reason,'' are taken mostly from the
39 scrolls, which are tracts totaling about 1,800 pages and written
by York. In the tracts, York draws from Christian, Jewish and
Islamic traditions, mixing them with ancient Egyptian history and
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the characters in the scrolls are recognizable from
Bible stories, but the illustrations depict the characters with
dark skin and Egyptian features.
</P>
<P>
   York said he selected the land in Putnam County for his site
because of its proximity to the Indian rock formations known as
Rock Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few years after moving to Putnam County, the group
generally kept a low profile, but recently that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Howard Sills said the group has demonstrated a pattern
of ``a seemingly willfull indifference to the law and local
ordinances.'' In addition, he said, some of the group's
publications and members have said they are part of a separate
sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the run-ins have been in regard to zoning and building
disputes or traffic violations that have escalated into
confrontations leading to arrests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sills said he thinks the prospect of violent confrontations
is real and that he has requested federal help in investigating and
monitoring the group. He said he has not received an official
reply.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sills padlocked a building on York's farm that was
being operated as a nightclub called Club Ramses. The building had
a permit to be used only as a storage facility. The Nuwaubians were
fined $45,000 for the violation, which they are appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Sills filed a civil suit against the group to keep the closure
in effect. A recent consent agreement provides for the club to
remain closed unless the group gets the proper zoning and permits.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Kilgore, pastor of the New Life Outreach Christian Center in
Eatonton, said he has opposed the Nuwaubians because he considers
some of York's teachings and writings to be anti-Christian. Kilgore
has spoken out against the group on some of his local radio
broadcasts and is trying to form an alliance of black and white
clergy to oppose the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've come here and are saying, `Move over and let us have
our way, and if you don't let us have it, we'll take it,''' Kilgore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuwaubians sometimes have ``shown a hostile spirit'' in
their relations with county residents, Kilgore said, adding that he
has received anonymous threatening letters.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time York and his group have generated ill
will in the community.
</P>
<P>
   One reason he decided to leave Brooklyn and drop all the Muslim
trappings of the organization he had built there, York said, was
that there was open hostility between his group and some black
Muslim organizations. In addition, he said, he had been the target
of seven or eight assassination attempts, which he saw as the work
of hostile Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 FBI report, made available to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution by a Putnam County official who asked to
remain anonymous, indicates the group generated controversy _ and
surveillance _ while based in New York. When asked about the
report, an FBI spokesman in New York said it was Justice Department
policy not to confirm the existence of such a report or the status
of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is authorized to investigate internal threats to
national security through its division focusing on domestic
terrorism. Internal reports on groups such as Ansaru Allah would
not be unusual, according to federal and local law enforcement
officials, even if the agency never takes any action in reaction to
what it learns. The agency apparently never shared its findings
with New York law enforcement officials, and no criminal charges
related to allegations in the report have been filed against York
or any of his followers.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change. In an effort to further investigate the
report's allegations, the Journal-Constitution informed New York
homicide officials of the report. In addition, the case files of
the Horace Greene investigation were reviewed, and some of the
people mentioned in that case were located and interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the investigation of the Greene killing has been
reactivated, and Roy Savage, who was named the killer in the FBI
report, is a suspect, according to Frank O'Keefe, a homicide
detective in the New York Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report described Savage as an enforcer for the Ansaru
Allah Community. The motive for killing Greene, according to the
report, was that he was resisting the group's efforts to take
control of his neighborhood. Savage now is serving a 98-year
sentence in a New Jersey prison for the 1983 dismemberment killings
of two of the five women with whom he lived.
</P>
<P>
   York said the group has no connection to the killing of Greene,
whom he described as a ``buddy,'' though the FBI report described
the two as opponents. He said Savage ``may have been a member'' of
Ansaru Allah but never more than a fringe member. York described
Savage as a ``nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New York police Detective Bill Clark, who led the initial
investigation of the Greene killing, said he believed the killer
may have been a member of Ansaru Allah. He said he was hindered in
looking into the matter by city policies that categorized Ansaru
Allah and other black Muslim properties as ``sensitive sites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I would've gotten in with them right away and
started pulling the men out for lineups,'' Clark said. Instead, he
had to make an appointment just to interview York in the case, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Eutsey, a former police detective in Newark, N.J., said he
encountered similar bureaucratic barriers about four years later
when he was investigating Savage. Eutsey said he wanted to enter
Ansaru Allah to find a woman who had lived with Savage and returned
with her daughter to Ansaru Allah after the killings. New York
police insisted he make an appointment, but Eutsey resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just garbed up and went in,'' he said. Wearing Muslim
attire, he got inside and persuaded witnesses to leave with him and
testify against Savage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report mentions arson and other activity in New York
connected to Ansaru Allah's efforts to control city neighborhoods
by making merchants hire them as security guards. It says the group
recruited women to join so they could sign up for welfare and share
their benefits with other members.
</P>
<P>
   York said he is aware of the FBI's surveillance of him and his
group. He believes federal agents have targeted him because he has
had ties to Sudan, where the United States recently bombed a
factory believed to be processing materials for chemical weapons
for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The name Ansaru is taken from the Ansaar, a Sudanese ethnic
group, he said. York said he has traveled to Sudan, and he has a
Sudanese ex-wife and two children who live there. However, he
noted, his former contacts in Sudan have grown mostly hostile
toward him because he no longer is Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   York said he was questioned by FBI agents in 1995 regarding his
Sudanese connections. He regarded the interview as a routine
screening related to security for the 1996 Olympics. He said he
passed a lie detector test and that nothing further came of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been in Georgia for five years, York said he
wants to focus on developing the Nuwaubian community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all about trying to save the children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Putnam County school officials, members of the
Nuwaubian group have applied to home-school about 150 children.
York said the group sees such a step as necessary to protect the
group's children from violence and gangs that may be prevalent in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   York said he has decided to encourage more political activity
among Nuwaubians in an effort to remove from office the county
officials he believes are opposing them. ``It's the only way I'll
get fair treatment,'' York said.
</P>
<P>
   County records show that more than 150 voters who have
registered in recent years have identified themselves as Moors, a
sign that they probably are affiliated with the Nuwaubians. There
are about 9,200 registered voters in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the growing controversy, York said he is reconsidering his
plans for building an Egypt of the West in Middle Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking I may be going to take my family and go somewhere
else,'' he said.

 &HT;    For good and for ill, Wallace legacy lives on
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- On the afternoon they buried George Wallace,
young men gathered in an old brick building on the University of
Alabama campus to play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years before, Wallace had stood defiantly at the
door of the cavernous building, Foster Auditorium, daring the
federal government to force the enrollment of two black students at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   As Wallace's flag-draped casket was carried from the Capitol in
Montgomery, the basketball players sweated in the muggy September
heat, their shouts echoing around the ghostly hall. Bolted to the
north wall of the building is a small bronze plaque that is a
monument to Wallace's ``Stand in the Schoolhouse Door,'' a deed
that in its day shook all of Alabama and much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a black youth leaps high into the air and slam-dunks a
shot. He turns with a big grin and exchanges a high-five with a
beaming white teammate. The image is commonplace today, the stuff
of soft drink commercials and sports channel highlights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, it might have set this town on fire, maybe even
bringing troops into the streets. But now, on the day George
Wallace's body is lowered into the ground, nobody notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he was a good governor,'' says M.C. Mazique, a
23-year-old senior at Alabama. ``He got elected so many times, he
must've done a good job representing the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a surprising thing to hear a young black man say about
Wallace. Mazique grew up in New York, but his mother was from
Georgia and his father from Mississippi. When it came time to pick
a college, he came to the South, with no qualms about the region's
racially torn past.
</P>
<P>
   He picked Alabama, he said, because his mother liked the quiet,
wooded campus the best of any school he had considered.
</P>
<P>
   A political science major and varsity basketball player, Mazique
talks about Wallace in a detached way, as someone he has learned
about from reading history books, not as a current figure with an
impact on the young man's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a sign of his times,'' Mazique says. ``He did things
for symbolic value. Later in life, I guess he changed his ideology,
but in his day, he represented public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other black students have equally mild opinions of a man
who once stood for holding back their race. Most have heard of
Wallace's later apologies to black people, his admission that his
racial views were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he was a big part of the segregationist past,'' said
Gordie Flowers, an 18-year-old freshman from Birmingham. ``But I
think he was sincere when he said he changed. I think he got a lot
of respect from blacks for that. And in the end I think he had a
positive impact. I think the negative thoughts and the stereotypes
have been lifted. There are a lot of black students here and I like
it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakeysha Mosby, 20, a student from Birmingham, is less
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a racist,'' she said. ``We read about him in
the history books. They say he apologized, but I don't think he
really meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosby has never noticed the plaque on Foster Auditorium's wall,
and says she never thought about the school's history of racial
turmoil before she enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of history,'' she said. ``I'm here for the
education. And I feel a part of things here.''
</P>
<P>
   White students are divided on Wallace, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was good for the state,'' said Melissa McGill, 19,
of Dothan, Ala. ``He believed in one way of life and wanted to keep
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Rogers, 18, of Columbus, Miss., couldn't disagree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he really hurt the state,'' Rogers said. ``Every time
you hear this unfair prejudice against the South, they always bring
up George Wallace along with Jefferson Davis. To me, prejudice is
the lowest form of life. No matter what he did to try to fix it,
he'll always stand for that prejudice of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles east of the university town where Wallace made his
stand for segregation, a giant swath has been cleared in the deep
forest, and a gleaming glass and metal building has been erected.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Mercedes-Benz factory, and its giant circular logo, a
symbol of luxury around the world, towers over the futuristic plant
on a pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   If Wallace is a symbol of Alabama's past, boosters argue that
this building is the symbol of Alabama's future.
</P>
<P>
   The state government sacrificed millions in subsidies to win the
plant from competitors. It got headlines around the nation when the
German company chose Alabama over all the others.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the boosters wanted. While Wallace
fulminated in the 1960s and 1970s, angrily defying federal
authority and becoming a symbol of Southern intransigence, the
neighboring states of Florida, Georgia and Tennessee acquiesced
more quietly to racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those states went on to prosper, leaving their past as
part of Dixie and becoming part of the Sun Belt. Atlanta became a
national transportation hub and regional banking center. Nashville
boomed as a recording capital and tourist draw. Florida landed
Disney World and rocketed to prosperity as one of the world's
leading tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, George Wallace and his legacy hung on for decades.
Big industry didn't seem to want to relocate in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, most of Alabama's white residents didn't seem to
care. They relished Wallace's defiance, cheering as he blasted the
``pointy-headed intellectuals.'' Across the state, bumper stickers
carried his name in bold letters along with his fighting slogan:
``Stand Up for Alabama.'' In Vance, the small town that Mercedes
put on the map, Mary Williams Wood sits in a one-room building,
hoping for the prosperity that Mercedes promises. She sells real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was born and raised in Vance, but after she married she
moved to Baltimore for a time. That gave her a new perspective on
her Alabama roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door, he was
doing what the people wanted,'' said Wood, who is white. ``But it
hurt us. It gave Alabama a bad name. I could hear it in what people
outside the state were saying about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, 67, meets a lot of people in her line of work, ``black and
white.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes Mercedes is the symbol for Alabama's future and
that the state is healing from its racially troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blacks who grew up here didn't feel welcome here, and they
moved away,'' she said. ``They went to Detroit and Chicago and the
cities up North. But let me tell you what I see in my work. Now
that they are retiring, they are coming home to Alabama. We've had
a bad name, but we're slowly living it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Howard was one of those black people who left. He grew
up in Birmingham in the 1940s and knew he had to leave. There were
the Birmingham steel mills but little else in the way of
opportunity for black people.
</P>
<P>
   He got an electrical engineering degree from Tennessee State
University, then joined the Air Force and was trained as a
meteorologist. He spent his career in the service, living primarily
in Cleveland, St. Louis and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, he was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base in
Montgomery. A young black minister, the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., led a boycott of Montgomery's segregated bus lines. Howard,
who had a ``safe'' job in the military, where white bosses couldn't
punish him, worked as a driver for the boycotters, carrying people
all over town so they would not have to ride the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Howard minces no words when asked about Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Wallace is the worst thing that ever happened to the
state of Alabama, period,'' he says. ``He went deeper than anybody
in a long time into playing the race card, and the stigma is still
there. It's really put this state behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard is articulate, educated and successful. He knows he would
have had a very hard time achieving success had he stayed in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he chose to return to Alabama for his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about it, he shrugs, saying the cost of living is lower,
the weather is nicer and his roots are in Birmingham. He is a
volunteer at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, a proud
monument to Alabama's troubled legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama has changed,'' Howard says. ``There's no official
segregation now, but there is still plenty of economic
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard has a wealthy white friend from Massachusetts who
recently wanted Howard to help him start a business in Alabama. But
when his friend approached business contacts in Alabama, he was
told the venture wouldn't fly with a black man in a visible role,
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still here,'' he said. ``The other states around Alabama
had leaders who wanted to leave the past behind. The reason Alabama
is so far behind is because of George Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute
sits a homeless black man, Carlton Harper, on a cement landing on
the exact spot where white racists in 1963 set a dynamite bomb that
exploded next to the 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four black
girls inside.
</P>
<P>
   Harper was only 11 when it happened, but he'll never forget it.
He joined the marches when King called on Birmingham's youth to
``fill the jails.'' He got hosed down by white officers, herded up
and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted was to be accepted as a part of this country,''
he said. ``We weren't asking for something more, we just wanted to
be a part.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper remembers the ignominy of segregation. At a downtown
Birmingham department store, black customers were allowed to order
their lunch from a window in front, but had to go around back to
the kitchen door to get their food.
</P>
<P>
   Harper believes Alabama has changed but still has a ways to go.
Wallace did a lot to hold the state back from the progress its
neighbors have enjoyed, Harper says, but he is willing to forgive
him. The fiery governor may have even helped black people overthrow
the bondage of segregation, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made black people come together,'' Harper said. ``When he
went to the university and stood in the door, that really put
Alabama at the forefront. It really backfired. It opened the door
for black people. George Wallace may not have known he was doing
it, but it really made us come together. We had to.''

ARCA VICTORY EXHAUSTS GIBSON AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mark Gibson didn't get to enjoy his victory
in the ARCA Z-MAX 250 until about an hour after taking the
checkered flag yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of the late summer heat and the emotions of
winning left Gibson physically and mentally exhausted, and after a
short ceremony in victory circle he was taken to the infield care
center.
</P>
<P>
   After being cooled down and rehydrated, Gibson finally was able
to savor the victory.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mind waiting a few extra minutes, though. He has
already been waiting a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just the emotional part of it as much as the
physical part of it,'' Gibson said. ``We won a year ago last
weekend at St. Louis, and we expected to win three, four, five
races this year. We have been close. We've had a good year but not
a great year. We wanted to win this so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson got his second career victory by nine seconds over Bill
Baird, who finished second for the third consecutive race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's getting old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering he wrecked his primary car in practice Friday
morning and had to qualify and race in his backup, he'll take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened to me this weekend, tearing a new car up,
we're happy,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ciochetti was just behind Baird, followed by Bobby Gerhart
and Gus Wasson.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had come close several times this season, with two
second-place finishes and three thirds. Although he hadn't won a
race, he came to Texas second in the Automobile Racing Club of
America points race.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a distant second behind Frank Kimmel, who has won
nine races.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel looked like he was going to make it 10 in the early
stages yesterday. He sat on the pole and led the first 27 laps.
However, on the 32nd lap, the handling problems that plagued him in
practice and qualifying resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel got loose coming out of Turn 2 with Gibson right behind
him and went sideways. Gibson hit the brakes and might have given
him a slight tap before Kimmel slid down and hit the retaining wall
down the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't Mark's fault,'' Kimmel said. ``I was loose before he
got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kimmel out, Gibson began to dominate. He took the lead on
the 43rd lap and was in front for 119 of the final 125 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it would have been different if Frank had been
there,'' Gibson said. ``He had as good a car, or close to as good a
car, as we did. But we'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The only suspense came after a restart on lap 128.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had pulled away on every other restart, but Baird and
Ciochetti got around him this time.
</P>
<P>
   Baird held the lead for three laps, then Ciochetti went in
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we went by them and pulled away from them, I thought
it was ours,'' said Ciochetti, who was looking for his first ARCA
victory. ``But you've got lapped traffic, guys running 50 miles an
hour off the pace and you're trying to be cautious to not run into
one of them, and the others guys got a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird and Gibson got around Ciochetti when he got caught in
traffic, then Gibson passed for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic might have been a factor at that moment, but it didn't
have anything to do with who won the race. Gibson gradually pulled
away during the final 32 laps and won easily.
</P>
<P>
   His crew had put on scuffed tires instead of brand new slicks on
the final pit stop, and he said it took a few laps for them to warm
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already run that set of tires, so we knew what we could
do after about three laps,'' Gibson said. ``I was surprised they
got by me, but once the tires came in I knew we still had the
dominant race car.''

BALTIMORE BEATS NEW YORK, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The paleness in David Cone's face over the last week
run contrary to his insistence that his flu had dissipated. ``I'm
getting a better,'' he would say, in a congested and nasal voice.
</P>
<P>
   Cone treats illness the way he pitches: just find a way to get
through, just figure out a way to survive. Try as he might on
Saturday, however, Cone could not force his body to respond, in a
5-3 loss to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Ponson, the Orioles' hard-throwing rookie, shut the
Yankees down for the second time this season, holding them
scoreless into the eighth inning. The Yankees have 47 losses (and
106 victories), and even if they won each of their final nine
games, they cannot match the single-season record for victories,
116 by the 1906 Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Cone pitched seven innings to surpass 200 for the season,
activating a clause in his contract that gives him the option of
playing for the Yankees for $5.5 million next season or becoming a
free agent. Cone and Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman say they
have not discussed the 1999 season, though hope something is worked
out; logic suggests that once the season is over, Cone will try
parlaying his option into a longer contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cone earned his 18th victory on Aug. 17, with six weeks
remaining in the regular season. Cone's first 20-victory season
since 1988 seemed certain. But Cone (19-7) has only won once in his
last six starts, and he pitched Saturday at far less than optimum
condition.
</P>
<P>
   A flu-like virus began moving around the Yankees' clubhouse in
New York last week, with Tino Martinez, Tim Raines, Manager Joe
Torre and then Cone all infected. Martinez and Raines lay on tables
in a trainer's room last Sunday, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   But they recovered, and Torre has improved. Cone, however,
remains affected. As the team flew here from Tampa, Fla., late
Thursday night, a wave of nausea came over Cone, and he dragged
himself into the clubhouse Friday. There was never any doubt he
would pitch Saturday, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   A neon sign on the facing on the third deck of the left-field
stands indicated that Cone was throwing relatively hard, his
fastball 90-92 miles an hour (on a radar gun with liberal
readings), and yet early on it was apparent that his pitches did
not possess their typical sharpness. All day he would be plagued by
cheap hits, bloopers _ unlucky, in one sense, and in another, a
sign that Cone was having trouble mustering enough to put away
hitters as he does normally. Cone had 10 or more strikeouts in each
of his last three outings before Saturday, but had only five
against the Orioles, reaching 201 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   He competed gamely, calling out his catcher Joe Girardi in the
first inning to discuss a possible adjustment, staring in several
times in disagreement with Umpire Fieldin Culbreth's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, as the Yankees walked off the field, Martinez, the
first baseman, tapped a downcast Cone on the backside: hang in
there, man.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles opened the game with four consecutive hits,
scoring two runs, and before Cone pitched his way out of further
damage. In the third inning, Cone allowed a high, chop hit with two
outs _ Cone shaking his head in disbelief _ and then walked Rafael
Palmeiro, before retiring the rookie Calvin Pickering on a fly to
left. B.J. Surhoff blooped a hit in the fourth, and the Orioles had
two on and two out when Roberto Alomar smacked a high drive down
the right-field line, where Paul O'Neill charged and slid and
caught the ball, saving two runs. Surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson opened the fifth with a double, however, the ball
pressing the chalk of the right-field foul line, and Eric Davis
bounced a double off the right-field wall and Palmeiro lined a
single to left-center, three batters and three hits. A double play
prevented further damage, with the Yankees trailing Ponson, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson pitched six and two-thirds shutout innings against the
Yankees June 16, and dominated them Saturday in much the same
manner: Power stuff, fastballs of 94-95 mph and hard sliders, lots
of strikes. Of the 125 pitches Ponson threw in seven and a third
innings, 79 went for strikes. He allowed just two walks, and the
Yankees did not get their first hit until the fourth, when Bernie
Williams singled.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson struck out Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter to begin the
game and never really was in any jeopardy. Only twice did a
Yankees' base runner move into scoring position _ Scott Brosius in
the fifth inning, and Jeter in the sixth _ and Ponson got through.
</P>
<P>
   Cone will have one more chance for his 20th victory, when he
faces Tampa Bay at Yankee Stadium.

SYRACUSE ROMPS, AS RUTGERS MAKES IT EASY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ A high snap. An interception. A fumble. All
within 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers took the quickest path to defeat against heavily favored
Syracuse Saturday: self-destruction. Not that fewer mistakes would
have changed the outcome. There are only so many turning points in
a 70-14 rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to play a perfect game to win this football
game and turnovers would have to go our way,'' Rutgers linebacker
Aaron Brady said. ``That didn't happen for us. Pretty much anything
that could go wrong went wrong for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the soul-searching resume for the Scarlet Knights (1-2, 0-2
Big East). Rutgers has lost its last three games to Syracuse by an
aggregate 162-17 score and has dropped the last 12 games in the
series, which the Orangemen lead, 24-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights' losing streak against Division I-A teams
grew to 16 as they gave up the most points in a game since Yale
beat them, 70-0, in 1890. Coach Terry Shea's three-year record at
Rutgers is now 3-22.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights have a week to regroup for their homecoming
date with Army, which is 1-1. Syracuse (2-1, 2-0), which is ranked
No. 13 in the Associated Press poll, resumes its difficult
non-conference schedule at North Carolina State (2-1) after a bye
week.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Syracuse held leads of 35-0 and 42-7 before halftime.
In moving to three of its first four scores, Syracuse had to travel
a total of 55 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen got three short touchdown runs by fullback Rob
Konrad, two long touchdowns by receiver Kevin Johnson and two
medium sprints into the end zone by running back Kyle McIntosh. The
Orangemen rushed for 346 yards to Rutgers' 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't stop them from the first quarter to the fourth
quarter, so we've got some real areas of concern right now,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's lopsided victory hurt quarterback Donovan McNabb's
Heisman chase. McNabb, who was benched after one series in the
second half, completed 8 of 12 passes for 119 yards and 1
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb's most spectacular play did not show up on his stat
sheet. With Syracuse ahead, 35-0, McNabb sold the Rutgers defense
on a fake handoff to McIntosh, hid the ball behind his back and let
Johnson pluck the ball on a reverse. Johnson raced 52 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Rutgers could glean anything positive from the game,
defensive back Alan Davis hesitated, exhaled loudly, and said, ``I
don't think we gave up.''

WHITE HOUSE BRACES FOR RELEASE OF CLINTON'S TESTIMONY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials braced for a new blast of
damaging revelations from the scheduled release tomorrow of
President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony and reams of
graphic material involving his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The volumes of such sexually explicit minutiae, a Democrat on
the House Judiciary Committee said, ``will send America into a
fury.''
</P>
<P>
   But in sharp contrast to the elaborate, two-part rebuttal the
White House issued to the first round of disclosures from
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, Clinton's damage-control team
was preparing no major counterattack tomorrow. White House
officials were hoping instead for the new burst of material to blow
up in the hands of House Republicans who engineered its speedy
release.
</P>
<P>
   As both parties tried to stake out the high ground, House
Judiciary Committee member Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts on
Saturday echoed many fellow Democrats and White House officials in
criticizing the release of another round of provocative material.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee is expected to
vote by early October to recommend launching a full impeachment
inquiry of Clinton on 11 allegations of perjury, witness tampering,
obstruction of justice, and abuse of the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't think people need this kind of detail,''
Meehan said of the sexually explicit material that is scheduled to
be unsealed. ``It could conceivably backfire on the Republicans for
releasing it so quickly, particularly without even reviewing all of
it first.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle is scheduled to start tomorrow at 9 a.m., as
several television networks begin airing an unedited, four-hour
videotape of Clinton's testimony before Starr's prosecutors. The
remarkable session is expected to show Clinton as the public has
never seen him, in a testy encounter marked by anger, profanity,
and, Starr alleges, perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's deputies will be seen asking Clinton intimate details
about his liaisons with Lewinsky in a hallway and bathroom near the
Oval Office, and about his alleged attempts to cover up the
adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders continued to come under fire Saturday
for scheduling the videotape's release on the Jewish New Year and
on the day Clinton delivers his annual address to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the videotape, 2,800 pages of supporting
documents are scheduled to be released tomorrow, including
transcripts of Lewinsky's grand jury testimony and her interviews
with the FBI, which provide extremely explicit details of her
sexual episodes with Clinton in the White House and in telephone
conversations. The material is expected to be distributed on the
Internet as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope parents will exercise parental guidance,'' said
Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who serves on the
Judiciary Committee. ``We made a good-faith effort to try to
eliminate the public disclosure of the most salacious material, but
there are a few exceptions we deemed necessary because they go to
substantiating Starr's report.''
</P>
<P>
   The material to be released tomorrow also includes Secret
Service records of Clinton's and Lewinsky's White House movements,
telephone records, Lewinsky's computer messages, and her written
notes. It also includes documents on efforts by Vernon E. Jordan
Jr., a prominent Washington lawyer and Clinton insider, to help
Lewinsky find a job in New York as part of the president's alleged
attempt to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the documents are said to include transcripts of
Clinton's phone messages to Lewinsky, a list of items the FBI
seized from Lewinsky's apartment, and FBI lab reports on Clinton's
blood and on Lewinsky's blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the Goverment Printing Office were working through
the night to print the 2,800-page volume for the 535 members of
Congress, hundreds of news media outlets, and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee blacked out about 120 sections of the
material they considered sexually explicit and irrelevant, possibly
damaging to individual reputations, or vital to national security.
</P>
<P>
   But some members, including Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia
Republican and dogged Clinton foe, won support from the GOP
majority to make public several of the censored sections involving
crude details of the sexual relationship between Clinton and
Lewinsky. ``If Americans have a problem with the detail,'' Barr
said, ``then they have a problem with the activity the president is
engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided public comment on the matter Saturday as he
mingled with House members who attended his weekly radio address in
the Oval Office. But several Democratic lawmakers spoke out after
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Melvin L. Watt, a North Carolina Democrat who
sits on the Judiciary Committee, said the highly partisan,
preliminary review of Starr's allegations provides scant evidence
that ``we're going to have a fair process.''
</P>
<P>
   Watt said he hoped the public reacts to the Clinton videotape
``with outrage at the notion that we have undermined our most
serious constitutional obligation ... to protect individual
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The material to be released tomorrow is part of the 18 boxes of
material that Starr recently delivered to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining in the other boxes is the grand jury testimony of
other witnesses, including Jordan; Lewinsky's former friend, Linda
Tripp; and Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Under a House resolution, all the material must be released by
Sept. 28, except sections that are blacked out or withheld by the
Judiciary Committee. The panel has yet to schedule a meeting to
discuss additional releases.

NITTANY LIONS HOLD ON FOR 20-13 VICTORY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Joe Paterno might not have stuck around for 301
victories if they all came like this, with far too many turnovers
and dropped passes to satisfy a perfectionist.
</P>
<P>
   But with Penn State clinging to a 13-6 lead over Pittsburgh in
the final minute of the third quarter Saturday, Kevin Thompson
lofted a pass along the sideline and Charlie Fields snuck around
cornerback Tray Crayton, caught the ball at the Panthers' 40-yard
line and raced untouched for a 60-yard touchdown. The eighth-ranked
Nittany Lions held on for a 20-13 victory, improving to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss the game as a letdown, a blip on the
schedule for Penn State between Paterno's 300th victory celebration
last week and a meeting with No. 1 Ohio State on Oct. 3. But it's
never just another game when the opponent is Pittsburgh, in what
could be one of the final meetings in a rivalry that has lasted for
105 years.
</P>
<P>
   With conference schedules taking precedence over tradition and
emotion, and the rivalry set to expire after 2000, Paterno and the
Nittany Lions had no chance of overlooking this one. How could
they, as the streets surrounding Pitt Stadium filled with fans of
both sides chanting the taunts that have lasted through 94
meetings? The crowd of 56,743 was the largest at Pitt Stadium since
the same two teams combined for a record crowd of 57,158 nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, the fans who had driven two and a half
hours from Happy Valley had the last word. But Penn State won only
after shaking off a sloppy start. The victory was Penn State's
sixth straight over the Panthers, with two more games scheduled in
the series. Penn State holds the series lead with a 49-41-4 mark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the third-quarter touchdown, Thompson had receivers far
more open on many occasions, but the junior quarterback was too
strong, overthrowing them time after time. Finally, he simply
lofted the ball up and let Fields find his way to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The play gave the Nittany Lions breathing room and allowed them
to attack Pittsburgh quarterback Matt Lytle. Running for his life,
Lytle was sacked twice on the next drive and the Panthers did not
cross midfield again _ on a pass-interference call _ until 4
minutes 46 seconds remained in the game. Lytle scrambled for a
24-yard gain that gave Pittsburgh a first down at the Nittany
Lions' 16-yard line. Two plays later, Lytle's pass for Kenney
Ketchen in the end zone was broken up, but the Lions were whistled
for pass interference again and the Panthers had first-and-goal
with 3:30 to play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lytle, despite the pounding he had taken in the second half,
kept the ball himself and ducked under defenders to score on a
quarterback sneak with 3:26 to play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' defense then held, getting Lytle the ball on the
Pittsburgh 43-yard line with under two minutes remaining. But on
first down, Lytle was sacked by Courtney Brown and LaVar Arrington.
On the next play, linebacker Brandon Short chased Lytle down,
forcing Pittsburgh into a third-and-25 at its own 28-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   With 56 seconds left, the Panthers called time out, with Coach
Walt Harris scouring his playbook for an emergency play. But he
received only more of the same, as Arrington pulled Lytle down for
a 2-yard loss. On fourth down, Lytle fired deep for Ketchen, but
Askari Adams broke up the play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions struck first, scoring on a 16-yard run by
fullback Mike Cerimele in the first quarter; even on that play,
Cerimele fumbled as he reached the goal line. Cerimele was able to
recover the ball in the end zone, but it nevertheless was one of
three Penn State fumbles in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State was able to take a 10-0 lead in the second quarter
after a Pittsburgh fumble gave the Nittany Lions the ball at the
Panthers' 23-yard-line. Travis Forney connected on a 34-yard field
goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh racked up 153 yards of offense and 12 first downs in
the half, but could not get on the board until the final minutes
when Paul Ruzila converted a 45-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, not content to sit on the ball, tried again to push
toward the end zone, but Sam Crenshaw dropped a short pass and
Thompson then overthrew Corey Jones as he streaked down the left
sideline, 5 yards beyond the nearest defender. It was fitting that
the half ended that way for the Lions, who began the game with a
16-yard run from Cordell Mitchell, but saw him ruin a 9-yard run on
the second play by fumbling the ball away. &QL;

MEXICAN SECOND HOMES CLOSE TO SITE OF MEXICO DRUG MASSACRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSENADA, Mexico _ ``Where else would I find this for less than
a million dollars?'' Peggy Schaumburg asked as she stood on the
porch of her tiny, white-bricked cottage with its endless view of
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 20 years, Schaumburg, 82, has rented this house in
the hamlet of San Miguel, about five miles south of Ensenada. She
uses it as a weekend refuge from the urban sprawl she lives in back
in her native Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet, close, and it's my second home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, California ends about 65 miles north at the border.
Unofficially, however, Schaumburg and tens of thousands of her
fellow Americans _ most of them from the Golden State _ have turned
this stretch of the Mexican coast into a favorite weekend hot spot
and the ideal place for a summer home, much like Cape Cod, the
Berkshires, or southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But even as this California Culture appears to be pushing
farther south, there are still reminders that this can be an
unfamiliar and dangerous frontier, as tourists and residents here
learned last week when 18 members of three families _ including two
children ages 1 and 2 _ were executed in what authorities believe
was a drug-related massacre.
</P>
<P>
   None of the victims of the killings were Americans, and
officials say violence of this type has never been seen in these
parts, against tourists or residents. And whether such a grisly
episode will affect the area's laid-back American loyalists remains
to be seen. But the incident is crystallizing a new reality, for
visitor and resident alike, that Ensenada, population 330,000, is
no longer the sleepy fishing and surfing town that it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, yes, this is beginning to feel more like a big city,
like this place is in some sort of transition to something
bigger,'' said Felizardo Palacios Perez, an Ensenada native and
spokesman for the local tourism office.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, large cruise ships from Los Angeles pour thousands
of tourists onto Ensenada's ``malecon,'' _ the shoreline boulevard
filled with Spanish-style buildings that sell everything from fish
tacos to papier-mache figurines _ for a day of shopping and dining.
On average, each passenger spends about $40 during each 6-hour
visit, Palacios said.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing industry remains the area's top economic engine,
although it has been hurt in recent years from a ban on catching
tuna. The area also depends heavily on the manufacturing plants
that dot the sides of the new north-south toll road, the
world-class wineries that have sprouted to the east, and on tourism
from Mexicans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the main highway north of Ensenada sit the
million-dollar hillside homes of Villas Cibola del Mar, where
bright red and purple bougainvillae spill over bright white walls.
About 70 percent of the residents in the development are from the
United States, said Jose Ramirez Garcia, the development's
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be better than this? Live here and you're an hour's
drive from the largest cities in the richest country in the
world,'' he said, adding that he believed the slayings were from
``elements from outside Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   New commerce and communities have also brought new problems,
like traffic, noise, and illegal activity. City and tourism
officials say they are building new streets to ease the congestion.
They say they trust the authorities to tackle the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions about the police and their willingness
to stop the growth of the marijuana and heroin trade that has
trickled into this area. Even as they try to piece together
Thursday's pre-dawn attack at a ranch in the suburb of El Sauzal,
there are suspicions law enforcement offcials here and throughout
the state have helped the major drug cartels by failing to arrest
them or even by doing their dirty work for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too much, to see how these drug bands have become so
powerful and ruthless here that they kill women and children and
the police act like they don't know who did it,'' said a
46-year-old woman who gave her name only as Marta and lives near
the ranch where the massacre occurred. ``They know who did it, but
they don't arrest their bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been inconsistencies in the police's handling of the
case. Officials have described Fermin Castro, the owner of the
ranch who was apparently the gunmen's main target, as a small-time
player who was involved with a band of drug dealers who paid fees
to one of the larger cartels. But several residents interviewed
since the attack have described Castro, 38, as Ensenada's biggest
dealer. Ten people have been taken into custody for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have taken the only two witnesses of the crime
_ a 12-year-old boy and a pregnant 15--year-old girl _ into
protective custody. But those close to their families say they have
not been told where the children are and fear they may never return
alive.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why authorities have not done more to break up the
drug cartels, Jose Luis Chavez, a federal investigator, replied
angrily that ``we cannot touch a single hair on someone's head
unless we follow the law, and that is what we try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding the attacks did not appear to dent
this weekend's hectic schedule of activities: There was the annual
chili cookoff at the Papagayo Hotel. There was the surfside wedding
in San Miguel for Milt, 82, and Beth, 70, a California couple who
met years ago in Ensenada. And there was Randy Masterson, a San
Diego businessman, who was relaxing near the pool at the Coral
Hotel and Marina, the largest resort in the state of Baja
California Norte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard about what happened,'' he said when asked about
the killings in El Sauzal, which he'd learned about from watching a
California news program on the hotel television. ``I feel badly and
maybe a little worried. But from here that seems pretty far away.
Don't you think?''

CLINTON'S FATE MAY LIE IN HUNT FOR COMMON THREADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The implication was first made in Attorney General
Janet Reno's request to expand Kenneth W. Starr's investigation in
January: that some of the Clinton scandals might have common
elements, involving improper attempts to influence witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It was raised again this summer by House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
who declared that it might be necessary to show ``a pattern of
criminal behavior'' to justify impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the House Judiciary Committee grapples with Starr's
report on the president's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, and
Starr investigates further allegations of obstruction of justice,
many in Washington are wondering about the extent to which other
Clinton scandals could become part of the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fate, some increasingly believe, may lie in the
committee's ability to move beyond the sex-saturated Lewinsky
matter to a broader indictment of the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report reveals some links among the claims against
Clinton, such as Vernon E. Jordan Jr.'s role in securing job offers
for Lewinsky and Clinton confidant Webster Hubbell, and the sheer
number of alleged attempts to hide physical evidence, from
Lewinsky's gifts to the famous box of billing records from Hillary
Rodham Clinton's law firm.
</P>
<P>
   But whether those similarities and the broad arc of allegations
against the Clintons amount to a pattern of behavior, let alone one
worthy of impeachment, are matters of sharp disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some constitutional scholars reject the idea that acts that
would not by themselves justify impeachment could, when lumped
together, imperil Clinton's presidency. And they warn that playing
connect-the-dots with Clinton's scandals can be inherently
prejudicial, that merely adding to the number of suspicious acts
does not prove that even one of them is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's critics insist that Clinton, in lying about
his affair with Lewinsky and covering it up, was merely acting out
a career-long pattern of subverting the truth. Focusing narrowly on
the Lewinsky matter, they say, obscures the fact that Clinton's
deceptions go way beyond his personal life, and pervade his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have obstruction of justice and perjury in nearly every
Clinton scandal, which explains why these other scandals, Chinagate
and Filegate in particular, should be looked at before the Monica
Lewinsky case,'' said Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, a
conservative legal group that has filed 19 cases against the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it in a number of different settings _ an effort to
destroy evidence and silence witnesses,'' Klayman added.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal scholars consider Starr's allegation of obstruction
of justice by Clinton, if proven, more worthy of impeachment than
his claim that Clinton perjured himself by lying about his affair
with Lewinsky. The case for obstruction centers on Clinton's
alleged retrieval of gifts he gave to Lewinsky, at a time when she
was under subpoena to turn over the items to lawyers in the Paula
Jones sexual-harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr, Lewinsky testified that she suggested to
Clinton on Dec. 28, 1997, 11 days after receiving the subpoena,
that she might be better off returning the gifts, and that he
responded either ``Let me think about it'' or ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the president's secretary, Betty Currie, picked
up some of the presents from Lewinsky's apartment. Lewinsky said
Currie told her Clinton had sent her to collect the items. Currie,
however, testified that she believes Lewinsky, not Clinton, had
asked her to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   In past allegations, members of Clinton's inner circle have been
accused of shielding potential evidence. On the evening of the
suicide of White House deputy counsel Vince Foster in 1993, Maggie
Williams, chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton, searched Foster's office
and carried out some folders, according to testimony by a Secret
Service officer. Williams testified that she removed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Foster had been advising the Clintons on some aspects of the
Whitewater real estate case. Investigators were interested in
documenting the extent of Mrs. Clinton's legal representation of
James and Susan McDougal, the Clintons' business partners. Billing
records were important for a range of reasons, including verifying
some of Mrs. Clinton's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The records, believed to have been obtained by the Clintons
during the 1992 presidential campaign, were subpoenaed in 1994. Two
years later, they turned up on a table in the White House book
room. No one has offered an explanation for the two-year delay in
producing them.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in a case examining whether the late Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown rewarded top Democratic campaign contributors
with seats on overseas trade missions, Brown's business partner,
Yolanda Hill, said in an affidavit that Brown told her that two top
Clinton aides asked him to delay turning over key documents until
after the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   After obstruction of justice, a major assertion in Starr's
impeachment report is that Clinton attempted to interfere with
potential witnesses against him, principally by attempting to
secure Lewinsky's silence by having Jordan help her get a job.
Lewinsky, who had already requested Clinton's help in her job
search, suggested that Jordan might provide some contacts. Later,
Jordan testified, he briefed Clinton after obtaining an offer for
Lewinsky from a holding company controlled by Revlon head Ronald
Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Revlon board member, had earlier used his company ties
to secure $63,000 in consulting fees for Webster Hubbell, at a time
when Hubbell was under criminal investigation. Hubbell subsequently
refused to cooperate with Starr, leading Starr to investigate
whether the White House helped arrange contracts for Hubbell in an
attempt to buy his silence.
</P>
<P>
   Another claim of interfering with a potential witness arose
recently when Dolly Kyle Browning, a high school classmate of
Clinton's, filed suit against the president, saying a top White
House aide threatened her into watering down the story of her
sexual relationship with Clinton. Browning later was a witness in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   To some conservatives like Ann Coulter, an attorney and author
of a book making an argument for Clinton's impeachment, these cases
and many others paint the picture of a president who repeatedly
subverts justice.
</P>
<P>
   But some specialists say Coulter, Klayman, and other legal
conservatives are mixing unlike elements in their zeal to tar
Clinton. For example, they say, Clinton never has been implicated
in the missing billing records or the alleged retrieval of items
from Foster's office. And to invoke those cases as arguments for
impeachment, they say, Clinton's critics would have to show he at
least had knowledge of alleged abuses going on around him.

TYSON IS TOLD TO WAIT ANOTHER 14 DAYS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Mike Tyson kept his cool on Saturday. Now he
will have to cool his heels for another two weeks, until the Nevada
State Athletic Commission meets again to consider his application
for a license to box in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing that lasted 6 hours 15 minutes in a suite at
Cashman Baseball Stadium here, the members of the commission voted
to continue their hearing until Oct. 3. The chairman, Elias Ghanem,
told Tyson that the commission wanted him to undergo a
psychological evaluation and have a report back to the commission
no later than Sept. 28 if he wanted it to render a decision as to
his mental fitness to return to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   After arguing between Tyson's lawyers and lawyers from the
Nevada Attorney General's office, an agreement was hammered out in
a hallway adjacent to the suite during a 45-minute break near the
end of the hearing that will allow Tyson to choose to be evaluated
at either the Mayo Clinic, the Scripps Clinic or the UCLA Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing needs Mike Tyson if boxing can stand Mike Tyson,'' said
Glenn Carano, the newest member of the Nevada commission, who has
been with the group for just a year. ``To Mike Tyson's credit, I
appreciated his remorsefulness today and I think he feels sorry
about the biting incident. Now, it's just a matter of his mental
fitness to return to the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Carano would not say how he would have voted had he needed to
Saturday, and he would not divulge how he will vote if the
psychological evaluation comes back and Tyson is deemed mentally
fit to return to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   During a contentious exchange between Tyson's lawyer, Dale
Kinsella, and a senior deputy attorney general, Kirk Hendrick, over
whether Tyson would waive his right to confidentiality with regard
to the psychological report, Tyson said: ``Nothing in my life is
private. What do you want to know?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's boxing license was revoked by Nevada after he bit
Evander Holyfield on both ears during their heavyweight
championship bout in Las Vegas on June 28, 1997. Tyson was allowed
to re-apply for his license after a year, although the commission
made clear Saturday that the revocation was for life and it was
under no obligation to hear any more testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Nave, a commission member and a vocal critic of
Tyson's new adviser, Shelly Finkel, said he was torn. He said he
liked Tyson and did not want to deny his application, forcing him
to sit out another year, but he also did not want a decision
Saturday to come back to haunt the commission. Nave was concerned
that Tyson had spent a total of only 19 hours with psychologists
and psychiatrists over the last few months, and his time with them
had come recently. Nave was also critical of Finkel's decision to
take Tyson before the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board
first, before coming back to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unsatisfying conclusion to a long day for all
involved. Unlike the New Jersey hearing in July, when a Tyson
outburst during the final stages was captured on camera, Tyson
managed to keep his emotions in check Saturday. The only visible
signs of frustration were when he would rub his head with both
hands and cover his eyes during the tedious legal arguments being
volleyed back and forth by the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who had arrived on a red motorcycle, left the meeting
without commenting. When he tried to leave, the motorcycle would
not start. He asked Finkel whether anyone had tampered with his
motorcycle before he slammed his helmet on the ground, hopped into
a green Mercedes and hustled up a ramp leading out of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expected they were going to rule,'' Finkel said. ``It was
frustrating. I came in thinking we had done everything necessary to
get it done. But in two weeks we'll have a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee seemed divided over whether to grant Tyson a
license Saturday, without any stipulations that he get
psychological counseling, or whether to reject his application
outright and make him wait another year to apply. Commissioner
Luther Mack said he was troubled by allegations that Tyson was in a
scuffle with two elderly men after a traffic accident in
Gaithersburg, Md., last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella told the commissioners that they could not ask Tyson
questions about the allegations that he had punched one man in the
chest and kicked another in the groin, because the matter is
pending before the courts. Tyson has been charged with misdemeanor
assault in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella tried to assuage the commissioners' concern over the
incident by releasing a report from a private investigator who had
interviewed a police officer on the scene who said that one man did
not look like he had been struck and from a witness who said that
Tyson had not done anything but get out of his car following the
accident.

HOLE GETS DEEPER FOR EUROPEANS AT SOLHEIM CUP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ For the United States at the Solheim Cup, it was
another day of steady play under pressure, with many players making
important contributions. For Europe, it was another day of missed
opportunities, missed putts and deflating defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Moving closer to victory, the United States won five of eight
matches Saturday to take a commanding 10{-5{ lead over Europe in
the biennial match-play competition. As the defending champion, the
United States needs just 3{ points in Sunday's 12 singles matches
to reach the 14 points needed to retain the cup. As the challenger,
Europe needs 9 more points to take the cup away.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult will it be for Europe to win 9 points on Sunday?
Consider this. The United States has dominated singles play in the
previous two Solheim Cups, holding an 18-4 advantage. By the time
play ended Saturday, even Europe's top players admitted they were
in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all play to our potential, I believe we can still win
the Solheim Cup, but if we don't, we're going to get beaten quite
badly,'' said Laura Davies, who was one of the few bright spots for
Europe Saturday, winning both of her matches. ``So far, we haven't
holed enough putts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has been making putts all over Muirfield
Village Golf Club. Juli Inkster earned Saturday's final point in
dramatic fashion, making a 45-foot birdie putt that gave her and
Meg Mallon a 2-and-1 victory over Liselotte Neumann and Charlotta
Sorenstam in fourball competition. In Saturday afternoon's other
fourball matches, Annika Sorenstam and Catrin Nilsmark of Europe
defeated Betsy King and Rose Jones, 5 and 3; Davies and Lisa
Hackney defeated Tammie Green and Chris Johnson, 2-up, and Donna
Andrews and Sherri Steinhauer of the United States defeated Marie
de Lorenzi and Helen Alfredsson, 4 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States set the tone in the morning, winning
three of four foursomes matches by riding the strong play of Dottie
Pepper and Pat Hurst, who both raised their records to 3-0. Pepper
and Inkster defeated Alfredsson and de Lorenzi, 1-up; Hurst and
Kelly Robbins defeated Neumann and Nilsmark, 1-up; and Andrews and
Steinhauer defeated Annika Sorenstam and Catriona Matthew, 3 and 2.
Davies and Charlotta Sorenstam recorded the only morning point for
Europe, defeating Brandie Burton and Mallon, 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day's matches were symbolic of how the competition
has unfolded. When the United States has needed key shots or
crucial putts, many players have stepped forward. And as the
competition has progressed, Europe has become more frustrated.
Davies, the longest hitter in the competition, was furious on the
11th tee Saturday afternoon, upset that the tee box had been moved
to the left after the morning matches. The new position made it
more difficult for Davies to reach the par-5 hole in two shots, but
an LPGA official, Jim Haley, denied that the tee box had been moved
with Davies in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not set up the course for any individual player or
team,'' Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   The morning's final two matches were both decided on the par-4,
395-yard 18th hole, and both matches went to the United States.
Pepper and Inkster were tied with Alfredsson and de Lorenzi as they
walked to the 18th green, and with the United States holding a
6{-3{ lead, both teams knew that Europe needed a victory, or at
least a half point. Pepper and Inkster made par, but de Lorenzi hit
a poor chip shot from the rough that rolled 15 feet past the hole,
and Alfredsson missed the difficult par putt wide right.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes later, things got even better for the United
States and worse for Europe, when Robbins and Hurst secured their
victory on the 18th hole. Nilsmark had a chance to make a 20-foot
putt for birdie that would have won the hole and evened the match,
salvaging one-half point for Europe. Nilsmark struck the putt
smoothly, and it looked as if it might fall, but it rimmed the cup
and stayed out. Nilsmark stared at the hole dejectedly. That gave
Hurst a chance to win the match with her 6-foot par putt, and she
did not miss. When the putt fell, Hurst and Robbins hugged in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that Hurst, a Solheim Cup rookie, would
be 3-0? ``I never dreamed that,'' said Hurst, winner of one LPGA
major this year, the Nabisco Dinah Shore. ``But I'm really enjoying
all of this. We just have to keep it going.''

METS BEAT MARLINS, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pressure was squarely on John Franco's slight
frame once more. And it was excruciatingly heavy. But instead of
buckling Saturday as he did on Friday night, he survived a scare
and kept the Mets from missing another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a blanket of boos, Franco walked two Florida Marlins
batters to open the ninth inning and hit another. But he escaped
from a bases-loaded situation with a strikeout to save a 4-3
victory, one that allowed the Mets to tie the Cubs in the National
League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster was averted. Franco leaped in the air, a far cry from
his slumped-shoulder walk off the field Friday night. This time he
did not allow the Marlins to slip away. And once again the Mets did
it the only way they know how: with dramatic flair.
</P>
<P>
   They also pulled off the victory with the help of the animated
Turk Wendell and the understated John Olerud. Further proof that
something wild can coexist with something mild in the Mets'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain togetherness about this team that spills onto
the field, and it has led them to this point: The Mets tied the
Cubs for the wild-card berth with six games left in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   There was Wendell, practically frayed at the edges from the six
straight appearances he had made, hopping out of the bullpen to end
pending disaster for the Mets in the seventh, while the calm Olerud
continued his uncanny hitting by going 3 for 3 with a run scored
and one driven in.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets knew the opening was there for them to tie the Cubs. As
the last out was made in the bottom of the sixth, the letter ``F''
flashed on the Shea Stadium scoreboard next to the Cubs' 7-2 loss
to the Reds. The crowd of 55,775 roared in approval.
</P>
<P>
   There was a buzz in the air because the Mets had a 4-1 lead at
that point. But all it took was a two-run home run served up by
Masato Yoshii to Mark Kotsay in the seventh to send the crowd
squirming in its seats.
</P>
<P>
   As Yoshii left the field with one out in the inning, the
untiring Wendell came bounding out of the bullpen like a coiled
spring for his sixth appearance in six games. He had not allowed a
run in his last eight and two-thirds innings. After hitting Derrek
Lee, he walked Kevin Orie. Wendell then got the pinch-hitter Brian
Daubach to miss a 2-2 pitch to end the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a perfect opportunity to add to their 4-3 lead in
the bottom of the seventh, but with two outs and two men on, Luis
Lopez struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud kept himself squarely in the race for the National League
batting title, a competition that has become an undercard fight
compared to the hype surrounding the wild-card race and the
home-run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud would not have it any other way. He would rather be in
the background and is thriving in his anonymity. While the crowd
sways on every movement Mike Piazza makes, and all eyes are focused
on the Cubs, Olerud just plugs along on the fringe of the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Friday night's ugly scene, when Franco gave up a
two-run lead in the ninth inning, everything seemed a little
brighter and lighter for the Mets. Although Yoshii followed his
pattern of struggling with his control early, the Mets countered
with the reliable Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   His r.b.i. single in the Mets' two-run second inning helped put
the Mets ahead by 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little comfort in that lead. The last-place
Marlins, and downtrodden teams like them, have been able to cast a
spell on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As dangerous as the Mets are to the elite teams in the league,
they have been caught with visions of post-season scenarios dancing
in their heads when faced with also-ran opponents. So losing Friday
night to the Marlins, a team with just 51 victories, was not
surprising. It was devastating, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to make up a game on the Cubs,'' Olerud said.
``But I know this team, and I believe we'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   They bounced right back into a tie with the Cubs. And Franco
leaped right with them.

SKIP AWAY WINS WOODWARD STAKES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Skip Away raced into thoroughbred history
Saturday when he won the 45th Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park
against an all-star field. With the victory, his ninth straight, he
drew ever closer to the stature and the money record of the great
Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The durable gray 5-year-old, purchased three years ago for
$22,000 by the trainer Sonny Hine for his wife, Carolyn, won by a
length and three-quarters over Gentlemen, the 6-year-old iron horse
from Argentina, with Running Stag third, Free House fourth and
Coronado's Quest fifth and last. Coronado's Quest, the only
3-year-old in the field, saw his five-race winning streak end.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, who won his fourth Woodward Stakes and his third
in the last four years, including two aboard Cigar, was asked to
rank Skip Away and Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having two kids,'' he said. ``Which one do you love
most?''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Hine, clamoring for respect for his horse for months,
said: ``He is some horse, the best there is. He is one of the best
I've ever seen. He is so brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Hine said, ``We want him to get the respect he
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mandella, the California trainer whose Dare and Go ended
Cigar's winning streak at 16 two years ago, led the cheers for his
Gentlemen but acknowledged Skip Away's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the top of the stetch, I thought we had a big chance to win
this one,'' Mandella said. ``But Skip Away just got away from us.
He showed everyone just how much of a tremendous horse he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shug McGaughey, the trainer of Coronado's Quest, said:
``Skip Away is getting close to making history. Everyone thought
this would be a great race, but it didn't really shape up like
everyone thought. Coronado's Quest and Free House did not run their
races, and maybe Skip Away made them not run their races.''
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter of a mile, Skip Away ran a length or so behind
Coronado's Quest, who flew the first quarter-mile in 22 3/5
seconds. After half a mile, which was run in 45 2/5 seconds, Skip
Away had the lead with Coronado's Quest second, Free House third
and Gentlemen fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After three-quarters of a mile, which Skip Away ran in a
sizzling 1:09, Gentlemen was replacing Coronado's Quest as the
pursuer, with Free House fourth. And as they turned into the
stretch, it was Skip Away by two lengths over Gentlemen, who was
opening daylight on Running Stag, the 46-1 long shot from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As they flew across the finish line, Skip Away had a length and
three-quarters on Gentlemen, who had six lengths on Running Stag.
Nine lengths farther back came Free House, the recent winner of the
$1 million Pacific Classic, who outdueled Coronado's Quest for
fourth place by the length of his neck in a short but distinguished
field.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:47 4/5, paid $4.20
for a $2 bet to win as the favorite and added $300,000 to his
bankroll. He has earned $9.5 million, putting him within less than
$500,000 of Cigar's record total of just under $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The day's races, which drew 20,237 spectators, had two other
stakes with stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ruffian for fillies and mares, it was all Sharp Cat, who
won her fourth straight start. The 4-year-old daughter of Storm
Cat, trained by Wally Dollase and ridden by his son-in-law Corey
Nakatani, led all the way and won by three lengths over Furlough,
who had half a length on Stop Traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Storm Cat had already won the Matron at Belmont Park as a
2-year-old and the Acorn as a 3-year-old, and she was no surprise
to anybody. She ran the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:42 2/5, paid
$3.50 for a $2 bet to win as the favorite and banked $150,000 for
career earnings of $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a special animal,'' Dollase said. ``You couldn't ask for
a horse to do any better. She does everything so easy, you don't
have to train her.''
</P>
<P>
   The third stakes on the board, the Jerome, is the second-oldest
in the United States, having been been run for 130 years at four
tracks. It was won in the homestretch by Limit Out, who had not won
since the Bay Shore last April.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he outran a good field of 3-year-old colts,
winning by 2\ lengths over Grand Slam, winner of the Peter Pan this
year and the Champagne and Futurity last year. And Grand Slam, the
favorite, had half a length on Scatmandu, who won three straight
races earlier this year before testing the heavy hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Limit Out, trained by Allen Jerkens with Jean-Luc Samyn riding,
made his move from fifth place on the rail and won the homestretch
duel.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the mile in 1:36 1/5, paid $9.20 for a $2 bet to win and
earned $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat behind the speed, stalked them and waited until the top
of the stretch,'' Samyn said. ``When you're in a position where the
only option is to go inside, you go inside.''

CADETS RALLY TO MAKE THEIR DEBUT MEMORABLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Army began a new chapter in its storied
football history Saturday when the Cadets made their debut in the
3-year-old Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   Ending 108 years as an independent, Army became a conference
member in auspicious style, recovering from a 20-16 deficit in the
second half to score three unanswered touchdowns and beat
Cincinnati, 37-20, before a crowd of 32,775 in Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those touchdowns came on big-yardage plays: a 44-yard
touchdown pass from Johnny Goff to halfback Bobby Williams that put
Army ahead for good, 23-20, late in the third quarter, and a
79-yard interception return by free safety Kenny Rowland three
minutes into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was particularly satisfying for Army considering it
had been projected to finish last in an eight-team league that
includes schools like Southern Mississippi, Houston and East
Carolina. The Cadets play at Rutgers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win, and a great turnabout, for us,'' said Bob
Sutton, the Army coach. ``We ran the option much better and, over
all, were much better offensively. And our defense came through in
big spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Rowland's touchdown run, the biggest Army defensive
play came with 5 minutes 29 seconds left. With the Cadets leading,
30-20, linebacker Nate Hunterton and cornerback Tony Coaxum stopped
Cincinnati runner Orlando Smith for no gain on fourth-and-1 at the
Army 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge play for us,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case when Army wins, its ground game and
defense were largely responsible. Led by Williams and Goff, who ran
for 108 and 92 yards, respectively, the Cadets rushed for 317 yards
against 162 for the Bearcats. Cincinnati, 0-3, was more effective
in the air, passing for 214 yards to 82 for Army.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four of Cincinnati's passing yards came on three passes
by the versatile Chad Plummer, who was even more effective as a
receiver, catching 11 passes for 128 yards. Those 11 passes were
thrown by sophomore Deontey Kenner, with whom Plummer alternates at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The game was marked by six fumbles and three interceptions.
Cincinnati took a 17-13 halftime lead, largely because of
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Army's Hunter Hill fumbled a punt following the game's opening
series _ the first of two punts fumbled by the junior _ giving
Cincinnati the ball on the Cadets' 16-yard line. Two plays later,
Plummer found Jason Collins-Baker wide open in the end zone. Then
in the second quarter, with Army leading, 13-7, following Eric
Olsen's second field goal, Bearcat linebacker Hassan Chapman picked
off a pass by Goff at the Cincinnati 35. The Bearcats then drove 65
yards on 9 plays, the last of which was a 23-yard touchdown pass
from Kenner to Cornelius Bonner. That gave the visitors a 14-13
lead, which they widened to 17-13 on a 40-yard field goal by Joe
Judge on the last play of the half.
</P>
<P>
   After misfiring on all five of his passes in the opening half,
the left-handed Goff was 4 for 4 for 82 yards and 1 touchdown in
the second half. Two of those completions came on the Cadets' first
possession, which ended with Olsen's third field goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to come out in the second half and
re-focus,'' said Goff. ``The team was behind me and picking me up.
I took control and tried to lead the team.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 40-yard field goal by Judge had put the Bearcats ahead
by 20-16, Army regained the lead when Goff hooked up with Williams
with 2:23 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati appeared on the verge of retaking the lead when it
marched to the Army 21. But Kenner, under pressure from linebacker
Derick McNally, threw a wobbly pass into Rowland's hands near the
right sideline, and the sophomore raced in for a 30-20 lead.

TEXAN'S DREAMS GO UP IN FLAMES IN ARCA RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Billy Meazell was in pain. He had just returned
from the Texas Motor Speedway's infield care center, where he was
treated for bruises and a slight burn sustained in a fiery crash on
lap 81 of yesterday's ARCA Z-MAX 250. His flaming car hit the wall
three times and flipped up on the right-side wheels for a few
frightening feet.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what hurt. Looking at the charred wreck that had
been the only car in his self-owned and self-operated racing team,
now ``that'' hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more pain in seeing this car than in anything
else,'' said Meazell, a native of Frankston, in East Texas. ``I'm
mad, disgusted. That's the only car I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Meazell and his crew, which includes his brother
Steven and step-brother Dennis Taylor, will try to salvage what
they can from the 1994 Chevrolet Lumina they had brought to TMS to
run in their first Automobile Racing Club of America event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just small-town East Texas people with a small family
budget,'' Steven Meazell said. ``We don't have any sponsors. This
hurt us bad. The car's almost outdated, but we've still got over 60
grand in it. We came here looking to catch someone's eye and get a
sponsor, and to do that, we figured we'd have to put the car near
the front.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the wreck, they were doing just that. Billy
Meazell, a longtime dirt-track racer, had moved as high as second
during the race, and was running a solid third when he came out of
Turn 4 and ``couldn't turn left.''
</P>
<P>
   The steering wheel turned but the car wouldn't respond. As he
hit the outside wall, the left side of the car burst into flames.
He slammed hard into the outside wall again on the front stretch,
slid across the track and hit the inside wall, knocking the car up
on its right-side wheels. He made it out of the car on his own soon
after it rolled to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in the garage was that either a tire had blown or an
oil line ruptured, coating the tires with slick oil and starting
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the Meazells were left wondering what to do.
This week, they had already shelled out $16,000 _ money that comes
from Billy Meazell's mobile home and truck business _ on a new
engine after blowing one in practice Thursday. They installed the
new motor barely in time to become the last car out on the track
for Friday's qualifying and proceeded to post the ninth-best
qualifying speed at 168.539 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that mattered after the wreck. All that was left was
a search for a sponsor and the hope they would be able to replace
the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not giving up,'' Steven Meazell said. ``We're going to
keep on pushing. We can run with the big boys. We just need some
help.''

OVERPAID DODGERS ARE A TOUGH FIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even with all that energy and enthusiasm, Kevin
Malone is a realist.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are not a quick fix _ even if next year's payroll
reaches a staggering $70-75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am confident we can be right there next year, there
has to be a lot of planning long term,'' Malone said Thursday.
``You have to create some room to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's strength at player evaluation is buried under the $53
million his predecessors committed to 12 players for 1999. In
addition, he inherits $34 million for five players in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he could try to ship Bobby Bonilla back to Baltimore and
tell Orioles owner Peter Angelos the Dodgers will pick up half the
$11.8 million the 35-year-old Bonilla is owed for the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the lack of flexibility that will make the recovery so
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the guarantees, the Dodgers cannot sign a No.1
starter like San Diego's Kevin Brown, who might command $10 million
a year on the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Malone watched the San Francisco Giants crush the Dodgers 18-4
on Saturday. But the real pain was knowing the Giants are
contending with a $40 million payroll they want to keep in place
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants built their payroll around option years that will
help them maintain some fiscal sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Do they pay Orel Hershiser, who has one victory in his last 12
starts, $3.2 million next season or exercise a buyout of $200,000?
Do they pay J.T. Snow $3 million or $700,000 and let him become a
free agent? Charlie Hayes $1.7 million or the $275,000 buyout? The
same questions are being asked about shortstop Rey Sanchez ($1.4
million or $100,000) and reliever Julian Tavarez ($1.2 million or
$200,000).
</P>
<P>
   Granted, all that lends itself to some uncertainty for Giants
fans, but it seems to bring a more competitive team.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers handed Malone a $15 million brick from last May's
Mike Piazza trade with Florida (Gary Sheffield $9.5 million,
Bonilla $5.9 million).
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the guaranteed money, the Dodgers still have to
deal with a considerable group of players eligible for salary
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charles Johnson enters his fifth year with a chance to
make $4.5 million next season. Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek could
get a raise to $2.5 million. Left-hander Carlos Perez could get $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ismael Valdes, the culprit in Saturday's meltdown, could
get almost $4 million in arbitration. If Valdes had any kind of
season, he could have gotten a long-term contract worth quite a bit
more.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is going to have to convince some team that the
overpriced veterans can put them over the top. And because the
expectations are so high in a major market like L.A., he is going
to have to keep big names in the lineup while rebuilding the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Not that big contracts are all bad. After the 1996 season,
franchise player Mike Piazza asked the Dodgers for a six-year deal
worth $60 million. The Dodgers laughed and Piazza accepted two
years for $15.
</P>
<P>
   The next year they gave Raul Mondesi $36 million for four years
with two option years that could make the deal worth $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is gone after wanting $105 million for seven years, and
people are still wondering about Mondesi's potential.
</P>
<P>
   What about Leyland: With General manager Dave Dombrowski signed
and the rest of the front office taking shape, prospective Marlins
owner John Henry now will turn his attention to convincing manager
Jim Leyland to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, 49, called Leyland on Saturday to introduce himself to
Leyland, who has three years left on his contract after this season
but has an out clause that allows him to leave if the team is sold.
Henry plans to meet with Leyland and Dombrowski sometime this week
after the Marlins return home from their road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, as he has all along, refused to comment on his
situation except to acknowledge that he had spoken with Henry by
phone and that he probably would see him at one of the Marlins' six
remaining home games.
</P>
<P>
   When Dombrowski signed his five-year, $5 million contract
extension last week, he said he'd do what he could to convince
Leyland to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the priority is keeping Jim Leyland,'' Dombrowski said.
``He's one of the best managers in baseball, so obviously you want
him to stay. But he has to do what's best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland left Pittsburgh after the 1996 season because he was
worried it would take too long for the Pirates to rebuild and he
wanted to win right away, which he did with the Marlins. Henry has
said he'll spend to make the Marlins competitive again, but not
right away, and if Leyland decides he doesn't want to wait, he
could leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind building some,'' Dombrowski said. ``I don't know
if Jim feels like that. He has to make that decision. He knows we
would like to have him back, but all I can do is tell Jim how it
stands. I can't keep pushing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Big contract: Bret Saberhagen improved to 14-7 on Wednesday
night after receiving a new three-year contract (with an option for
2002) on Sunday. The deal is worth $12.5 million plus incentives
for the first three years. The fourth year, which can be triggered
by innings pitched, has a $4.5 million base.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 victories are the most Saberhagen has had since he went
14-4 for the Mets in '94. He had reconstructive shoulder surgery
after the '95 season, missed all of 1996 and all but six starts of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   He's back throwing in the low 90s with excellent control. The
Sox have made it a point not to push him past 100 pitches this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think if (my injury) had happened 10 years ago that
I'd be pitching,'' Saberhagen said. ``Modern medicine took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Future in Twin Cities? Marty Cordova was American League Rookie
of the Year four years ago, but now the Twins are wondering if he
is part of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova is a big reason why the Twins are finishing their sixth
consecutive losing season for the first time in franchise history.
He is hitting just .255 with only 10 homers and 67 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He's already been through two dreadful slumps: The 0 for 29 that
went from Aug. 31-Sept. 14 and an 0 for 22 that went from July
17-26.
</P>
<P>
   Some on the Twins staff are convinced that Cordova can no longer
hit a quality major-league fastball. Manager Tom Kelly has tried
talking to Cordova a couple of times recently and hasn't felt that
Cordova is receptive to help. Hitting coach Terry Crowley on
Wednesday declined comment when asked to evaluate Cordova's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back is up against the wall, but I've been here before,''
Cordova said. ``I'm going to have to do something or something is
going to be done to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers gone? Among the few bright spots for the A's this season
was Kenny Rogers (14-8, 3.16), but after regaining his spot as one
of baseball's better left-handers, it looks like he might want out.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Dodgers' Jeff Shaw, he is in the middle of a multi-year
contract and can demand a trade. He could return to Texas, where he
had his best seasons, or Tampa Bay, near where he lives in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my wife had said at the beginning of the year that she
couldn't deal with my being on the West Coast, I wouldn't be here
now,'' said Rogers, who has two young children. ``I enjoy playing
the game, but I don't enjoy the time away from my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's don't want to have to think about life without Rogers,
who is due to get $5 million in 1999, half of that paid by the
Yankees. The A's picked up Rogers from New York in exchange for
Scott Brosius last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe the A's a lot,'' he said. ``They gave me a chance after
New York, when other teams might not have. When we're talking about
next year, I won't forget that I owe them.''
</P>
<P>
   News and notes: Boston's John Valentin appears to have settled
in at third base after losing his shortstop job last year to Nomar
Garciaparra and struggling with a move to second. Valentin has
committed 12 errors in his first full season at third and none in
the second half.... Orel Hershiser, with one victory in 12 starts
since July 21, retired the first 12 batters Wednesday on his 40th
birthday. But Arizona batted around in the bottom of the sixth,
scoring four runs.... The Cubs' Kevin Tapani (19-7 with a 4.60) has
a chance to become only the 12th pitcher since 1920 to win 20 games
with an ERA above 4.00. He would be the first since Jack Morris in
1992, unless Texas' Rick Helling (19-7, 4.30) beats him there.
Others who won 20 with a 4-plus ERA: Jim Merritt in 1970, Lew
Burdette in 1959, Murry Dickson in 1951, Bobo Newsom in 1938, Wes
Ferrell in 1936, Vern Kennedy in 1936, Lefty Gomez in 1932, Ray
Kremer in 1930, George Earnshaw in 1930 and George Uhle in 1922....
Seattle RF Jay Buhner, who missed most of the first two months this
year after knee surgery, underwent a ``Tommy John'' surgery on his
right elbow and probably won't play for the next 6-9 months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE ORDER
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing feeling in and out of baseball that the Cubs'
Sammy Sosa has been slighted during his race with Mark McGwire for
the all-time single-season home run record. Commissioner Bud Selig
wasn't there when Sosa hit No. 62 and there was no ceremony to mark
the occasion. They also stopped giving the baseballs a special
stamp so Sosa's No. 62 is still missing. Today, Selig and
representatives from the Maris family will be there for a party for
Sosa at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ROTISSERIE WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Despite their great season, Cubs fans were still upset the team
traded leadoff hitter Doug Glanville to Philadelphia during the
winter. But after a hot first half, Glanville is batting .210
(38-181) since July 31, dropping his overall average from .314 to
.285. What's worse is that Glanville has walked just 12 times in
that stretch and scored only 20 runs. The Phillies are thinking
about taking Glanville out of the top spot in the order next
season.
</P>
<P>
   STAT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez hit five homers in two games. The five homers came
in six at-bats Tuesday and Wednesday. He hit four in four at-bats _
three homers in his last three at-bats in a 7-5 victory over
Toronto on Tuesday and a three-run homer in the first inning on
Wednesday. On Tuesday he drove in five runs. Wednesday he drove in
four. Ramirez has 42 homers and 133 RBI _ far and away career
highs.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden is the leading candidate to replace Pat
Gillick when he formally steps down. The Orioles received
permission to interview Bowden on Tuesday, and he has strong
support within the organization from old friend Syd Thrift,
Baltimore's director of player development. Other candidates:
Cleveland exec Dan O'Dowd, former Dodgers GM Fred Claire, former
Yankees GM Bob Watson and Braves assistant Dean Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is special, but I don't know if anybody else
does.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Angels coach Larry Bowa, after there were 9,000 empty seats at
the Ballpark in Arlington for Wednesday's Rangers-Angels game for
the AL West lead.

A&AMP;M STORMS PAST SOUTHERN MISS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Rain swept from offshore into the Gulf
States yesterday afternoon, but it was Texas A&AMP;M that blanketed
Southern Mississippi with a case of tropical depression.
</P>
<P>
   Missing prime bad-weather fullback D'Andre Hardeman _ who has
been suspended indefinitely from the team _ the 17th-ranked Aggies
relied on two lightning-strike touchdown runs by Dante Hall and its
Wrecking Crew defense for a 24-6 victory over the crestfallen
Golden Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very good football team we played,'' USM coach Jeff
Bower said.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M spoiled the home opener for Bower's Southern Mississippi
team that had vowed redemption after falling out of the preseason
Top 25 with a 34-7 loss at Penn State two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before only the fifth sellout crowd (33,323) in Roberts
Stadium history, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum was concerned before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been worried about this game since last spring,'' Slocum
said. ``But I thought we took some of the momentum out of the crowd
early in the game because our defense was getting after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 2-1 is a good place to be. It would just be so different
now if you come in here and lose and have to go back and play North
Texas. You can't get the monkey off your back. So I'm very pleased
with this win. Getting out of a hostile environment like this with
a victory will help us when we open \RBig 12\S conference play at
Kansas \ROct.3\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall pulled a small muscle in his calf on Wednesday and was
doubtful before kickoff. But he had immediate impact when he
entered the game with 5:16 left in the first half as the Aggies
clung to a precarious 6-0 lead on two of Russell Bynum's three
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   On his second carry, Hall took it outside and broke four
tackles, sprinting 44 yards down the left sideline to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the big plays in the ball game,'' Slocum said.
``That run really came at a good time. We were only up by six and
needed to get some distance between us and them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall struck again in the third quarter, two plays after Jason
Webster's 30-yard return to the USM 25 after one of three Aggies
interceptions. Hall gained 9, then cut over the right side and
faked out a final defender at the 5 on his way to a 16-yard scoring
run with 4:29 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hall finished with 76 yards on eight carries, but gained it all
on his first four calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could play today, but I hadn't practiced all week, so
it wouldn't have been fair to the other guys not to give them a
chance,'' Hall said. ``I had some great blocks from the line \Ron
the 44-yard run\S that enabled me to get into the end zone. On one
play, the muscle tugged a little bit. But other than that, I felt
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's defense also recovered a pair of fumbles. The five
turnovers led to 13 points. The Crew also sacked USM quarterback
Lee Roberts five times for losses of 26 yards _ an important factor
on a day in which the A&AMP;M offense managed just 171 yards and nine
first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Warrick Holdman led the Aggies defense with seven
tackles, two for losses, a sack and batted down a pass at the line
of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive line was the key to our defense,'' Holdman said.
``They put a lot of pressure on the quarterback, which enabled us
to make some big plays.'' Extra points Four Aggies running backs
gained 127 yards on 33 carries. ... Ja'Mar Toombs, the only
freshman to play for A&AMP;M this season, started in place of suspended
D'Andre Hardeman. ... Punter Shane Lechler averaged 50.1 yards on
nine kicks. ... Sophomore field-goal kicker Russell Bynum is now
5-for-5 and has converted all six extra points.  &LR; tagtop:Mike Jones,

BRACK DOING FINE JOB OF REACHING HIS GOAL: WINNING RACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fans of the Pep Boys Indy Racing League
haven't started wearing their ``Anybody But Brack'' T-shirts. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Brack's record-setting three-race winning
streak might be a blessing for a series still auditioning for more
than one marquee player. With reigning champion Tony Stewart headed
for a full-time NASCAR Winston Cup ride in 1999, Brack is heir
apparent to the title of ``IRL Poster Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stewart noted, ``It beats having your face on a milk
carton.''
</P>
<P>
   But does Brack want the job?
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal isn't to be the guy that gets the most PR,'' said
Brack, the championship points leader who starts 10th in today's
inaugural Lone Star 500K at Texas Motor Speedway. ``My goal is to
win races _ because if I win races, everyone has to write about me
anyway. I can deal with all of that other stuff, but the main thing
for me is a good race result.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months of the IRL schedule, Brack's results
have been impeccable. His consecutive victories at Charlotte Motor
Speedway, Pikes Peak International Raceway and Atlanta Motor
Speedway have stolen the spotlight at A.J. Foyt Racing from injured
teammate Billy Boat _ Foyt's de facto No. 1 driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's just got a roll going,'' said Boat, winner of the True
Value 500K here in June, but out of the title chase after missing
two races with a broken leg and pelvis. ``I've been trying to find
out what Kenny's eating, what he's drinking and where he's hanging
out, because I'm trying to get a little bit of it to rub off on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack chased Boat and Plano's Greg Ray across the finish line
during the True Value 500K night race June 6. That event, Round 4
of the series, was Brack's second consecutive top-10 result. He
finished 18th and 10th in the next two races before unlocking the
door into Victory Lane, times three.
</P>
<P>
   At Charlotte, Brack led on seven occasions for 76 laps. He
grabbed the front spot from Jeff Ward with 13 laps remaining on a
1.5-mile facility that is a sister track to TMS.

<P>
   Brack passed Robbie Buhl of archrival Team Menard with three
laps to go to win at Pikes Peak. For added drama, Brack's fuel tank
was empty and his engine dead when he crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, another 1.5-mile oval in Bruton Smith's empire,
Brack passed Ward for the victory with 14 laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest drive I had in terms of wearing myself out
probably was at Charlotte, because they put us down in every pit
stop,'' said Brack, driver of Foyt's No. 14 Power Team
Dallara/Aurora. ``Every time we went into the pits we were leading,
and we'd come out fifth or sixth. The other two have been hard as
well. There are no easy victories. At least I haven't had any.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Sweden, Brack came to this series in 1997 after
making a splash in the International Formula 3000 Championship. He
was runner-up in that open-wheeled series in 1996, scoring three
victories and three poles in nine races. That performance earned
Brack a look from Arrows Grand Prix as its Formula One test driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't really see a future for me in Formula One,'' said
Brack, 32. ``I knew that a newcomer into Formula One wouldn't get a
McLaren or Ferrari drive straight-away. And honestly, if I looked
two, maybe three years up the road, I couldn't see a path leading
to that. I thought that's not for me. I want to race to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack's F3 successes, and his championship in the Barber Saab
Series in this country in 1993, ultimately landed him an IRL ride
with Galles Racing International last year. Hired as a substitute
for the injured Davy Jones, Brack drove in seven races and posted
two top-five finishes. He led three races for a total of 35 laps.
Brack also was the highest-qualifying rookie on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny brought a lot to our team last year,'' said Galles, who
reluctantly parted company with Brack after selling his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win as many championships as he's won without a lot
of talent,'' said Galles, now general manager of Nienhouse
Motorsports, which fields Reebok-sponsored cars for Davey Hamilton.
When Foyt fired Hamilton after last season, he extended free-agent
Brack a contract. Brack will start today's race with a 23-point
lead over runners-up Hamilton and Stewart with only this event and
the season-ender at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Oct. 11 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that Kenny's made Foyt's team, rather than the
other way around,'' Galles said. ``Kenny's a quick-learner and
very, very serious about his racing. Once he learned how to run on
an oval _ and certainly Foyt has a lot of experience in that area _
Kenny brought a lot to that team.''
</P>
<P>
   For Foyt, first four-time champion of the Indianapolis 500, the
Americanization of the guitar-playing, Harley-Davidson-riding Brack
has included having him move to Houston, Foyt's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny is a hell of a good racer,'' said Foyt, winner of a
record 67 Indy-car races. ``He's still got a lot to learn. And
that's one thing, he works real good with me. I've been trying to
help him that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack said this winning streak is exactly what he envisioned
when he signed with the often ornery Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we got together was because I knew he would give me
a car I can win races with,'' Brack said. ``I mean, I guess he took
a chance on me because I had only seven races under my belt in
America last year. But I know I can win races if I have a car that
can win races. So I expected to win races this year, for sure.''

<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Texas A&AMP;M senior fullback D'Andre Hardeman,
the Aggies' leading scorer and rusher this season, has been
suspended indefinitely from the team, school officials announced
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given. He did not travel to the Aggies' game with
Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could, but I can't elaborate,'' coach R.C. Slocum
said. ``And I can't say when it will be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials earlier had said Hardeman missed the first
three days of practice this week because of illness, but said he
was at practice on Thursday in shorts. A&AMP;M's key short-yardage
runner, the 234-pound back had scored four touchdowns in two games
this season to bring his career total to 30, seventh-best in school
history. Hardeman also led the Aggies with 105 yards on 24 carries.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tony Stewart set the standard during
yesterday's final practice session for today's Lone Star 500K with
a lap of more than 224 mph. But Scott Sharp and Scott Goodyear
might have convinced some that today's race could be more than a
battle between Team Menard and A.J. Foyt Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, who fell from first to fourth in points after an
18th-place finish at Atlanta on Aug. 29, posted a speed of 223.464
mph, which is second behind Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp will start today's race in his Delphi Automotive Systems
Kelley Racing entry in third, behind Billy Boat and Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to win this race and get the maximum points we can
get doing it,'' said Sharp, who is 36 points behind standings
leader Kenny Brack.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows exactly if this track is going to be exactly the
same as it is right now. You got to sort of guess. When you get in
there it is going to be subtle changes you make on the pit stop
(that make the difference). You got to hope when you make an air
pressure adjustment or a wing adjustment it is enough or in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear posted a speed of 223.187 mph during the final
practice.

<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Mel Angelstad has bounced around enough
minor-league hockey teams to know that it's just about impossible
to play for the Fort Worth Brahmas one season and the Stars the
next.
</P>
<P>
   But he's hoping to pull off the impossible this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old winger, who logged 19 games and 102 penalty
minutes with the Brahmas in the Western Professional Hockey League
last season, has a two-year contract with the Stars. He is slated
to be the tough guy for their International Hockey League
affiliate, the Michigan K-Wings.
</P>
<P>
   But Angelstad also is the backup to tough guy Brent Severyn. And
if Severyn is hurt or the Stars develop the need for extra
toughness, Angelstad is now just a phone call away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying to earn a job, and I'm no different,'' he
said. ``I just want to perform my role as well as possible, and the
rest will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelstad, who played 63 games and had 321 penalty minutes with
the Orlando Solar Bears of the IHL last season, has an angel in the
organization. New K-Wings coach Bill McDonald has coached Angelstad
in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Fort Worth and says that making the
jump to the NHL isn't inconceivable for his favorite tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the system, they need some depth at that position, and
Mel is that depth,'' McDonald said. ``All I know is that Mel can
fill that role if given the chance.''

POP WARNER TEAM HELPS RESPONSIBLE YOUTHS GROW ON A DUSTY FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SOLOMON B. DAVIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October 1995, after returning to New York City
from the Million Man March in Washington, two former college
athletes, Chris Legree and Ervin C. Roberson, vowed to transport
the march's spirit of racial responsibility to their home
neighborhood in Brooklyn. Since both men had used scholarships to
attain college degrees, they decided to use sports as their vehicle
for change and brought Pop Warner Little Scholars football to a
dusty patch of field underneath the No. 3 train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mo' Better Jaguars have barnstormed throughout the East,
defeating well-established Pop Warner football teams from Syracuse,
N.Y. to Baltimore, and making state history by winning the Empire
State Classic Football Championship in their inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all 15 of the team's coaches say they derive less
satisfaction from perfect spirals or smashing hits than hearing
mothers talk about their children's academic improvement and the
boys themselves testifying about turning down offers to run with
the wrong crowd because they prefer the camaraderie of the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are black men out here teaching black boys how to be black
men,'' said Everton Baker, a conductor for the New York City
Transit Authority and second-year coach of the 11- to 12-year-old
junior midgets team. ``For these inner-city kids, the coaches may
be the only black-male role model they'll have.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 54 percent of black children are reared in
single-female households, and the Jaguars saw organized sports as a
conduit to re-establish contact between concerned black men and
black boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider them one of the upper echelon programs in the
United States,'' said Wesley Johnson, the founder, general manager
and coach of the Pop Warner Maryland state midget champions, Hanlon
Park. ``They're a quality organization with committed coaches,
parents and kids. Not only are they making better boys, they're
making better Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for inner-city youths to play organized football,
because of the high equipment costs and lack of playing fields. Yet
the Mo' Better team has made it possible for 120 youngsters, aged
7-14, to participate in the sport each of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Legree, a 42-year-old electrical engineer for Con Edison and
director of operations for the football program, said: ``We wanted
to create a vehicle that was capable of establishing a bond between
the youth of Brownsville and concerned strong black men and women
and to embed in the residents a sense of community pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We put this together with spit and Scotch tape, and we're
winning championships,'' said Roberson, a 38-year-old architect who
is executive director of operations. ``Imagine what we'd be like if
we had funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by the formidable task of raising $40,000 to fund the
program, the Jaguars have met their budget through a yearly $10,000
donation from Jay Jordan of Chicago-based Jordan Industries (Jordan
met Roberson and Legree when they were competing as athletes);
appropriations from Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp.'sSafe
Haven Program; contributions from local stores; and team
registration fees and the sale of team merchandise, raffle tickets,
bus trips and car washes. When all else fails, the coaches dig into
their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as the Jaguars were on the verge of winning the
regional quarterfinals in Syracuse, the coaches were brooding over
how to finance the semifinal matchup in Marlboro, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches took up yet another collection and were saved by
Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., said George Corbin II,
executive director of planning for the Jaguars who works for the
restoration corporation's Safe Haven program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seemingly never-ending struggle for funding, the
educational component of the program takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to produce a pool of kids who are academically
ready to compete first at Poly Prep, Xaverian, Christ the King and
Stuyvesant High Schools,'' said Roberson. ``And then on to Harvard,
Stanford and Tennessee,'' added Corbin.
</P>
<P>
   All players must take tests in reading and mathematics. Those
who have difficulty with certain subjects must enroll in tutorial
programs operated by Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp. Coaches
visit the schools during the year, and for three hours before every
practice session a licensed teacher assists the players with their
homework.
</P>
<P>
   Players in need of additional attention are referred to school
tutorial services.
</P>
<P>
   Pop Warner, as the national youth sports organization is known,
emphasizes education. A 73 average is one of the eligibility
requirements for individual players and teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't in football, my average was about 70; now that I
play for Mo' Better and hear what the coaches say about getting a
good education, my average stays at 80 or higher,'' said Eric
Figueroa, an 11-year-old second-year player. ``They challenge me to
do better and really want me to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days a week, Figueroa and his teammates practice on Betsy
Head Park's parched grass field. On game days, visiting teams,
accustomed to playing on well-maintained sod, reluctantly square
off on the dusty terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A continual source of emotional support is a group called the
Team Mothers. The eight women, some with children on the team and
some without, help organize fund-raisers, assist in recruiting
players and participate in strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like,'' said Pat Parker, a school secretary at Public
School 13 in Brooklyn, and one of four team managers, ``is the fact
that no matter how well you play, or even if you can't catch a
ball, every child gets a chance to play. The idea is to bring black
boys into contact with positive black men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision this program becoming a model to be emulated in
urban areas across the country,'' said Legree. ``A lot of sports
programs out there distinguish themselves solely for athletic
success. We are a surrogate family that uses football to reacquaint
black men with black families in general, but black boys more
specifically.''

BAYLOR STUNS N.C. STATE
</HEADLINE>

By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ One week after upsetting No. 2-ranked Florida
State, North Carolina State's players received the shock of their
lives yesterday afternoon at Floyd Casey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on grit and determination, the Baylor Bears built a 26-0
halftime lead, then hung on and edged the 20th-ranked Wolfpack,
33-30, in front of 28,734 fans. The victory was a
confidence-builder for a Baylor team that was only 2-9 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really thrilled for our football team,'' Baylor coach Dave
Roberts said. ``That will really help Baylor _ for a football team
that just beat Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we had some good plays, and offensively, we had
some bad plays. We were just fortunate to win and delighted to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   It marked the Bears' first victory against a ranked team since
they defeated 25th-ranked Fresno State, 42-39, in 1993 in Chuck
Reedy's first game as coach. But yesterday's awe-inspiring outcome
wasn't decided until four seconds remained, when Baylor cornerback
Gary Baxter zipped around left end and blocked a 39-yard field-goal
attempt by Kent Passingham that would have tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   During a timeout before Passingham's kick, Baxter played the
role of a psychic, predicting he would preserve the Bears' victory
with a blocked field goal. Earlier, Passingham had missed 41- and
45-yard field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was going to block it, because I wanted this
game more than anybody,'' Baxter said. ``I had a vision. I told the
team we worked too hard to let them come back and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was going to give them my 110 percent, and I
pulled my goodies out of my bag and gave it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning its home opener, Baylor is 1-1. N.C. State drops
to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State coach Mike O'Cain bristled at suggestions that his
team might have come in smug and overconfident after handling
Florida State, 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great concentration coming in,'' he said. ``Baylor may
have been better than we thought they were. It was hard for us to
tell with just one film.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great running backs and an outstanding quarterback.
They played harder and wanted it more than we did, especially in
the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, about that first half.
</P>
<P>
   That was as close to a perfect half of football as the Bears
could imagine. It was as if the football gods permitted Baylor to
do whatever they wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Bears scored a pair of touchdowns and a
field goal when they had the ball and tacked on a TD and a safety
when the Wolfpack had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bryant opened the scoring with a 32-yard field goal. The
Bears went up, 5-0, when N.C. State punter Scott Earwood _
stationed deep in the end zone _ fumbled the snap from center,
which teammate Corey Lyons recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor fullback Derek Lagway then produced one of the
magnificent runs of this young season. Taking a simple handoff,
Lagway rambled through the middle of the line and broke six tackles
en route to securing a 27-yard touchdown and a 12-0 lead late in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had me wrapped up, but I just kept my feet moving,''
Lagway said. ``When I broke loose the second time, I saw the end
zone, and I just dove in.''
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State, which didn't get its initial first down until 1:37
was left in the first quarter, threatened when a 57-yard reception
by Torry Holt got the Wolfpack to the Baylor 7. But on
third-and-goal from the 4, nose tackle Ronald Smith jarred the ball
from quarterback Jamie Barnette with a ferocious blindside tackle,
and Kenyada Parker scooped it up and rambled 82 yards for a 19-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   That 14-point swing came back to bite the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a blitz, and I came outside and the ball bounced up
in my hands,'' Parker said. ``I know I looked slow, but I knew I
was going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Wolfpack, Holt caught touchdowns covering 80 and 11
yards. He finished with 11 catches for 255 yards _ the receiving
yards are the most ever against Baylor _ while Barnette completed
24 of 55 passes for 469 yards and three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor quarterback Odell James scooted around right end for a
4-yard TD that bumped Baylor's lead to 33-23 at the outset of the
fourth quarter. Then the Bears sweated it out in the waning
seconds.

<P>
   The Yankees showed they are human by losing 11 of their last 19
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfair that every time we lose, people say we're
flat or say we're not playing for anything,'' shortstop Derek Jeter
said. ``Sometimes we're going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre isn't worried. ``I think we can rise to the
occasion,'' Torre said. ``We're playing well, but you lack a
certain amount of intensity after you clinch.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Toronto's Jose Canseco has hit the 100-RBI mark for the
first time since 1991. ... The Orioles' loss of assistant general
manager Kevin Malone to the Dodgers was a big one, considering that
everyone expected Malone to replace current Baltimore GM Pat
Gillick. ``It's a big loss for me personally,'' O's manager Ray
Miller said. ... If Yankees right-hander David Cone wins another
game, it will be his 20th and will give him the record for greatest
number of years between 20-win seasons; Cone last won 20 in 1988.
Tommy John, who holds the current record, won 20 in 1966 and 1974.
... Hideki Irabu, in danger of being left off the Yankees' playoff
roster, might have helped himself with eight innings of two-hit,
shutout ball Thursday. ... He hasn't had a great season, but Tampa
Bay's Fred McGriff has 17 homers and 75 RBIs. ``I'm working on
stuff now for the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   White Sox outfielder Albert Belle can become a free agent after
the season because of a clause that allows him to void his current
contract if he is not among the three highest-paid players. But it
is unlikely anyone is going to pay him more than $11 million a
season. ``Right now, I'm not going anywhere,'' Belle said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Since the start of the 1996 season, the Tigers have lost
286 times. ... Royals infielder Terry Pendleton apparently will
retire after this season. ``Trust me, we will know before this
season is over whether I'll venture into trying to make another
ballclub next year or go home,'' the former Brave said. ``My family
has already put their vote in. I won't say (what they voted). It's
truly up to me.'' Pendleton has played in 75 games this season,
hitting .253 with three homers and 29 RBIs. ... Minnesota's speedy
Otis Nixon has only four triples this year, but it is his career
high. ... Indians first baseman Jim Thome, who rehabbed his broken
hand in the minors, said of a recent, long bus trip, ``It was like
`Bull Durham' all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Relievers rarely pitch out of the windup, but that's exactly
what Rangers closer John Wetteland has been doing lately.Wetteland
had struggled recently, with his ERA rising from 1.68 to 2.02
before dropping back under 2.00. He thinks the full windup will
help his rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: One leftover that went almost unnoticed from the day
after Mark McGwire hit No. 62: Mariners slugger Ken Griffey Jr. had
a congratulatory banner flown over Cinergy Field for the
Cardinals-Reds game the day after the historic homer. ``He's in
Cincinnati, my hometown, and it was something to say: `You've
worked hard to get where you're at.' I wanted to say (the Griffey)
family appreciated what he did.'' ... When Angels general manager
Bill Bavasi was recently asked how badly he wanted to make the
postseason, he said, ``How bad do you want oxygen?'' ... Oakland's
Ben Grieve certainly didn't help himself for Rookie of the Year
when he went 109 at-bats between homers. ... Griffey, who has 53
homers and 20 stolen bases, is just the third player ever to hit 50
homers and steal 20, joining Willie Mays (1956) and Brady Anderson
(1996).

 &HT;    On deck: Arizona Diamondbacks
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 4:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Bruce Chen (1-0, 5.79; first
appearance vs. Diamondbacks) vs. RHP Amaury Telemaco (6-9, 3.61;
1-1, 3.29 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Chen is making his third major start and his first as
Kevin Millwood's replacement in the rotation, as Millwood assumes a
spot in the bullpen. The rookie defeated Florida 4-2 last Saturday
for his first victory and while he has been hit in his two
appearances (12 hits in 9 1/3 innings), he continues to strike out
opponents at a high rate with 12. Telemaco has been a staple of
Arizona's rotation after being picked up on waivers from the
Chicago Cubs in June. He has the lowest ERA among the starters
after Omar Daal's 2.70, but has done so with good damage control.
Telemaco has allowed 140 hits and walked 41 in 135 innings this
year but yielded just 69 runs. The Braves catch him after one of
his weakest efforts. He lasted just 3 1/3 innings against San
Francisco last Tuesday, giving up six runs on five hits. He has
worked past the sixth inning just six times in 16 starts.

 &HT;    D-backs deal Embree's relief
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With one June airplane ride, Alan Embree gave up some
40 victories in the standings, an annual date in the playoffs and a
chance to prove himself at the game's highest level. In turn, he
found some peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   From where the ex-Braves reliever sits in Arizona's clubhouse
today, he thinks that's a pretty good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcomed it,'' Embree said of the June 23 trade that sent
him to the Diamondbacks for reliever Russ Springer. ``I wasn't
throwing much. I was getting frustrated just wondering, `Hey, wait
a minute. I'm doing everything you ask me to do but I'm not getting
into games.' They just had a different plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Embree took a string of 16 appearances with just three earned
runs allowed into Saturday night's game against the Braves. His ERA
since leaving Atlanta is an unimpressive 4.41, but much of that
stems from repeated abuse from the Chicago Cubs, who have scored
eight runs off him in four appearances.
</P>
<P>
   After the last game Aug. 3, when he gave up three runs without
retiring a batter, Embree changed from an abbreviated windup
installed by Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone back to his old
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have tweaked a little too much,'' Embree said. ``My
arm was getting sore from what we tried in spring training and I
was tired of getting my brains beat in. I was throwing without
getting anything on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   His current streak (1.69 ERA in 16 games) is what followed. But
Braves followers who watched Friday night's ninth inning witnessed
the sort of frustrations that prompted Atlanta general manager John
Schuerholz to send Embree away.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a five-lead, Embree walked Gerald Williams to open
the inning, then gave up a rocket to Chipper Jones that third
baseman Matt Williams was able to glove and turn into a double
play, catching Williams off first base.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Embree could not finish the inning. Ryan Klesko,
hitting just .203 against left-handed pitching, singled and Andruw
Jones followed with a double into the left field corner. That was
enough for Arizona manager Buck Showalter, who had to bring in his
closer, ex-Brave Gregg Olson, for the final out. He needed just
three pitches to retire Andres Galarraga on a ground-out,
preserving a 5-0 shutout for starter Andy Benes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Braves) had to see what John (Rocker) can do,'' Embree
said. ``Rocker has really had a solid year. I wound up being the
odd man out.''

   The Phillies might trade ace Curt Schilling this winter. General
manager Ed Wade isn't sure, but he said, ``I'm not doing my job if
I'm not thinking about who we could get for Curt Schilling or Scott
Rolen. Does that mean I'm going to pick up the phone and try to
trade them? No. But you have to think about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Braves right-hander Mark Wohlers finished the season with
33 walks in 20 1/3 innings. That's 14.61 walks every nine innings,
the third-worst ratio in major-league history behind Rob Dibble
(15.72) in 1995 and Ralph Lumenti (15.43) in 1958. ... Why are the
Braves pulling for the Giants to win the wild card? They are 7-2
against San Francisco this year but just 18-18 against San Diego,
Houston, the Mets and Cubs. ... If Jim Leyland leaves the Marlins,
expect the club to give strong consideration to putting player
development director John Boles in the manager's uniform again.
Boles replaced Rene Lacheman on a temporary basis two years ago.
... Hideo Nomo is just 6-12, but the Mets think he will turn it
around next season. ``I think it's as much confidence as much as it
is anything else right now,'' general manager Steve Phillips said.
... Former Brave Felix Millan, who had been working as the Mets'
Latin America coordinator, has left the team. Millan's plan is to
run a baseball school with Luis Tiant.

   The home-run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa has been a
regular subject on the David Letterman show, and recently the comic
did a top 10 list of things Babe Ruth would say if he were alive
today. Among them were, ``You call this a baseball team? Where are
all the fat guys?'' and, ``I can't believe all these naked photos
of me on the Internet.'' Also, there was, ``If that's the case, I
would have been impeached from the Yankees 500 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Poor Steve Trachsel. The Cubs starter not only gave up
McGwire's 62nd homer but also was the starting pitcher in the game
in which Sosa went deep for his 62nd. He will be remembered as the
answer to a double trivia question. ... Speaking of McGwire, he is
the only player ever to ask for a cut in salary in the arbitration
process, which he did in Oakland after the 1991 season when he hit
.201. ... With all the Mc-Gwire memorabilia in Cooperstown,
attendance is up more than 7 percent at the Hall of Fame. ... The
Cubs don't sound confident that Kerry Wood will be back this
season. The rookie has a sore throwing elbow, and manager Jim
Riggleman said, ``If we don't get to use him in the stretch, we're
grateful for what he gave us, and we'll try to get it worked out.''

   Giants starter Shawn Estes, who won 19 games last year, missed
two months and has given up 24 runs in four starts since his
return. Is his shoulder still giving him problems? ``I'm fine
physically, but I thought I'd be able to turn it on mentally,''
Estes said. ``It's not as easy as I thought. My focus is not
there.'' And largely as a result, the Giants have all but fallen
out of the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Fans in Denver finally are starting to get tired of
Colorado's play on the field. The club did not sell out any games
on a recent seven-game homestand. ... The Dodgers will be looking
for a new manager after the season, but don't expect it to be
Leyland. Insiders say he doesn't want to live on the West Coast.
There have been rumors that the Dodgers will call the Expos to ask
for permission to talk to manager Felipe Alou. New Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone held the same job with Montreal and has a good
relationship with Alou. ... San Diego's Tony Gwynn, who has been
bothered by a sprained right thumb, is back earlier than expected,
saying, ``I've got to get back in there to get my swing down.

 &HT;    For a night, Atlanta rivals Vegas _ OK, not really
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- This fight night, to get to your seat, you did not
pass through the jangle of slot machines or meet the glassy stares
of sleep-deprived card counters. The gambles of an evening card at
the Georgia Dome were more subtle. Should you really risk eating
that yellow stuff on top of the nachos? Might you get lucky in
Buckhead later?
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal did not shake hands with Kevin Costner, who did
not hug Nicole Kidman before the main event. They must have been at
the Tyson hearing. Let's face it, the star quotient in this part of
the world is not high, especially if politicians or country radio
DJs don't really count. Here, it is sometimes more important to see
than be seen.
</P>
<P>
   This crowd, while game, did not wear the usual quantity of
jewels and glitter. What is the deal with dressing up for the
fights, anyway? You should dress for such an event the same as you
would for a Gallagher concert.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being decked out in neon, this fight locale was
ringed by inspirational banners bearing the Don King logo. ``Only
In America.'' ``Liberty Freedom Honor.'' ``Live Free or Die.'' King
has become the Thomas Paine of his generation. If any state ever
runs out of mottoes for its license plates, there's a shock-haired
fight promoter who would be happy to supply it one _ for 30 percent
of the take.
</P>
<P>
   By none of the usual measures is Atlanta a fight town. But it
played one on cable television Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   What this place lacked in traditional ambiance, it more than
made up for in enthusiasm Saturday. Even while the punches from the
early bouts echoed through a mostly empty Dome, officials were
expecting nearly 40,000 to occupy the place by the time Evander
Holyfield took the stage. It was a shocking pronouncement, a last
burst of optimism that was light years away from the reaction when
this idea was first hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have really thought the town would turn out like this
for an event that featured neither linebackers nor monster trucks?
We are not going to bounce any of the usual sites as Mecca for the
fight game until there are blackjack tables in the Margaret
Mitchell House. But for one evening, this place rocked to the
syncopation of flying fists.
</P>
<P>
   This was a powerful testament to Holyfield. ``The Champ Hits
Home'' was the working title of the promotion. And home hit back.
</P>
<P>
   For one night, Holyfield achieved the status of a soloist with
overwhelming drawing power. The kind not seen in this building
since Michael Jordan came calling, back when there was an NBA.
Seven years ago, Holyfield couldn't create much of a stir in the
Omni. Now, he's creating big Dome buzz. He's making fine progress.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, for those in the Georgia Dome's upper tier last
night, it was a prizefight going on down there on the floor, not a
flea circus.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dome slowly filled with the curious, the growing throngs
were treated to an undercard that was at least as varied as any
carnival midway. There was a fight amongst women (Christy Martin is
still the only name to know, if you must), one that called for a
good amount of kicking (no, Mike Tyson was not involved), something
called an interim world middleweight championship (aren't they
all?), and a really fine battle among featherweights whose combined
weight was just 4 pounds less than Vaughn Bean. All a part of the
endless pageant of professional boxing.
</P>
<P>
   For one night, the city was poised to buy the whole package,
both the courageous and the ridiculous.

 &HT;    Who's nuttier, Tyson or the commission?
 &HT;    By Terrence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Boring fight after boring fight, the boxing universe
spins closer to what it needs most among heavyweights. We're
talking about Holyfield-Tyson III, minus Iron Mike's tribute to
cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   The only questions are these: Which century will the fight
occur, and will both guys enter the ring with walkers?
</P>
<P>
   What Evander Holyfield likes to say about facing Mike Tyson
again is that he'll never say never. Good. In boxing language, that
means it all depends on the bucks on top of the bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney, who shrugged
before Saturday night's fight at the Georgia Dome against Vaughn
Bean and suggested that the chances of Holyfield-Tyson III rank
with those of the Pacific exchanging places with the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander already has beaten Tyson twice, so there isn't an
incentive to fight him again,'' Thomas said. ``Evander's goal now
is to fight the guys who will help him unify the division by
getting the belt (WBC) that he doesn't have. For Evander to fight
Tyson again, there really would have to be a compelling reason for
him to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   To translate, Holyfield-Tyson III is a certainty. We've already
told you about those bucks on top of the bucks. Although Thomas
said that Holyfield never schedules fights for money, it's like
this: The man doesn't have an estate in Fairburn. He has an entire
state. It costs Holyfield $1 million per year just to keep the
lights on.
</P>
<P>
   There will be Holyfield-Tyson III, all right. This was apparent
long before Holyfield threatened to embarrass Bean before the
Georgia Dome masses screaming for the hometown boy. And that was
long before the Nevada State Athletic Commission embarrassed itself
Saturday in Las Vegas with six hours of nothingness in search of
silliness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you recall how Tyson's teeth sort of caught Holyfield's
ears during their meeting last summer. Well, the commission quickly
revoked Tyson's boxing license in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Tyson is seeking to regain his license after waiting
the required year, the members of this holy commission want Tyson
to prove something that nobody else has been forced to prove in
this unholy sport since cavemen threw the first punches. That's
civility.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but whether Tyson kicked, punched or even bit a couple of
folks last month after a car accident in Gaithersburg, Md.,
shouldn't factor into the commission's decision. Neither should
Tyson's explosion during a July hearing to get a boxing license in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Tyson sat out a year and lost enough
millions by not fighting to increase his mighty financial woes. He
paid the commission a $3 million fine. He said he was sorry about
the biting thing. So let's move on with our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the commissioners want Tyson to pick one of three
psychiatrists to evaluate whether he's eligible to join the U.S.
Supreme Court or maybe pilot the next space shuttle. The
commissioners said they'll meet with Tyson again in two weeks after
reviewing the psychiatrist's report.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he feels like Norman Bates, and he should. That's
because this entire process by the commissioners is psycho.

 &HT;    `Little E' growing up
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- He doesn't look much like his father, but on the
Busch Grand National tracks, there's no mistaking him as a younger
version of Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   He has the aggressiveness, the temperament and, OK, the dents in
his fenders. No one is calling Dale Earnhardt Jr. the Little
Intimidator yet. The handle is ``Little E.''
</P>
<P>
   But give him time.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season on the Busch circuit, Junior has displayed
some of his father's fiery style while dashing to the front of the
point standings. In June, after the Pikes Peak 250, he was fined
$5,000 ``for actions detrimental to racing,'' which is a fancy way
of explaining his postrace shoving match with Tony Stewart's crew
chief in the NASCAR trailer. There had been some bumping during the
final laps.
</P>
<P>
   He was black-flagged in July's South Boston 300 and held for one
lap after running into a lapped driver's back bumper and turning
him sideways into the outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   But Junior is learning to keep his temper under control, and the
result is six victories, including last weekend's Busch race at
Richmond, where he led nearly all the way. He has 13 top-fives in
25 starts and has earned $662,135.
</P>
<P>
   The fine didn't break him, but it might have taught him a
lesson. What money couldn't fix, Dale Sr. could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a little talk with him after the races sometimes,''
Dale Sr. said. ``As the car owner, I'm very proud of him.
Hopefully, we can carry on through the year if he can keep his cool
and think about points. As competitive as he is and the team is, we
want to go out and win races and win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks must be doing some good. Little E thought the better
of retaliating against Kevin Lepage in the Food City 250 at Bristol
late last month, even though Lepage caused him to wreck and settle
for 15th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like tearing up race cars,'' Junior said. ``We don't
like having to fix torn-up race cars. We've got a championship to
win, and Kevin Lepage is the last thing on the list, as far as
items to think about. We're going to concentrate on winning the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Junior, 23, hadn't won a Busch race or a
pole. His best finish was seventh in nine career starts. The sudden
success and celebrity have accelerated his growing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea we were going to do this well,'' he said. ``But
we came out of the box running good, and we've become a hot topic.
We've had to become somebody right way. I had never met with
sponsors before. I'd done some autograph sessions, but nothing with
like 3,000 race fans standing in line. I've just always been a
T-shirt and jeans guy. But I don't think that's what cuts it
anymore. I've got to clean up my act a little bit, start shaving
every day, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he is so young and so new to victory lane,
Little E is not that eager to move to Winston Cup, but those are
the plans. He will compete in a few Winston Cup races in 1999, then
go full time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anxious to get there on a full-time level yet,'' he
said. ``I've still got a lot of time before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to see about the competition, see how the show is
run, so to speak. See how much different it is on and off the race
track, compared to the Busch series. Then after running a couple of
those races, I'll know how long I need to prepare for a full
schedule in the Cup series.''

   Clean racing pays for Burton
</P>
<P>
   After his victory at Richmond, Jeff Burton had an answer for
those wondering why he didn't put Jeff Gordon in the wall in last
year's Southern 500 at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came last Saturday night, when Gordon showed Burton
the same respect he had received last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always driven Jeff clean, and he drove me clean at
Richmond,'' Burton said. ``I feel what I gave last year came back
to me. Had we wrecked at Darlington, I bet the outlook at Richmond
would have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon acknowledges he could have taken a cheap shot at Burton,
but said, ``I like racing a guy hard and clean and trying to make
the pass that way. Jeff raced me the same way. It was a heck of a
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Park cleared
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park has been cleared to drive in today's MBNA 400 at
Dover. Park crashed Monday while testing at Homestead and was
hospitalized for a short period of time. He was released after a
CAT scan and X-rays indicated no head injuries.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   BUSCH SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Dover lover
</P>
<P>
   Going back to Dover for Saturday's Busch race was like B'rer
Rabbit returning to his briar patch for Ken Schrader _ it feels
like home. ``I don't know why, but Dover has been a real good track
for me,'' Schrader said. ``It's one mile and you slam down in the
corner, but you're running so fast, it feels like you're running a
quarter mile (track). Winning here (in 1989) was special because it
was my own team that ran on a part-time basis. I love the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Sadler finished sixth here a year ago and is bringing
the same car to Dover Downs. ``We tried something new in the
spring, and it didn't work out. So, we brought `Old Faithful'
back,'' said Sadler. ... NASCAR Busch Series regulars have
dominated Dover races. Bobby Labonte's victory in 1997 is the only
one by a Winston Cup regular in the past 13 races here.

   CRAFTSMAN TRUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Engines break
</P>
<P>
   Scott Walters went into Saturday's Ram Tough 200 at Gateway
International Raceway with redemption on his mind. Last week, his
team suffered its first DNF of the year, an engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are going to happen,'' Walters said. ``In no way
was it a reflection on this team and what we can do. Sometimes
things break.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other failure the team had this year was at Texas Motor
Speedway in April. Walters was out of contention when he tangled
with two other trucks. ``I got a few cuts and bruises in the wreck,
but we were right back in it the next week,'' said Walters, who is
21st in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week
</P>
<P>
   The 15 points by which Jack Sprague leads Ron Hornaday going
into this week's race is the smallest post-Labor Day advantage in
series history. The previous closest margin, 31 points, came in
1995, when Mike Skinner led Joe Ruttman after his victory at
Martinsville. Skinner ultimately became the tour's first champion.

 &HT;    Robert W. Sherman, longtime Cox exec., dies
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Robert W. Sherman, the first president of The
Palm Beach Post and its sister publications after they were
acquired by Cox Enterprises, died Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sherman devoted 50 years to the newspaper business, starting
as a classified ad salesman for the Dayton Daily News in 1928 at
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   He retired Jan. 1, 1979, as executive vice president and a
member of the board of directors of the Atlanta-based chain which
now owns 16 daily newspapers _ including ones in Atlanta, Dayton
and Austin _ and 11 weeklies.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he the top executive of Palm Beach Newspapers Inc.
for six years, but Mr. Sherman helped negotiate the purchase from
John H. Perry in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob had a contact who worked for the (West Palm Beach) paper.
He and I went down and negotiated with Mr. Perry,'' said Carl
Gross, retired senior vice president of the Cox group.
</P>
<P>
   Some details of the purchase were worked out when Perry treated
the two buyers to lunch at Arby's.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase included The Post, the Evening Times, the Palm
Beach Daily News, Palm Beach Life magazine and weekly papers in
Delray Beach and Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Cox purchase, the morning Post and Evening Times
operated under a single editor and a unified staff. Mr. Sherman
divided them into separate newsgathering staffs, each with its own
editor.
</P>
<P>
   The evening newspaper was discontinued in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was a tall, Lincolnesque figure, very quiet. When he said
something, he meant it,'' said Charles Glover, who followed Mr.
Sherman through the ranks of Cox Newspapers and eventually became
president of the parent company, Cox Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Mr. Sherman was named chairman of the board of Palm
Beach Newspapers and resumed his duties as senior vice president
for development for the Cox group.
</P>
<P>
   He negotiated the purchase of the Austin American-Statesman and
other Texas papers in 1976, then took over supervision of the
construction of a Cox newsprint plant in South Carolina until he
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in charge of development during one of the most active
periods in American newspapers. And he was very keen at it,'' said
Clarke Ash, retired editorial page editor of The Post.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sherman advanced through the ranks of the Dayton newspaper,
becoming personnel director in 1958 and business manager in 1961,
handling all the labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   He headed newsprint manufacturing for the Cox papers for several
years in the mid-1960s. When the Augusta mill was sold in 1968, Mr.
Sherman became Cox vice president for development.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sherman also served in the U.S. Army during World War II,
spending most of his tour in France.
</P>
<P>
   He received an honorary doctorate in humanities from the
University of Dayton in 1994, said June Sherman, his wife. Mr.
Sherman started a scholarship bearing his name at the university
because he wasn't able to attend college, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had an interest in helping young people,'' June
Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, June, two daughters and three
stepsons. A memorial service will be held 7 p.m. Tuesday at the
First Presbyterian Church in Boca Raton, 600 W. Camino Real. The
funeral will be held in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations go to
Hospice By The Sea Care Center in Boca Raton or the Robert W.
Sherman Scholarship Fund at the University of Dayton.

STEWART SETS STANDARD IN PRACTICE, BUT SHARP, GOODYEAR READY TO
TUSSLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tony Stewart set the standard during
yesterday's final practice session for today's Lone Star 500K with
a lap of more than 224 mph. But Scott Sharp and Scott Goodyear
might have convinced some that today's race could be more than a
battle between Team Menard and A.J. Foyt Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, who fell from first to fourth in points after an
18th-place finish at Atlanta on Aug. 29, posted a speed of 223.464
mph, which is second behind Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp will start today's race in his Delphi Automotive Systems
Kelley Racing entry in third, behind Billy Boat and Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to win this race and get the maximum points we can
get doing it,'' said Sharp, who is 36 points behind standings
leader Kenny Brack.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows exactly if this track is going to be exactly the
same as it is right now. You got to sort of guess. When you get in
there it is going to be subtle changes you make on the pit stop
(that make the difference). You got to hope when you make an air
pressure adjustment or a wing adjustment it is enough or in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear posted a speed of 223.187 mph during the final
practice.

 &HT;    Fans line river at dawn to watch someone else fish
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moline, Ill. -- There's usually not much to see from the 55th
Street boat ramp at 6 a.m. _ just some ducks congregating near the
Mississippi River shoreline, a barge carrying cargo downstream and
the reflection of the lights on Centennial Bridge, which links the
Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   For the hundreds of fans who lined the river each day this week
to watch the pros blast off in the Wal-Mart FLW Tour World Bass
Fishing Championships, however, there was the bonus of seeing the
sport's best anglers hit the water, the blue-and-white night-time
lights of their boats blurring away up river at 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not something that'll raise goose bumps for many, but
it certainly brings out the bassin' fans, who mix dedication to
their sport with a good measure of insanity to get up before
daylight to watch someone else fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to watch the big boys launch,'' said Rick Salsman, a
second-shift welder from Coal Valley, Ill., who brought his teenage
daughter Mindy to be among the 300 or so at the ramp Thursday.
``The blastoff is pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're pretty nuts,'' Mindy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishermen are nuts,'' her father clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Which might explain Fred Kuntz and Gary Dees, friends from
Moline, who had a breakfast picnic on a table near the activity.
The two weren't quite sure what was going on until someone told
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just hanging out,'' said Dees, who caught a channel
catfish and grilled it for breakfast. He pointed to the river:
``This is our TV.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll find as many different types of people at a professional
bass tournament as there are buzzbaits on sale to catch finicky
fish.
</P>
<P>
   There are family members of the anglers, who brave a hectic
schedule on the road traveling from tournament to tournament to
wish their loved ones well.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kron was in town from Maryville, Tenn., with her
husband, Ben, who was fishing in the nonboater, or amateur, class.
She stood under a street light with Ben's brother Richard and his
fiancee, Shirley, who live in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so bad to get up so early just to watch her husband
``as long as you get to bed early,'' Barbara Kron said. ``Last
night, it was 8 p.m. When the fisherman says it's time to go to
bed, you go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybelline Watts of Grove City, Ohio, was battling a sore throat
but still was able to attend the daily weigh ins at the Moline
Wal-Mart Supercenter to cheer her husband, Robert, also a
non-boater. Her eyes began to water as she explained why the hard
life on the road was worth it to see her husband, who retired two
years ago after battling lung and throat cancer, fulfill his dream
of fishing professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to be able to fish after two years of cancer
treatments,'' she said, ``it's just been a wonderful reward.''
</P>
<P>
   There are the serious anglers who hope to pick up something from
the pros they can use themselves. John Larson and his stepbrother
Jim Collins of East Moline are hoping one day to become pros and
rake in some money like the $250,000 first-place FLW prize offered
this week. They followed friend Wesley Strader, a young pro from
Spring City, Tenn. They were at every weigh in, most of the
launches and even had plans to get out on the water to learn what
they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him in a honey hole,'' Larson said about some advice he
tried to pass along to Strader. ``I just hope he goes there,
because there's fish in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the curious, like Phil Miles of Coal Valley, who
was one of 1,000 or so at the first-day weigh in, because ``I just
wanted to see a nice stringer of bass''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also come to see the celebrities,'' Miles said. ``I see
them on TV. To see them up close and be able to talk to them is
pretty nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass fishing has thrived on its connection with its fans. Often
likened to the fan base of NASCAR auto racing, the fans flock to
the sport's bigger tournaments by the thousands to watch the pros
on the water and at the weigh ins.
</P>
<P>
   The BASS Masters Classic last month in Greensboro, N.C., had
crowds in the tens of thousands just to watch the anglers parade
one by one across the stage and listen to them explain how they
caught 'em or why they didn't. Hundreds more waited on the water
every morning to follow the top pros as they fished, much like a
gallery might follow Tiger Woods at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30 million Americans are bass anglers, resulting in
an industry worth $40 billion. Those numbers have tournament
organizers and sponsors, many of whom are not fishing-specific
companies, realizing the potential payoff in tapping the interest
of the fans, in part with the help of wholesome role models who
star on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the pros who are here are to some fans what Jeff
Gordon is to the racing fans,'' said James Key of Troy, Ala., a
representative of EverStar batteries, one of the FLW sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart FLW Tour, a significant player in the industry in
only three years of existence, had packed more than 10,000 fans
into a large air-conditioned tent by Saturday for the weigh ins.
Thousands more attended the FLW Family Fun Zone area surrounding
the tent, offering family activities like casting contests and
cookie decorating for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially millions more had the chance to see Saturday's final
weigh in, thanks to a satellite uplink that will broadcast the
proceedings to the monitors in the electronics departments at 1,900
Wal-Marts across the U.S. During that broadcast, which will show
the top five anglers going head to head for the top prize of
$250,000 in a format much like PGA coverage, fans will have a
chance via cellular phone to ask questions of the anglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use the analogy of like having the opportunity to
listen in on Brett Favre calling a play during the Super Bowl,''
says Brian Sayner, vice president of communications for Operation
Bass, which runs the Wal-Mart FLW events, ``and be able to ask him,
`Why are you running that play?' ''

 &HT;    Hite bags five fish to win close fight
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. _ Tommy Biffle's prediction that either he or Davy
Hite would win the largest payoff in bass fishing history was right
on the mark. The only problem, however, was that it also meant he
could finish second.
</P>
<P>
   Hite, a six-year pro from Prosperity, S.C., caught five fish
weighing 10 pounds, 13 ounces to beat Biffle, of Wagoner, Okla. _
who also caught five fish _ by 12 ounces to win the Wal-Mart FLW
Tour World Bass Fishing Championship Saturday. Hite, who also had
the highest cumulative total (21-6) for the four-day event on the
Mississippi River, won $250,000, paid to him in a suitcase full of
cash by an armed Moline police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money,'' said Hite after receiving the
briefcase. ``I don't think I've ever seen $250,000 in cash
before.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that it came down to Hite and Biffle. The two
had shared a productive small area of backwater north of Moline in
what is called Pool 13 the entire tournament and had agreed to
divide the spot. There were so many keepable (more than 14 inches)
fish in the weedy spot that it caused Biffle's prediction Friday
when the field was trimmed to five.
</P>
<P>
   Hite said when he found the hard-to-get-to spot during
pre-tournament practice he called his wife, Natalie, to tell her he
found an area that could win the tournament. He didn't think he'd
be sharing it until Biffle, who noticed the area on a map before
checking it out, showed up on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe with one other boat I thought I could still win it,''
Hite said, ``but not with more than one other boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle, whose total included a 4-ounce penalty for returning
with a dead fish, finished second in the event for the second
consecutive year. He also finished second in the BASS Masters
Classic, the sport's other major championship, winning $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the tournament that if I came in second place
again, I'd be mad,'' said Biffle, who'll get another chance at
redemption when the FLW Tour Championship is held on his home lake,
Fort Gibson Lake near Tulsa, Okla., next September. ``It's a big
disappointment, but one of these days I'm going to win one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Klein of Weatherford, Texas, was third with two fish
weighing 4-4, George Cochran fourth with 4-0 and Jerry Williams of
Conway, Ark., fifth with 3-9.
</P>
<P>
   All five anglers started from scratch Saturday, and were
weighed-in in front a crowd of about 1,200 under a large tent used
as a studio for upcoming broadcasts on ESPN. Each angler weighed
their fish one-by-one in a last-man-standing format. Hite needed
2-2 to beat Biffle when his final fish was weighed at 2-13.

LUYENDYK SWITCHES TO BACKUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By LEN HAYWARD and JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Treadway Racing, which fields cars for Arie
Luyendyk, decided to pull its primary entry and use a backup car
for today's Lone Star 500K because of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk had qualified 20th with a speed of 219.646 mph, but he
will start today's race from the back because of the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The team made three engine changes on Friday, and according to a
statement from the team, its third motor, which was the race motor,
``developed a problem that would eliminate it from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The team had only one engine left and it was in the backup car.
Luyendyk also did not run during Saturday's final practice
session. &QL; 
CURRY DENIES FOYT CHARGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Curry, team manager of Team Menard, denied that he and
driver Tony Stewart were playing games Friday in the qualifying
line for today's Lone Star 500K.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt, owner of pole-winner Billy Boat's car, took exception
to a series of decisions by top competitors to pull out of their
originally scheduled spots in the qualifying order during the heat
of the day. Boat, the second driver to qualify, ran an IRL-record
lap at 225.979 mph on a track with a reported temperature of 127
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Boat then had to wait-out the session as pole contenders Greg
Ray (engine change), Arie Luyendyk (engine change), Scott Sharp
(wiring problem) and Stewart (engine change) pulled out of line.
Foyt interpreted those as deliberate moves to get to the rear of
the line, at a time when conditions theoretically would be cooler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear (the rule is) going to be different at Las Vegas,''
said Foyt, referring to the season ender Oct. 11. ``If not, we're
all going to change engines before qualifying. That's what I told
'em. I'm not going to be no goose like I was here, with them
shooting at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody burned their bridges'' Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Curry reiterated that his team had changed engines after blowing
a motor with 10 minutes to go in practice. And Menard confirmed
that the team also changed tires before Stewart qualified at
224.869 mph, to join Boat on the front row. Those moves were all by
the book, Curry said. &QL; 
RAY A MENARD CANDIDATE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Curry said that Ray, a resident of Plano, is a serious
contender for the seat at Team Menard that will be vacated by
Stewart at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the reigning IRL champion, is scheduled to run the
NASCAR Winston Cup schedule in 1999 for team owner Joe Gibbs.
Stewart will be a teammate to native Texan Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some discussions with Ray,'' Curry said. ``I would
say there's a very short list, and he's on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry said team owner John Menard still is considering if he
wants to run a two-car team in 1999. Robbie Buhl is driving
Menard's second car this year. &QL; 
KITE SEARCHING FOR RIDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After this year's Indianapolis 500, Georgia native Jimmy Kite
was one of the hottest drivers in the Indy Racing League. He had a
frustrating week at the famous track because he wrecked his Team
Scandia entry three times before he even attempted to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   He started 26th and ended up 11th, and was among six first-year
drivers to finish in the top 15.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Indy 500, Team Scandia announced that it was
going to take Kite stock-car racing. The team eventually wanted to
move up to Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That deal has since ended, and yesterday Kite was walking
through the garage with noted racing attorney Cary Agajanian trying
to find a ride for next season.

   ENSENADA, Mexico _ As family members buried the victims of a
vicious gangland attack outside this booming weekend resort on
Saturday, many of the California tourists who flock here and the
Mexicans who attend to them tried to put the gruesome massacre out
of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury resort hotels serving tourists from north of the
border filled to near capacity. Two cruise ships pulled into the
harbor on a six-hour shopping layover, disgorging thousands of
consumers in shorts. Surfers, anglers and beer drinkers sprawled on
rocky beaches and lounged in the bars and restaurants downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour's drive by toll road south of the U.S. border,
Ensenada has become an increasingly popular destination for
Southern Californians looking for a several-day ``Mexican
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ensenada's marimba-and-margarita image has long
co-existed with a more sinister reality, which, authorities say,
expressed itself last week. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Eighteen people _ including a baby in diapers, several toddlers
and five other children _ were shot to death before dawn Thursday,
when as many as a dozen gunmen attacked a walled compound six miles
north of Ensenada. Cattleman and reputed drug smuggler Fermin
Castro and members of his extended family lived there.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Thursday's attack was somehow linked to drug
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   For years, cocaine from Colombia, heroin from Asia and marijuana
from Mexico have flowed from ships and planes through the Ensenada
area toward U.S. consumers. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Officials say Castro, a 38-year-old Paipai Indian and former
schoolteacher who had become wealthy in recent years, was one of a
handful of local smugglers who have made Ensenada increasingly
important in the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   After apparently torturing Castro inside his house, the
attackers herded him and members of his extended family against a
low wall in the courtyard between the compound's three houses, then
shot them with automatic weapons and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and a 12-year-old nephew were injured but survived the
shooting, authorities say. His pregnant 15-year-old daughter,
Viviana Castro Tovar, eluded the gunmen by hiding under a bed.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors trickled through Ensenada on Saturday that Castro had
died from his wounds, but government officials insisted that he
remained alive. Army troops guarded the Ensenada hospital where he
reportedly was receiving care.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Castro's family are worried about the safety of his
daughter, Viviana, who escaped the attack unharmed. The girl, who
is seven months pregnant, was taken by government officials for
``safe keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have Viviana Castro in protective custody,'' read a
typed note left anonymously under the windshield wiper of a
reporter's car. ``But what happens to her after she testifies?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those killed in the attack were Castro's wife and their
2-year-old son; Castro's sister, her husband and children; and
Castro's sister-in-law, her husband and children. Castro's in-laws
said the family buried the massacre victims in private ceremonies
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials say they still aren't sure about the
exact motive for the killings. They insist, however, that the
attack had no links to an ongoing struggle pitting a powerful
drug-smuggling clan in Tijuana against another narcotics
organization in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Although shocked by the massacre, many people in Ensenada
insist that the killings have nothing to do with them or their
increasingly prosperous city.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of people die every year in gangland squabbles
related to the drug trade along the U.S.-Mexico border, innocent
people are rarely targeted. Some early theories about Thursday's
massacre suggested that the killings had more to do with personal
feuds or land disputes than narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is stuff between those families,'' real estate developer
Jorge Ramirez said of the massacre victims, who were killed a short
distance from a burgeoning development of luxury houses owned by
U.S. retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with these people,'' he said, nodding
toward the million-dollar houses that stand up the hill from his
office.
</P>
<P>
   A rapidly growing city of about 300,000 people, Ensenada's
economy has been shifting toward tourism and manufacturing since a
U.S. embargo of Mexican tuna has all but killed the local fisheries
industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   New hotels are springing up along the city's rocky coastline.
Foreign-owned factories that will produce electronics, clothes and
other goods for export are being built on the edges of town. A new
sea-front promenade has been constructed, downtown streets are
being improved, and docks for cruise ships are being expanded.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. dollars seem more welcome than Mexican pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are as likely to speak English as Spanish, often
without an accent. Signs along the highway remind visitors _ in
English _ that littering is unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are in your own country, with all its customs,'' Ramirez
said of the city's attractions for Mexicans. ``But you are 50
minutes from the richest country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tourism official Felizardo Palacios has expressed concerns
that the slaughter of unarmed men, women and children might stop
tourists from coming to Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, that has not happened. Palacios said more people
came to Ensenada this weekend than last, despite news of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an annual chili cook-off with rock bands and yard
games kicked off on schedule at a hotel only a few miles from the
site of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with me,'' Roberto Adado, of
Riverside, Calif., said of the massacre, as he cast a fishing line
into the gray surf from a rocky beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrendous, but you're OK, if you mind your own
business,'' he said. ``Just like anywhere else.''

 &HT;    Gingrich avoids scathing rhetoric
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another time, Newt Gingrich would have relished
an all-out attack on President Clinton as much as any other
Republican in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   He would have scoffed at party elders who tried to rein in his
speeches on the House floor, speeches that first made his national
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich would have regarded his more reticent colleagues as too
timid at a time when they should have been pressing their partisan
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, as the speaker of the House, Gingrich is managing
the most delicate issue of his long career in Congress by publicly
urging caution and forgoing by the dozen opportunities to speak
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do our duty. We won't rush to judgment. We won't
refrain from judgment,'' Gingrich said Friday at the Christian
Coalition's annual Washington conference.
</P>
<P>
   He is attempting to strike a balance between assuring
Republicans that their leaders are not backing down from their
pledges to pursue possible impeachment proceedings and reassuring
the wider public that the GOP is not intent on bringing down
Clinton at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on Gingrich's performance. The one thing
Republicans cannot afford is public perception that they are not
being fair to Clinton. Congressional Democrats already are making
those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, denouncing
the House Judiciary Committee's vote Friday to release Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony, specifically asked Gingrich to
``do more to ensure that fairness and bipartisanship will be the
guiding principles of this inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's aides have consistently referred questions about
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to the committee,
declining to put Gingrich's imprimatur on the panel's work.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker has shown up at events on education and agriculture
and he has talked about the GOP's proposed $80 billion tax cut as
part of an effort to show that Republicans intend to take care of
the nation's business, scandal or not.
</P>
<P>
   Touting an education bill, Gingrich criticized a reporter who
asked about the Clinton testimony videotape by pointing out that he
had spent just 45 minutes on the topic out of a 14-hour work day.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has such a strong public image as a partisan that he
has to be especially careful. While his standing in public opinion
polls has climbed over the past year, nearly half those polled by
the Washington Post in July rated Gingrich unfavorably, compared to
a third who viewed him favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The polling issue relates directly to Gingrich's presidential
aspirations. If he turns in a statesmanlike performance, ``he could
come out of this greatly enhanced,'' said Ralph Reed, the
Republican political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would dispel some of the scars of 1995 and 1996,'' brought
on by the government shutdown and his violation of House ethics
rules, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's public demeanor has done little to dispel Democrats'
belief that the speaker is calling all the shots in the Judiciary
Committee's first look at the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and other Democrats said they assume
Gingrich is aware, and at least tacitly approves, of Majority Whip
Tom DeLay's (R-Texas) attacks on Clinton or Rep. Henry Hyde's
(R-Ill.) position in favor of releasing the supporting materials to
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   They also pointed to the letter Gingrich and other Republican
House leaders sent to FBI Director Louis Freeh to ask for an
investigation of allegations that the White House is conducting a
smear campaign against congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker also alluded Friday to the possibility of expanding
the committee's investigation to include such other topics as
campaign finance violations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican House members also have made clear Gingrich's
role in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker told a closed-door meeting of House Republicans that
they should push to make public Clinton's testimony and resist
calls from some in their own party to limit the release of
salacious material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let Newt drive my train. I don't care what the speaker
says I should do,'' Republican Rep. Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina said after the meeting.

BRUINS GET PHYSICAL _ AND GET BURNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ UCLA cornerbacks Marques Anderson and Jason Bell used
the same coverage techniques they employed last week against Texas,
but with a wholly different result.
</P>
<P>
   Their physical style elicited five pass interference calls and
forced them to change their approach _ a change which left them
vulnerable to Houston's aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
   Cougars quarterback Jason McKinley completed 21 of 46 passes for
269 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get aggressive with them, get in their pads, then
the officials starting calling PIs (pass interference) left and
right,'' Anderson said. ``When they started calling them, we had to
ease up. We didn't do anything different than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's maximum-protection blocking scheme prevented UCLA's
blitzers from pressuring McKinley. Without effective blitzes,
Anderson and Bell were left in man-to-man coverage for unusually
long periods. When it's one-on-one in the open field, every second
counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave their quarterback an opportunity,'' Anderson said.
``They got some 15-yard comeback passes on me, and that's unheard
of in Division I.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars appeared to pick on Bell, a junior from Long Beach
who lacks Anderson's sprinter speed. Bell failed on several short
passes, but he did not allow any game-changing completions. In
fact, UCLA's cornerbacks allowed just one long touchdown pass _ a
34-yarder to Jerrian James _ and that came against reserve Ryan
Roques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell was unbelievable,'' defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti
said. ``What a great game. How many times was he out there
one-on-one?''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen update: Two true freshmen played for the first time,
cornerback Julius Williams and defensive tackle Anthony Fletcher,
meaning they are no longer eligible to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Williams joined the rotation earlier this week, when
second-string cornerback Damian Allen quit. The 6-foot-3, 292-pound
Fletcher, from San Dimas, was called upon Saturday after Kenyon
Coleman injured his knee in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a direct result of Kenyon's injury,'' Aliotti said.
``But I see (Fletcher) as being a good defensive lineman. He's big
and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Coleman sprained the medial collateral ligament
in his right knee and probably will miss 3-4 weeks. UCLA's goal
probably is to have him back for the Oct. 10 showdown at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very, very surprised if his (anterior cruciate
ligament) is injured,'' said UCLA physician Dr. Gerald Finerman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, inside linebacker Tony White injured his right
shoulder and is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The Bruins converted just 4 of 13 third-down
attempts.... Houston had 92 plays, UCLA 67.... Larry Atkins led
UCLA with 10 tackles and two pass breakups.... The Bruins had two
sacks, one by Ryan Nece, the other by Billy Pieper.... Nine Bruins
caught passes.

RAY'S CAR OK, WILL START RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Greg Ray figures to be up-and-running for
today's Lone Star 500K in a car that spent most of yesterday in for
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, of Plano, spun out on the frontstraight and tagged the
outside retaining wall in Turn 1 with the left side of his car only
11 minutes into yesterday morning's practice. The left side
suspension on the No. 97 Best Access Systems Dallara/Aurora was
heavily damaged, as well as the left front wing.
</P>
<P>
   But team owner Thomas Knapp and his crew spent the day making
repairs, and Ray is scheduled to take the green flag from his
originally scheduled 12th starting spot for the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the car will be OK,'' said Ray, who missed the entire
final afternoon practice as repairs continued. IRL officials ``are
going to let us run a few laps (this morning). That's a safety
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said A.J. Foyt Racing and Team Menard offered to supply
parts to Knapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had enough parts, and the ones we didn't have we went to
the Dallara trailer,'' Ray said. ``It was probably a $40,000
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray spent part of his downtime reviewing video of the crash
recorded by his in-car camera. Ray had turned a hot lap of 221.157
mph before returning to the pits for fresh Firestone tires. Ray was
in the process of warming those tires when his day went awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right behind Robbie Buhl in turns 3 and 4, and the car
pulled hard left,'' Ray said. ``I kept turning into and then
basically drove right through the grass. When I hit the grass, the
car lost control and it swapped ends. I still can't tell what
happened. I was only doing 150 mph, still going straight, and it
pulled left.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said even his review of the video did not provide a
definitive explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence isn't shaken. When I get in the car, I always
drive the same,'' said Ray, who is eligible for the Texas Two-Step
bonus of $100,000 today. ``I've just had this real uneasiness all
day, because I don't know what happened.''

SILENCE OF THE PIGS  
 KING'S WIN WAS BIG BLOW TO CHAUVINISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many men felt like civilization as we knew it ended 25 years ago
tonight in the Houston Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   That evening Billie Jean King beat a 55-year-old hustler named
Bobby Riggs in a tennis match that had little to do with tennis and
everything to do with social change.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us who attended the ``Battle of the Sexes'' and openly
rooted for Mr. Riggs are still paying off bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folded the laundry?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet dear,'' we sing out from the kitchen, one oven mitt on
fire. ``I'll get to it right after dinner. Hope the casserole is
all right. It's a little brown on top. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King may have done as much in one night to empower
women and advance the women's movement _ and gender equity in
sports _ as Susan B. Anthony and Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   They should mint a coin in her likeness, or honor her with a
commemorative stamp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a foolish bet and a grave mistake to place our faith in
Riggs. But most males in the crowd of 40,000 did. We felt it was
our duty. Like fraternity brothers, we had to stick together.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1970s the women's lib movement was in full
flower. A showman and shameless self-promoter, Riggs earned
national notoriety by challenging the best female tennis players to
a winner-take-all match. Margaret Court accepted. Riggs beat the
No. 1 ranked woman convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   King was ranked No. 2. Riggs wanted her next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman wants to get in the headlines, she should have
quintuplets,'' Riggs declared. The 1939 Wimbledon champion and
card-carrying male chauvinist said he wanted to join the women's
pro tennis tour. Easy money. Riggs even offered to undergo ``the
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice,'' King recalled. She knew this was
vaudeville. Riggs' goading was pure shtick. ``But I had to play
Bobby. And I had to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the big night, the Astrodome was as divided as the House
Judiciary Committee. Four of us went together, a double date. The
seating arrangement was he, he, she, she. The guys were the ones
wearing ``Pigs For Riggs'' buttons in support of the aging sex
symbol, whose duck-footed walk and dinky style of tennis cast him
as a plucky underdog. Actually, Bobby was an 8-5 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Females in the crowd stood as one when King entered the arena
carried on a Egyptian litter like Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   We counted on Riggs. The flamboyant huckster with his suitcase
full of vitamins assured us he would win. Riggs declared that if he
lost he would jump off a bridge, although looking back I don't
recall him ever saying which one.
</P>
<P>
   If I can ever bring myself to write a book about the experience
the title will be, ``The Night Tennis Went A-Ms.''
</P>
<P>
   Our man didn't just lose. Billie Jean woman-handled him.
</P>
<P>
   Then 29, at the top of her game, King had too much youth and
strength and speed. She took Bobby's moon-shot lobs out of the Dome
lights and rifled them back. She ran Riggs around like a show dog.
She owned the net.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second set, as our tiring standard bearer
wound down like a grandfather clock, members of the women's pro
tour happily began passing out gag tickets to a ``Bobby Riggs
Bridge Jump.'' King won in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   I recall walking with my buddy to the car in silence, two steps
behind our dates, avoiding their smug superior smiles.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the match wasn't much more than a carnival stunt.
``It didn't mean that much to me personally because I didn't feel
like I beat anybody,'' King said. ``I think Bobby was born in 1918
_ the same year my dad was born. ``What I didn't expect,'' King
said years later, ``was how it helped women in general to gain a
little courage. Their self-esteem went up a little bit. I walked
into a newspaper in Philadelphia a few days later and the people in
the newsroom stood up and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women gathered around and said they had felt underpaid for
a long time. They deserved a raise, but didn't have the guts to ask
for it. They said, `The day after you played Bobby, we went in to
see the boss and asked for a raise.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `The important thing is, did you get it?' And they
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People draw strength from odd places. If my winning encouraged
someone to take a little more control of their destiny, if it gave
them the guts to take a chance, even if they failed, then that
makes me happy.'' &QL;

FOR GARRETT, MONDAY IS HUGE DAY
</HEADLINE>

By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jim Garrett, former quarterback, former
coach and current NFL scout, spent much of the past 30 or so years
preparing his son for tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett will play the biggest game of his six-year NFL
career when he starts at quarterback for the Cowboys against the
New York Giants (7:20 p.m., WFAA/Channel 8) at the Meadowlands, 50
miles from his parents' home in Monmouth, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Garrett won't be there. Nor will his wife, nor Jason's
three brothers, each of whom is a football coach. Nor any of the
rest of Jason's seven siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Garrett won't allow any distractions to interfere with Jason
Garrett's mission the next four games, the chance of a lifetime.
Jim Garrett, who in his playing career made cameos with NFL and
Canadian teams, understands.
</P>
<P>
   While Troy Aikman recovers from a broken collarbone, Jason can
do more than follow in his father's footsteps. It's an opportunity
Jason began preparing for as a youngster, when he used to make his
brothers catch passes in ``the dead of winter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that I have a job to do because he's been
around it,'' Jason Garrett said. ``How he prepared and approached
the game was a great example for me. It's what I've tried to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up with a value system that you should do what you
want to do in life. We had opportunities to go to a place like
Princeton and we had varied experiences there. We graduated and had
the choice to do what we wanted to do. And we all chose to be
around football. It's something we've been around and love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett attended an Ivy League school to get an Ivy League
education _ an Ivy League football education. Princeton coach Steve
Tosches remembers Garrett's being around the fieldhouse so much, he
wondered how he ever graduated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always referred to Jason as being born in a huddle because
he always hung around his dad, his dad's teams and on the
sideline,'' said Tosches, who coached Jason and his brothers John
and Judd at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he graduated, I kiddingly asked him when he went to
class, because he was always at the fieldhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Good things always seem to happen to Jason Garrett. Cowboys fans
will never forget Thanksgiving Day 1994, when he led the Cowboys to
a 42-31 comeback victory over the Green Bay Packers. Replacing the
injured Aikman and Rodney Peete, Garrett completed 15 of 26 passes
for 311 yards and two touchdowns, winning NFC offensive player of
the week honors. His teammates called him Rudy after the movie
about the legendary, undersized Notre Dame walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was a long time ago,'' Garrett said. ``But it was a
great day for me and will give me fond memories the rest of my
life. I can draw from the experience. That game will certainly help
me against the Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd Garrett has seen the Green Bay effect work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There was that time Jason returned to New Jersey and went with
his brothers to their favorite bar down the street. Judd said
nothing special had ever happened there before. But on this night
Bruce Springsteen walked through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big joke around the family is that he is a Ferris Bueller
type,'' Judd said. ``Things always work out for him or happen
around him. He's always meeting famous people or having something
special happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys deep snapper Dale Hellestrae, who hangs with a group
that often includes Garrett, Aikman and former Cowboys lineman Mark
Tuinei, said his friend's personal interests are diverse, ranging
from golf to crossword puzzles to dinner with his wife, Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae added, however, that the strait-laced Garrett can be
kind of wacky if you consider his karaoke singing
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you ever heard him sing, you'd think it was kind of
wacky,'' said Hellestrae.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting for this week that one of Garrett's favorite songs
is ``New York, New York''.
</P>
<P>
   If he does ``make it there'' tomorrow night, credit goes to
Garrett's approach to the game of football, which is based on an
intense work ethic and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   They are a byproduct of the lessons he learned from his father
and served him well during early career struggles.
</P>
<P>
   After earning Division I-AA All-America honors as a Princeton
senior, Garrett was considered too slight of build and arm strength
on NFL draft day. He began his career as an rookie free agent in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   He made the practice squads of two NFL teams, played in the
Canadian Football League and the World League before earning a spot
on the Cowboys' roster in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Garrett, a coach with the Saints, said his brother's
perseverance is another family trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad kept trying until there were no more opportunities,'' Judd
said. ``He kept at it until all the doors are closed. Jason did the
same thing. Now it's paying off for him.''

SOSA GOES 0 FOR 4; REDS BEAT CUBS, 7-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For their last homestand of the season, the Chicago
Cubs planned a full weekend of festivities to honor Sammy Sosa,
culminating in a ceremony before Sunday's game that the Cubs
promised would rival the gift-showering in St. Louis on Sept. 8
after Mark McGwire's 62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, has said he will attend
the game Sunday, and Saturday the Maris family made its first trip
to Wrigley Field to see Sosa play. And as the attention on the home
run chase grew _ if that is even possible _ Sosa went 0 for 4 with
three strikeouts in the Cubs' 7-2 loss to Cincinnati, their second
straight to the fifth-place Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has not hit a homer since he smacked his 63rd home run in
San Diego on Wednesday night; he is 0 for 12 since then, and 0 for
7 against the Reds. In his fourth at-bat Saturday, he grounded into
a double play to end the game; he has failed to hit the ball out of
the infield since coming home to Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Cubs back into a tie in the National League
wild-card race with the Mets, who beat Florida Saturday, 4-3. It
has now been 42 days since more than one game separated the two
teams in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sosa's three strikeouts, the 40,357 fans at Wrigley, led
by the Maris family in the front row behind the Cubs' on-deck
circle, vigilantly stood and cheered for his at-bats, trying to
will Sosa into hitting a home run. In a tally on the roof of one of
the houses across Waveland Avenue from the ball park, a giant 63
was changed to a 64 during every at-bat, and then returned to 63.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' starter, Jason Bere (2-2), gave up Sosa's 56th home
run here on Sept. 2. Saturday he pitched eight innings, his longest
outing in more than three years. He gave up a single to Lance
Johnson to start the game and then did not yield another hit until
the sixth inning; it was the only other hit he gave up. Cubs second
baseman Mickey Morandini hit a single in the ninth off reliever
Danny Graves, Morandini's 1,000th career hit, before Sosa hit into
the game-ending double play. The three hits for the Cubs brought
their total for the series to just nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sammy, you just have to challenge him and go at him,''
Bere said. ``I tried to mix it up a little bit, and today it
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Reds' pitchers again managed to baffle Sosa, the
sell-out crowd did get to witness a home run display by a powerful
right fielder; it just was not the one they came to see. Reds right
fielder Jon Nunnally hit two home runs and drove in four runs, both
of which tied career-best performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows I'm a human being,'' Sosa said after the game.
``The last couple of days they've just been pitching me great.''

WILLIAMS' HEISMAN HOPES TAKE HIT AS LONGHORNS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ For the second consecutive week, the Texas
Longhorns boosted the Heisman Trophy campaign of an opposing
quarterback and helped shovel dirt on the candidacy of their
record-setting tailback.
</P>
<P>
   For a second consecutive season, they will limp into a game
against Rice coming off abject humiliation on network television.
This time, fifth-ranked Kansas State inflicted the damage with
yesterday's 48-7 shellacking in front of 43,714 at KSU Stadium and
an ABC regional audience.
</P>
<P>
   What the rout lacked in terms of point differential when
compared to last year's 66-3 loss to UCLA was offset by the
across-the-board dominance of the beating. Kansas State scored
touchdowns on offense, defense and special teams. The Wildcats
stopped Ricky Williams from crossing the line of scrimmage on six
of his first 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just in the first half, which ended with Kansas
State on top, 35-0.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Texas concluded its most lopsided loss to a
conference opponent since a 50-7 pounding by Baylor in 1989,
Williams' Heisman hopes were hanging by a thread, and the Longhorns
(1-2, 0-1 in Big 12) were conceding they were no match for the more
physical Wildcats (3-0, 1-0). Especially not with redshirt freshman
quarterback Major Applewhite (16-of-37, 232 yards) forced to make
his first start on a windy day against the nation's top-ranked
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got outmatched and ran into a buzzsaw,'' said first-year
Texas coach Mack Brown, whose team was outgained 405-292 and lost
the turnover battle, 4-2. ``We're just not ready for a team like
this at this point in our program. To be honest, I was amazed ...
Major did as well as he did. This is the wrong place for a redshirt
freshman quarterback to make his first start.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite was forced into duty because of a broken finger
sustained by starter Richard Walton. Kansas State greeted him by
crowding nine men at the line of scrimmage to slow Williams, who
rushed for 375 yards and nine touchdowns in Texas' first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite never forced the Wildcats to change their defensive
approach, and Williams never gained more than seven yards on any of
his 25 carries. He was thrown for losses five times and finished
with 43 yards (1.7 per carry), his lowest output since _ all
together now _ last year's debacle against UCLA, when Williams
carried 13 times for 36 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they've got nine men waiting and you've only got seven
blockers, the numbers don't work out,'' said Williams, who watched
Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop account for 223 yards and
three touchdowns in a second consecutive matchup of Heisman
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's rematch with UCLA, Bruins' quarterback Cade
McNown threw for 329 yards and three touchdowns in a 49-31 victory.
Being overshadowed by fellow Heisman candidates in consecutive
weeks ``is going to hurt me, but not kill me'' in the chase for
college football's most coveted honor, Williams predicted.
</P>
<P>
   More telling for Texas' bowl hopes will be shoring up a defense
that allowed 5.7 yards per snap and a punt-coverage unit that
watched David Allen average 43 yards on four runbacks, including a
93-yarder for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although Applewhite completed three passes longer than 30 yards
and connected with Wane McGarity on a 13-yard touchdown strike, he
also threw two interceptions. One killed a drive that reached the
Wildcats' 19-yard line, and the other was returned for a touchdown
by linebacker Jeff Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way I played because of the
interceptions,'' said Applewhite, who nonetheless drew positive
review from coaches and teammates. ``Even though people expected me
to make some mistakes, it makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scoring on two returns, Kansas State turned three
Texas turnovers into touchdown drives of 23, 23 and 80 yards. They
also had touchdown marches of 80 and 69 yards, while Texas took
just three of its 65 snaps inside the Wildcats' 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't move the ball ... and we had too many turnovers,''
Brown said, summarizing the Longhorns' long day. ``Everyone feels
miserable.'' Extra points Williams' first-quarter fumble was his
first in 143 carries. ... Freshman defensive end Jermain Anderson
recorded his first career sack in the fourth quarter, prompting
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder to slam his headphones. ... Snyder
kept his first-team offense in the game until 2:53 remained.

WITH MARIS' MARK DOWN, IS GRETZKY'S NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took 37 years before two sluggers named Big Mac and Slammin'
Sammy came along and broke Roger Maris' single-season home run
record of 61 set in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But with the final days of the historic 1998 baseball season
upon us _ as fans wonder how many more homers Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa will hit _ it spurs the question as the NHL preseason
unfolds: Will anyone ever come along to break Wayne Gretzky's
fabled single-season goal-scoring record?
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone even know what it is? Go ahead, guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but I know it was a lot,'' said Robert Francz, a
1997 draft pick by the Coyotes who was born in Germany. ``How many
did he score?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-something, isn't it?'' asked Juha Ylonen, the Coyotes'
young center from Finland. ``It was 91, right? No, it was 92. Is it
92? I'm pretty sure it was 92.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was 92.
</P>
<P>
   And no, most people don't think it ever will be topped.
</P>
<P>
   As monumental as McGwire's and Sosa's personal Home Run Derby
has become, Gretzky's incredible run of 92 goals in 80 games during
the 1981-82 season with the Edmonton Oilers may stand the test of
time.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa have eclipsed Maris' record, but they haven't
buried it the way Gretzky shattered Phil Esposito's mark of 76
goals, which he scored in 78 games for Boston in 1970-71. The Great
One surpassed it by 16 goals. By comparison, that would be like
McGwire or Sosa swatting 77 homers _ something that obviously won't
happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's record is safe, in my opinion,'' said Esposito, now
the general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning, during a visit to
Phoenix last year. ``It just can't be done again.''
</P>
<P>
   Others share Esposito's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nobody's going to score that many goals. Not in this day
and age,'' Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick said. ``The game has
changed too much. There's more of a defensive-style system now. The
players are better. The defensemen are better. The goaltenders are
much better. It's a much more controlled game. It's not sporadic.
People are in better shape. There's just too many things you can
associate with the game now that you couldn't before.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biggest thing is, I just don't think there are any
players who were as good as Gretzky was when he was in his prime.''
</P>
<P>
   Some great ones have come along since The Great One. Mario
Lemieux. Brett Hull. Teemu Selanne. Paul Kariya. Jaromir Jagr.
Pavel Bure. Mats Sundin.
</P>
<P>
   A new brand of power-forward goal snipers also have burst on the
scene. Eric Lindros. Peter Forsberg. John LeClair. Keith Tkachuk.
But of all of them, only Hull and Lemieux have ever come reasonably
close to the magic No. 92 scored by the magician, No. 99.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988-89, his fifth NHL season, Lemieux pumped in 85 goals for
the Pittsburgh Penguins. He did it in 76 games, four fewer than
Gretzky played during his historic, record-setting year. In
1990-91, his fourth full NHL season, Hull did Lemieux one better,
scoring 86 goals for the St. Louis Blues that year, also in 76
games.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as it was, it was still six goals too few. And it
was only the third-best individual goal total to date. Gretzky
tallied 87 in 1983-84, playing in 74 games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull came close. Lemieux came close. Others have sniffed
at the mark, too.
</P>
<P>
   During an 84-game schedule in 1992-93, Selanne and Buffalo's
Alexander Mogilny, who now plays for the Vancouver Canucks _ the
Coyotes' opponent today in a preseason game at America West Arena _
each tied Esposito's old standard by netting 76 goals to lead the
league. For Anaheim's Selanne, then a first-year player with the
Winnipeg Jets, it's a number that has remained in the record books
as the most ever by a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a guy who could do it, it might be Selanne,''
Roenick said. ``Maybe Kariya. Maybe even Bure, when he's lighting
it up. Forsberg, too, although he's a different kind of player
altogether. If they broke in back then, they could have scored 80
goals or more, easy. But it's different now.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't in baseball. Reggie Jackson is on record as saying he
could hit 70 homers or more if he were playing in today's game at
his prime. Expansion and weak pitching, he said, would almost
guarantee it. Fellow Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt virtually said the
same thing a week before.
</P>
<P>
   But expansion has hit the NHL, too, supposedly diluting talent.
There also are more great pitchers in baseball than there are great
goalies in hockey. And don't forget, the NHL has opened up the ice
this season, clamping down hard on obstruction penalties, moving
the nets up a few feet and putting tighter restrictions on goalie
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Is it certain Gretzky's 92-goal season is safe?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one who could have topped it would have been Mario
Lemieux,'' said Coyotes center Cliff Ronning, who scored 89 goals
during his last year in the Canadian junior leagues. ``Other that
that, I don't see it happening. Maybe 20 years from now, someone
will beat it. It'll be some young kid from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith isn't so sure. Smith, the
No. 1 pick in the 1978 NHL draft, played against Gretzky for 14
seasons, including the memorable 92-goal campaign of 1981-82.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an absolutely unbelievable feat,'' said Smith, who
coincidentally had his best season the same year, scoring 43 goals
and 114 points. ``The thing about Gretzky is, he never quit. End of
the second period, up 5-1, he would go and get four points in the
third period. Mario Lemieux would stop. Up 5-1, he'd go into cruise
control and the game would end, 5-2. Gretzky, the game would end,
9-2, and he'd have another goal and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will ever happen again. Right through
coaching, from the time kids start to play hockey now, there's more
of an emphasis on defense. Pee-wee coaches want to have systems.
They use videotapes. It just seems so unlikely that record will
ever be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is from the same guy who initially thumbed his
nose at The Great One. Smith was entering his final season of
junior hockey when he was over at a friend's house and some kids
from nearby Brantford, Ontario, stopped by.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there's this kid from their hometown, Wayne Gretzky,
and he's going to play in the same league as you,'' Smith said.
``I'm like, `Yeah, sure. Right. I'll be sure to keep an eye open
for him. Whatever.' . . . Little did I know.''
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as scoring 93 goals in a single season might be,
Gretzky thinks the toughest scoring record in hockey to beat is the
one he set the same year for the fastest 50 goals from the start of
a season. Maurice Richard and Mike Bossy set the standard with 50
in 50 games. Gretzky shattered it by hitting the half-century mark
in just 39 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you never expect to score 50 goals in 39 games,''
Gretzky said. ``I never expected to score 50 goals in a season. I
don't know if anybody will ever score 50 goals in 38 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might happen. To say say it will never happen is wrong, but
I think that's going to be the hardest record for someone to
break.'' &QL;

WETTELAND'S WORKLOAD SCRUTINIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates sought out
closer John Wetteland for a heart-to-heart chat before last night's
game with the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was Wetteland's workload. Wetteland had pitched four
days in a row, and Oates left the meeting with the idea he was
going to give his closer a night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't want to get John where he's not available
for the final eight games,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy decision. Oates has to fight temptation and a
pitcher who does not like to refuse combat assignments. Wetteland
has a 1.95 earned-run average and a club-record 41 saves, and Oates
knows there's nothing worse than blowing a division title without
his best pitcher on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But that's part of life as a closer. Wetteland had pitched in
four consecutive games, but prior to that, he had appeared just
once in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a strange year that way,'' Wetteland said. ``I
remember remarking to a couple of guys in the bullpen, I haven't
logged a ton of innings, and I don't understand why sometimes I
hurt. But then I realize, this year it's been where I pitch four
out of seven games, then zero out of seven. It's been spurts. It's
been interesting but fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland has been used on four consecutive days twice this
season and three times in his career. Oates is reluctant to use any
closer more than four consecutive days, even one who is in good
shape, as Wetteland is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys in this game who, for whatever reason, after
three days they'll say, I can't go out again,'' Oates said. ``Not
John. He's in pretty good shape ... and he eats a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wetteland: ``I want to go out there. All day long I've been
a little short-tempered. I'm anxious to go, I want to keep going. I
don't want a day off. I can't wait to throw the baseball and see
what I've got. If I can't throw, that's one thing. But if I can
throw and if I have stuff, then I don't see any reason why I
shouldn't be out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I praise God my body has been durable as far as my arm
responding and being able to do stuff. The times I've been on the
disabled list have been for a broken toe and a pulled groin muscle.
I don't worry about that aspect or even pain. To me, it doesn't say
anything if a player has pain. We all have that, we just deal with
it and see what can get out of it.''  &LR; tagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817)

DE LA HOYA CLEARS HURDLE  
 DOMINANCE OF CHAVEZ STEP TOWARD GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya's victory Friday night over Julio
Cesar Chavez is a potential rite of passage in the career of a
young fighter trying to become a great one.
</P>
<P>
   In finally destroying his boyhood hero, De La Hoya, 25, took a
big step toward eliminating the boy in himself.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Often, it was downright painful. An hour after
the final blow, not even dark sunglasses could hide purple welts
that swelled beneath De La Hoya's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And it was wasn't always impressive. There were moments when De
La Hoya lost his balance and looked confused, even vulnerable, to
the aggressive, close-quarter tactics employed by Chavez, 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a smart plan,'' De La Hoya (29-0, 24 KOs) said
after he retained the World Boxing Council's welterweight title
with Chavez's surrender after eight rounds at Thomas &AMP; Mack Center.
``I did the total opposite of what we talked about. I was way too
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it seemed so tough. I could have stayed on my toes
and outboxed him. But people don't want to see that. They want to
see me fight.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more chances to see De La Hoya fight. On Nov. 21,
he faces African Ike Quartey, who was stripped of the World Boxing
Association's welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey is an opening chapter in De La Hoya's career after
Chavez. It is the initial chance for him to define himself against
a young rival with recognized credentials. Quartey-De La Hoya looms
as a milestone toward maturity and beyond Friday night's passion
play.
</P>
<P>
   The second bout with Chavez was loaded with potentially
dangerous emotions. De La Hoya was angry at the old man, who did
not acknowledge him as an equal after a victory in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After the rematch, it was clear Chavez's only chance was a
mistake committed by a young man blinded by emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, perhaps because Chavez no longer can withstand
punishment long enough to capitalize on the momentary, late lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat the old Chavez, the best Chavez anybody has seen in
the last five years,'' De La Hoya cornerman Gil Clancy said. ``He
did not beat a shill. He beat a great fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't knock him out. De La Hoya promised a KO. Perhaps,
an exhausted Chavez denied him that chance. Perhaps it wasn't a cut
at his lower lip, but the fear of an imminent KO that led to
Chavez's failure to answer the bell for the ninth round.
</P>
<P>
   For De La Hoya, the result will be questions about his punching
power. Chavez raised doubts by saying he ``was not a true knockout
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but Chavez had no doubt about one thing: He wasn't
talking about the Golden Boy anymore. Today, De La Hoya's old
nickname is just a bunch of kid stuff. &QL;

OSHA _ It's not easy to place a value on human life. Juries have
set its worth in the millions. In Arizona, however, a worker's life
is worth a little less _ about $3,000. That's the median fine paid
by Arizona companies for safety violations that contributed to the
death of a worker, according to a computer analysis of Occupational
Safety and Health Administration records by The Arizona Republic.

<P>
   OSHA-POWELL _ One button could have saved Cory Powell's life.
But it didn't work. Powell, a 35-year-old trash collector from
Mesa, was decapitated in 1994 while working in the bed of a garbage
truck. He left behind a wife and two daughters. OSHA investigators
said Powell might have survived to take care of his family if his
employer had bothered to maintain its trucks or train its workers.

OSHA-REDDEN _ Painters Robert Redden and Greg Gauthier were
probably in a hurry on that Christmas Eve in 1992. Their foreman
was on his way to the bank to get their paychecks, and they had
last-minute shopping to do. Both had big plans. Redden, 22, was
getting married in a week. Gauthier, 19, was studying to get his
general equivalency diploma. They were finishing up, taking down a
40-foot aluminum ladder. Suddenly, it began to topple, falling
toward a 7,200-volt power line. ``Somehow that ladder got away from
them,'' recalled Lorne Williams, former owner of Allied Painting.
``They grabbed the ladder and tried to catch it. It was aluminum,
and it hit them wires and cooked them.'' Both men were killed. By
BILL MULLER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

<P>
   OSHA-GARCIA _ Macario Garcia feared the one thing that killed
him. Last year, after climbing an 8-foot ladder to install
fluorescent lights in a renovated office building, an electric
shock hurled Garcia to the concrete floor. He died 16 hours later
from head injuries. He was 40. ``He once told my younger brother
that it gave him chills to get up there,'' said Marilyn Chavez,
Garcia's sister. ``I wish I had known that before.'' OSHA
inspectors cited Garcia's employer, Keystone Electric, $6,500 for
unsafe working conditions and inadequate training. Keystone
appealed and eventually paid $2,625. By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER. Story

RISKS (Washington) _ Fit, trim and tan at age 77, John Glenn just
grins and gives a thumbs up when asked whether he's worried about
the health consequences of being the oldest astronaut ever. But
some scientists and aging experts admit they are ``holding their
breath'' about the Oct. 29 flight's risks, which they say could
include a heart attack or stroke _ even for a superathlete such as
Glenn. Many worry because there are no data on whether anyone
Glenn's age can withstand some of the challenges of this ride in
space. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

DON'T CALL PADRES PARTY-POOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres players were not nearly as wrapped up in
the moment as their fans and franchise after  &UR; Sammy Sosa slammed
his 63rd home run early last week.
</P>
<P>
   Most Padres players were, to put it mildly, steamed after
watching how their organization saluted Sosa after he cracked a
grand slam in the eighth inning that broke the tie at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to a man, Padres players said they felt betrayed by their
fans and the club, which shot off fireworks and flashed a huge
``San Diego Salutes Sammy Sosa!'' on the scoreboard after the
Padres, who recently clinched their second National League West
Division title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa's a good friend of mine, and he's had a great
year,'' Padres left fielder  &UR; Greg Vaughn said. ``But what the
(expletive) is going on? We're trying to do something for this
city, and the fans are rooting for this guy to beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring a championship to San Diego, and they're
pulling for him to hit a grand slam. Everyone in this clubhouse
feels like we have our road uniforms on. Are we the enemy? No one
here understands. We're confused. With us or against us?
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Tony ( &UR; Gwynn) lines out to Sammy and they applaud. There are
a lot of (steamed) players in here. ( &UR; Kevin) &UR; Brown is.
( &UR; Trevor) &UR; Hoffman is. This is supposed to be our city . . . our
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Sterling Hitchcock was lustfully booed the night before
when he threw several pitches out of the strike zone against Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's garbage,'' Hitchcock said. ``And the biggest bunch of
crap is the fireworks our organization set off after he homered.
It's a joke. . . . a flat-out joke. We're playing for something.
And the fans turn on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said  &UR; Gwynn: ``I don't need to add anything else. A lot of guys
are very upset. They feel that us as an organization and the fans
went overboard out of respect. It's not a happy place. Everyone
understands the significance. But it went way overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres simply should have let the fans pay homage to Sosa,
not get involved themselves. Now they have alienated their players,
and that's just plain dumb, especially with the playoffs starting
next week. &QL; 
Arizona Belle-weather? &QL; 
 &UR; Albert Belle has returned to the top of the leader board in just
about every power category in the American League. Now the big
question is where he will wind up next season.
</P>
<P>
   With three players averaging more than his $10 million annual
salary, the White Sox left fielder can escape the remaining three
years on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes Chicago,'' Belle's brother and confidant  &UR; Terry Belle
said. ``People don't really bother him much. He wants to retire
with the White Sox and play until he's 40.''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds promising for the White Sox, the man himself
spoke last week when Chicago was in Cleveland. Remaining in Chicago
doesn't seem like a lock.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, I'm not going anywhere,'' said Belle, who
last week became the fourth player since 1950 with at least 400
total bases. ``But you never know what will happen at the end of
the season. Certain payrolls could take on big-money guys.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Belle lives in Tucson in the off-season. And the
Diamondbacks strongly considered courting him when he was a free
agent two years ago _ yes, a year before they before they took the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does opportunity knock twice, right,  &UR; Jerry Colangelo? &QL; 
The cat's hat &QL; 
 &UR; Mark McGwire had an autographed cap sitting in his locker the past
several months, one he rarely noticed. The cap was given to McGwire
by St. Louis broadcaster and former Cardinals player  &UR; Mike Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   It was signed by none other than  &UR; Roger Maris, but McGwire
didn't learn of the special significance until a few days after he
broke Maris' single-season home run record. Maris died of cancer in
1985 but gave the cap to former teammate and then-Cardinals Manager
 &UR; Whitey
 &UR; Herzog in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger told Whitey, `Give this to the guy who breaks my
record,' '' said Shannon, who like Herzog was one of Maris' closest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire learned of the cap's significance after a reporter
filled in the All-Star first baseman two nights after McGwire broke
the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that until you told me just now,'' McGwire said.
``I knew it was something special, because not many people got
those hats, from what I understood. So I knew it was special. But I
didn't know it was that special.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said the cap is white and shows Maris' name with the
number ``61'' twice, signifying the record 61 homers that Maris hit
for the Yankees in 1961. &QL; 
Pepe Le Pew strikes back &QL; 
San Diego reliever  &UR; Roberto Ramirez thought it was a pretty good
idea at the time. Boy, was he wrong. Ramirez saw the skunk who
lives in the bowels of Qualcomm Stadium the other night, poking his
head out near the Padres bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez fired a baseball at the skunk but missed. The skunk came
back with a fastball of his own, spraying toward the bullpen. The
relievers immediately scattered as the smell permeated the left
field corner of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dumb things done and said in the bullpen should remain in
the bullpen,'' Padres reliever  &UR; Randy Myers said. &QL; 
Thin-skinned? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Veteran umpire  &UR; Ed Montague was so enraged at what he believed
was a slap in the face of one of his fellow umpires on his crew in
Philadelphia last week that he stopped the game and stormed into
the dugout to call the press box and order the song ``Double
Vision'' be taken off the stadium's loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems  &UR; Brian Gibbons might have missed a close call at first
base and the old hit from Foreigner blared over the speakers.
Montague was told the music was for the Phillies' next batter,
 &UR; Alex Arias, who had three doubles in three at-bats that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a  &UR; Sinatra fan,'' said Montague, who admitted he'd never
heard of the group. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A true measure of greatness: Chicago's  &UR; Sammy Sosa has hit 50
home runs since  &UR; Roger Clemens last lost a game, which occurred May
29, when Sosa had 13 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No wonder their payroll is less than $10 million: Florida has
used 17 rookies in its rotation this season and 27 rookies overall,
which, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, is the most used in
the expansion era (since 1961). The previous record was 25 by the
1969 San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Ron Kittle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A case of the rich getting richer: The Atlanta Braves have
three players ( &UR; Andres Galarraga,  &UR; Chipper Jones and  &UR; Javier
 &UR; Lopez) with at least 100 RBIs for the first time since 1970 when
 &UR; Hank
 &UR; Aaron,  &UR; Orlando Cepeda and  &UR; Rico Carty all reached the century
mark.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here's someone we'd love to see managing in the
 &UR; majors some day: Scottsdale resident  &UR; Mike Gallego just might wind
up in the Boston Red Sox organization next spring as a minor league
coach or manager. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
 &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. became the fourth youngest player to reach 1,000
RBIs Tuesday. The three ahead of him place Griffey in high company.
 &UR; Mel Ott (27 years, 94 days),  &UR; Jimmie Foxx (27, 236) and  &UR; Lou
 &UR; Gehrig (28, 287). Griffey was 28 years, 297 days old when he
reached the plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's  &UR; Bret Boone, a probable Gold Glove winner, joined
 &UR; Joe Morgan as the only second basemen in the Reds' storied history
to hit 20 home runs in one season. Morgan hit at least 20 home runs
four times during his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City scored at least one run in each inning while
trouncing Oakland, 16-6, last Monday. The last time an American
League club managed that feat was May 11, 1949 when the Chicago
White Sox beat Boston. St. Louis did it Sept. 13, 1964 against the
Cubs, the last time a National League club managed the feat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terry Mulholland, who has replaced rookie sensation
 &UR; Kerry Wood in the Cubs' rotation, has a 2.51 ERA in four starts.
``I've always known what I can do physically,'' said Mulholland,
who very well could be in someone's rotation next season.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffman joined  &UR; Bobby Thigpen (57 in
'90),  &UR; Randy Myers (53 in '97) and  &UR; Dennis Eckersley (51 in '92) as
the only players to have at least 50 saves in one major league
season.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia catcher  &UR; Bobby Estalella thought he was going back
to south Florida to hang out for the winter. He was wrong. The
Phillies want him to go to the instructional league to improve
throwing out base stealers (he's 4 for 30). They also want him to
play winter ball in Puerto Rico. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
With General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone on board with the Dodgers, the
club's attention turns to finding a manager for next season. The
list of early candidates (in no particular order): Montreal's
 &UR; Felipe &UR; Alou, former Baltimore Manager  &UR; Davey Johnson and former
Texas and Boston Manager  &UR; Kevin Kennedy, who just may be the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Manager  &UR; Jim Leyland, who probably will not return to
the Marlins, is also a candidate to land the Dodgers job, but only
if he is willing to move to the West Coast, which seems unlikely.
Leyland could, however, be in line for the Detroit or Colorado job,
both of which will probably open.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with a Dodgers theme, it's become fairly well known
inside baseball circles that Los Angeles is desperately trying to
peddle Gold Glove catcher  &UR; Charles Johnson, who is arbitration
eligible and likely will land a 1999 contract worth at least $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati GM  &UR; Jim Bowden, who was passed over for the Dodgers'
GM post, is attempting to take over in Baltimore, where
 &UR; Pat Gillick is not expected to return. Bowden received his club's
permission to interview for the Orioles' job. Others in line are
Cleveland assistant  &UR; Dan O'Dowd and Florida assistant  &UR; Frank Wren.
</P>
<P>
   If Montreal GM  &UR; Jim Beattie decides to leave (he already has
turned down a contract extension), then scouting director
 &UR; Fred Ferreira likely take over. If Ferreira does not become general
manager, he could wind up taking over as Seattle's GM if  &UR; Woody
 &UR; Woodward is let go.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has offered a minor league supervisory job to fired
Detroit Manager  &UR; Buddy Bell, who is expected to accept. Bell still
lives in the Cincinnati area. It would not be impossible think Bell
could one day manage the Reds. &QL;

 &HT;    Maddux fighting uneasiness
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix _ Bobby Cox thinks he threw well. Eddie Perez, his
catcher, thought he pitched better than he had in weeks. Even plate
umpire Ed Vanover felt he pitched well enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greg Maddux awoke to the same uncertain feeling Saturday
morning. He hasn't won in five starts, his last victory coming Aug.
23. In losing 5-0 to Arizona Friday night, he yielded 10 hits for
the third time in six games. Before Saturday's game, he even
wondered where he would fit into the postseason rotation, a
stunning thought from the pitcher who still leads the majors in ERA
(2.24).
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at where the balls are being hit,'' said Cox. ``His
velocity is up. He's still quick. He's had some bad luck. But he's
striking out more people than he ever has. He's just been hurt on a
few certain pitches or some ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux went over the 200-strikeout mark for the first time
Friday night, when he fanned nine, but it was little solace. He has
no explanation for his current plight, and it should be remembered
he had pitched 12 scoreless innings before the Diamondbacks scored
five times between the third and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some balls were hit hard,'' Maddux said. ``Some weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made some great pitches,'' said Perez. ``I don't
think he's been making those pitches the last two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has just one tune-up start, probably three to five
innings Friday against New York, before heading into the
postseason. And where that takes him is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez returns
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez made his first start at catcher in four games after
receiving a cortisone injection for a case of tendinitis in his
left elbow. He still has difficulty fully extending his arm but
that discomfort is expected to dissipate as the soreness from the
injection, made on the underside of the forearm, wears off over the
weekend. Lopez said he began experiencing the pain after ``a bad
swing.''Line-up matters
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Danny Bautista made his first start since Aug. 24 and
will wear a lightweight brace on his right knee (slight tear,
medial collateral ligament) the rest of the season. Right-handed
set-up man Rudy Seanez is expected to pitch today, if not Tuesday,
after throwing at nearly 100 percent in two bullpen sessions. Cox
is continuing to tinker with his rotation for the Florida series.
Cox has tentatively scheduled Kevin Millwood to pitch Tuesday in
Florida instead of John Smoltz, followed by Denny Neagle.

 &HT;    Albatross for Vols is a Gator
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- When last Tennessee beat Florida, Phillip
Fulmer was but an interim coach, a career assistant kicked
momentarily (or so it was thought) upstairs until Johnny Majors
returned from heart surgery. When last Tennessee beat Florida, on a
stormy day in 1992, it marked the end of Majors' reign and the
beginning of Fulmer's. Six years later, the opponent over whose
back Fulmer clambered to the top stands as the reason his
stewardship remains unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   As head coach Fulmer has beaten everyone save Florida. Almost
half his losses _ he has only 11 _ have been to the Gators. Yes, he
has won the SEC title, and yes, he has made Tennessee a fixture in
the Top 10, but he cannot be said to have succeeded until he whips
Florida on something other than an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the inability to beat Alabama drove Bill Battle out of
town, just as a similar failing undid Battle's successor, the
once-sainted Majors, Fulmer has found himself a nemesis. His
winning percentage (.833) is nearly as splendid as Steve Spurrier's
(.838) is at Florida, but where it counts, Spurrier has owned
Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   Five in a row, none all that close, the worst being in 1995 when
Tennessee led 30-14 and lost 63-37. Peyton Manning came and went,
infamously going 0-for-Florida. On Sept. 21, 1996, what seemed the
Vols' best shot fizzled on the launch pad, Florida taking a 28-0
lead before 107,608, then an NCAA record crowd. Were hype a
measurable quantity, the ballyhoo for that game might also have set
a standard.
</P>
<P>
   Having aimed so high and missed so often, the Big Orange seemed
to approach this year's Florida assignment with something
approaching moderation. If a game between the Nos. 2 and 6 teams in
the land can be understated, this was. Yes, CBS had it in prime
time, but somehow the sporting day didn't seem to revolve around
Neyland Stadium. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were playing 90 miles
apart in the Central Time Zone. Evander Holyfield was fighting in
Atlanta. And don't the Gators always win this game anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was fairly light by big-game standards. The lead story
on 1-A of the Knoxville News-Sentinel had to do not with Saturday's
game but with Monday's videotape release in Washington. Maybe the
low-key approach aided the home side. Tennessee took an early lead
simply because the Gators kept messing up.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, sloppy as ever, made three turnovers and were called
for seven penalties in the first half. The Vols took a 10-3 lead on
the strength of one long run _ fullback Shawn Bryson went 57 yards
against an overshifted defense _ and a mini-drive to a field goal.
With 5:06 left before halftime, the Vols took the ball at their 26
with a chance to throw a hammerlock on the halting game. They went
nowhere, punted to Florida and saw the Gators tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing had been decided. Indeed, the impression left by this
first half was that neither team was as strong as in previous
seasons. But another half remained, time enough to make a stronger
impression, perhaps even time enough for Phillip Fulmer to break
through against the bane of his existence.

 &HT;    Error-prone LSU holds off Auburn
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ The tone was set immediately. On the first play
from scrimmage, Kevin Faulk sped for 7 yards and the LSU coaches'
headsets went dead. Just the first of many Cajun faux pas on an
evening when LSU was often the bungle Tigers. And still won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a finished product,'' Gerry Dinardo, said in an
understatement after his No. 7 Tigers overcame their mistakes and
Auburn 31-19 Saturday night. ``There were times we did not look
very good out there. But you come on the road in the SEC, I guess
looking good is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in your SEC opener and in Jordan-Hare Stadium, where
a capacity crowd of 85,214 saw LSU's Herb Tyler pass for three
touchdowns and run for a fourth. Especially on a night when you
have two extra points blocked and one returned for a 2-point
conversion. When two quarterback sneaks don't gain an inch but give
Auburn hope. When you lose a fumble at the Auburn 7 and, very
nearly, your quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all that calamity, LSU finally prevailed in a game
it dominated and should have won handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had times when we could've been a little bit better
offensively, but we just didn't knock 'em out,'' said Dinardo, his
team now 2-0, 1-0 in the SEC and clearly the early season best in
the SEC West.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spot them 14 and lose by 12, that's about as close as
you're going to come,'' said Auburn coach Terry Bowden, whose
Tigers (1-2, 1-1) have now lost four of their last five home games.
Bowden got 285 yards passing and two TDs from Ben Leard
(21-for-38). But Leard, the beneficiary of several blown coverages
by LSU in the first half, was intercepted three times and had 127
yards passing in the second quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked them apart in the first half,'' said Leard, who
threw a 54-yard TD pass to fullback Heath Evans (later lost for the
year with a broken ankle) and a 22-yarder to Karsten Bailey that
drew Auburn within 19-14 at halftime. ``I was able to sit back in
the pocket and throw. But they mixed it up in the second half and
put a lot of pressure on us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clarence LeBlanc intercepted Leard on Auburn's first play
and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown, Thomas Dunson recovered
Michael Burks' fumble on Auburn's next play at the Auburn 26. That
led to Tyler's third-down, 5-yard quarterback draw for a TD. But a
blocked extra-point attempt kept it 13-0 and Leard-to-Evans cut it
to 13-7. Tyler hit tailback Kevin Faulk (88 yards on 21 carries) on
a 19-yard TD pass, but Leard's 10-yard scoring pass to Karsten
Bailey made it 19-14.
</P>
<P>
   LSU dominated the third quarter but turned it over at the Auburn
18 when two Tyler sneaks got nothing. He later fumbled at the
Auburn 7. Even after Tyler hit Larry Foster on a 29-yard TD pass,
the PAT was blocked and returned by Auburn's Brad Ware to make it
25-19.

 &HT;    Virginia jumps on Tigers early, then holds on
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ In a matter of seconds, what would have
been Tommy West's finest victory as head coach at Clemson turned
into his most bitter defeat as the Tigers dropped a 20-18
heartbreaker to No. 10 Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers snatched the game away early, gave it back late
and then took it back in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fault our effort,'' West said. ``We made way too many
mistakes to go on the road and play a top 10 team.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes, without a doubt, cost Clemson (1-2) the game.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (3-0) jumped on top 17-3 in the first quarter as
quarterback Aaron Brooks had his way with the Tigers defense.
Thomas Jones scored on a 31-yard run after a fumble recovery and
Brooks threw a 20-yard scoring pass to Kevin Coffey. The Cavaliers
looked headed for an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia was unable to score again in the half and that gave
Clemson new life after intermission.
</P>
<P>
   After trapping Jones in the end zone for a safety, the Tigers
caused Virginia fullback Tyree Foreman to fumble. Clemson safety
Antway Edwards picked it up and didn't put it down again until he
reached the Cavaliers' end zone 93 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, still leading 17-11, then allowed Clemson to open the
final period by moving 87 yards in six plays, with Tigers
quarterback Brandon Streeter hitting Brian Wofford with a 54-yard
scoring strike to give the Tigers an 18-17 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if that might be enough, but with 3:55 left,
Virginia began a drive on its own 34. On a third-and-8, the Tigers
were called for holding, and then on a third-and-10 from the 46,
Edwards was whistled for a pass-interference penalty on Virginia's
Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers moved to the 10, and Todd Braverman kicked the
game-winner with 49 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was picture perfect,'' Edwards said of his
defense against Coffey. ``I got my hands on the ball. I couldn't
play it any better.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was doubly bitter because the Tigers were pummeled
37-0 last week by Virginia Tech at home and could have redeemed
themselves here.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being beaten like we were last week, the worst thing we
could have done was to fall behind 17-3,'' West said. ``Instead of
throwing in the towel and saying we'd had enough, we tried to find
a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   West said the two-point loss was probably worse than the
37-point defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we lost is much more emotional,'' he said, ``it rips
your gut out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They got off to a great start early,'' Edwards said, ``but we
never lost our composure, and I thought we played a great second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never happy or satisfied with a loss, but the guys and
the determination and the fight ... I don't know if I've ever been
prouder.''

 &HT;    Gamecocks thunderstruck by Marshall loss
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Marshall reached a milestone in its two-year
history as a I-A school Saturday night with a 24-21 victory over
South Carolina, not the best SEC school, but an SEC school
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, the Thundering Herd could have trampled
embattled coach Brad Scott's hopes of keeping his job after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied and the Gamecocks on the move, Marshall's
Daninelle Derricott picked off his second Anthony Wright pass at
the 50 and returned it 30-yards to put the Herd on the 20. Three
plays later and after calling time out with two seconds left, Billy
Malashevich kicked a 37-yard field goal for the victory and
Marshall (3-0) players thundered onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks (1-2, 0-1 SEC) were hurt in the first half by the
loss of two fumbles inside the Marshall 10 and a chip-shot field
goal attempt that hit a goalpost. An interception to begin the
second half was just as damaging in the first meeting between the
schools, as Marshall then covered 23 yards for a 14-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, led by junior quarterback Chad Pennington who is
already being touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate, took its first
win over an SEC school in 11 tries before 78,717 at Williams-Brice
Stadium, the largest crowd to ever see Marshall play. Marshall has
now won 35 of its last 39 games, as Pennington has found plenty of
other receivers since Randy Moss left for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A trick play by the Thundering Herd led to a 21-10 lead.
Pennington took the snap, pretended that the play was an
end-around, but really put the ball on the ground. Chapman picked
it up and ran untouched around left end for the 7-yard score with
6:25 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gamecocks had a trick up their sleeves, too. They faked
a field goal on fourth-and-1, and ultimately scored on an 8-yard
pass from Anthony Wright to Kerry Hood. The Gamecocks made a
2-point conversion on a Wright pass to Hambrick for a 21-18 margin.
The two receivers redeemed themselves after being the two players
who fumbled in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was short on a 46-yard field goal attempt with about
seven minutes left, then the Gamecocks made a 36-yarder to tie the
score.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, which called timeout on its first play from scrimmage,
wasted no time figuring out what to do against the Gamecock
defense. On the drive, Pennington was 5-for-5 for 46 yards,
including a 17-yarder to freshman Gregg Kellett on third-and-11
from the South Carolina 30. He followed that with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Lanier Washington for a 7-0 lead with 11:04 left
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On South Carolina's first possession, the Gamecocks were on
track to post an answering score when Wright passed to Hood at the
Marshall 9. A thundering hit delivered by Derricott caused him to
fumble the ball, which was recovered by a member of the Herd.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, South Carolina lost its second fumble
inside the 10, this time when Troy Hambrick was stripped of the
ball at the 5.

 &HT;    Florida's success on 3rd-down plays has been backbreaker for
Volunteers
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knoxville, Tenn. _ Tennessee knew it would have to win several
battles in order to emerge victorious Saturday night in the war
against No. 2 Florida, but none would be bigger than battles that
took place on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's success on third down against Tennessee has more or
less defined the last five meetings of the two teams, all won by
Florida. During the winning streak, Florida has converted 34 of 74
third downs. If you include the four fourth-down conversions in the
1996 game, the Gators converted nearly 50 percent of the time
against the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the kicker: Over the last five games with Tennessee,
Florida has converted third and 7 or longer 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't put a finger on (why Florida has been so
successful),'' said Steve Johnson, Tennessee's senior cornerback.
``Some of it is coverage breakdowns. Sometimes it's the pass rush
that doesn't get there at the right time. Sometimes they just make
great plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In last year's 33-20 victory, all three of Florida's offensive
touchdowns came on third down. Playing well on third down was a
point of emphasis for Tennessee's defense in the off season, but
the Vols struggled against Syracuse and Donovan McNabb in their
opener. Syracuse converted eight of 16 third-down situations,
including a third-and-23.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely close
</P>
<P>
   Over 107,000 fans packed Tennessee's Neyland Stadium, hoping for
a close game, which has been rare lately against Florida. The
Gators' margin of victory against Tennessee in the past five games
has been 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we've been able to get an early turnover or two and
get on top of them,'' said Florida coach Steve Spurrier. ``But I've
got a feeling that this one is going to go down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosey speaks
</P>
<P>
   The trash talking from both teams was kept to a minimum this
week, but Tennessee guard Cosey Coleman did take a little shot at
the Gators. Coleman, the former high school All-American from
Southwest DeKalb, said he went on an official visit to Florida
while he was being recruited but decided to pass on the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little too cocky down there for me,'' he said.
``They were bragging about how good they were, and how they were
the cream of the crop of the SEC, and how they planned to stay that
way. I knew they were a good team, but it just wasn't right for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing powers
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee linebacker Eric Westmoreland suffered an ankle injury
Wednesday but after some serious rehabilitation Thursday was
cleared to play against Florida. Westmoreland spent the entire
night Thursday at the Neyland-Thompson Sports Center getting
treatment for the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Phillip Fulmer said he could never recall a Tennessee
football player spending the night getting rehab. But in 1997,
Tennessee women's basketball player Kellie Jolly was able to play
in an NCAA Tournament game 48 hours after a severe ankle injury.
She, too, spent an entire night in the complex getting treatment.

MILLER IS EAGER TO LEAD  
 EARLY MISTAKES HELP LINEBACKER MATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Tony McCombs needs a few pointers about his new
position, right outside linebacker, and Jamir Miller is there for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth needs to adjust where he is
lining up, and Miller gets him in the right spot.
</P>
<P>
   Practice is a few beats below performance level, and Miller
pipes up, although not loudly enough, he would say after the
Cardinals suffered a season-opening rout at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Team leader and Jamir Miller: Not an image that came immediately
to mind when, as a wild 20-year-old who had left UCLA a year early,
Miller finally arrived at his first training camp _ 15 days late _
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Or when he was suspended by the NFL for four games in his second
season after violating the league's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   Miller reflected what too many youngsters with too much money
are about. Misguided. Unaccountable. Rebellious. Underachieving.
Arrogant. Self-centered. A good party was far more important than a
good game against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   With the grace of one of his rangy strides, Miller has covered a
lot of ground since those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in people, so it doesn't surprise me at all,'' said
teammate Aeneas Williams, a four-time Pro Bowl cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was as optimistic as Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Jamir at the scouting combine when he was coming
out, and it amazes me that this is the same guy,'' Cardinals
defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``He came out as a young
kid. Now he's a professional. He's not just a guy getting paid to
play football, he's a professional football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Ryan and his staff berated Miller, trying to coax the
talent out of him that they knew he had when they made him a
first-round draft pick. Miller blew them off.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran linebacker Seth Joyner got to him, though, taking Miller
under his wing and showing him how to be a professional. Some of it
sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   And then, more and more did.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Vince Tobin and his staff came in for the 1996
season, Miller was getting the hang of what it took, on and off the
field. Ironically, Miller became so dependable that the club was
confident cutting Joyner in 1997 and moving Miller from the right
linebacker spot into Joyner's left side position.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller is filling Joyner's shoes in more ways than one as a
respected veteran who leads by example, filling a void on a unit
crying out for a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assessment of what makes a good leader is one who leads by
example, yet when needed gives that push to bring everyone else
along,'' Miller said. ``Now when I say something, people do listen.
You have to pay your dues in order to be in that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rah-rah type of guy, never have been, never will be.
But the thing is, people respond better when you perform on the
field. That's what they respect. Then they listen to what you're
saying because they figure what you're doing has to be right. It's
not about trying, it's about doing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a maturation, a transformation that perhaps only the likes
of Williams could have anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamir has taken a quantum leap in terms of understanding the
game,'' Williams said. ``He was fortunate to have a guy like Seth
Joyner here in his younger years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Jamir has taken on his own personality and maximized his
productivity. There's no doubt he has gained the respect of the
team, not just the defense, and not just the linebackers. He is the
veteran of our linebacking corps now. Roles are reversed now. Jamir
is doing the same thing, tutoring our young guys, that was done for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said there is more to his maturation than the passage of
a few football seasons, or even having a friend and mentor such as
Joyner. Miller's marriage to his wife, Racquel, and the birth two
years ago of their daughter, Ashlynn, really caused the lights to
go on for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed me a lot,'' Miller said. ``That showed me there
is more to life than just me.''
</P>
<P>
   His coaches could see the change in Miller immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all of us who have a family, he grew up,'' McGinnis said.
``We all come to a crossroads in our lives. You can go this way, or
you can go that way. He realized `that way' might not be a real
good way to go. He went the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Miller more often than not went the right way,
accounting for a career-high 139{ tackles and causing foes to run
away from him. He made 5{ quarterback sacks. At 6 feet 5 and 266
pounds, Miller is as big as most defensive ends, making him ideally
suited for the left side _ the one most teams attack for the tough
yards. He's also as fast as many safeties. As a high school
sprinter, he broke 11 seconds in the 100-meter dash.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he came out of college early, to cash in as quickly
as possible as a pro. And that's why two coaching staffs have done
everything they could to get him to reach that potential. Finally,
Miller has responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear this cliche a lot, but he's playing the game with
passion,'' said Cardinals linebackers coach Glenn Pires. ``He's
getting after people. With Jamir, the sky is the limit. He has all
the good qualities you'd want in a linebacker. He has improved
tremendously, but he has a long way to go. He can be as good as he
wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two games this season, Miller has 17 tackles, a sack and
a fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a guy with talent, you bend over backward to
try to get him into your system and get him to play,'' Tobin said.
``Players all have different buttons you have to push to get them
to perform. In Jamir's case, the buttons were first having patience
and then being demanding in getting him to do things in a certain
way, our way. There were some tense moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see him today, it's really a tribute to Jamir. He is the
one who decided that he needed to change both on and off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Ashlynn has Miller focused squarely. On the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one that lives in the past,'' Miller said. ``The
things that happened helped me grow. I'm thankful that some of them
happened. If they hadn't, I probably wouldn't be in the position
I'm in now. They showed me basically how to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask if I marvel at how far I've come. Not really. I
look more toward the future to see what that may hold for me. I
marvel at that.'' &QL;

MCGWIRE IS NOW CHASING NORMALITY, AS CARDS BEAT BREWERS, 7-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Mark McGwire loves it and hates it. He loves that
tens of thousands of fans drive hours just to see him swing his
bat, that fans in opponents' stadiums stand and cheer every time he
moves toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire is bothered that his successful assault on
baseball's single-season home run record has led people to see him
as otherworldly, as someone who, for now, is larger than the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has hit more home runs in one season than anyone in
history, the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman wants to be viewed
as normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around you change,'' McGwire, who hit his 64th homer
here Friday night against the Brewers, said before Saturday night's
game. ``They want to touch you; they want to shake your hand; they
want to say that they said hi to you. Just the other day, I was in
Houston, going out of the dugout after the game, and people were
touching me, and the comment I heard was: `Mom! Dad! I touched him!
I touched him!' It's weird that because of something you do, people
look at you differently.''
</P>
<P>
   It was definitely true a few hours later. The 54,132 fans in a
sold-out County Stadium stood and cheered. It was the third inning,
and everything was pointing toward another history-making home run.
</P>
<P>
   Both team's pitchers were struggling and two of McGwire's
teammates, Brian Jordan and Fernando Tatis, had already homered off
the Brewers rookie Steve Woodard. And the diminutive St. Louis
shortstop Luis Ordaz had hit the ball off the left-center-field
wall on one bounce in the Cardinals' three-run second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the drama were the powerful bats the Brewers were
wielding. Ripping the offerings of the St. Louis rookie Jose
Jimenez, Milwaukee also scored three runs in the second, one of
which was knocked in by Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of the Cardinals' lineup took batting
practice against Woodard, McGwire stumbled. To the dismay of the
Brewers' largest crowd this year, the home team's right-handed
finesse pitcher struck McGwire out on a called third strike that
nipped the outside corner of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Through eight innings, McGwire had struck out three times and
failed to add any distance between himself and Chicago's Sammy
Sosa, who had 63 homers after going 0 for 4 Saturday in a loss to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday night's game, McGwire would have seven games
left, including one here Sunday, to add to his record-breaking
total. His son Matthew, 10, has given him a number to shoot for,
but McGwire will not reveal the figure. ``I'm pretty close,'' he
said. ``I'll tell you when I get there.'' Sosa has six games
remaining but could get another game's worth of at-bats if the Cubs
and Mets faced each other in a wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hasn't enjoyed facing the Brewers' staff. When he hit
his 64th homer an estimated 417 feet Friday night off the rookie
Rafael Roque, McGwire got his first homer this season at County
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's first at-bat Saturday night, Woodard, who allowed
seven runs and nine hits in five and two-thirds innings, did
something few pitchers have done this year against McGwire. Moments
after Jordan hit his 24th home run an estimated 430 feet, Woodard
drilled McGwire in the back. It was only the sixth time this season
that McGwire was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people try to pitch him outside rather than inside,''
Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner had said, explaining why McGwire is
rarely hit. ``Some pitchers are afraid of it now. We're in a
kinder, gentler society.''

 &HT;    `I feel like Norman Bates'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- If Mike Tyson wants to earn millions in a boxing
ring, he will have to go to Europe. At least for the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced of Tyson's mental stability, the Nevada Athletic
Commission declined Saturday to reissue a boxing license to the
fallen former heavyweight champion. The commission listened to
testimony for six hours in Las Vegas, then decided to postpone its
decision until at least Oct. 3 after Tyson has been evaluated by an
independent psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say he's normal and can fight again, then we have the
responsibility to maybe, probably, license him to fight again,''
said commission chairman Elias Ghanem, who will give Tyson a choice
of three psychiatric institutions from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) at this time we just don't feel like we have enough
information. I must say that if it had come to a vote today (on the
license), I would have voted no.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who has been out of boxing for 15 months since being
disqualified for twice biting Evander Holyfield's ears, is expected
to comply with the commission's request. If he fails to get
relicensed, or merely believes future attempts are futile, he will
almost certainly fight overseas. Other countries are not required
to comply with disciplinary measures by U.S. commissions. There
already has been talk of Tyson fighting Axel Shultz in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada commissioners also are ``uncomfortable'' _ a word used by
officials James Nave and Luther Mack _ with the two assault cases
pending against Tyson, stemming from a recent auto accident in
Maryland. Tyson's attorney, Dale Kinsella, asked that his client
not answer questions about the accident because of pending
litigation. Coincidentally, a preliminary hearing on the accident
is scheduled for Oct. 2, the day before the hearing's resumption,
possibly giving Tyson time to reach settlements with his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner James Nave said, ``For me to vote yes on this
license, I have to have more information'' on the accident and a
psychological evaluation. Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney, said,
``Evander has said on numerous occasions that Mike deserves to be
relicensed. There's no reason to believe his view has changed on
that... . It seems to me, the commission wants some evidence that
Mike Tyson is not a threat to others and to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who arrived at Cashman Center on a motorcycle dressed in
jeans and a polo shirt, had his head buried in his hands when the
commissioners announced their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the hearing, Tyson appeared worn down after hearing
extensive exchanges about his mental stability. He finally cracked,
``For some reason, I feel like Norman Bates up here with all these
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson continued to blame others for his mistakes. When asked
why he continually gets into trouble, he said he's ``an easy
target,'' and added, ``I'm belligerent sometimes when I'm provoked.
I'm tired of people trying to take advantage of me, trying to bully
me around and antagonize me. It's been pervasive for so many years
that I'm a bad seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's attorneys have portrayed the boxer as financially broke.
Kinsella presented a chart showing Tyson received only $5.2 million
of his $30 million purse for the second Holyfield fight.
</P>
<P>
   However, at one point, Tyson said money didn't matter: ``I'm
more of a socialist than anything. I help people. I help
charities.''

 &HT;    Champ's sparring partner gets Bell rung by Pendergrass
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Not so long ago the word from the Evander Holyfield
camp was that the champion's sparring partner, Gary Bell, held the
potential to one day acquire a belt of his own. That may still turn
out to be the case, but Bell got his bell rung plenty in losing on
his boss' undercard Saturday night at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Against Artis Pendergrass _ who came in from Ft. Lauderdale with
an uninspiring 12-10 record _ Bell lost a slugfest when he was
knocked out midway through the sixth round. Pendergrass, an
unimposing sort with a protuding belly, floored Bell twice in the
round.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrass followed three straight left hooks in the middle of
the ring with a right and a left that dropped Bell. He made it to
his feet by the count of eight, but was quickly decked for good by
a series of Pendergrass punches that sent him to the canvas hard on
his back.
</P>
<P>
   For Pendergrass, it was a victory that inspired hope after a
less than ordinary career start. For Bell, the WBA's No. 5-ranked
contender whose words on his trunks read: ``Bring The Pain,'' it is
a setback that could test his mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on him,'' said Don Turner, who trains Holyfield and
Bell. ``He's a game guy.''
</P>
<P>
   His boxing game, however, was way off Saturday night. Instead of
pressing forward after jabs as he did in working with Holyfield,
Bell backed away. And that signaled his demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary fought in a way that we've never seen before,'' said Jim
Thomas, co-manager along with Holyfield. ``He looked tired in the
second round. That's incomprehensible because he's in great shape.
Then he started backing up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He went forward in sparring,'' Turner said. ``Yes, I'm
surprised. When you jab and move back, you open yourself up to be
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bell was hit plenty. The two men exchanged heavy blows
throughout the fight. Pendergrass banged at Bell's head in a
neutral corner in the fourth, stunning Bell. But Bell recovered to
make a round-closing assault that got the crowd into it.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, however, Pendergrass controlled matters, getting
off first with shots to the head as Bell's lack of mobility hurt
him. The next round, Pendergrass turned out Bell's lights with the
series of unanswered bombs.
</P>
<P>
   That battle was not the only interesting match on an undercard
that provided a potpourri of excitement:
</P>
<P>
   Christy Martin, the best-known women's boxer, scored a
fifth-round technical knockout over Christine Robinson. Martin, of
Orlando, staggered Robinson at the end of the first round, but the
Sylva, N.C., challenger recovered to give Martin a good fight the
next three rounds. The fight was stopped with 47 seconds left in
the fifth round. Martin improved to 36-1-2; Robinson fell to 16-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``King'' Lawrence Chapman of College Park raised his record to
14-0 by battering Earl Monroe (10-3-4) for eight rounds. Monroe
provided more of a test of conditioning for Chapman, who chased the
Demopolis, Ala., native much of the fight. Johnny Ruiz (33-3) won
the North American Heavyweight Championship with a fourth-round
knockout of Jerry Ballard (19-2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Eliecher Julio won the WBO Bantamweight Championship with
an 12-round decision over Adonis Cruz (29-3-1) of Nicaragua. Julio
was not happy afterward, however. ``I want to fight the best, and
right now I'm being denied that,'' he said. ``I'm tired of fighting
people with no names. I want Johnny Tapia.''
</P>
<P>
   In a kick-boxing championship bout, Jerome ``Geronimo'' LeBanner
(23-6-1) retained his WKN Thai World Heavyweight title by knocking
out Espedito ``Black Panther'' Da Silva (25-4) after 52 seconds of
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   LeBanner, of Paris, nailed Brazil's Da Silva with a left kick to
the jaw that knocked him down and out for the count.
</P>
<P>
   Jade (The Jewel) Scott (25-2) of Brooklyn knocked out Derek Amos
(12-7) with a solid right counter in the first round. Amos, who did
not land a punch, shook his head ``no'' as he was counted out.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina prospect Juan Pablo Chacon ran his record to 25-0 with
an eight-round unanimous decision over Mario Diaz, who fights out
of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard began typically. That is, there was a bit of a
controversy. The opening bout between Luis Perez of Puerto Rico and
Atlanta's Eugene Johnson was judged a draw after eight rounds.
Perez' record sustained its first blemish at 10-0-1, while
Johnson's moved to 5-5-1.

NFC EAST TURNING INTO BOTTOM FEEDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their 32-year history, the Seattle Seahawks never have
started a season 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   They've also never started with three games against NFC East
teams.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is the division?
</P>
<P>
   Combined, it is 2-8 after two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are 0-6 against teams outside the division.
</P>
<P>
   They are 0-6 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, NFC East teams were 0-5 and outscored, 157-76.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, really strange,'' said San Francisco 49ers
linebacker
 &UR; Ken Norton Jr., who played for the Dallas Cowboys of the East.
``When I played there, the NFC East was the best. The Cowboys,
Giants and Redskins _ they set the standard. But I guess it goes in
cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants, tied with Dallas for the division lead at
1-1, are 8-0-1 under second-year Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel against East
teams. They are 3-6 outside the division, 1-4 against AFC clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 31 years since the East was this bad _ 1967 when the
Cowboys were division champions with a 9-5 record and the rest of
the teams were under .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no real secret,'' longtime Washington Redskins cornerback
 &UR; Darrell Green said. ``The game has changed with free agency.
Players leave, coaches leave. It's not the same game.''
</P>
<P>
   The only two coaches in the East who aren't under pressure are
Fassel and first-year Coach  &UR; Chan Gailey of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a miracle for Philadelphia Eagles Coach  &UR; Ray Rhodes
to save his job. Washington's  &UR; Norv Turner is a goner if the team
is sold. The Cardinals'  &UR; Vince Tobin probably needs seven wins to
be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than the quarterbacks who will start for East
teams this weekend to see why the division has declined.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trent Green will start for Washington at Seattle.  &UR; Jason
Garrett replaces injured  &UR; Troy Aikman against the Giants'  &UR; Danny
Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   In Sun Devil Stadium today, the Cardinals'  &UR; Jake Plummer, who
has 11 career starts, goes against inexperienced  &UR; Bobby Hoying of
the Eagles. They have combined to throw one touchdown pass and four
interceptions and have been sacked 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to playing the Cardinals and Eagles, Seattle's  &UR; Mike
Sinclair,
 &UR; Darrin Smith and  &UR; Phillip Daniels have combined for 10{ sacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the fun is over for the Seahawks (2-0). They don't play
another East opponent until Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our division is in disarray,'' Rhodes said. ``It's open. All
we have to do is get on track, and we can be a player in this
division.'' &QL; 
Fat chance &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giants running back  &UR; Tyrone Wheatley, a 1995 first-round draft
pick, has been inactive the first two weeks because of being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bad bone in my body for that young man,''
Fassel said. `` I want him to play. We need him to play. But we
only need him to play if he's going to be functionally ready for us
to go in and do, and I can count on him. If you want to call it
tough love, then call it tough love. But he's going to do it based
on the standards I set, and I'm not yielding anything different
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel wants Wheatley to weigh less than 233 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he is overweight, Wheatley said, ``I don't know, man.
Same reason you wonder why  &UR; Bill ( &UR; Clinton) did it. I'm wondering
the same thing.'' &QL; 
Heads up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how much Oakland Raiders owner  &UR; Al Davis and Denver
Broncos Coach  &UR; Mike Shanahan hate each other: In the ``Monday Night
Football'' opener in 1994, Shanahan, then offensive coordinator of
the 49ers, suggested that backup quarterback  &UR; Elvis Grbac throw at
Davis' head during pre-game warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he said was, `Let's run the go route,' which we ran every
time in warm-ups,'' said Grbac, now with the Kansas City Chiefs.
``He said something like, `Al Davis is over there.' But he never
told me to throw the ball at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember throwing over Al Davis' head. He moved out of the
way and kind of looked at Shanahan, but that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   No it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis looked back and saw what Shanahan had done, he raised
his middle finger at his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to confirm Grbac's story, Shanahan, whose team plays in
Oakland today, said, smiling, ``He must be confusing me with
another coach. Would I do something like that?'' &QL; 
Expensive proposition &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any team that wants to hire Green Bay's  &UR; Mike Holmgren as
general manager/coach at the end of the season apparently will owe
the Packers a second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Ron Wolf wouldn't confirm that, but in his new
book, ``The Packer Way,'' Wolf wrote that the club would receive
compensation if Holmgren left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes perfect sense to me,'' Wolf wrote. ``We're
recognizing the sanctity of a contract, but we're also
acknowledging Mike's professional goals. We want him happy, and we
want the organization happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a second-round pick would be cheap compared to what
the New York Jets had to pay New England to hire  &UR; Bill Parcells
before last season. The Patriots received third- and fourth-round
picks in 1997 and a No. 2 choice in '98. Next year, they'll get a
first-round pick. &QL; 
Memorabilia &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July, Miami Dolphins quarterback  &UR; Dan Marino gave his son,
 &UR; Joey, a bat signed by St. Louis Cardinals first baseman  &UR; Mark
McGwire. It was a present for Joey's ninth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to get him, then I realized that he was a
big Mark McGwire fan,'' Marino said. ``So I tracked down Mark down
in San Francisco and got him to sign a bat. Mark (shipped) the bat
for me, and Joey was excited when I gave him it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Marino could just get the same reaction out of Coach
 &UR; Jimmy
 &UR; Johnson when they throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks Marino deserves much of the blame for the
Dolphins having the league's 28th-ranked passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had receivers open,'' Johnson said of last week's victory
over Buffalo. ``We've just got to hit them. We've got to throw to
the ones that are open, not the ones that are covered.'' &QL; 
Quick kick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers win 23 of their next 30 games, they will finish the
1990s with a .767 winning percentage, the best of any franchise in
any decade. They are 99-31 in the '90s. &QL;

CARDS KNOW VICTORY OVER EAGLES IS CRUCIAL  
 RECORD-LOW CROWD FOR HOME OPENER EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The Cardinals and Eagles. Some are wont to call
them birds of a feather, or two 0-2 football teams desperately in
need of a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a pair of foul fowls.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this _ and the record heat _ hasn't been lost on the
public, which will stay away in record numbers tonight when the two
NFC East foes ruffle their feathers at Sun Devil Stadium. As of
Thursday afternoon, only 36,850 tickets had been sold, a startling
figure considering the Cardinals' season ticket base is 31,000 and
change. Team officials are expecting a crowd near 40,000 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a shocking walk-up sale, it could mark the smallest
crowd for a Cardinals home opener since the team moved to the
Valley in 1988 and a huge drop-off from last year's opener, when
70,060 saw the Cardinals upset the Dallas Cowboys, 25-22, in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the company they're keeping. If today's crowd is as
small as anticipated, Philadelphia will represent three of the top
four poorly attended openers (42,533 in 1992, and 45,004 in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   For the record, last year's Dallas win marks the Cardinals' only
victory in a home opener since they nested in the Valley. At least
now they can view their record in home openers as a modest winning
streak instead of being 1-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very important football game for us,'' Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin said. ``It's a division opponent, and we're both
0-2 and need to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we win for two reasons: One, we need to control
our division, and you do that by beating division opponents. And
two, it's important that we control our home turf.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, if the franchise ever hopes to sway the voting
public into subsidizing a new stadium, it must avoid the indignity
the public would foist on it with the type of season that an 0-3
start could trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals fully understand why they will be playing to a
half-empty house in the nationally televised (ESPN) game that _ as
usual _ will be blacked out in Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see more people, but you can't depend on
something like that to get yourself ready to play,'' All-Pro
cornerback Aeneas Williams said. ``We'd like to see the type of
crowds that are here for the Dallas games, but until we start
winning, we won't get that consistent fan support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a half-filled home stadium will feel like heaven
after opening the season in noise pits called Dallas and Seattle,
quarterback Jake Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing at your place, before your fans, and it feels
better,'' Plummer said. ``It doesn't mean we'll be better. You
still have to play well to win. But I feel more comfortable in Sun
Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I even think back and picture everybody in an old
Arizona State jerseys and me playing where I just went out and made
plays. Sometimes it helps make me feel more comfortable and helps
me relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is not a stranger to sparse crowds between the buttes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the luxury of 70,000 die-hard season ticket
holders that some teams have,'' he said. ``But if that's a goal of
everyone on this team, we have to win and we'll eventually get
there. I worked my way through weak crowds at Arizona State, but we
eventually got there.''
</P>
<P>
   From a football aspect, the home field advantage this weekend
will be welcomed in the form of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest advantage the home field represents, other than
having the fans behind you, is it gives you freedom to call
audibles at the line of scrimmage,'' Tobin said. ``A lot of time on
the road, the noise level is so high you can't hear the
quarterback's cadence, and you have to go on a silent count, which
can cause mistakes and affect how you come off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As they always do in the battle against dehydration, the
Cardinals will have free water stations throughout the stadium for
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, the team also will introduce its new Spirit Flag Line.
Hopefully, they can pick up the blitz or won't wave white flags. &QL;

   Bears stun No. 20 N.C. State 33-30
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ After almost blowing a 26-point lead, the Baylor defense
stiffened in the fourth quarter against 20th-ranked North Carolina
State on a sweltering Saturday at Floyd Casey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bears needed to come up with one more big play if they
hoped to avoid going to overtime against the Wolfpack. North
Carolina State needed to make a 39-yard field goal with 13 seconds
left to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everybody in the huddle I was going to block it,''
Baylor cornerback Gary Baxter said. ``I wanted it more than
anybody. We had worked too hard to they them do that to us at the
end. I pulled all my goodies out of the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter was true to his word, slipping through from the left side
and blocking the attempt by Wolfpack kicker Kent Passingham to
preserve a 33-30 upset victory for the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled for our team,'' Baylor coach Dave Roberts said.
``This is a win that we can build on. We hung in there and won
against a very good football team. We had a lot of guys make some
big plays today. We had our ups and downs and we still made a lot
of mistakes, but the guys came up big at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State (2-1) was coming off one of the biggest
wins in school history _ a surprising 24-7 upset victory over
then-No. 2 Florida State last week. But Baylor (1-1) shocked the
Wolfpack and built a 26-0 lead at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baylor may be better than we thought they were,'' North
Carolina State head coach Mike O'Cain said. ``They have great
running backs and an outstanding quarterback. They played harder
and wanted it more than we did, especially in the first half. But
I'm proud of the fight we put up in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack charged back by scoring 23 points in the third
quarter to make it 26-23 with one quarter to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were a little too content as a defense after the
first half, and we didn't have the same intensity,'' said Baylor
linebacker Kenyada Parker, who returned a fumble 82 yards for a
touchdown in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really tired out there and people were cramping up,
but we sucked it up in the fourth quarter and got it done. We told
ourselves we weren't going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The man doing most of the damage for North Carolina State was
senior receiver Torry Holt, who had 11 receptions for 255 yards.
But Holt did not have a catch in the final 14 minutes of the game
when Baxter was covering him man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches told me to stay on him and I said, `That's
fine,''' Baxter said. ``He's just another man. I wanted to show
that I could stop an All-American.''
</P>
<P>
   What really stopped the Wolfpack was a woeful kicking game.
Passingham missed two field-goal attempts before the block, and
Scott Earwood, who normally handles the kicking chores but was
nursing shin splints, dropped a punt snap in the end zone that gave
Baylor a safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears led 5-0 and kept the momentum up, thanks to a power
run by fullback Derek Lagway that Earl Campbell couldn't have done
better.
</P>
<P>
   On second-and-five at the North Carolina State 27, Lagway (82
yards on nine carries) took a handoff up the middle and appeared to
be stopped at the 25. But he broke through six potential tacklers
and scored to give Baylor 12-0 lead late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack threatened to reach the end zone in the second
quarter when they had third-and-goal at the Baylor four, but the
biggest play of the half for the Bears transformed a potential
North Carolina State score into a touchdown for the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfpack quarterback Jamie Barnette (24-of-55, 469 yards, three
touchdowns) rolled to his left before he was blasted from behind by
Baylor weakside linebacker Jason Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The ball popped out, and Parker scooped it up at the 18 and
rambled down the sideline for an 82-yard TD to give the Bears a
19-0 lead with 6:01 to go in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blitzing from the left side,'' Parker said. ``Just as I
looked up, Jason was popping their quarterback right in the mouth.
The ball bounced right to me. It was the longest run of my life,
but I knew I was going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the rout was on with Baylor's next offensive
possession when Elijah Burkins ran in for a two-yard TD to make it
26-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wolfpack looked like a different team in the second
half. Two TD passes from Barnette to Holt and one to tight end
Devon Smith, plus a pair of two-point conversions, made it 26-23
with 1:56 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor offense finally stopped the bleeding when quarterback
Odell James scored on a four-yard bootleg early in the fourth
quarter to give the Bears a 33-23 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But North Carolina State scored again on a big play. Tailback
Ray Robinson took a pitch to the right, cut upfield and ran
untouched for a 34-yard TD, making it 33-30 with 12:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack had a chance to tie the game on a 45-yard
field-attempt by Passingham, but the kick was slightly off to the
right with 4:50 to go. Passingham would get one last chance, but
Baxter would made sure the ball didn't reach the goal posts.

A&AMP;M bottles up Southern Mississippi 24-6
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aggies' defense, kicking game &QL; 
help make up for lost ground
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Maybe Texas A&AMP;M eventually will have a good
game offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' 171 total yards against Southern Mississippi was
well under its 221-yards-per-game average, which ranked 102nd
nationally coming into Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Aggies, offense is but a third of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a dominant performance from its defense and a flawless
effort by its kickers, 17th-ranked Texas A&AMP;M easily handled
Southern Mississippi 24-6 before a sellout crowd of 33,233 at
Roberts Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The third-largest crowd in Southern Mississippi school history,
which had hoped to see the Eagles pull off one of their biggest
wins ever, instead saw them almost shut out for the first time in
22 years and fall to 0-2 for the first time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming into their stadium it was going to be a hard
game, and if we take their crowd out (of the game), we take them
out,'' said Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Warrick Holdman, who keyed the
Aggies' blitz. ``I'm very proud of this defense. We were just
attacking. Every time we blitzed it was successful, and we blitzed
the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team, and we know if we're not doing good, the offense
is going to help us. We just felt that if we don't let them score,
our offense would get rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies' offense never really got untracked.
</P>
<P>
   With starting running back Tiki Hardeman serving an an
indefinite suspension and Dante Hall limited because of a strained
muscle just below his right hamstring, the Aggies (2-1) struggled
to move the ball for much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the Eagles to five first downs and 58 yards in the
first half, the Aggies picked off three passes in the second half
and did not allow a score until 53 seconds remained to play. In
all, the A&AMP;M defense forced five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies won the battle of special teams as well. Kicker
Russell Bynum was 3-for-3 on field-goal attempts, and Shane Lechler
took advantage of a good workout with nine punts for a 50.1-yard
average.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive game, the A&AMP;M secondary shut down a
potent receiver. Sherrod Gideon, who had 13 catches for 176 yards
in the Eagles' season opener, managed only three catches for 25
yards against Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our main focus, shut the top guy out and play to our
capability,'' said Texas A&AMP;M free safety Brandon Jennings, who had
an interception. ``We're going back to our old tradition of
blitzing. That makes the secondary play a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us to hustle, and that's what we did to get those
interceptions _ they didn't come to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies batted away at least five of quarterback Lee Roberts'
attempts, and two of A&AMP;M's interceptions were the result of chasing
down tipped balls.
</P>
<P>
   Hall provided the Aggies' only offensive highlights. Although
questionable for the game because of a muscle pull suffered in
practice Thursday, Hall entered with the just over five minutes
remaining in the first half and the Aggies ahead 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a minute later, the fleet-footed junior was making his
way into the end zone , breaking four tackles on a beautiful
44-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   More accurately, it was three near-tackles and one whiff. The
fourth Golden Eagles player, who had the angle on Hall inside the
10-yard line, never got a hand on him as Hall pulled out a
stop-and-go move before crossing the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Sirr Parker took a toss around right end for the two-point
conversion to put the Aggies up 14-0 with 4:14 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who had 76 yards on eight carries, sat out the Aggies'
first two possessions of the second half and then re-entered in
pretty much the same fashion as he had earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings returned his interception 30 yards to set up the Aggies
at the Southern Mississippi 25 with 5:13 left. This time, Hall took
just 44 seconds off the clock to find the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   A carry over the right side netted nine yards. It was followed
by a nice hesitation and sprint down the right side as the Aggies
took a 21-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great cut that got me one-on-one with the defender,
and I just tried to get it on in there,'' Hall said. ``I just
wanted to get in there and help the team. Sirr had told me how they
were playing defensively, and I knew if I waited I could get the
blocks and then try to beat those who weren't blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Anthony recovered a fumble to set up a Bynum 27-yard
field goal, and Gideon finally got free from an afternoon of
harassment by Texas A&AMP;M cornerback Jay Brooks for a six-yard
touchdown catch in the final minute to complete the scoring.

Kansas St. waylays Texas 48-7, holds Williams to 43 yards
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MANHATTAN, Kan. _ The bright side somehow is getting hard to find.
Either that, or Texas is beginning to tire of the search.
</P>
<P>
   After Kansas State pounded Ricky Williams and punished the
Longhorns 48-7 on Saturday, refusing to quit began to lose its
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Texas did have second-half moments to equal many from its
save-face rally at UCLA last week. But against Kansas State, the
Longhorns saw Williams, their weekly saving grace, pounded. They
saw their line embarrassed, their tacklers undressed in the open
field.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of possibilities, including a solid first
showing by freshman quarterback Major Applewhite. But this time,
after falling behind 35-0 by halftime _ in a score too similar to
last week's 35-3 for comfort _ the Longhorns found no joy in a few
meaningless moments.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State celebrated at their expense until the logical
question remained whether the No. 5 Wildcats have yet played a
competitive Division I-A team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone feels miserable,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``We
just feel so bad. It's not fun to be down so bad at halftime. I
told the team, `You don't like it, your coaches don't like it, but
you're playing a great football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our medicine handed to us, and we have to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State so thoroughly outmanned UT that the Wildcats had
more dominant Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jeff Kelly of La Grange had 11 tackles, forced two
fumbles and returned an interception 17 yards for a touchdown.
Quarterback Michael Bishop of Willis threw for 182 yards and two
touchdowns, and rushed for 41 yards and a score. Even punter James
Garcia of Victoria averaged 60.3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kansas State defense was so in control that Williams
struggled to get even 43 yards, his fewest since he was held to 36
against UCLA last season and the fourth-worst total of his career.
On 25 carries, Williams lost yardage on five and made it only back
to the line on three others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit him so much, I just started helping him up,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kept coming and coming,'' Williams said. ``Every
play, there seemed like eight or nine guys up there. I didn't think
it was that physical; they were just everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas offense was so completely beaten that Applewhite was
far from the Longhorns' biggest problem. Forced by starter Richard
Walton's broken hand to play with just 18 career snaps of
experience, Applewhite completed 16 of 37 passes for 239 yards and
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But two passes were intercepted when Applewhite tried to throw
while being hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable playing, but I'm upset about the two
interceptions,'' Applewhite said. ``Any time you throw two
interceptions with a fumble, you're not going to do well as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Texas offense became mistake-prone without a
running game to at least lower the risk, the UT defense found new
ways to struggle in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   KSU running back Eric Hickson, who had 124 yards rushing on just
16 carries, was often surging past the Texas linebackers and into
the secondary before encountering any contact or a defender to
juke. He easily made J.J. Kelly and Aaron Babino miss 2:17 into the
game on a 44-yard touchdown run to begin the rout.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' defenders were almost turned into moving turnstiles when
with Kansas State leading 14-0, David Allen made Jay Humphrey,
De'Andre Lewis and Derek Lewis all miss on a 93-yard punt return
for a score, his third return for a touchdown in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And, like UCLA a week ago, the Wildcats added two touchdowns
before the half to make the game a rout, no matter what sort of
turnaround the Longhorns could muster in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was a great, complete game,'' Kansas State
coach Bill Snyder said. ``In the second half, we couldn't move the
ball and had a few miscues on defense, and we gave up the
touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Texas again improved in the second half, another
opponent complained about its second-half letdown while the
Longhorns searched for signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds stupid when you come off the field 48-7,'' Brown
said. ``But we looked better on defense. The goal-line stand. We
forced some turnovers. We covered some people. In the first half
against UCLA, we weren't close enough to see who was in on the
play. At least today we could tell who was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely a better football team than we were two weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``better'' remained far from good enough to play at the
level of Kansas State or UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, that was too obvious to argue.

interceptions with a fumble, you're not going to do well as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Texas offense became mistake-prone without a
running game to at least lower the risk, the UT defense found new
ways to struggle in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   KSU running back Eric Hickson, who had 124 yards rushing on just
16 carries, was often surging past the Texas linebackers and into
the secondary before encountering any contact or a defender to
juke. He easily made J.J. Kelly and Aaron Babino miss 2:17 into the
game on a 44-yard touchdown run to begin the rout.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' defenders were almost turned into moving turnstiles when
with Kansas State leading 14-0, David Allen made Jay Humphrey,
De'Andre Lewis and Derek Lewis all miss on a 93-yard punt return
for a score, his third return for a touchdown in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And, like UCLA a week ago, the Wildcats added two touchdowns
before the half to make the game a rout, no matter what sort of
turnaround the Longhorns could muster in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was a great, complete game,'' Kansas State
coach Bill Snyder said. ``In the second half, we couldn't move the
ball and had a few miscues on defense, and we gave up the
touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Texas again improved in the second half, another
opponent complained about its second-half letdown while the
Longhorns searched for signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds stupid when you come off the field 48-7,'' Brown
said. ``But we looked better on defense. The goal-line stand. We
forced some turnovers. We covered some people. In the first half
against UCLA, we weren't close enough to see who was in on the
play. At least today we could tell who was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely a better football team than we were two weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``better'' remained far from good enough to play at the
level of Kansas State or UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, that was too obvious to argue.

ARKANSAS, QB STOERNER LEAVE SMU IN DARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Considering the stress the Arkansas
Razorbacks have suffered these past three autumns, they can
probably be forgiven for trying to turn the lights out on SMU a tad
early last night.
</P>
<P>
   But even a 29-minute shutdown that cast an eerie gloom over War
Memorial Stadium in the third quarter could not slow the Hogs'
march toward their objective _ ending SMU's three-year win streak
in the series.
</P>
<P>
   This time, in front of the seventh-largest crowd (55,544) in the
stadium's history, they obliterated it, 44-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have been better off,'' Mustangs coach Mike Cavan
said, ``if they'd just never turned the lights on again.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Razorbacks (2-0) were sitting on a 10-point
lead and the Mustangs (0-3) figured they still had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide had already turned, and the Arkansas attack _
fueled by Clint Stoerner (17-of-33, 262 yards, three touchdowns)
and Chrys Chukwuma (17 carries, 142 yards) _ was on its way to a
470-yard evening.
</P>
<P>
   SMU, meanwhile, was struggling on all fronts (209 total yards,
three turnovers), and two quick giveaways after the lights came on
gave Arkansas an insurmountable 34-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   There was elation among the hosts, as first-year coach Houston
Nutt thanked the fans and said he was happy ``that our seniors
finally got this thing off their back. They've heard a lot about it
from a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mustangs, Cavan said, ``it always looks darkest
before a comeback ... and right now it looks pretty dark.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first play after the opening kickoff, Stoerner flipped a
quick hitch pass to wide receiver Anthony Lucas, who juked two
defenders and fled 87 yards. With 26 seconds elapsed, the
Razorbacks had a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They increased it momentarily, with a helping hand from the
guests. After a penalty, freshman quarterback Josh McCown was
sacked at his 14 and coughed up the ball, with Jamel Harris
recovering for Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Hogs came away with a 47-yard Todd Latourette
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 10-0, the Mustangs revived themselves with a drive
into Arkansas territory, and when it stalled, Colin Vadheim dropped
a punt dead on the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks punted out from the 2, and the Mustangs got a
35-yard Roy Rios field goal out of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the quarter, Arkansas' Chris Akin fumbled a snap on a
punt, and SMU took over at the Hogs' 28. On the first play of the
second quarter, McCown hit Albert Johnson with a 23-yard scoring
pass to tie it at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Akin later dropped a punt dead at the SMU 5, and Arkansas fared
better on the exchange, getting a 29-yard scoring pass from
Stoerner to Eric Branch for a 17-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Latourette added another field goal in the third quarter, and
after the teams' sojourn in the dark, the Razorbacks used two
breaks to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an interception by Zac Painter that set Arkansas
up at the SMU 29 and launched a drive that Stoerner finished with a
1-yard sneak.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jacoby Rhinehart fumbled a punt at his 13, and Arkansas'
Madre Hill got the TD yardage in one play for a 34-10 lead. The
Hogs scored 10 more in the fourth, and SMU got a score on a
touchdown pass from Chris Sanders, brought in late to spell McCown.
</P>
<P>
   Cavan said he thought the crowd affected the Mustangs, and that
``we were a little nervous at first.'' McCown agreed, saying, ``I
was real nervous at the start, and I guess it was obvious by the
way I played. I just wasn't used to playing in front of a crowd
this big.''

A ROUT, AS EXPECTED, BUT IVY CHAMPS ARE LOSERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to refine)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most people figured Saturday's Ivy League football
opener between Columbia and Harvard would be one-sided. After all,
Harvard overran the Lions, 45-7, in last year's opener and went on
to a 9-1 record and the Ivy championship. The Crimson had won seven
straight games, and quarterback Rich Linden and tailback Chris
Menick, the big guns, were back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Columbia was trying to shed memories of a 4-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the game was clearly one-sided, but not as
expected. This time, Columbia embarrassed Harvard. It dominated the
line of scrimmage offensively and defensively. On a muggy Saturday
afternoon, it kept running the ball and wore down the opposition.
Columbia won, 24-0, and everyone knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, we really dominated the game,'' Columbia Coach Ray
Tellier said. ``I can't remember the last time we did that on both
sides of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tim Murphy of Harvard fully agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man for man, they're not a better team than us, but they
outplayed us,'' he said. ``They were bigger, stronger and more
physical. We got beat up in the trenches. They never gave us a
chance to get into the game. At least nobody got killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics told the story. Columbia, led by the freshman
Johnathan Reese (72 yards) and Norman Hayes (58), rushed for 196
yards. Harvard, which averaged more than 200 yards rushing and 200
yards passing a game last year, was held to 169 yards in total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia introduced a 4-4 defense, the same that Harvard used,
and held Linden to 60 yards passing and Menick to 37 yards rushing.
Harvard suffered three sacks and two interceptions and two lost
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's deepest penetration, to the Columbia 41-yard line,
came in the final minute of the game. As Linden said: ``We couldn't
put it together. We never had 11 guys on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   The Homecoming Day crowd of 6,000 at Wien Stadium watched
Columbia dominate from the start. In the first quarter, Jason
Bivens ran a yard for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Neal
Kravitz kicked a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Paris
Childress connected on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mark Cannan, and
27 seconds later, after linebacker Paul Roland's 35-yard
interception return, Hayes crashed a yard for the final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bivens had double duty for Columbia, but not at his old tailback
position. On defense, he took half the snaps at strong safety,
usually in passing situations. On offense, he got in for 11 plays
at quarterback, always out of a resurrected wishbone rather than
Columbia's standard pro set. On one of those plays, a naked
reverse, he gained 11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a limited package,'' Bivens said. ``I played quarterback
in high school, so it's not like I never took a snap before.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as Columbia played, Tellier said he had no illusions.
When someone asked whether this victory made the Lions the Ivy
favorites, their coach would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played one game,'' he said. &QL;

REAL ESTATE: NEW YORK SPACE IS TIGHT, OFFICE MARKETS ROBUST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With vacancy rates declining, rents rising and some
tenants opting to move either to the suburbs or to parts of
Manhattan that were once avoided, the fundamentals of the
commercial real estate market in the New York area have been robust
in the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary third quarter figures compiled by the
Julien J. Studley company, the overall vacancy rate for office
space in Manhattan fell to 5.8 percent, from 6.8 percent in the
second quarter, while average rents rose to $31.29 a square foot
annually, from $28.97 a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in these averages is the fact that in some parts of
midtown, such as the area near Grand Central Terminal, space in the
newest and best buildings is all but unavailable, and asking rents
of $70 a square foot have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The vitality of the office market has also been reflected in the
retail sector, with some stretches of Madison and Fifth avenues
commanding annual rents of $300 to $500 a square foot. Hotels are
filled nearly to practical capacity, with room-rate increases
fattening owners' profits.
</P>
<P>
   But the gyrations of the stock market are having an impact on
sales of property, with the decline in the price of real estate
investment trust stocks removing them, at least temporarily, from
the acquisition scene and forcing other financing sources to
reevaluate their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentiment is different,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the
chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, which specializes in
building sales, ``and we're trying to sort out what it means.'' He
said financing sources were now requiring developers to supply a
higher proportion of funding for deals. ``Wall Street and the hedge
funds pulled back from financing in the 80 to 90 percent range,''
Hauspurg said.
</P>
<P>
   Hauspurg said the new reluctance of investment firms to
aggressively finance purchases was likely to slow the pace of
transactions as buyers and sellers are forced to negotiate new
terms. ``This is not great for the sales business,'' he said.
``When the price changes, the volume drops 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean F. Hennessey, director of the New York hospitality practice
for PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm,
said, ``There were a number of players who were going to put
properties on the market who have pulled back due to the impact of
the stock market. The buyers have gotten fewer and pickier. They
are looking for better deals than two months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The real estate investment trusts, the tax-sheltered acquisition
and ownership vehicles that made such a splash in the metropolitan
area over the last few years, have grown quiet, the victim of their
falling share prices and their own structure.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid paying taxes on income, the REIT's must pay out 95
percent of their income to shareholders as dividends. This means
they do not have much in the way of retained earnings. And with a
depressed price, they are not inclined either to return to public
markets for additional financing or to use their stock to acquire
properties, in order to avoid diluting the value of existing
shares.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Vornado Realty Trust, which acquired Bernard
Mendik's portfolio of midtown buildings in 1997 and went on to buy
most of the property along Seventh Avenue between 34th and 31st
Streets, has not announced any new acquisitions recently. That is
probably because its shares, which reached $50 early in the year,
have recently been trading below $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it is difficult for REIT's to raise capital and
they don't want to use their own stock as scrip to make
acquisitions,'' said Michael Cohen, president of Williams Real
Estate. ``REIT stock is not cash anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market watchers say the decline of the REIT's represents a
return to reality. ``The market got frothy,'' said Dennis Yeskey,
the regional manager for real estate services at Deloitte &AMP; Touche,
an accounting and consulting firm. ``REIT's were out of whack in
1996 and 1997, trading at 20 times earnings, when they should be at
eight times.''
</P>
<P>
   REIT's will find a way to stay active players in the real estate
market, but will be forced to change their tactics, others argue.
``REIT's were the No. 1 bidder for every property coming on the
market seven or eight months ago,'' said Kevin Haggarty, executive
managing director of the Insignia/ESG Capital Advisers group. ``Now
they are No. 2 or No. 3, but they will continue to make
acquisitions in categories where they are dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to sell stock or debt securities based on the
overall corporation, REIT's seeking capital in the current climate
are likely to place mortgages on individual properties, Haggarty
said, although there is little evidence they have done so yet.
</P>
<P>
   But if the investment market is being roiled by the stock
market, the leasing market remains strong, so strong that some
tenants' brokers are recommending that their clients not make any
long-term commitments at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd advise people to extend their lease short-term and stay
where they are,'' said James Meiskin, president of Plymouth
Partners, a tenants' broker. ``This is no time to make long-term
decisions. The market may well be at its apex.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Colp-Haber, a partner in Wharton Property Advisors, which
also represents tenants, said that because of the tight market
``landlords are making demands at the last minute, upping rents and
taking away space.'' High rentals and the shortage of space
``represent a significant impediment to small business growth in
New York City,'' Ms. Colp-Haber added. ``This is the downside of an
otherwise vibrant economy and booming real estate market. In sum:
things are so good, they're bad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to market analysts, the demand for space is being
driven by rising employment and the fact that virtually no new
office buildings have been added to the city's inventory for almost
10 years. ``There have been 180,000 jobs added in New York and
those people need space to work,'' said Raymond O'Keefe, president
of Grubb &AMP; Ellis New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look out the window, there are no building cranes,'' said
Thomas Falus, president of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield of New York,
speaking of most of the city. ``The only building that's going on
is where there are already leases. The supply/demand equation looks
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the glut of empty space coming on to a declining market
that characterized the late 1980s, many real estate executives
expect rent levels to hold, with companies priced out of the
Manhattan market heading for the other boroughs or suburbs. ``I
don't think we are going to see a big increase in rents, which is
good,'' O'Keefe said. ``They will probably stay on this plateau for
awhile.'' He said the reason for this moderation is that demand for
space and the available supply are in rough equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Class A space, which is in the newest and most technically
advanced buildings, is all but unavailable in midtown, with CB
Richard Ellis calculating the vacancy rate at 2.2 percent. This has
produced some movement of tenants to downtown, but for many
companies a midtown location is essential to running their business
and they are paying to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of alternative markets, including North
Dakota,'' observed David Levinson, an executive managing director
of Insignia/ESG, a real estate services company. ``The critical
questions are where are a company's clients and can they get the
employee skills they need. It's these operational issues that are
critical, not saving a couple of dollars a square foot on real
estate. Real estate only controls the relocation decision if
everything else is neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid an unending upward spiral some companies are seeking to
break out of the traditional tenant-landlord model. For instance,
the news and financial information company Reuters has formed a
joint venture with the Rudin family to build an 855,000-square-foot
building on Seventh Avenue from 42nd to 43rd streets that will
serve as Reuters headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters officials have said they see the joint venture as a
means of controlling costs in a rising market and being able to
tailor the building so it projects the image of a high-technology
company.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bear Stearns will control its own 1.1
million-square-foot building at 383 Madison Avenue between 46th and
47th streets, where demolition of the old structure on the site is
currently under way. The financial services company has a 99-year
lease on the underlying land.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has a 49-year lease on
all 1,595,000 square feet of space at 2 Broadway under which it
controls the building and pays all the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major tenants don't want the traditional tenant-landlord
relationship,'' said Peter Riguardi, an executive vice president of
Colliers ABR, who helped negotiate the MTA deal this summer. ``They
want to control their environment and have their own security. They
don't want to have to look at the lease every time they want to do
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Reuters and Bear Stearns projects under way, the 1.6
million-square-foot building under construction by the Durst
Organization on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd streets loses it
distinction as the only major new office project in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives said they expect other available building
sites to be utilized quickly. These include the two remaining Times
Square sites south of 42nd Street, which are controlled by Mortimer
Zuckerman and George Klein, and the half block on Seventh Avenue
between 49th and 50th streets that is usually referred to as ``Rock
West'' because it is owned by The Rockefeller Group. At Rock West,
the financial services company Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has
reached an agreement with the Rockefeller Group to build a
million-square-foot building on what is now a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Since sites where new construction can proceed are very few in
Manhattan, older buildings will have to be upgraded if they are to
be competitive. A market report prepared by CB Richard Ellis noted
that while the vacancy rate in midtown buildings built since 1980
is 2.3 percent, it is 6.3 percent for those built before that.
``Building renovations will accelerate as the office market
tightens and tenants demand Internet-ready infrastructure,'' the
report predicts. ``As Grand Central station finishes its
renovation, look for the entire submarket to respond with building
upgrades.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the prospects for real estate in the downtown
market were so bleak that the city mounted a special incentive
program that gave tax breaks to commercial tenants who would locate
there and incentives to owners who would convert old office
buildings to apartments and condominiums. Now downtown is becoming
an outlet for tenants being squeezed by midtown's rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA's decision to lease the entire 1,595,000 square feet at
2 Broadway, between Stone and Beaver streets on the southern tip of
the island, was one of the biggest leasing transactions of recent
years, but not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Guardian Life Insurance Co. is leaving its midtown south
location near Union Square to occupy 450,000 square feet of space
at 7 Hanover Square at the intersection of William and Water
streets. The company also has options to expand to 880,000 square
feet over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by Cushman &AMP; Wakefield the overall vacancy
rate downtown has dipped below 10 percent, with Class A vacancies
down to 5.9 percent at the end of the second quarter, compared to
12.2 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the average asking rent in the district reached $28 a
square foot annually, a 13 percent increase from $24.85 in the same
1997 quarter, with Class A space up to $36.48 from $30.11 a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the 1980s, Park Avenue South was developed as an
alternate to midtown,'' said Levinson of Insignia/ESG. ``Now it is
downtown that is the alternative. The office market is getting so
tight that some buildings that were scheduled for conversion to
residential may stay office.'' For example, the building at 10
Hanover Square was scheduled for conversion before the Goldman
Sachs financial services company leased 522,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown is much healthier than it was, due to the conversion
program,'' said O'Keefe of Grubb &AMP; Ellis. ``You have the
residential units, and the state has signed to develop the Hudson
River park. The area will have a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeeze in on in midtown, and for that reason the Jersey
shoreline will blossom,'' said Michael T. Cohen of Williams Real
Estate.
</P>
<P>
   With the waterfronts of Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken just
a few PATH tube stops from Manhattan, building has resumed in
Jersey City for the first time in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Lefrak Organization is building a 561,000-square-foot office
building at its Newport complex, while Hartz Mountain Industries is
at work on a 419,000-square-foot tower at its Colgate site. Last
week, the fund-management company Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co. announced that
it would move next year from the General Motors Building on Fifth
Avenue to 150,000 square feet in Hartz Mountain's Colgate Center.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects are being planned, including a
1,150,000-square-foot office and retail complex in Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of activity in New Jersey,'' said Donald P.
Eisen, an executive managing director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield who
specializes in suburban properties. ``Now we are seeing companies
compete for the same space. There is great interest in Newark from
telecommunications companies who want to be close to the main
telephone switches.''
</P>
<P>
   Rental rates for office space in the northern part of the state
increased $2.15 a square foot to an average of $27.35 a square
foot, Cushman &AMP; Wakefield reported, and several speculative office
buildings are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The activity in New Jersey is not limited to office properties.
The number of movie screens in the state has increased to 828 from
550 over the last decade as shopping center developers increasingly
incorporate them in their designs to add entertainment to
consumption and try to increase the latter by keeping shoppers
around longer.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives say the office markets in Westchester and
Fairfield Counties have not revived to the extent New Jersey's has.
``There is still space available in Westchester, although there is
renewed interest in White Plains,'' Eisen said. He noted that
Zurich Insurance was continuing to build in Stamford, Conn., but
had decided to keep its headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, the office market continues to recover, with the
overall vacancy rate dropping 2.4 percentage points to 10.8
percent. At mid-year 1990 the rate was 17.6 percent, according to
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. Despite the low vacancy rate, rents, averaging
$24.43 a square foot, have not risen enough to justify speculative
construction, many real estate executives say.
</P>
<P>
   SoHo is the hot shopping area, retail leasing specialists say,
with both domestic and foreign-based retailers taking the place of
the art galleries, whose inability to pay rising rents has driven
them to west Chelsea. ``It is as if a whole new shopping area is
being built there,'' said Alan Victor, an executive vice president
of Lansco Corp., retail leasing specialists. He said many of the
stores opening in the area are selling merchandise priced below
that in stores along Fifth and Madison Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a jewelry store, it will sell fashion jewelry as
opposed to custom works of art on Fifth Avenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy, which has filled office buildings with
well-paid workers, and the additional housing that has been built
or converted is fueling demand for retail services, analysts say.
This has strengthened the hand of landlords, particularly in areas
of the city where certain retailers feel they must have a presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carriage trade retailers from all over the world need a
Madison or Fifth Avenue address to show they are contenders in the
world of platinum-card purchasers,'' a study by CB Richard Ellis
concluded. ``Entertainment and sports retailers are interested in
Times Square and Fifth Avenue locations in order to burnish their
images as players on a global stage.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the higher retail rents, from $300 to
$500 a square foot a year, are charged on Madison Avenue between
58th and 72d Streets and on Fifth Avenue between 51st and 59th
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   New York's hotels remain filled to a high level of occupancy, as
tourism and business bring more visitors to a city that is seen as
safe and exciting. According to a survey of 70 hotels by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, occupancy rates were 83.2 percent in the
second quarter of this year, compared to 81.5 percent in the same
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Strong demand is allowing hotel operators to improve their
profit margins by boosting room rates. According to the same
survey, the average daily cost of a hotel room in Manhattan rose to
$198.70, a 16 percent increase over last year's second-quarter
average of $171.39.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer an occupancy story, because it can't get much
higher,'' Hennessey said. ``But it is giving hotel owners the
opportunity to push up room rates.''
</P>
<P>
   And that translates directly into profits, because most hotel
costs are fixed. Once the break-even point has been reached, much
of the additional revenue falls to the bottom line, Hennessey said.
