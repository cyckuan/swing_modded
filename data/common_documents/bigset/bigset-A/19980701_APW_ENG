Teams take care of business before lockout begins

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scottie Pippen was sitting at home in Chicago,
his moment in the free agent spotlight postponed indefinitely.
Michael Olowokandi bid the Clippers goodbye and prepared to go back
to England. Keith Van Horn finished his last workout for a while at
the New Jersey Nets' practice site.
	   All around the NBA, players and team officials took care of
last-minute business Tuesday before a lockout went into effect at
midnight. The NBA said it had no choice but to stop operating until
it could find a way to bring the growth of player salaries in line
with revenues.
	   Pippen was one of 148 free agents who had been looking forward
to July 1 as the day they would be free to shop their services to
the highest bidder.
	   Now, like everyone else, they will have to wait until the
lockout ends before they can start talking to teams.
	   ``We could have started sizing up our options, but now we'll
just have to wait,'' said Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent. ``It's
really nothing more than a delay. Whether it's resolved Sept. 1 or
Dec. 1, we'll eventually go about our business the same way.''
	   At team offices, staffs were briefed on the rules of the lockout
_ for example, no direct contact with players for the duration.
Trainers and medical personnel conferred with players on moving
treatment sessions away from team facilities.
	   In the hours before the lockout began, the Houston Rockets
brought in two of their rookies, Michael Dickerson and Cuttino
Mobley, for a final workout. The coach and general manager of the
Toronto Raptors flew to Atlanta to meet with Charles Oakley and
finalize last week's trade with the New York Knicks.
	   In Orlando, the Magic decided to waive Mark Price, while the
Boston Celtics picked up the option on Bruce Bowen's contract and
declined to do the same with Tyus Edney.
	   The Philadelphia 76ers bought out the final year of Derrick
Coleman's contract, and the Seattle SuperSonics released Dale
Ellis, the league's career leader in 3-pointers.
	   Karl Malone basked in the afterglow of his appearance on a
wrestling show, where he bodyslammed and clotheslined Hulk Hogan.
The Utah Jazz star will face Dennis Rodman in a pay-per-view match
in mid-July.
	   ``He looked like he was trying hard not to laugh,'' Jazz
spokesman Kim Turner said, referring to Malone's performance.
	   Olowokandi, drafted by the Clippers as the overall No. 1 pick
last week, watched the Argentina-England World Cup soccer game
while preparing to fly home to England for about three weeks.
	   ``I'll keep doing the things I need to do, working on my game
and my conditioning,'' Olowokandi said. ``As much as I need
offseason work, this will only motivate me because it stacks the
odds against me even more.''
	   Olowokandi was one of the players who figured to be most
adversely affected by the lockout, since it will prevent him from
playing for the Clippers in a summer league and honing his raw
skills.
	   Other rookies and free agents will also have to deal with a
summer of uncertainty, some being forced to make a hasty decision
on their next career move.
	   Agent Steve Kauffman represents three free agents _ Stephen
Howard (Sonics), Emanuel Davis (Rockets) and Darvin Ham (Wizards) _
who may head to Europe on one-year contracts.
	   ``They might have considered it as an option anyway, but throw
in the uncertainty of the labor situation and they might bite when
they otherwise might not have,'' Kauffman said.
	   This is the third lockout in four years. A lockout in the summer
of 1995 lasted three months; in 1996 it lasted only a few hours.
	   The collective bargaining agreement that expired at midnight was
supposed to run for six years. But owners had the right to reopen
it if the amount of money being paid toward player salaries
exceeded 51.8 percent of basketball-related income.	   The owners are now devoting 57 percent of those revenues to
player salaries, a total of almost dlrs 1 billion.
	   In nine negotiating sessions, owners and players made only
minimal progress. Still, in the weeks and months leading up to
Tuesday night's deadline there had been a general feeling that
11th-hour negotiations could somehow forestall a lockout.
	   Instead, the sides didn't even come close to resuming talks.
	   Rather than being tucked away in a room with league and union
lawyers, players association president Patrick Ewing of the Knicks
attended the unveiling of one of his paintings at a New York
restaurant.
	   ``What needs to be done?'' he said. ``I'm not really sure. They
feel they want a greater share of the pie, and we want our share.
We just have to stay strong and fight for what we believe in.''

Clinton calls on China to open its markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 5 grafs with Clinton on corruption, other
details. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton called on
China Wednesday to open its markets to foreign trade, and he urged
American investors in the world's largest country to help it battle
huge environmental problems.
	   Addressing U.S. business leaders in this communist city that
showcases capitalism, Clinton said he could not, as a visiting
president, ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
environmental measures.
	   ``But as a citizen of the world and the leader of my country, I
have a responsibility to ask us all to work together for a planet
that our grandchildren can still enjoy living on. And so do you.''
	   He also urged American firms operating here to set a good
example on fair labor standards and business practices. He called
on China to dismantle its ailing state-run industries and improve
its legal and regulatory system. Pointedly, he urged ``strong
efforts to combat corruption.''
	   In another direct remark, Clinton suggested that China protect
personal rights and constrain ``arbitrary government.''
	   Clinton spoke with business leaders in the atrium of a high-rise
hotel before touring Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a shimmering symbol
of China's march toward a market economy. In the towering steel and
glass building housing the exchange, the president was having lunch
with young Chinese entrepreneurs.
	   Clinton said China must agree to ``strong terms'' to qualify for
membership in the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules
for global trade. That would require opening markets and allowing
investment opportunities here for foreign firms. The terms have to
be ``clear and unambiguous,'' the president said, although he said
China should be granted some concessions as a developing nation.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said. ``More open markets are
important to the United States, which buys today about a third of
China's exports _ and in turn should have a fair shot at China's
markets. It is important to China as it builds an economy that must
compete globally.''
	   He said rapid change and disruptions caused by economic reform
``make it tempting to turn inward and to slow down. But for China,
as for America, the promise for the future lies in helping our
citizens to master the challenges of the global economy, not to run
away from them.''
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley, speaking to the same
forum, said China's leaders, in meetings over the last week,
insisted they could not open their markets because domestic
industries cannot compete in the global economy.
	   ``We believe the opposite is true,'' Daley said. ``The more
China opens its markets, the more its domestic industries will be
able to compete.''
	   Clinton said China will have to develop worker retraining and
social security programs as it transforms its massive state-run
industries into market-based companies. He said the United States
stands ready to help with ideas.
	   There was a strong environmental message in Clinton's remarks,
noting that China will soon surpass the United States as the
largest emitter of greenhouse gases that many scientists believe
are responsible for global warming.
	   He said 1998 promises to be the warmest year in recorded history
and that environmental pollution in any nation is a global problem.
	   Clinton said Shanghai, a flashy center of global trade and
finance, could be the center of an energy revolution in China.
	   ``We have to do something to break the idea in people's minds
that the only way to grow the economy of a developing country is to
adopt industrial-age energy use patterns. It is not true, it is a
huge problem, it is still a problem in the United States. I ask you
to lead the way.''
	   He also urged the business leader to press the U.S. Congress to
grant permanent most-favored-nation trading benefits for China,
saying the United States could not turn its back on the world's
largest nation.
	   A key U.S. House committee overwhelmingly passed the measure
last week, and both houses are expected to take it up in July.

U.S. trade deficit with China forecast to hit dlrs 60 billion in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
1998 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The U.S. trade deficit with China could
climb to dlrs 60 billion in 1998, U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday.
	   Speaking to a U.S. business group, Barshefsky said Beijing
needed to open its markets wider to foreign goods and services if
it hoped to gain entry into the World Trade Organization.
	   She told the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce that China
had made progress in reforming its import regime, but U.S. exports
still had a tough time penetrating the mainland market. High
tariffs and other market barriers contributed to a dlrs 50 billion
trade imbalance in 1997, and that amount is likely to swell rather
than shrink this year, she said.
	   China claims the trade imbalance is only dlrs 16.4 billion,
excluding among other things trade through Hong Kong, but agrees
its surplus is growing.
	   Barshefsky downplayed the possibility of a congressional
backlash against China, saying Beijing was taking steps to address
the issue. She noted China recently made new offers to open its
financial services and telecommunications industries in a new
proposal to join the WTO.
	   But U.S. officials said the plan fell short of meeting
membership demands.
	   Another senior U.S. trade official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said any new offer for joining the World Trade
Organization will require broad liberalization of the financial
sector, and not just selective approvals for foreign banking,
securities and insurance firms.
	   Beijing's pledge not to devalue its currency _ while welcome _
also will not boost its chances for WTO membership, the official
said. A stable currency is in China's own interest as well as the
region's.
	   China's leaders have said the United States and other WTO
members should view the stable yuan pledge and its constructive
role in the crisis with a ``positive attitude'' when reviewing its
membership proposals.
	   The official declined to estimate when China might gain WTO
membership, a process that has been negotiated for more than 11
years.
	   The United States, China and other countries will meet July 20
in Geneva for a fresh round of WTO talks.

Sub-sea earthquake splashes Great Barrier Reef
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An earthquake stirred up waters
around the Great Barrier Reef but there have been no reports of
damage, seismologists said Wednesday.
	   The quake, which struck at 12:58 p.m. Tuesday, had a magnitude
of 4.3 and was centered beneath the reef, about 155 miles (250 km)
northeast of Rockhampton, the Queensland University Advanced Center
for Earthquake Studies said.
	   There had been no reports of tremors felt on the mainland, said
the center's Steven Jaume.
	   The earthquake was also recorded by the Australian Geological
Survey Organization.
	   Jaume said the quake, which would have caused minor damage had
it occurred in a populated region, was the fourth this year in
Queensland at or above magnitude 4.
	   A number of earthquakes had been recorded in the past in the
region of Tuesday's quake, including a 5.0 tremor at Heron Island
in November 1978.

Husband blows up self, wife over marital troubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A husband angry that his wife would not return
with him to his hometown in the countryside exploded a homemade
bomb, killing both, in the northwestern city of Urumqi, according
to a report seen Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Urumqi native Zhu Huajie, 30, married Shen Fuxin and followed
him to Ningxia in 1990. In 1994, when their daughter was one year
old, she returned to the city, leaving her husband behind, the
state-run newspaper Xinjiang Daily reported last Friday.
	   Shen Fuxin, a former convict from Ningxia province, had been
trying for several years to convince his wife to return to him. She
asked for a divorce, and he refused, the report said.
	   It said Shen exploded the device while the two were sitting
talking on June 19. The blast killed both instantly, but no other
people were injured, the report said.
	   Police have attributed several recent explosions in various
cities to personal attacks. The blasts have prompted authorities to
tighten controls on explosives, which are widely used by miners,
farmers and construction workers and appear relatively easy to
obtain.

Academic: Europe threatens Australia's share of Asian beef market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Europe is threatening to take a big
chunk out of Australia's share of the lucrative Asian beef export
market, a leading analyst warned Wednesday.
	   Professor Oswin Maurer, chairman of meat marketing at the
University of New England, said European Union beef producers could
enter the market as soon as the year 2000.
	   Under the 1987 Adriesen-Kerin Agreement, the EU vowed not to
sell subsidized beef in Asia.
	   However, Maurer said the EU was on target to reduce government
subsidies to producers.
	   He said it also planned to eliminate direct subsidies by the
next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks,
scheduled for 2000.
	   ``Once it has accomplished this it will have lifted the last
barrier preventing it from selling beef on Asia's markets,'' he
said.
	   A major European push into the region has the potential to cause
more long-term damage to Australia's beef export industries than
the current Asian economic crisis, he said.
	   In 1996-97, Australia sold 430,600 metric tons of beef,
excluding live exports, to markets in North and Southeast Asia.
	   The EU produces 7.5 million metric tons of beef and veal a year,
and is forecast to produce 8 million tons by 2000, despite a
downturn following the mad cow disease scare.
	   ``It's also anticipated that the European Union will have
accumulated a 1 million ton stockpile of beef and veal by the year
2000,'' Maurer said.
	   ``Obviously they'll be looking at ways to shift this stockpile
and Asia presents a logical solution to this problem.''
	   ``We need to initiate dialogue with the EU about its future
plans in Asia and search for win-win solutions that ensure
Australia is not left out in the cold,'' he said. ``We cannot
afford to ignore this issue.''

ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire's 37.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Brewers 5, Indians 4 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Milwaukee, Cal Eldred defeated Cleveland for the first time
since 1992 and singled for the first two RBIs of his career.
	   The Brewers won for the seventh time in eight games and improved
to 8-4 in interleague play. The Indians lost their third in a row.
	   Eldred (4-5), who had lost seven straight decisions to
Cleveland, allowed seven hits in six innings. Bob Wickman pitched 1
2-3 scoreless innings for his 11th save.
 &UR; Rockies 6, Mariners 4 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 33rd homer, but
the Seattle Mariners lost to Colorado to match their worst June
record in franchise history.
	   Griffey, who led the All-Star voting for the third straight
year, hit 14 homers in June. But the Mariners went 8-20 during the
month, tying the 1983 club for the worst June mark.
	   Griffey came to the plate with a runner on third and two outs in
the ninth, but Mike Munoz retired him on a fly to right for his
first save.
 &UR; Angels 4, Giants 3 &QC; 
	   In Anaheim, California, Garret Anderson's three-run homer
highlighted a four-run sixth inning that lifted Anaheim over San
Francisco.
	   The Angels went 22-6 in June, a franchise high for wins in any
month.
	   Chuck Finley (8-4) gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1-3
innings, and Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his major
league-leading 25th save in 28 chances.

Peruvian President Fujimori, Japanese emperor discuss El Nino
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Japan's
Emperor Akihito met Wednesday and discussed the El Nino weather
phenomenon that has battered the South American nation.
	   Fujimori told Akihito about the heavy rains brought about by El
Nino that hit Peru, an Imperial Household Agency spokesman said.
	   The president told the emperor, however, that as El Nino had
been expected, he was able to alleviate damage by taking steps in
advance. These included channeling flood waters through a dry river
bed out into a desert, where trees were later planted.
	   Fujimori and Akihito met at the Imperial Palace prior to the
president's departure for home after attending a two-day
international symposium on promoting economic ties between Japan
and Latin American countries.
	   Floods and mudslides generated by El Nino caused at least 150
deaths and left tens of thousands homeless in Peru from
mid-December through February.
	   A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said on condition of
anonymity that Fujimori and Japanese officials did not specifically
discuss Japanese aid to the South American country regarding El
Nino-related damage.
	   Earlier this week, Japan's Kyodo News service reported from Lima
that Fujimori would seek to obtain dlrs 100 million in credits from
Japan for a project to rehabilitate areas affected by El Nino.
	   Fujimori has visited Japan annually since 1990, the year he was
elected president. The latest meeting with Akihito was Fujimori's
sixth audience with the emperor.
	   At the symposium Tuesday, Fujimori urged the world's top
economies to act decisively to solve the Asian economic crisis
before it spreads to other regions.
	   Fujimori, who arrived Sunday, also said Asia's financial
problems have had a limited effect so far on Peru and neighboring
countries.
	   The symposium was co-sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan and the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank.

Hong Kong marks year of reversals in subdued handover anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A subdued Hong Kong marked the first
anniversary of its return to China on Wednesday, reassured that
Beijing would let it manage its own affairs but increasingly
uncertain of its ability to do so.
	   The territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin told Hong Kong's 6.5 million people that
their future increasingly would be tied to that of the vast
mainland.
	   Toned-down festivities included a flag-raising ceremony on the
harbor-side site of last year's handover ceremony and a variety
show including Chinese dancers as well as stars of the Cantonese
pop music scene.
	   Jiang, fresh from his summit with President Clinton, also will
dedicate Hong Kong's new dlrs 20 billion international airport
before going home Thursday. Clinton is to arrive at the airport
just hours later for a brief visit ending his tour of China.
	   In speeches, Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Jiang
both praised China's ``one country, two systems'' under which the
territory is responsible for its own affairs, and expressed
confidence in the future despite its current economic troubles.
	   ``When we look north, the bright future of our motherland adds
much to our valor,'' Tung said in a speech. ``With the
reunification, our interests and those of our nation are
intricately linked.''
	   In its effort to dig itself out of recession, Tung said Hong
Kong would have to promote cooperation with the mainland,
particularly its dynamic southern regions.
	   Jiang said that China's formula of ``one country, two systems''
was ``a guarantee for Hong Kong's prosperity, a model for the
return of Macau and the solution to the Taiwan issue.''
	   Macau, a Portuguese territory for more than 400 years, returns
to China next year. Taiwan is perhaps the most contentious issue of
all. The island categorically rejects reunification with China
under similar terms as Hong Kong.
	   The first year under Chinese rule was one in which nothing
turned out to be as it seemed.
	   Widespread fears that China would limit Hong Kong's political
freedoms have subsided. However, Hong Kong's confidence in its
near-legendary economic prowess has been deeply shaken by Asia's
economic crisis. Economically, the mainland has turned out to be a
source of stability.
	   Even such a determined foe of Beijing as Martin Lee, Hong Kong's
de facto opposition leader, acknowledged that the worst
pre-handover fears so far have not come true.
	   Lee, writing Wednesday in the English-language South China
Morning Post, said that Hong Kong residents responded with
``courage and conviction,'' to efforts to undermine their freedoms.
	   ``In this historic first year as part of China, Hong Kong people
_ who many had long suggested were interested only in their wallets
_ shattered the myth they cared nothing for their rights and
freedoms,'' Lee wrote.
	   Several small-scale protests were scheduled during Jiang's
visit. On Tuesday night, about 10 demonstrators burned portraits of
Jiang outside his hotel and scuffled with police. No one was hurt.
	   The economy was more worrisome to Hong Kong residents than
politics. Unemployment soared to a 15-year high of 4.2 percent, and
was expected to go higher. The stock market's key index dropped by
about half, and the economy plummeted into recession.
	   Uncomfortable in politics, Tung's popularity has suffered
because of his slow reactions to challenges including the economy
and surprises such as the so-called ``bird flu'' that resulted in
the mass slaughter of millions of chickens.
	   Commentator C.K. Lau said Tung's performance ``has earned him a
reputation as a do-gooder with grand plans who has done the wrong
thing with good intentions.'' A recent poll found him less popular
than controversial Chris Patten, the last British colonial
governor.

Cambodian pedicab drivers see earnings halved since coup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The already meager earnings of
Cambodia's cyclo drivers have been sliced nearly in half since last
year's bloody coup, which has frightened off tourists and hurt the
economy, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The traditional three-wheeled, pedal-powered taxis have in
recent years struggled to compete with faster motorcycle taxis
racing about the streets of Phnom Penh.
	   But since last year's coup, when strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in pitched street battles,
the cyclo drivers have seen net income fall an average 43 percent,
the Cambodia Daily reported.
	   A year ago, a cyclo driver earned an average 12,250 riel a day.
Ten months later, the figure had fallen to just 6,975 riel per day,
the paper said, citing a survey of drivers.
	   The pre-coup value of the riel was 2,600 to the U.S. dollar. But
the violence, coupled with economic crisis in other Asian
countries, have weakened the currency to about 3,800 today, making
the earnings even less.
	   Fewer foreigners are visiting and residing in Phnom Penh. But
ordinary Cambodians have also suffered economically and often walk
instead of hiring cyclos.
	   Many drivers, usually farmers who come to the capital to earn
some extra money during the non-growing season, now complain that
they don't have enough money to eat.
	   One driver, Ngoun Horn, told the paper that today he earns a
maximum of 5,000 riel a day. It costs 2,000 riel just to rent the
cyclo, he said.
	   ``I no longer have enough money to feed the family,'' said Ngoun
Horn, who is married with four children. He sleeps in the streets
in his cyclo.
	   Nearly 10,000 cyclos are registered with the capital's
transportation office, in records dating to 1989. But no one knows
how many are really operating.

NOTEBOOK: Clinton advises Chinese students how to link up with
</HEADLINE>
White House &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Even on the other side of the world, U.S.
President Bill Clinton had to know what was going on at the White
House.
	   So he did what anyone in the world with a computer and a modem
could do. He turned to the Internet.
	   At Shanghai's Internet Cafe, Clinton asked high school senior
Hang Yan to log on to ``www.whitehouse.gov.''
	   The screen lit up with a picture of an illuminated White House
and waving American flags on either side. Among other things, the
site contained the speeches Clinton has been delivering in China.
	   ``I'm getting better than I used to be,'' Clinton joked of his
Internet know-how. ``Give me credit.''
	   The Internet Cafe, typical of similar establishments cropping up
around the world, is a coffee shop and bar with computer terminals
at each table. Computer buffs gather here to split the cost of
surfing the Internet, roughly dlrs 2.50 per hour.
	   ``I think it's very exciting,'' Clinton said. He sat at a table
with two students and a teacher from the Lon Don high school,
watching them access various Internet sites.
	    &UR; ----
	   The late U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill said it, and Clinton
agrees _ ``all politics is local.''
	   Clinton told Shanghai business leaders Wednesday that the most
memorable call he fielded during a 50-minute radio show Tuesday
wasn't for him at all. It was for Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
	   ``He did not want to talk to the president, he wanted to talk to
the mayor about traffic issues,'' Clinton said. ``It was very much
like call-in shows in America.''
	   Clinton said that caller once again proved the oft-repeated
theory of O'Neill.
	    &UR; -----
	   In a Chinese city where traffic problems are chronic, Clinton's
visit to Shanghai produced a new, vertical one _ the elevator jam.
	   Although Clinton was taking the service elevator to his suite at
the luxurious Portman Ritz Carlton Hotel, one _ and sometimes two _
of the remaining six elevators were held open for security
purposes.
	   That didn't leave a lot of capacity for everybody else.
	   White House aides posted signs around work areas for reporters
and staff, warning them to allow an extra 15 minutes for the ride
down from their rooms for events and motorcades.

Netanyahu meets Weizman in effort to settle dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By Jack Katzenell &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After questioning each other's competence,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Ezer
Weizman met Wednesday morning in an effort to settle their bittrr
dispute over the peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu went on both national television channels Tuesday
night and accused Weizman Tuesday of siding with the Palestinians
and the Israeli opposition against the government.
	   An angry Weizman said he would hold a press conference Wednesday
morning to reply to Netanyahu's accusations.
	   However during the night the majority leader in parliament, Meir
Shitreet, urged Weizman and Netanyahu to meet in order to settle
their differences and they agreed, presidential spokeswoman Batya
Keinan told The associated Press.
	   Shitreet is a prominent figure in Netanyahu's right wing Likud
party, who is regarded as less hawkish than Netanyahu on the issue
of negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   Weizman Monday blamed Netanyahu for the deadlock in the
negotiations, saying it was time to call early elections.
	   In an interview which appeared in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot
Monday, Weizman expressed deep concern about the peace process. He
questioned Netanyahu's qualifications to be prime minister.
	   ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world. Cut off
from reality. The nation does not know where the prime minister is
leading them,'' Weizman said. ``He rules by trial and error. If
Netanyahu wants to know what the nation thinks, he should go to
polls.''
	   Interviewed on Israel TV Tuesday, Netanyahu said ``The fact is
that the President, to my sorrow, took a stand with the left to
actually get rid of the current elected government.''
	   Netanyahu said Weizman was also siding with Egypt and the
Palestinians, who have said Netanyahu's policies are hurting
chances for peace.
	   ``The President has strengthened and hardened the Arab
position,'' Netanyahu said in another interview with Israel's
Channel 2 TV.
	   In Israel the President is largely a ceremonial figure who is
not normally involved in politics, but Netanyahu said ``The
president is attacking the prime minister on a personal basis, it's
not a healthy thing for Israel.''
	   Weizman's aided told Israel radio he would continue his campaign
for new elections as long as there is no breakthrough in the
negotiations with the Palestinians over the scope of an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu has dismissed early elections and said they would be
held as scheduled in the year 2000. He also blamed the Palestinians
and not his government, for the stalemate in progress towards
peace.
	   The United States is awaiting a long-overdue answer from Israel
on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Israel radio reported that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright telephoned Netanyahu from China Tuesday and urged him once
again to move forward with the promised troop withdrawal.

Singaporeans shocked by nude couple on the beach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Japanese chef and his local girlfriend, a
Singaporean masseuse, thought nothing about going skinny-dipping at
Singapore's East Coast beach last weekend.
	   Little did they expect it would get them arrested and fined
1,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 588) each for committing an ``obscene
act in public.''
	   But that's exactly what happened after a crowd of overnight
picnickers at the beach saw them in their birthday suits and
promptly called the police.
	   In its second article on the arrest this week, the leading
Straits Times daily on Wednesday interviewed a woman witness to the
nudity.
	   Awiyah Kassim, 38, said she had ``a shock of her life'' when a
woman emerged from the water naked as Kassim and her family were
picnicking nearby.
	   ``She was not shy at all! In fact, she was displaying her body
openly,'' said Kassim, who added she got ``another shock'' when a
naked man also emerged from the water.
	   ``It was so disgusting that I cannot describe it,'' said Kassim,
who had urged her husband to call the police.
	   The case has caught unusual media attention in multiethnic
Singapore, where in the same office one can find women in mini
skirts as well as those in baju kurong, a traditional Muslim long
dress.
	   The chef, Kazuhiro Inose, 29, told The Straits Times he did not
expect that they would end up in court for baring all on the beach.
	   ``Singapore is different than Japan,'' said Inose, who came to
the island republic last year to work in a Japanese restaurant.

Cambodia appeals for more election aid, observers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's election organizers
issued an urgent appeal Wednesday to the international community
for additional funds and observers for the July 26 polls.
	   Kassie Neou, vice chairman of the National Election Committee,
said Cambodia appreciated aid already provided by other countries
and the United Nations, but said more help was needed.
	   ``There are two more things we still request _ more
international observers and additional funding to meet our urgent
needs,'' Kassie Neou said in a statement.
	   Cambodia has been pledged more than dlrs 11 million in election
aid from the European Union, a similar amount from Japan and almost
dlrs 3 million from the United States.
	   The United States, which has serious doubts over the ability of
strongman Hun Sen's government to conduct a fair election, is
providing the money solely to non-governmental groups.
	   The committee, which the opposition says Hun Sen has stacked in
his favor, last week said that it would need dlrs 5.1 million more
to hold the polls.
	   Kassie Neou said there was a ``serious shortfall, especially in
the area of transportation.''
	   He also appealed for more foreign observers, now expected to
number about 500 by election day. Kassie Neou said the Cambodians
hoped to have one for each of the 1,700 ballot counting centers.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan last month pledged his
personal willingness to help Cambodia in the elections and urged
donor countries to help pay for the balloting.
	   Hun Sen hopes the election will restore international legitimacy
and aid lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a bloody takeover last year.

Mrs. Clinton says China must couple economic growth with freedom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ Echoing her husband's call for improved human
rights, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton cautioned Wednesday
that China must ensure its remarkable economic growth is
accompanied by greater basic freedoms, particularly for women.
	   In a speech at a modern new library in Shanghai, China's flashy
financial center, the first lady said that a country's development
and progress depended on ensuring that women get equal access to
health care, education, credit and jobs, as well as political,
social and economic rights.
	   Quoting a Chinese saying, Mrs. Clinton told an audience of about
700 members of the Shanghai Women's Federation and the U.S.
community here that ``women can only hold up half the sky when our
feet are planted fully on the soil of freedom and social and equal
justice.''
	   In an address in Beijing earlier this week, U.S. President Bill
Clinton declared certain rights to be ``universal'' and challenged
China's repressive system of government while extolling economic
reforms that are lifting millions of Chinese out of poverty.
	   Mrs. Clinton echoed that sentiment, praising China's economic
reforms as ``an extraordinary accomplishment.''
	   ``But economic and social progress must go hand-in-hand with the
strengthening of other freedoms, the yearning to be treated with
dignity, to be able to choose one's own religion or one's husband,
to speak freely, to participate fully in the life of one's
community,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``These yearnings know no national
boundary.''
	   No country would be as successful as it could be in the 21st
century if it leaves women behind, Mrs. Clinton said, noting that
young Chinese intellectuals as long ago as 1919 had contended that
equal rights for women were necessary for China to survive and
prosper.

Singaporeans shocked by nude couple on the beach

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Japanese chef and his local girlfriend, a
Singaporean masseuse, thought nothing about going for a midnight
skinny-dip at Singapore's East Coast beach last weekend.
	   Little did they expect it would get them arrested and fined
1,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 588) each for committing an ``obscene
act in public.''
	   But that's exactly what happened after a crowd of overnight
picnickers at the beach saw them in their birthday suits and
promptly called the police.
	   In its second article on the arrest this week, the leading
Straits Times daily on Wednesday interviewed a woman witness to the
nudity.
	   Awiyah Kassim, 38, said she had ``a shock of her life'' when a
woman emerged from the water naked as Kassim and her family were
picnicking nearby.
	   ``She was not shy at all! In fact, she was displaying her body
openly,'' said Kassim, who added she got ``another shock'' when a
naked man also emerged from the water.
	   ``It was so disgusting that I cannot describe it,'' said Kassim,
who had urged her husband to call the police.
	   The case has caught unusual media attention in multiethnic
Singapore, where in the same office one can find women in mini
skirts as well as those in baju kurong, a traditional Muslim long
dress.
	   The chef, Kazuhiro Inose, 29, told The Straits Times he did not
expect that they would end up in court for baring all on the beach.
	   ``Singapore is different than Japan,'' said Inose, who came to
the island republic last year to work in a Japanese restaurant.

Hanson: Send refugees home after conflict ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist political leader
Pauline Hanson unveiled her immigration policies Wednesday, saying
refugees would be kicked out of Australia when ``the troubles'' in
their homeland were over.
	   Hanson told reporters Australia's present intake of 12,000
refugees a year could be maintained by her One Nation party but
said this would be achieved under new, more stringent rules
including later deportation.
	   In a separate news conference, Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock denounced One Nation's immigration policy, saying ``It is a
document that is about dividing Australia rather than uniting
Australia.''
	   Ruddock said refugees should not be sent back, saying people who
leave their countries and make a commitment to Australia with their
families and with all their resources should be allowed to stay.
	   ``It does not do us any good as a nation to be pushing them
aside and saying that you are not as Australian as the rest of
us,'' Ruddock said. ``What they are indulging in here is a clear
sham.''
	   In a stormy news conference, Hanson and her spokeswoman on
immigration, Robyn Spencer, called for zero growth in immigrant
numbers and the abolition of the multiculturalism policy.
	   But Hanson and Spencer contradicted each other over whether a
refugee could gain Australian citizenship, what would happen to
their children and what deadline for deportation would exist.
	   At present, Australia generally allows people who are accepted
as refugees to stay permanently, if they wish to do so.
	   But under One Nation's proposed policy, once peace was
re-established in the refugees' country of origin, they would be
expected to return to it.
	   A reporter asked if this meant Bosnian refugees would be
returned to Bosnia.
	   Hanson did not reply.
	   She said that children of refugees would not obtain Australian
citizenship merely by living in this country.
	   When asked if a refugee could apply for citizenship, for example
after five years, Hanson replied ``yes'' but was immediately
rebutted by Spencer.
	   ``Because I think that they're here on temporary residence until
the problem is solved,'' Spencer said.
	   Hanson, who has said before that Australia is in danger of being
``swamped by Asians,'' did not retreat from that view.
	   ``I do not want Australia to become Asianized,'' she said. ``And
I am sure that no Asian country wants to see their country become
Australianized.''
	   Hanson said 70 percent of the migrants now coming to Australia
each year are Asian, a figure that was immediately challenged.
	   The government statistician reports that less than 35 percent of
Australia's migrants came from Asian countries last year. Britain
sends the most migrants, followed by New Zealand and Ireland.
	   Hanson said the zero net migration policy, under which the
number of migrants coming to Australia would be restricted to the
25,000 to 30,000 people who leave the country each year, will be
``non-discriminatory.''

Thai inflation soars in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai inflation is soaring as the
country grapples with economic crisis, with the Commerce Ministry
reporting Wednesday that consumer prices rose 10.7 percent in June,
the biggest increase in a decade.
	   The ministry attributed the increase to surging food prices,
especially rice and starch products and fruits and vegetables.
	   But Karun Kittisataporn, director general of the ministry's
Business Economics Department, said the increase was still below
the 12.2 percent forecast by the International Monetary Fund, which
is administering a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout for Thailand.
	   Inflation has been rising since Thailand abandoned exchange
rates pegged to the U.S. dollar a year ago, inadvertently sparking
the Asian economic crisis. The government has promised the IMF to
try to keep consumer price inflation at 10.5 percent this year.
	   Karun said he expected 1998 inflation to come in just under that
figure. The IMF has forecast that the June inflation figure will
represent the peak of year-on-year inflation, Karun said.
	   Year-on-year consumer inflation in the first half of 1998 was
9.7 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in the same period in 1997.
Analysts say year-on-year inflation should ease in the second half
of the year.

South Korea's trade surplus widens in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's trade surplus widened to
dlrs 3.92 billion in June, thanks to a sharp 36.6-percent drop in
imports, the government said Wednesday.
	   But the country's exports dropped by 5.6 percent in June, the
second consecutive monthly contraction, the Commerce, Industry and
Energy Ministry said.
	   South Korea hoped to use its weak currency to ship more goods
abroad to surmount its financial crisis, but the falling value of
the Japanese yen was undermining that strategy.
	   Exports fell 3 percent in May, and government officials expected
further decreases in the months ahead. Japan and South Korea
compete in key export items, and the weak yen makes Japanese goods
cheaper overseas.
	   In June, customs-cleared exports fell to dlrs 11.7 billion and
imports plunged to dlrs 7.79 billion, resulting in a dlrs 3.92
billion surplus.
	   In the same month last year, South Korea posted a dlrs 104
million surplus.
	   The cumulative trade surplus in the first six months this year
reached dlrs 19.99 billion, compared with a dlrs 9.16 billion
shortfall a year ago. In the same period, exports increased 3.6
percent but imports decreased 36 percent.

Dispute over Subic leadership forces Fedex to divert planes

<TEXT>
	   OLONGAPO, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. air cargo company Federal
Express diverted three planes from its Asian hub at Subic Bay
freeport after rival groups threatened a violent showdown over who
should head the special economic zone, officials said Wednesday.
	   The three planes, each carrying about 10 tons of cargo, were
diverted to Manila late Tuesday and early Wednesday, airport
officials said.
	   Richard Gordon, who has led the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority
since it was created at a former U.S. naval base in 1992, has
refused to step down after being dismissed by new Philippine
President Joseph Estrada.
	   Estrada instead appointed a long-time Gordon rival, former Rep.
Felicito Payumo, to the post, but Gordon insists he still has six
years remaining in his term because he was re-appointed by former
President Fidel Ramos in February.
	   Hundreds of Gordon's supporters barricaded all the gates leading
to the freeport on Wednesday. They also used a huge crane to block
a highway tunnel where thousands of supporters of Payumo were
gathering.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appears to be in retaliation for efforts
by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases
movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada, who took office Tuesday, said that as a Ramos
appointee, Gordon should offer to resign according to tradition to
give the new president a free hand in choosing his own appointees.
	   Radio reports said some factories at the freeport shut down
Wednesday to prevent their workers from being caught in any violent
confrontation between the pro-Gordon and pro-Payumo groups.
	   Gordon's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to stop Payumo's
takeover to prevent violence, but withdrew their motion early
Wednesday, saying they would refile it with a lower court.
	   Subic, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Manila, was
converted into an industrial and tourism center after the Americans
left in 1992.
	   Gordon, the previous mayor of the neighboring city of Olongapo,
led volunteers who protected the former base from looters, and
wooed investors including Fedex and Acer, the Taiwanese computer
manufacturer. The industrial zone now employs about 67,000 workers,
more than double the number during the time it was a U.S. base.
	   Officials at Fedex, which established its Asian hub in Subic in
1995, were not immediately available for comment.

Clinton calls on China to open its markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: GRAF 2 new with Clinton disappointed on WTO progress, minor
editing elsewhere. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton called on
China Wednesday to open its markets to foreign trade, and he urged
American investors in the world's largest country to help it battle
huge environmental problems.
	   Clinton said he was disappointed that more progress was not made
during this trip toward an agreement for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
	   Addressing U.S. business leaders in this communist city that
showcases capitalism, Clinton said he could not, as a visiting
president, ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
environmental measures.
	   ``But as a citizen of the world and the leader of my country, I
have a responsibility to ask us all to work together for a planet
that our grandchildren can still enjoy living on. And so do you.''
	   He also urged American firms operating here to set a good
example on fair labor standards and business practices. He called
on China to dismantle its ailing state-run industries and improve
its legal and regulatory system. Pointedly, he urged ``strong
efforts to combat corruption.''
	   In another direct remark, Clinton suggested that China protect
personal rights and constrain ``arbitrary government.''
	   Clinton spoke with business leaders in the atrium of a high-rise
hotel before touring Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a shimmering symbol
of China's march toward a market economy. In the towering steel and
glass building housing the exchange, the president was having lunch
with young Chinese entrepreneurs.
	   He said China must agree to ``strong terms'' to qualify for
membership in the WTO, which sets the rules for global trade. That
would require opening markets and allowing investment opportunities
here for foreign firms. The terms have to be ``clear and
unambiguous,'' the president said, although he said China should be
granted some concessions as a developing nation.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said. ``More open markets are
important to the United States, which buys today about a third of
China's exports _ and in turn should have a fair shot at China's
markets. It is important to China as it builds an economy that must
compete globally.''
	   He said rapid change and disruptions caused by economic reform
``make it tempting to turn inward and to slow down. But for China,
as for America, the promise for the future lies in helping our
citizens to master the challenges of the global economy, not to run
away from them.''
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley, speaking to the same
forum, said China's leaders, in meetings over the last week,
insisted they could not open their markets because domestic
industries cannot compete in the global economy.
	   ``We believe the opposite is true,'' Daley said. ``The more
China opens its markets, the more its domestic industries will be
able to compete.''
	   Clinton said China will have to develop worker retraining and
social security programs as it transforms its massive state-run
industries into market-based companies. He said the United States
stands ready to help with ideas.
	   There was a strong environmental message in Clinton's remarks,
noting that China will soon surpass the United States as the
largest emitter of greenhouse gases that many scientists believe
are responsible for global warming.
	   He said 1998 promises to be the warmest year in recorded history
and that environmental pollution in any nation is a global problem.
	   Clinton said Shanghai, a flashy center of global trade and
finance, could be the center of an energy revolution in China.
	   ``We have to do something to break the idea in people's minds
that the only way to grow the economy of a developing country is to
adopt industrial-age energy use patterns. It is not true, it is a
huge problem, it is still a problem in the United States. I ask you
to lead the way.''
	   He also urged the business leader to press the U.S. Congress to
grant permanent most-favored-nation trading benefits for China,
saying the United States could not turn its back on the world's
largest nation.
	   A key U.S. House committee overwhelmingly passed the measure
last week, and both houses are expected to take it up in July.

Report: Japan to enact residential, income tax cuts next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from government official

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has decided
to enact permanent cuts in residential and income taxes in 1999 to
boost the country's sluggish economy, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may announce the cuts ahead of
elections to the upper house of Parliament on July 12, reported the
Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily.
	   The cuts, which would replace a special tax cut of two trillion
yen (dlrs 14.5 billion) now planned to take effect in 1999, will be
between two trillion yen and four trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) in
scale, the Yomiuri reported.
	   Chief Government Spokesman Kanezo Muraoka said he wasn't aware
of any decision on tax cuts, but that the government would debate
the issue after elections for Parliament's upper house on July 12,
the Nikkei News Service reported.
	   According to the newspaper, Japanese government officials and
leading members of the LDP told U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers of the permanent tax cut plans when he visited
Japan in mid-June.
	   At the latest, Hashimoto will formally announce the cuts before
his scheduled meeting on July 22 with U.S. President Bill Clinton
in Washington, the Yomiuri reported.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Would-be immigrants often try desperate measures
to flee to more fortunate lands. Sometimes their efforts end in
tragedy. A boat full of Arabs and Africans set out for Europe this
month, but ended up drifting for days. An Associated Press
correspondent reports on the suffering of the 109 people who
survived _ and two who didn't.
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ Blinded by thirst and anger, Arabs and
Africans fought over food that was scarce and water that was even
scarcer aboard a fishing trawler drifting for nine days under a
scorching sun in the eastern Mediterranean.
	   The journey began filled with the hope of would-be illegal
immigrants, some from as far away as Rwanda. For all 111
passengers, it was infused with the optimism of a better life in
Western Europe.
	   Instead, it turned into a harrowing trip that only ended Monday,
after a Ukrainian boat miraculously spotted two passengers who had
left the trawler on a raft. The others, drifting off Cyprus, were
then rescued. Some were unconscious, some in need of medical help,
virtually all severely sunburned.
	   Two already had died of thirst, their bodies thrown overboard.
Children and pregnant women drank sea water to try to quench their
thirst, and toddlers fought over bread, survivors told The
Associated Press in the Cypriot port of Limassol.
	   Their journey was part of a growing trade in illegal immigrants
that targets Cyprus and southern Europe, either as a destination or
transit points.
	   The Syrian-flagged ``Rida Allah'' _ Arabic for ``God's
blessing'' _ sailed from Tripoli in northern Lebanon on June 18
with a six-man crew. It declared Benghazi, Libya, as its
destination.
	   In reality, the passengers wanted to be taken to Greece or
Italy. They had paid middlemen in Lebanon, Sudan and northern Iraq
thousands of dollars for passage aboard the boat.
	   Most of the passengers hailed from Rwanda, Congo and Arab
countries like Lebanon, Iraq and Libya.
	   Two days after setting sail, the vessel developed engine trouble
and the crew was unable to repair it, survivors said.
	   Water and food began to run out. Tensions began to rise.
	   ``Nearly 40 ships sailed past us, and there was no way they
could not have seen us. But no one bothered to rescue us,'' said
Farhad Izzideen Ali, a Kurd from northern Iraq.
	   As some ships passed, the passengers shouted for help. Some even
started small fires to attract attention.
	   The passengers, who included eight children and 12 women, barely
had room to stretch out to sleep. Some ate bread that was stale or
even rotting.
	   ``My children were snatching the small pieces of bread from each
other's mouths and fighting over them,'' said Idrees Mohammed Ali,
an Iraqi Kurd. His three children, ages 5, 3, and 10 months, played
on the floor of their Limassol hotel room, where the Cypriot
government was housing the passengers until it decided what to do
with them.
	   ``We have seen death and destruction in Iraq, but to see your
own child dying from hunger and thirst is something else,'' he
said.
	   Faced with what seemed to be certain death, passengers resorted
to violence. Arabs said the Africans, who made up the majority of
the group, attacked them and the Syrian captain and crew with
knives.
	   ``They took our food and water,'' said Leila Farahat al-Masri,
an 8-year-old Lebanese girl. She was on the boat with her father
and mother, who is 7 months pregnant.
	   But Peter Osagiadeliyi, a 30-year-old Rwandan, said the Arabs
kept the ship's food and water to themselves.
	   ``I told my fellow blacks on the boat that it is better to die
than let these people kill us,'' he said. ``We took the food and
water, but later returned half.''
	   Osagiadeliyi left Rwanda in 1993, the year before the central
African state plunged into civil war and genocide. He and his wife
lived in Ethiopia and Sudan before arriving in Tripoli as
stowaways, in hopes of making their way to Europe.
	   Convinced that help would never come, some passengers decided to
seek it on their own. A makeshift raft was built of scrap wood and
barrels. A Rwandan and a Liberian volunteered to leave the Rida
Allah to find help.
	   Twenty-four hours later, and after fellow passengers lost hope
they would ever come back, the two returned with the
Ukrainian-flagged Valerian Zorin.
	   Mohammed Mustafa, the skipper of the boat carrying the illegal
immigrants, was ordered held for eight days by a Limassol court,
and the passengers were taken to the hotel, where they were kept
under armed police guard.
	   ``Whatever happens to us now is out of my control,''
Osagiadeliyi said. ``I can only wait.''

Dangerous python escapes in Tokyo suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An African python has escaped from its owner and is
suspected to be loose in a Tokyo suburb, endangering the lives of
infants, police said Wednesday.
	   The 3.6-meter- (12-foot-) long python slithered into a river
Monday in Sayama, north of Tokyo, while its owner was sunbathing on
the river's bank, said police spokesman Tomoyuki Watanabe.
	   The owner, Tsuneo Ito, looked for the snake by himself before
reporting his pet missing late Tuesday.
	   The snake is not poisonous, but its species is known to prey on
small animals such as rabbits and chickens, eating them whole, said
Watanabe.
	   That has raised fears that the snake could attack babies in the
area, and the police have warned local families to keep an eye on
their young children, Watanabe said.
	   Some 75 local officials, from police officers to city
bureaucrats, are out on the streets of Sayama trying to capture the
snake, Watanabe said.
	   Ito, who owns five other snakes, is being questioned by police
on suspicion of violating the local pet code by failing to receive
prior government approval to keep the snakes.

Thousands of Indonesian workers stage third day of protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hit hard by Indonesia's economic
crisis, thousands of workers demanding higher salaries staged
protests for the third consecutive day in central Java island,
police said Wednesday.
	   About 3,000 workers took part in the protest at a local
government office in Sukoharjo, 520 kilometers (325 miles) east of
the capital, Jakarta, police Lt. Nadiri said.
	   Workers from a textile company, P.T. Tyfontex, went on strike on
Monday. On Tuesday, they demonstrated at the local labor office in
the nearby town of Solo.
	   In a separate protest Tuesday, police and soldiers, firing
rubber bullets, wounded dozens of steel factory workers in Bekasi,
just east of Jakarta.
	   All 2,100 employees of the factory, PT Gunung Garuda, were
protesting low salaries. Police in Bekasi said the workers were
back on the job Wednesday.
	   The protests occurred as the government announced an average 15
percent increase in the minimum wage, increasing some monthly
salaries to between 130,000 and 198,500 rupiah (dlrs 8.60 and dlrs
13.20).
	   Indonesia is currently facing its worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Student protests for democracy and riots fueled by big rises in
prices and unemployment helped force President Suharto to quit
after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   The government of new President B.J. Habibie signed a deal last
week with the International Monetary fund which is expected to
clear the way for the resumption next month of billions of dollars
in aid.

Dollar tumbles, Tokyo stocks soar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon currency, bond; ADDS
trader comment in 11th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen Wednesday
on a report that the Japanese government will cut taxes to bolster
the economy. Tokyo stock prices soared.
	   The dollar bought 137.74 yen as of mid-afternoon, down 2.21 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
139.16 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose for
the sixth consecutive session, jumping 532.62 points, or 3.36
percent, to close at 16,362.89.
	   On Tuesday, the benchmark average rose 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent. It has gained almost 9 percent in the last six sessions.
	   Japanese financial markets have rallied on growing expectations
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will propose a sweeping tax cut
ahead of upper house elections July 12.
	   Investors are optimistic a tax cut would spur consumer spending,
lifting Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   In the latest sign such a cut may be in the works, a front page
story Wednesday morning in Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri,
said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto plans to introduce permanent
income and residential tax cuts of up to 4 trillion yen (dlrs 29
billion) next year.
	   Investors also took heart from recent signs that Japan is moving
to clean up once and for all the bad loans that have plagued its
banks since the collapse of real estate prices in the early 1990s.
	   Newspapers have cited top LDP lawmakers as supporting plans to
allow ``bridge banks'' based on a U.S. model to take over failed
financial institutions.
	   The outlook for a resurgent Japanese economy sent investors
scrambling for yen, traders said.
	   ``The trend until now has been to buy dollars, but that trend is
likely to gradually change,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign
exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   On the stock market, optimism about a rebound in consumer
spending triggered buying of shares of companies whose earnings are
tied to the domestic economy, said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager
of the stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   Steel makers, banks and real estate developers were among the
biggest gainers.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section ended up 40.37 points, or 3.18 percent, to 1,270.75.
The index closed up 28.16 points, or 2.34 percent, the day before.
	   Optimism about the domestic economy even excited the normally
staid bond market, sending yields higher on expectations companies
will start borrowing more as they step up production.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond jumped to 1.400 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of 1.330.
Its price fell to 110.47 yen from the previous day's 110.99 yen.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gas leaking from a kitchen stove exploded on the
top floor of an apartment building the Siberian city of Omsk,
killing four people and injuring six, Emergency Situations Ministry
said Wednesday.
	   The gas was leaking from an unlit stove that a resident had
forgotten to turn off, a ministry official was quoted as saying by

stairwell outside, which may have set off the blast, the official
said.
	   Four of the injured were hospitalized after the explosion late

	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Indian border forces killed five
separatist guerrillas in a gunfight near the frontier with Bhutan
early Wednesday, a border patrol official said.
	   No soldiers were reported killed in the clash near Baghmara, a
village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Gauhati, the
capital of the state of Assam.
	   Ashok Kumar, a deputy inspector general for the Border Security
Force, said the soldiers came under heavy automatic weapons fire as
they patrolled near Baghmara. They returned fire, killing the five
members of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and recovering
a large cache of weapons, Kumar said.
	   The National Democratic Front of Bodoland has been fighting to
carve out an independent homeland in Assam since 1986. Indian
officials say the front has several bases across the border in
Bhutan.
	   Hundreds of Indian troops patrol the Indian side of the border,
but tiny Bhutan is unable to deploy many troops on its side.

Life ends and begins during a largely ignored war

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ He's a little boy, an infant born
eight months ago in an impoverished, largely ignored West African
country. Now, with the withered face of an old man, he's dying
minute by minute.
	   Adao Bodjam's mother died in Guinea-Bissau's fighting; the baby
no longer can breastfeed and refuses to eat. Dysentery and
starvation are stealing his young life.
	   ``I wish I could say he would live, but all I can say is that it
isn't going to be easy,'' says Julio Namfantche, a physician and
refugee from the capital Bissau who volunteers at Mansoa's small
hospital.
	   Renegade army Brig. Ansumane Mane's failed coup earlier this
month against President Joao Bernardo Vieira has escalated into an
armed standoff in the capital. The rebels insist Vieira's
government is corrupt.
	   For three weeks, Guinea-Bissau's capital has been pounded by
daily rocket and artillery fire. Virtually all of its 300,000
people have fled.
	   Over the weekend, the war spread. Gunfire rattled near the town
of Mansoa, where tens of thousands of refugees have gathered.
	   At the 15-bed facility in Mansoa lie the poignant end results of
war, sickened and wounded on soiled sheets.
	   Waving a hand over his head, Adao's grandmother shoos buzzing
house flies from his wide eyes, strikingly white and awkwardly
large against sunken cheekbones.
	   ``I wish to see the day when I can watch him running and playing
football with the other boys,'' Isabel Djata says.
	   Her hand engulfs his stick-thin arm as she gingerly strokes his
hand with a finger. Adao's tiny frame has dwindled to bones in grim
relief against taught skin. With his tiny body lying on an adult
hospital bed, he is waiting to die.
	   A simple intravenous solution of amino plasma could save the
child's life, says Namfantche. But as with most things in Mansoa,
there is none to be found.
	   Short of medicine and food, without electricity or modern
medical equipment, Namfantche does what he can to ease the pain of
wounded soldiers, sick civilians and Adao, an infant casualty of a
barely noticed war.
	   The United Nations and most of the international community _
either unwilling or unable to do anything to help a population
caught in this conflict _ have been slow to respond.
	   Most expatriates and diplomatic staff withdrew from
Guinea-Bissau when fighting broke out June 7.
	   ``All our personnel have been withdrawn,'' said Van Szengsouk, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Senegal. ``Now we
have nothing to do with it whatsoever. Even if we get a request
(for help), we're not responding.''
	   French President Jacques Chirac has said his country will only
intervene if asked, and then only with a diplomatic mission.
	   But the crisis, the United Nations says, may continue to worsen.
A five-member U.N. team arrived Monday to examine the situation _
22 days after it began.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program says only a few days worth of
rice stocks remain in the central town of Bafata, where the
population has doubled to 300,000 in recent weeks.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a dirt-poor country that fought its way out of
Portuguese colonial rule, long has been treading a fine line
between subsistence and starvation.
	   But with the fighting, Namfantche says more and more children
are coming to the hospital in Mansoa malnourished. Refugees line
its corridors and medicine is in desperately short supply.
	   A rebel soldier, his arms and legs burned and his hip broken,
lies on dirty sheets, dazed with pain.
	   Across a courtyard in the hospital's last room _ two doors away
from the dying infant Adao _ an 18-year-old woman, Sabado Tchame,
is giving birth. There are no heart monitors, forceps or other
maternity ward tools.
	   Nurses massage Tchame's belly, trying to help the baby out.
Blood pools on the floor, streaming down the rusting legs of the
woman's bed.
	   A healthy baby girl emerges and the new mother pants with
exhaustion.
	   ``If you are born, well, you have no choice where you are
born,'' Tchame had said less than an hour before going into labor.
``But I at least want my child to grow up in a place of peace.''

Netanyahu, Weizman agree to stop trading accusations in public
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting over, statement &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After questioning each other's competence and
quarreling over Mideast peacemaking, Israel's president and prime
minister met Wednesday and agreed to stop trading blame in public.
	   However, there was no indication that President Ezer Weizman and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu settled their differences during
the 70-minute meeting at the president's residence.
	   The high-profile confrontation began earlier this week when
Weizman blamed Netanyahu for the deadlock in the peace talks with
the Palestinians and said it was time to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, accused Weizman of overstepping his
authority and siding with the Arabs and Israel's dovish opposition.
	   The president's role is largely ceremonial.
	   However, with his call for early elections the popular Weizman
may have provided the impetus for the centrist Third Way Party to
bolt the government and topple Netanyahu if the prime minister does
not agree soon to withdraw Israeli troops in the West Bank.
	   The United States is waiting for a long-overdue Israeli answer
on a U.S. proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan that was first
introduced in January, but Netanyahu has said he does not have
sufficient assurances from the Palestinians that they will carry
out promises to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   Weizman hinted recently that he felt he was being misled by
Netanyahu when the prime minister assured him he was serious about
carrying out a troop withdrawal. In a meeting last month, Netanyahu
requested that Weizman make use of his strong ties with the Arab
world and ask the leaders of Egypt and Jordan to give Israel a
little more time to reach agreement on a withdrawal.
	   In subsequent interviews, Weizman suggested he felt he was being
used by Netanyahu to gain more time, and that the prime minister
had no intention of reaching agreement on a troop withdrawal soon.
	   Unable to contain his frustration, Weizman on Monday called for
early elections over the deadlock in the peace talks. An angry
Netanyahu said the vote would be held in 2000, as scheduled.
	   Both leaders made their case in TV and newspaper interviews.
	   Weizman questioned Netanyahu's qualifications to be prime
minister. ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world.
Cut off from reality,'' Weizman told the Yediot Ahronot daily
Tuesday. Netanyahu shot back, saying ``the president, to my sorrow,
took a stand with the left to actually get rid of the current
elected government.''
	   After Wednesday's meeting, arranged by a leading figure of
Netanyahu's Likud Party, Weizman and Netanyahu issued a brief
statement, saying they had explained their positions to one
another.
	   They agreed that ``for the good of the country, it is necessary
that every issue be examined and discussed privately and not in
public,'' the statement said.

Cambodia's deposed leader vows to solve Vietnamese problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh played on Cambodia's long hatred of Vietnam in a campaign
speech Wednesday, promising to tackle the racially explosive issue
of Vietnamese immigrants if he wins elections July 26.
	   Speaking to about 2,000 supporters at a temple in Phnom Penh,
the prince said he will also seek to renegotiate a border agreement
with Cambodia's larger eastern neighbor.
	   ``If I win, I promise to solve the border issue and the problem
of illegal immigrants,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh was deposed as co-prime minister last year by his
archrival, Hun Sen, who is identified by many Cambodians with the
decade-long Vietnamese occupation that followed Hanoi's invasion in
1979 and overthrow of the genocidal Khmer Rouge.
	   The murderous Khmer Rouge, which waged years of guerrilla
warfare after being overthrown, and moderate figures like the
prince have all played the anti-Vietnam card to win support from
Cambodians, many of whom have visceral antipathy for Vietnam.
	   The prince said a woman he met on the campaign trail had summed
up her view of the election for him: ``If you vote correctly, the
number of Yuon will go down. If you vote wrongly it will go up.''
	   The main targets are hundreds of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese
living in Cambodia _ some for generations. To many Cambodians, they
are living reminders of the vast tracts of territory the once-proud
Khmer empire lost to Vietnamese expansion over the centuries.
	   Despite leading Cambodia for most of the years since 1985, Hun
Sen has never become a truly popular leader, in large part because
he was originally put in power and backed by Vietnamese troops.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but was forced
to share power when Hun Sen threatened renewed civil war. The
prince was ousted a year ago when the stronger Hun Sen staged a
coup.
	   Hoping to win back international legitimacy, Hun Sen has called
new elections but critics say the polls have been stacked in favor.
Nevertheless, Ranariddh predicted victory and promised that if he
wins this time, he will not share power with Hun Sen.
	   Ranariddh said that if people vote for Hun Sen, Cambodia will be
swallowed up by Vietnam _ which he called by the derogatory term
``Yuon'' _ in a ``dangerous'' trend where Vietnamese will
eventually take over the prime minister's office.
	   ``I don't hate Yuon,'' Ranariddh said, ``but if Yuon wants a
good relationship with Cambodia, it must respect our territorial
integrity, sovereignty, and stop sending its people to live in
Cambodia.''
	   Ranariddh said he would renegotiate a border agreement Hun Sen's
government signed with Vietnam in the 1980s.
	   The dispute over the 1,100-kilometer (800-mile) border
threatened to turn violent last year preceding the coup, when
Ranariddh accused Vietnam of ``invading'' his country by allowing
its people to farm on Cambodian soil.

New UBS announces sale of subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The newly merged United Bank of
Switzerland said Wednesday that Italian insurance company
Assicurazioni Generali intends to buy two of its subsidiaries.
	   The sale of Banca della Svizzera Italiana, a subsidiary in the
Italian-speaking canton (state) of Ticino, and Bosslab Corp., which
provides information technology for banking services, were among
conditions imposed on the new UBS by regulators.
	   The sale price for the two will total 1.92 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 1.32 billion), UBS said in a statement. The sale is subject
to approval by Italian and Swiss regulators.
	   The bank said it would use the proceeds of the transaction,
which it expects to contribute an additional profit of some 1
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 690 million) this year, to pursue its
strategic goals in private banking.
	   The new UBS, with dlrs 627 billion in assets, now the world's
second largest behind Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, started
trading Monday. It is the product of the merger of Swiss Bank Corp.
and Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   Switzerland's antitrust watchdog in May conditionally approved
the merger, which cleared its final hurdle of approval by the U.S.
Federal Reserve in June.
	   UBS must, if possible, sell by next March some 25 bank branches
as a package to one single buyer interested in establishing itself
as a Swiss retail bank, the regulators said.
	   It also has to divest Banca della Svizzera Italiana, Bosslab
Corp. and another Swiss subsidiary, Solothurner Bank.

Games to generate dlrs 3.8 billion from tourists says Minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's 2000 Olympics will attract 1.6
million visitors to Australia and generate U.S. dlrs 3.8 billion
(Aust dlrs 6.1 million), according to federal Tourism and Sports
Minister Andrew Thomson.
	   Releasing a new report commissioned by Australia's Tourism
Forecasting Council, Thomson said 132,000 overseas visitors were
likely to come to Australia as a direct result of the 2000 Games.
	   This would include athletes, officials, judges, journalists and
spectators.
	   Another 1.49 million tourists would be attracted by the
publicity surrounding the Olympics, he said.
	   The figures are the first official forecast of the likely extent
of the tourism spin-off from the Games.
	   ``The figures are very good for the tourism industry and very
good for those people who are employed in it,'' Thomson said.
	   The majority of tourists who will visit Australia because of the
2000 Olympics will come from the Asian region, he said.
	   Forty five percent of Olympic visitors would come from Asian
nations, while 25 per cent would come from Europe and 15 per cent
from the United States.
	   Thomson said that while the host state New South Wales would
benefit from the bulk of tourism, half of the extra tourists are
expected to also visit Queensland, 25 percent are expected to visit
Victoria and nine per cent would travel to the Northern Territory.
	   The forecast is based on a consensus reached by a panel of 43
tourism experts as to the likely impact of the Olympics on tourism
between 1997 and 2004.
	   The panel took into account the expected rate of recovery of the
Asian region from the current financial crisis.
	   Thomson said the recent decline in Asians visitors, due in part
to the regional financial crisis, had been balanced by an increase
in tourists from Europe, New Zealand and the U.S.
	   Tony South, director of one of Australia's biggest hotel
syndicates, Tourism Asset Holdings, welcomed the figures as a
``shining piece of good news.''
	   ``In an industry that's been beset by endless bad news in the
last 12 months I'm sure that it will be seen as a very positive
indicator,'' South said.

Prime minister wins party support for Aboriginal land rights deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government striking deal on land rights bill,
avoiding need to call early election. Will be updated later with
developments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard struck a
deal with a key independent senator Wednesday to adopt a
long-delayed Aboriginal land rights law.
	   By reaching the compromise, Howard will avoid having to dissolve
Parliament and call an early election to resolve an impasse over
the legislation, which has been blocked by the Senate until now.
	   The bill would limit claims by Aborigines on the vast tracts of
lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and miners.
The lessees claim they can't manage their businesses properly if
the land is subject to Aboriginal claims.
	   But the compromise is bound to provoke anger from both sides of
the issue. Aborigines say they are losing land access rights, and
landholders say it is a watered-down bill that doesn't guarantee
their businesses.
	   Howard reached a final compromise Wednesday with independent
Sen. Brian Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the
narrowly divided Senate.
	   Howard had been threatening to call an election on the issue
since Harradine blocked passage of the legislation in April, and
set July 4 as a deadline for laws to be passed.
	   The next election must be held by May 1999, but some analysts
said an August poll was likely if it was called early.
	   Compromise talks between Harradine and Howard were reopened
after the surprising success of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
in Queensland state elections June 13.
	   One Nation, which opposes special welfare payments to Aborigines
and Asian immigration, took 11 seats in the 89-member state
Parliament, many at the coalition's expense.
	   One Nation wants to abolish native title.
	   The government introduced the so-called 10-point native title
plan to spell out the exact extent of a 1996 High Court ruling
recognizing Aborigines' right to lay non-exclusive claim to
government-held land leased to farmers and miners _ some 42 percent
of Australia's land mass.
	   The plan would weaken the power of Aborigines over development
projects on pastoral leases, restrict their ability to claim native
title, set a deadline for native title claims to be presented and
allow Aborigines to claim compensation from projects where native
title can be proved.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India won the toss and put Sri Lanka
to bat in their three-nation Independence Cup cricket tournament
match in Colombo on Wednesday.
	   The match was reduced to 36 overs per side due to overnight

	   A wet patch two feet in diameter in front of the batting crease
at one end was the main reason for the delay.
	   India retained the same team that beat Sri Lanka in the opening
match while the host side brought in batsman Avishka Gunawardena

Asian economic crisis seen slowing arms expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The economic crisis in Southeast Asia
has produced an unexpected peace dividend, slowing the buying of
new weapons in the region, Australia's outgoing defense chief said
Wednesday.
	   Retiring Gen. John Baker said the financial turmoil had given
Australian defense planners breathing space in their plans to
acquired new military hardware.
	   ``Certainly, in defense terms, a slowdown in the acquisition of
modern defense systems in the region gives us a bit more time to
make our own judgments,'' Baker said in an address to the National
Press Club.
	   Baker recalled that 18 months ago, he voiced concern that the
economic turmoil could create uncertainties in the region, and said
that the speed and extent of the crisis had delivered a serious
lesson to defense planners.
	   ``I suggest to you that the mismatch between our ability to
change and the changes in the world around us are cause for some
concern,'' Baker said.
	   He said the onset of the Asian economic crisis showed just how
unpredictable the world is.
	   He said there are still pressures in Korea and problems in
Cambodia, and that India's and Pakistan's decisions to detonate
nuclear devices were a sobering development.
	   But recent changes in the region had not all been bad. U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China signaled the prospect of
improved relations between the two countries.
	   He said the lead times involved in the acquisition of defense
equipment could be very long.
	   For example, Australia's current program for the acquisition of
new submarines had been conceived in 1982 but the last submarine
would not be delivered until the year 2002, Baker said.

Russian prime minister says financial crisis demands urgent action
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Russia's
faltering economy was once again shrinking and he pleaded with
parliament Wednesday to swiftly approve an austerity package aimed
at halting a worsening financial crisis.
	   Kiriyenko outlined the government's recovery plan in a speech to
parliament Wednesday morning, but the Communists who dominate the
legislature have not yet indicated whether they will pass the
measures.
	   ``To delay the decision is also a decision in itself, the
consequences of which are very serious,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   The Russian economy grew by a modest 0.8 percent last year, its
first sign of growth in almost a decade. But it has declined 0.2
percent in the first five months of this year and the country is
facing a worsening financial crisis, the premier said.
	   The Russian stock market has lost half its value this year,
foreign investors have been fleeing, and the government is short of
cash due to its inability to collect taxes and a drop in revenues
from oil exports.
	   Russia is seeking a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from
the International Monetary Fund to help stabilize its economy, but
Kiriyenko said any aid must be accompanied by financial reforms.
	   ``To simply take an IMF (loan) and not carry out a stabilization
program is senseless,'' he said. ``We'll have the same problems
within four to five months, only worse.''
	   So far, the crisis has been limited largely to Russia's
financial markets.
	   But the government's big fear is that the ruble will be
devalued, causing prices to rise and inflicting more economic pain
on hard-pressed Russians
	   The government is proposing a package of 26 measures aimed
largely at cutting the budget and improving tax collection. The
government hopes the package will restore confidence to the markets
and convince the IMF to approve a new loan.
	   Kiriyenko said the government was currently collecting only 21
billion rubles (dlrs 3.4 billion) each month, and needed 25 billion
rubles (dlrs 4 billion) to make ends meet.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their pay months late due to
the government's chronic cash shortage.
	   Communists in parliament have consistently opposed spending
cuts, arguing that the government should spend more to help
struggling individuals and industries.
	   But President Boris Yeltsin and his administration say the
country must live within its means, and increasing spending would
only reignite inflation.
	   Russian lawmakers said that some of the government's anti-crisis
economic measures were likely to get preliminary approval before
the legislature begins its summer recess on Friday.
	   But the legislature is likely to oppose some of the proposals,
and a final decision is not expected before a special session in
mid-July.

Netanyahu, Weizman agree to stop trading accusations in public
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After questioning each other's competence and
quarreling over Mideast peacemaking, Israel's president and prime
minister met Wednesday and agreed to stop trading blame in public.
	   However, there was no indication that President Ezer Weizman and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu settled their differences during
the 70-minute meeting at the president's residence.
	   The high-profile confrontation began Monday when Weizman blamed
Netanyahu for the deadlock in the peace talks with the Palestinians
and said it was time to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, accused Weizman of overstepping his
authority and siding with the Arabs and Israel's dovish opposition.
	   The president's role is largely ceremonial.
	   However, with his call for early elections, the popular Weizman
may have provided the impetus for the centrist Third Way Party to
bolt the government and topple Netanyahu if the prime minister does
not agree soon to withdraw Israeli troops in the West Bank.
	   The United States is waiting for a long-overdue Israeli answer
on a U.S. proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan that was first
introduced in January, but Netanyahu has said he does not have
sufficient assurances from the Palestinians that they will carry
out promises to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   Weizman has suggested that he felt he was being misled by
Netanyahu when the prime minister assured him he was serious about
carrying out a troop withdrawal. In a meeting last month, Netanyahu
requested that Weizman make use of his strong ties with the Arab
world and ask the Egyptian and Jordanian leaders to give Israel a
little more time to agree on a withdrawal.
	   Unable to contain his frustration, Weizman called Monday for
early elections over the deadlock in the peace talks. An angry
Netanyahu said the vote would be held in 2000, as scheduled.
	   Weizman questioned Netanyahu's qualifications to be prime
minister. ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world.
Cut off from reality,'' Weizman said in an interview published in
the Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper on Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu shot back in an interview on Israel TV, saying ``the
president, to my sorrow, took a stand with the left to actually get
rid of the current elected government.''
	   After Wednesday's meeting, arranged by a leading figure of
Netanyahu's Likud Party, Weizman and Netanyahu issued a brief
statement, saying they had explained their positions to one
another.
	   They agreed that ``for the good of the country, it is necessary
that every issue be examined and discussed privately and not in
public,'' according to the statement.

Myanmar exile group claims new crackdown on opposition party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military authorities may have
detained more than 40 parliamentary election winners from the
opposition National League for Democracy in the past week, an exile
group said Wednesday.
	   A spokesman for the All Burma Students' Democratic Front said
details were difficult to confirm, but the group had the names of
three election winners from Irrawaddy Division, near the capital
Yangon, who had been arrested.
	   Contacted from Bangkok, the spokesman, who asked not to be
identified, said the crackdown was in apparent response to a June
23 demand by the league that the country's military regime convene
by Aug. 21 the pro-democracy Parliament elected in 1990 but never
allowed to meet.
	   The demand marked the first time the party, headed by 1991 Nobel
peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, had set a deadline for the
military to convene Parliament.
	   In Yangon, the league sent a letter to the government Tuesday to
protest reported restrictions against its elected candidates,
according to a copy of the letter circulated to the press by the
party.
	   Authorities had ``verbally or in writing'' asked elected
candidates of the party to sign pledges restricting their
movements, and those who refused were being imprisoned, said the
letter, addressed to Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the ruling State
Peace and Development Council; Senior Chief Justice Aung Toe and
Attorney General Tha Tun.
	   ``Treating the elected candidates of the party as criminals
amounts to abusing the law as well as misusing the power. Hence we
strongly protest such restrictions placed against the elected
members of the party,'' said the letter, signed by party chairman
Aung Shwe.
	   The party also urged its members of parliament not to sign such
pledges, and advised those who had to sign them not to honor them.
	   The letter did not make clear when such a restriction order had
been issued, or to how many people.
	   The military has staged several such roundups in the past in
response to plans by the league for some kind of political action.
	   In a murky incident last Thursday that appeared to be another
instance of intimidation, unidentified men assaulted members of the
youth wing of Suu Kyi's party outside her home in Yangon after
police tried to block them from holding a regularly scheduled
meeting.
	   The military _ which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962 _ refused to honor the 1990 election results when it
became clear that the league had won a landslide victory over
pro-military parties.
	   The student group spokesman contacted from Thailand identified
the arrested lawmakers, all from Irrawaddy Division, as Man Jonny
from Kyonbyaw constituency, David Hla Myint from Ngapudaw
constituency and Man Nyunt Thein from Pantanaw constituency.
	   Other arrested members of Parliament came from Pagan Division,
he said.

Fast-growing KLA rebels vow to win in the end in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Outgunned and outnumbered, Kosovo
Albanian rebel fighters insist they eventually will control Kosovo
even if they lose many more battles.
	   The fight for a coal mine and villages near Belacevac proved
both points: the Albanians' inability to hold territory against
superior Serb firepower and their ability to melt away to fight
another day.
	   Rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army strike suddenly, have
intimate knowledge of the rugged local terrain, enjoy popular
support and are unwavering in their will to prevail. With those
qualities, the rebels claim they will overwhelm powerful Serbian
forces.
	   ``We have the people,'' Abi Beleim Berisha, a local KLA
commander west of the capital Pristina, said Tuesday. ``We are
fighting for our homeland.''
	   Three hours later, Serb tanks, artillery and infantry swarmed
Berisha's post, taking Belacevac. But the KLA already was fighting
the Serbs elsewhere in Kosovo.
	   The militant force, which emerged in 1996 as a reaction to
perceived oppression by the Serbian government, has strengthened
considerably in recent months.
	   ``The UCK ranks grow stronger every day with people joining from
all over,'' said Sadri Tafilaj, a human rights activist from
Decani, referring to the KLA by its Albanian-language acronym.
``Professionally and institutionally, it is moving forward with
giant steps.''
	   Kosovo-born fighters from throughout Europe and some from North
America have signed on in increasing numbers since the Serbs
launched an offensive Feb. 28 to stamp out the secessionist army,
whose size and command structure remain unknown.
	   Now, its international profile is rising quickly, too, with
increasing recognition from foreign diplomats who want to negotiate
a cease-fire.
	   Experienced fighters, some of them veterans of earlier Yugoslav
wars who profess pinpoint accuracy with rocket-propelled grenades,
have reinforced the ethnic Albanian farmers who carry homemade
shotguns and bolt-action rifles.
	   ``We have no big military equipment,'' said Berisha, carrying a
Kalashnikov rifle and two rocket-propelled grenades. ``But we have
to win the war.''
	   The force uses its knowledge of a maze of mountain trails in
western Kosovo to travel from battle to battle within hours.
Farmers and villagers risk sniper fire to run dry biscuits and
water to entrenched guerrillas defending their regions. And a newly
imposed military discipline attempts to organize a force that
operates largely without radio communication.
	   ``I am so sorry I shot at you,'' Berisha said, trembling and
sweating profusely after firing half a dozen Kalashnikov rounds at
a journalist's car he mistook for a Serb attack vehicle.
	   ``Shooting at (a) journalist could mean five years in (a KLA)
jail for me. If I killed you it would be 20.''
	   A half-dozen KLA fighters, some Muslim and others wearing a
Catholic cross around their necks, nodded gravely as Berisha pulled
a note pad from his flakjacket pocket and noted the details of the
shooting to report to the regional commander.
	   In KLA territory, estimated at 40 percent of Kosovo, the
guerrillas have erected road signs in the Albanian language, issued
KLA license plates and recently formed a police force to solve
civil disputes.
	   Cooperation with the Democratic League of Kosovo, the pacifist
ethnic Albanian political party, is limited but growing rapidly,
said Jakup Kastrati, mayor of Malisevo, a regional center in
southwestern Kosovo.
	   Villagers, from small boys to old men, wear T-shirts and hats
bearing hand-crafted versions of the KLA emblem and shout slogans
of KLA support to passing journalists.
	   ``We don't agree with their means, but we agree with their
goals,'' said Kastrati, who governs the village while the KLA
patrols the streets, investigates crimes and mans nearby
checkpoints.

Japanese singer wins gold at Tchaikovsky competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mieko Sato of Japan won top honors in women's
vocals at the prestigious Tchaikovsky music competition, becoming
just the second Japanese artist to take a gold in the international
contest.
	   In the men's vocals, the top prize was awarded to Besik
Gabitashvili of Georgia on Tuesday night. Each winner received a
gold medal and dlrs 10,000.
	   The only other Japanese contestant to take the top prize was
Akiko Suwanai in the piano competition in 1990.
	   The Tchaikovsky competition has been held every four years since
1958. It has helped launch successful careers for many of the
winners.
	   The 11th Tchaikovsky competition ran for two weeks and the
international panel of juries included former Tchaikovsky winners.
	   The runners-up in the women's vocals section were:
	   Yelena Manistina, Russia; Maira Mukhamed, Kazakstan, and there
was a tie for fourth place between Russians Viktoria Yevtodyeva and
Zlata Bulycheva.
	   In the men's vocals, the runners-up were:
	   Yevgeny Nikitin of Russia, Alexander Kiselyov of Russia and
Purevzhab Ganbat of Mongolia.
	   Russian musicians captured the piano, cello and violin
competitions in results announced Monday.

World Cup: Romania says it accomplished its goal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ In the end, Romania got what its coach
said he wanted: to play in the second round. Then the team packed
up and went home.
	   ``I always said that our goal was to clinch our group and play
in the second round. Perhaps the (Romanian Football Federation)
officials had other designs, but my purpose was to bring the team
in the second round, which I succeeded,'' coach Anghel Iordanescu
said.
	   Romania, which made the quarterfinals in 1994 where it was
eliminated by Sweden after a penalty shootout, clinched Group G
with a near-perfect record: victories over Colombia 1-0 and England
2-1 and a 1-1 tie with Tunisia.
	   But it lost to debutant Croatia 1-0 on Tuesday, which sent the
other Balkan country to play Germany in the quarterfinals in Lyon
on July 4.
	   Iordanescu's five-year stint as Romanian coach ended with the
loss. He has signed a two-year, dlrs 900,000 contract to coach
Greece's national team, beginning on July 15.
	   For Romania the result was disappointing, especially after its
victory over England.
	   But the Romanians played a slow and uninspiring game and their
offense lacked the final punch. Gheorghe Hagi, the 33-year-old
playmaker who shone at the '94 World Cup in the United States,
slowed down too much to continue to be the key man in the attack.
He failed to score any goals in France and announced he would
retire from the national team.
	   The Romanians were hampered by the absence of several standout
players such as defenders Daniel Prodan of Atletico Madrid and
Tibor Selymes of Anderlecht, both unfit to play due to old
injuries.
	   Iordanescu has long been at loggerheads with Romania's soccer
chiefs, accusing them of endangering the country's World Cup
chances by denying him funds, facilities and competitive warmup
games.
	   The only consolation for the Romanians is the emergence of
several young players who have been lured away from financially
strapped Romanian teams by clubs in the West.
	   Among them is Valencia's Adrian Ilie, a 24-year-old striker who
has sprung from nowhere in the past year to become a central figure
in the Romanian setup. Ilie is currently courted by Real Madrid,
which is reportedly ready to swap Croatian Davor Suker for him.
	   Among other newcomers who played well in the games against
Colombia and England were forward Viorel Moldovan of Coventry City,
Espanyol's midfielder Constantin Galca and Salamanca's Gabriel
Popescu, 24, an excellent playmaker who is being groomed to take
over Hagi's role.
	   ``There are several young players we can rely on. Maybe next
time they'll be more successful,'' said Iordanescu.

Gift-wrapped explosives planted at Cambodian rally, party says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with explosives allegedly
planted at campaign rally. Trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Six gift-wrapped packages filled
with explosives were planted at an opposition party campaign rally
attended by 1,000 people but were detected before they could
explode, the party said Wednesday.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, one of two chief opposition groups
contesting the July 26 polls, accused Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
and his ruling Cambodian People's Party of terrorizing opponents.
	   ``It's a campaign of intimidation and everybody knows it,'' said
Eng Chhay Eang, party leader Sam Rainsy's chief of staff. ``The
threats and violence all come from one side, Hun Sen's
organization.''
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a political
demonstration led by Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's harshest critics.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 injured.
	   A party statement said that about 1,000 supporters had gathered
Tuesday in front of party headquarters in Battambang, the country's
second-largest city, to start a parade.
	   Four men came through the crowd carrying parcels wrapped up like
cakes, the statement said. They tossed the packages into a car and
tractor joining the parade as if they were gifts and left. A party
official became suspicious and opened one.
	   Inside were five explosive devices, apparently a type of land
mine, the statement said. The parcels were quickly removed from the
scene. The other packages had the same contents.
	   The opposition, human rights and watchdog groups have accused
Hun Sen of using murder and intimidation to make sure he wins the
election.
	   Sam Rainsy was not in the country. In last year's attack, widely
blamed on Hun Sen, he was slightly injured. A bodyguard who
shielded him from a blast was killed.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last year.
	   Earlier, election organizers issued an urgent appeal to the
international community for additional funds and observers.
	   Cambodia has been promised more than dlrs 11 million in election
aid from the European Union, a similar amount from Japan and almost
dlrs 3 million from the United States.
	   The United States, which has serious doubts over about the
government's ability to conduct a fair election, is providing the
money solely to private groups.
	   Kassie Neou, vice chairman of the National Election Committee,
said Cambodia appreciated aid already provided by other countries
and the United Nations, but that more help was needed.
	   The committee, which the opposition says Hun Sen has stacked in
his favor, said last week that it would need dlrs 5.1 million more
to hold the polls.
	   Kassie Neou said there was a ``serious shortfall, especially in
the area of transportation'' to bring ballot boxes in from outlying
areas for counting.
	   He also appealed for more foreign observers, now expected to
number about 500 by election day. Kassie Neou said the Cambodians
hoped to have one for each of the 1,700 ballot counting centers.

Three European ambassadors visit jailed East Timorese rebel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Trying to promote peace in disputed
East Timor, three European ambassadors on Wednesday visited a
jailed rebel leader from the Indonesian-controlled territory.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, Austria and the Netherlands returned
Tuesday from a fact-finding mission to East Timor, where security
forces shot two pro-independence protesters during rallies that
were staged to impress the visiting diplomats.
	   They are part of a European Union effort to mediate a solution
to the long-running conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
	   After leaving Jakarta's Cipinang jail, the ambassadors did not
comment on their meeting with Xanana Gusmao, a rebel chief who had
fought Indonesian troops since they invaded East Timor in 1975.
	   Many East Timorese revere Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year
sentence, and demand his release as well as a vote on independence.
	   He has international stature, too: South African President
Nelson Mandela visited him in prison last year during a state trip
to Indonesia and called for his release. Then-President Suharto
rejected the appeal.
	   President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, has offered to free
Gusmao and grant East Timor special status in return for
international recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory.
	   The ambassadors who visited Gusmao are Robin Christopher of
Britain, Paul Brouwer of the Netherlands and Viktor Segalla of
Austria. They were accompanied by Klaus Peter Schmallenback,
representative of the European Commission office in Jakarta.
	   Hamish Daniel, spokesman at the British Embassy, confirmed the
jail visit.

England soccer team praised for bravery after World Cup defeat by
</HEADLINE>
Argentina &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES in last 7 grafs with comment from fans, Charlton.
Tightens throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Heroes,'' declared a banner headline in the
tabloid Express newspaper Wednesday after England's World Cup dream
disintegrated in a nail-biting 4-3 penalty shoot-out with
Argentina.
	   The story of England's defeat Tuesday night in St. Etienne,
France, dominated the front pages of the nation's tabloids, which
tried to console the disappointed with praise for the team's
efforts in playing the second half of the game one man short and
succeeding in forcing Argentina into overtime and penalty shots.
	   The Daily Mail blamed the failure on star player David Beckham,
who was sent off the pitch moments after the second half began for
tripping up an Argentina player who had just fouled him.
	   His ``moment of lunacy'' and ``petulant act of retaliation''
shattered England's dream, the Daily Mail said.
	   ``His teammates staged one of the most courageous rearguard
actions in the tournament's history,'' the newspaper added.
	   About 28 million people were estimated to have watched England's
defeat on British television, causing one of the biggest power
surges ever recorded, said the National Grid, which operates the
nation's network of power lines.
	   ``The surge at half time (2,100 megawatts) was equivalent to
that reached in 1985 during an episode of ``Dallas'' when JR was
shot,'' National Grid spokesman Sean Regan said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who watched the game on
television in his Downing Street home with his children, praised
the England team.
	   ``They showed the English spirit at its very best,'' he said.
	   ``I don't know if destiny was against us. Everything went
against us. But it is not a night for excuses, it is a night for us
to be proud,'' said England coach Glenn Hoddle, close to tears
after the game. Later, he told SKY News that he doesn't blame any
of the players for the loss.
	   ``We have given absolutely everything, and I'm sure the nation
have realized and seen that with their own eyes and it's just a
sad, sad evening for English football,'' Hoddle said. ``It's a
football match at the end of the day. It's not life and death.''
	   During the Wednesday morning rush-hour, there was little
sympathy for Beckham on the streets of Manchester, where the player
is a star of Manchester United team.
	   ``He's supposed to be a professional. He's paid millions of
pounds a year and he goes and does something like that in an
important game,'' said draughtsman Gary Foden, 32, on his way to
work. ``It cost England the match. ''
	   Caterer Mark Curran, 24, said Beckham is ``a brilliant
footballer, but there was no excuse for what happened. ... It was
just a totally stupid thing to do, but I thought sending him off
for it was a bit harsh.''
	   ``It was the rest of the team I felt sorry for afterwards,''
said civil servant Jon Mastin, 39. ``They should have won and I
think they would have done if the sending-off hadn't happened.''
	   ``You can't blame the players who missed the penalties. It was
the sending-off that cost them the game. Someone like Beckham
should have known better.''
	   But Sir Bobby Charlton, a leading player and goalscorer in the
1966 World Cup winning team, spoke up for Beckham.
	   ``Don't throw him to the wolves,'' he said. ``He is a very
sensitive lad and he appreciates the mistake he has made,'' Sir
Bobby said. ``He is going to have to bear the brunt of it for some
time.''

Tokyo stocks soar, dollar tumbles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index soared to its
highest close in almost three months in heavy trading Wednesday,
boosted by a report that Japan will cut taxes to bolster the
economy. The dollar tumbled against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 532.62 points, or 3.36
percent, closing at 16,362.89 _ its highest since April 10.
	   The benchmark average now has climbed for six sessions, gaining
almost 9 percent. On Tuesday, it gained 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent.
	   The dollar bought 138.24 yen in late afternoon, down 1.71 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
139.16 yen overnight.
	   Japanese financial markets continued their rally on growing
expectations that the governing Liberal Democratic Party will
propose a sweeping tax cut ahead of upper house elections July 12.
	   Investors are optimistic a tax cut would spur consumer spending,
lifting Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   In the latest sign such a cut may be in the works, a front-page
story Wednesday morning in Japan's largest-circulation newspaper,
the Yomiuri, said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto plans to
introduce permanent income and residential tax cuts of up to 4
trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) next year.
	   Investors also took heart from recent signs that Japan is moving
to clean up once and for all the bad loans that have plagued its
banks since the collapse of real estate prices in the early 1990s.
	   Newspapers have cited senior LDP lawmakers as supporting plans
to allow ``bridge banks'' based on a U.S. model to take over failed
financial institutions.
	   ``The Nikkei average rose in the past few days amid the
government's progress in plans to set up the bridge bank,'' said
Ken Okamura, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd.
	   An estimated 876 million shares were traded on the first
section, up from Tuesday's 576 million and twice the daily average.
Advances outnumbered declines by more than 4-to-1.
	   Shares of steel makers, banks and real estate developers led the
market higher. A rebound by the domestic economy would most likely
help earnings at these companies, said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 40.37 points, or 3.18 percent, to 1,270.75.
The index had climbed 28.16 points, or 2.34 percent, the previous
day.
	   The dollar, which peaked at 139.15 yen in early trading, fell as
low as 137.45.
	   Optimism about the domestic economy also drove up yields in
Tokyo's bond market on expectations companies will start borrowing
more as they step up production.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.380 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of 1.330
percent. Its price fell to 110.62 yen from the previous day's
110.99 yen.

Clinton pushes free trade, expresses disappointment at slow WTO

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Praising the ``ingenuity and energy'' of
China's cosmopolitan center of capitalism, U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged his communist hosts Wednesday to open markets, battle
corruption and clean up the environment.
	   Clinton expressed regret that his long China trip hasn't brought
strong agreements needed for China's admission to the World Trade
Organization.
	   ``I'm disappointed that we didn't make more progress on this
issue, but we'll keep working at it until we reach a commercially
viable agreement,'' he said.
	   ``For China, as for America, the promise for the future lies in
helping our citizens to master the challenges of the global
economy, not to deny them or run away from them,'' Clinton told
China-based American business leaders before touring Shanghai's
gleaming new stock market.
	   Speaking in the sun-streaked atrium of a high-rise hotel,
Clinton called on China to open its markets.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said.
	   He noted that he and President Jiang Zemin failed to reach
agreement on lowering trade barriers and other economic reforms,
conditions that must be met before China gains entry into the WTO.
	   While pushing Congress to renew normal trade relations with
China, Clinton said he wasn't ready to try to make those relations
permanent.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with China is about dlrs 50 billion and
rising. America buys one-third of China's exports and should, in
turn, get ``a fair shot at China's markets,'' he said.
	   Delivering a strong environmental message, Clinton said he
couldn't ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
anti-pollution measures. ``But as a citizen of the world and the
leader of my country, I have a responsibility to ask us all to work
together for a planet that our grandchildren can still enjoy living
on. And so do you.''
	   Afterward, Clinton toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange during a
lunch-time pause in trading. Instead of stock prices, the
electronic readout board glowed with a red and yellow presidential
welcome.
	   Traders shook Clinton's hand and gave him a red trader vest with
the yellow number 1998 on its back. He didn't ring the opening bell
_ here a huge gong _ as Jiang did when he visited the New York
Stock Exchange last October during his U.S. visit.
	   Clinton also met privately with Chinese entrepreneurs, who are
at the forefront of Shanghai's and China's developing free market
system, replacing money-losing state enterprises and a command
economy.
	   Clinton, enjoying his second day in this thriving Western-style
city, said he had seen many ``examples of the kind of ingenuity and
energy'' needed to ``maximize the potential of the people of
China.''
	   But he declared that both Shanghai and China ``face major
challenges in advancing economic progress beyond the present
point.''
	   He called on China to dismantle its state-run industries and
improve its legal and regulatory systems, and urged ``strong
efforts to combat corruption.''
	   American businesses, he said, should set an example for fair
labor and business practices.
	   Clinton praised U.S. business leaders who work in China, saying
they have been nurturing ``China's ongoing evolution to a more
open, stable and prosperous society.''
	   Making the case that a freer Chinese economy will lead to more
political openness in the repressive society, the president said,
``The more China enters the world community and the global economy,
the more the world will strengthen freedom and openness in China.''
	   He suggested that China protect personal rights and constrain
``arbitrary government.''
	   Clinton didn't bring a U.S. business delegation on his nine-day
trip, as he has on some other foreign tours. Commerce Secretary
William Daley said that dealings with China had not been affected
by investigations back home about Clinton's authorization of U.S.
satellites on Chinese rockets.
	   After his speech, the chamber presented Clinton with a ``chop,''
a lunchbox-sized green jade stamp with his name written in Chinese
characters. Dipping it in red wax, he stamped his name on a chamber
certificate that said: ``Constructive engagement is the key to this
prosperous partnership.''

demonstration led by Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's harshest critics.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 injured.
	   A party statement said that about 1,000 supporters had gathered
Tuesday in front of party headquarters in Battambang, the country's
second-largest city, to start a parade.
	   Four men came through the crowd carrying parcels wrapped up like
cakes, the statement said. They tossed the packages into a car and
tractor joining the parade as if they were gifts and left.
	   ``Everyone was surprised when they opened them up,'' said Lon
Phon, the party's main candidate in Battambang.
	   Inside were five explosive devices, apparently a type of land
mine, the statement said. The parcels were quickly removed from the
scene.
	   Local human rights workers confirmed that the parcels held
explosives. Police, however, said they had not yet been informed
about the case.
	   The opposition, human rights and watchdog groups have accused
Hun Sen of using murder and intimidation to make sure he wins the
election.
	   Sam Rainsy was not in the country. In last year's attack, widely
blamed on Hun Sen, he was slightly injured. A bodyguard who
shielded him from a blast was killed.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last year.
	   Earlier, election organizers issued an urgent appeal to the
international community for additional funds and observers.
	   Cambodia has been promised more than dlrs 11 million in election
aid from the European Union, a similar amount from Japan and almost
dlrs 3 million from the United States.
	   The United States, which has serious doubts over about the
government's ability to conduct a fair election, is providing the
money solely to private groups.
	   Kassie Neou, vice chairman of the National Election Committee,
said Cambodia appreciated aid already provided by other countries
and the United Nations, but that more help was needed.
	   The committee, which the opposition says Hun Sen has stacked in
his favor, said last week that it would need dlrs 5.1 million more
to hold the polls.
	   Kassie Neou said there was a ``serious shortfall, especially in
the area of transportation'' to bring ballot boxes in from outlying
areas for counting.
	   He also appealed for more foreign observers, now expected to
number about 500 by election day. Kassie Neou said the Cambodians
hoped to have one for each of the 1,700 ballot counting centers.

Chelsea having fun in China with, without Mom and Dad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With China-Clinton &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Although she's spending a lot of time
beside her parents, Chelsea Clinton has managed a few solo moments
in China. She has slipped away for shopping excursions, a rickshaw
ride in Beijing and a spin on the dance floor in this bustling
coastal city.
	   The White House, in keeping with its policy of privacy for the
first daughter, hasn't said much about what Chelsea has been doing
as she accompanies U.S. President Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham
Clinton and her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, on a
nine-day, five-city tour of China.
	   But an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Chelsea, 18 and on summer break after her freshman
year at Stanford University, has been enjoying herself.
	   ``She's really having a great time,'' the official said. ``She's
been asking a lot of questions.''
	   Chelsea has been very much on public display here, in contrast
to the behind-the-scenes lifestyle she enjoys in Washington. She
has been seen playing animated tour guide at every sightseeing
stop, including one to view the Terra Cotta Warriors near Xi'an.
	   An only child, Chelsea has stuck by one or both of her parents
for many of their official events, from the welcoming ceremony last
Saturday at Beijing's Tiananmen Square to her mother's visit
Wednesday to the Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai.
	   The Clintons seem more relaxed with Chelsea around. The
president posed arm-in-arm with his daughter in the Forbidden City,
and the whole family joined hands as they walked atop the majestic
Great Wall of China.
	   Photographers were summoned Tuesday to capture images of Clinton
and his daughter strolling down the Old Shanghai alley of shops and
food counters. They stopped on a stone bridge over a lagoon
swarming with gold fish and Chinese carp. They laughed and threw
popcorn into the water.
	   Afterwards they brought soft-swirl ice cream.
	   Even while she is at official events, Chelsea has managed to
slip away while her parents work. During their visit to the city's
new museum, Chelsea got a personal tour of centuries of Chinese
art.
	   In perhaps her most adventurous getaway, Chelsea caught a
rickshaw ride in the crowded streets before leaving Beijing on
Monday.
	   Then Tuesday night, she was on the dance floor at the Park 97
club in downtown Shanghai, attending a party for White House press
and staffers. Since she didn't bring any friends along on this
trip, Chelsea recruited some young White House aides as dancing
partners.

Philippine stocks, peso rise on yen's gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose Wednesday,
extending their rebound to a third trading day in line with the
Japanese yen's recovery, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 21.83 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 1,781.96 after gaining 36.76 points Monday.
	   Financial markets were closed in the Philippines Tuesday in
celebration of President Joseph Estrada's inauguration.
	   Since Friday, the main index has gained 72.93 points, or 4.3
percent, as the yen advanced and end-of-the-quarter ``window
dressing,'' or revaluation of investment portfolios, heightened,
traders said.
	   ``Initial signs of stability (in the currency market) were
there'' and buoyed local stocks, said Ramon Lucas, a trader for Kim
Eng Securities.
	   Eagle Equities Inc. President Joey Roxas said investors,
particularly foreigners, are likely to remain sidelined until
stability has clearly returned to the currency market.
	   ``Overall, currencies will remain volatile for the rest of the
year,'' he said.
	   Despite the three-day rise, Roxas said the outlook isn't bright
for the third quarter since the market historically declines during
this period.
	   ``But we've been down so much in the second quarter, the trend
could reverse,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.528 pesos for the
day, down from Monday's 42.036 pesos.
	   Traders said the smooth turnover of power Tuesday from previous
President Fidel Ramos to Estrada was seen by the market as a
positive sign of the country's political maturity.
	   Estrada, who won by a wide margin in the May 11 national
elections, wasn't Ramos' candidate.
	   Traders said, however, Estrada's inauguration didn't provide an
added boost to the peso, and attributed the currency's gains
chiefly to the rising yen.

Arrested Pakistanis to be deported soon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Six Pakistanis arrested in Bangkok in a
joint operation by Thai police and the FBI were still in Thai
custody Wednesday but will be deported soon, a senior police
official said.
	   Pakistan's ambassador, meanwhile, criticized media reports that
the detainees were suspected of terrorism and played a role in the
World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 or were plotting to
assassinate U.S. Ambassador William H. Itoh.
	   Immigration Police Gen. Chidchai Vasanatidya denied reports that
five of the Pakistanis had already been deported. He refused to
clarify what suspicions had led to their arrests, but denied that
they had anything to do with terrorism.
	   ``They are still here,'' Chidchai said. ``We are in the process
of sending them back. The legal process is near completion.''
	   Chidchai was grilled by reporters at a news conference Monday
for failing to explain why the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
was involved in the case against the Pakistanis if their only
crimes were illegal entry or overstaying their visas.
	   The newspaper The Nation quoted government sources Wednesday as
saying five of the suspects had been deported because U.S. and Thai
authorities could not find evidence linking them to any specific
attack, though they were still suspected of being terrorists.
	   The newspaper, which raised the link with the World Trade Center
bombing in initial reports of the arrests last week, said the sixth
person was released since his passport and visa were valid.
	   Sher Afgan Khan, Pakistan's ambassador, in a letter to The
Nation published Wednesday, called the reported terror links
``unverified and irresponsible,'' and said an apology was owed for
hurting the feelings of Pakistan and its people.
	   The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and injured
more than 1,000. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack and sentenced
to life imprisonment.
	   In November, a New York court convicted Ramzi Yousef of Pakistan
on murder and conspiracy charges. He was described as the
mastermind of the bombing at the twin 110-story buildings.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Praising the ``ingenuity and energy'' of
China's cosmopolitan center of capitalism, U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged his communist hosts Wednesday to open markets, battle
corruption and clean up the environment.
	   Clinton expressed regret that his long China trip hasn't brought
strong agreements needed for China's admission to the World Trade
Organization.
	   ``I'm disappointed that we didn't make more progress on this
issue, but we'll keep working at it until we reach a commercially
viable agreement,'' he said.
	   ``For China, as for America, the promise for the future lies in
helping our citizens to master the challenges of the global
economy, not to deny them or run away from them,'' Clinton told
China-based American business leaders before touring Shanghai's
gleaming new stock market.
	   Speaking in the sun-streaked atrium of a high-rise hotel,
Clinton called on China to open its markets.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said.
	   He noted that he and President Jiang Zemin failed to reach
agreement on lowering trade barriers and other economic reforms,
conditions that must be met before China gains entry into the WTO.
	   While pushing Congress to renew normal trade relations with
China, Clinton said he wasn't ready to try to make those relations
permanent.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with China is about dlrs 50 billion and
rising. America buys one-third of China's exports and should, in
turn, get ``a fair shot at China's markets,'' he said.
	   Delivering a strong environmental message, Clinton said he
couldn't ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
anti-pollution measures. ``But as a citizen of the world and the
leader of my country, I have a responsibility to ask us all to work
together for a planet that our grandchildren can still enjoy living
on. And so do you.''
	   Afterward, Clinton toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange during a
lunch-time pause in trading. Instead of stock prices, the
electronic readout board glowed with a red and yellow presidential
welcome.
	   Traders shook Clinton's hand and gave him a red trader vest with
the yellow number 1998 on its back. He didn't ring the opening bell
_ here a huge gong _ as Jiang did when he visited the New York
Stock Exchange last October during his U.S. visit.
	   Clinton also met privately with Chinese entrepreneurs, who are
at the forefront of Shanghai's and China's developing free market
system, replacing money-losing state enterprises and a command
economy.
	   Highlighting housing reform, the president visited with Yu
Jinyuan, a resident of Jin Hui Gardens, apartments where several
families have become first-time homeowners and no longer rely on
state-owned company apartments.
	   Clinton announced a U.S.-China residential building counsel to
promote energy-efficient home-building materials, and said the
Commerce Department would bring Americans to China to help
establish a better home-financing system, stronger property rights
and mortgage markets.
	   Home ownership has made America stronger, he said, and could
also strengthen China.
	   Clinton, enjoying his second day in this thriving Western-style
city, said he had seen many ``examples of the kind of ingenuity and
energy'' needed to ``maximize the potential of the people of
China.''
	   But he declared that both Shanghai and China ``face major
challenges in advancing economic progress beyond the present
point.''
	   He called on China to dismantle its state-run industries and
improve its legal and regulatory systems, and urged ``strong
efforts to combat corruption.''
	   American businesses, he said, should set an example for fair
labor and business practices.
	   Clinton praised U.S. business leaders who work in China, saying
they have been nurturing ``China's ongoing evolution to a more
open, stable and prosperous society.''
	   Making the case that a freer Chinese economy will lead to more
political openness in the repressive society, the president said,
``The more China enters the world community and the global economy,
the more the world will strengthen freedom and openness in China.''
	   He suggested that China protect personal rights and constrain
``arbitrary government.''
	   Clinton didn't bring a U.S. business delegation on his nine-day
trip, as he has on some other foreign tours. Commerce Secretary
William Daley said that dealings with China had not been affected
by investigations back home about Clinton's authorization of U.S.
satellites on Chinese rockets.
	   After his speech, the chamber presented Clinton with a ``chop,''
a lunchbox-sized green jade stamp with his name written in Chinese
characters. Dipping it in red wax, he stamped his name on a chamber
certificate that said: ``Constructive engagement is the key to this
prosperous partnership.''

Professor in Japan announces candidacy for North Korean polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Korean professor at a Japanese university said
Wednesday he will challenge North Korean leader Kim Jong Il for his
seat in Parliament in elections this month in the reclusive
communist nation.
	   Lee Hwang-hwa, an assistant professor of economics at Kansai
University, said he intends to use his candidacy to highlight the
economic mismanagement that has pushed North Korea to the brink of
famine.
	   ``This is an important election because it comes while people
are starving to death,'' Lee told The Associated Press. ``If the
elections were free and fair, the regime would easily lose.''
	   Lee, 43, who heads a group of Korean residents in Japan opposed
to the North's Stalinist regime, says his election attempt will
also draw attention to the fraudulent and undemocratic nature of
the polls.
	   ``The regime allows absolutely no opposition,'' said Lee. ``Free
and democratic elections are needed in North Korea to oust the
government and save the people from starvation.''
	   For the past four years, millions of North Koreans have been
suffering from severe food shortages that were caused by drought
and floods, but aggravated by the government's regressive
agricultural policies.
	   Lee said there is virtually no chance he will even be able to
run in the July 26 elections, but ``I have the right to apply.''

Volkswagen shares up on report of talks with Volvo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen shares jumped Wednesday
after a report said the carmaker was in talks with Swedish
automotive group Volvo about a possible link-up.
	   Volvo says its chief, Leif Johansson, met with Volkswagen
chairman Ferdinand Piech last Friday in Goteborg, Sweden, but has
refused to comment further. Volkswagen declined to comment.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe, in Wednesday editions, quoted
unidentified sources as saying the two companies were in
preliminary talks on a business cooperation that could eventually
lead to a merger.
	   The newspaper said Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, is
looking for a partner that could help it enter the market for
medium and heavy trucks. Volvo is one of the world leaders in that
area.
	   Currently, Volkswagen's commercial-vehicle division specializes
in light vans and minibuses.
	   In morning trading in Frankfurt, Volkswagen shares were up 4.2
percent to 1,815 marks (dlrs 1,008), while the overall market was
up 1 percent at 5897.66 points.
	   The news comes within weeks of Volkswagen announcing it intends
to buy two luxury automakers _ Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Britain
and Italy's Lamborghini _ and just two months after Daimler-Benz
and Chrysler Corp. shook the auto world with their own merger
plans.

Austria takes over the EU presidency with fanfare
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria took over the European Union
presidency Wednesday in true Viennese fashion _ with a fanfare of
trumpets and strains of Strauss.
	   The small Alpine nation is the first of the three newcomers in
1995 to assume the semiannual rotating presidecy.
	   The big decisions of the year _ monetary union and structural
reforms within the organization _ were made under Britian's
leadership during the first half. And while Austria is expected to
play a role in promoting eastward expansion of the EU and in
crucial agricultural reforms, these issues won't be settled until
Germany takes over the presidency next year.
	   When the European Commission officially arrives in Vienna late
Wednesday, the party will be in full swing. Austria is marking its
presidency with a 4-hour festival of music and dance featuring the
famed Vienna Boy's Choir and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra in the
city's historic Heldenplatz, or Hero's Square.
	   As president of the EU, Austria will be responsible for
arranging and presiding over all meetings. For the next six months,
Austria will lead decision-making at EU headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium and in Vienna.
	   ``We're not yet so completely in the EU,'' explained Johann
Wiemmer, a pensioner watching the preparations. Like many other
Austrians, Wiemmer is still unsure what his country has gained
since joining the EU three years ago.
	   Many Austrians still worry that trading in their shillings for
the EU's common currency, the euro, or opening the EU's borders to
neighbors in Eastern Europe will be an unnecessary expense for
which they see nothing in return.
	   ``They promised us everything would be cheaper when we joined in
1995, but so far only milk products are cheaper,'' said Wilhelm
Winter, a banker in Vienna.
	   Ingrid Eigner, an organizer of Wednesday's festival, hopes
Austria's turn at the presidency will help cultivate a more
positive attitude toward the EU.
	   Unity is the theme for Wednesday's performance, including music
and performers from across Europe. The show also will be broadcast
live on Austrian state television and in 12 other European
countries.
	   ``The EU is like a big family, where everyone brings to it their
own character and their own faults,'' Eigner said. Learning to
accept both of these, she said, is the key to making the
organization work. ``Without that cooperation, it would just be a
farce,'' she said.

Cambodia's deposed leader vows to solve Vietnamese problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS grafs 11-12 to show Ranariddh referred to Vietnamese,
not Yuon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh played on Cambodia's long hatred of Vietnam in a campaign
speech Wednesday, promising to tackle the racially explosive issue
of Vietnamese immigrants if he wins elections July 26.
	   Speaking to about 2,000 supporters at a temple in Phnom Penh,
the prince said he will also seek to renegotiate a border agreement
with Cambodia's larger eastern neighbor.
	   ``If I win, I promise to solve the border issue and the problem
of illegal immigrants,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh was deposed as co-prime minister last year by his
archrival, Hun Sen, who is identified by many Cambodians with the
decade-long Vietnamese occupation that followed Hanoi's invasion in
1979 and overthrow of the genocidal Khmer Rouge.
	   The murderous Khmer Rouge, which waged years of guerrilla
warfare after being overthrown, and moderate figures like the
prince have all played the anti-Vietnam card to win support from
Cambodians, many of whom have visceral antipathy for Vietnam.
	   The prince said a woman he met on the campaign trail had summed
up her view of the election for him, using the derogatory term Yuon
for Vietnamese: ``If you vote correctly, the number of Yuon will go
down. If you vote wrongly it will go up.''
	   The main targets are hundreds of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese
living in Cambodia _ some for generations. To many Cambodians, they
are living reminders of the vast tracts of territory the once-proud
Khmer empire lost to Vietnamese expansion over the centuries.
	   Despite leading Cambodia for most of the years since 1985, Hun
Sen has never become a truly popular leader, in large part because
he was originally put in power and backed by Vietnamese troops.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but was forced
to share power when Hun Sen threatened renewed civil war. The
prince was ousted a year ago when the stronger Hun Sen staged a
coup.
	   Hoping to win back international legitimacy, Hun Sen has called
new elections, but critics say the polls have been stacked in
favor. Nevertheless, Ranariddh predicted victory and promised that
if he wins this time, he will not share power with Hun Sen.
	   Ranariddh said that if people vote for Hun Sen, Cambodia will be
swallowed up by Vietnam in a ``dangerous'' trend where Vietnamese
will eventually take over the prime minister's office.
	   ``I don't hate Vietnamese,'' Ranariddh said, ``but if Vietnam
wants a good relationship with Cambodia, it must respect our
territorial integrity, sovereignty, and stop sending its people to
live in Cambodia,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh said he would renegotiate a border agreement Hun Sen's
government signed with Vietnam in the 1980s.
	   The dispute over the 1,100-kilometer (800-mile) border
threatened to turn violent last year preceding the coup, when
Ranariddh accused Vietnam of ``invading'' his country by allowing
its people to farm on Cambodian soil.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States' largest brokerage opened the
first branch of its new Japanese retail unit Wednesday, formally
entering the market for managing Japan's massive pool of personal
savings.
	   Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of New York-based
Merrill Lynch and Co., opened the branch in the central Japanese
city of Nagano, the site of this year's Winter Olympic Games.
	   Merrill Lynch Japan Securities plans to open 28 more branches by
the end of July and eventually increase that number to 33, the
company said.
	   Fidelity Investments Co. has announced similar plans.
	   Merrill Lynch and other foreign brokerages are expanding rapidly
in Japan, where domestic rivals have been plagued by repeated
scandals and are scrambling to adapt to sweeping deregulation.
	   The deregulation, called the ``big bang,'' is throwing open
Japan's financial markets to new companies and products.
	   Merrill Lynch and other foreigners are vying to get a piece of
Japan's dlrs 9 trillion pool of individual savings.
	   Merrill Lynch created its retail brokerage unit in February by
hiring 2,100 former employees and taking over several branch
offices of failed Yamaichi Securities Co., Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage.
	   Yamaichi collapsed in November after revealing it had more than
250 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) in hidden losses.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has decided
to enact permanent cuts in residential and income taxes in 1999 to
boost the country's sluggish economy, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may announce the cuts ahead of
elections to the upper house of Parliament on July 12, reported the
Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily.
	   The cuts, which would replace a special tax cut of two trillion
yen (dlrs 14.5 billion) now planned to take effect in 1999, will be
between two trillion yen and four trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) in
scale, the Yomiuri reported.
	   Chief Government Spokesman Kanezo Muraoka said he wasn't aware
of any decision on tax cuts, but that the government would debate
the issue after elections for Parliament's upper house on July 12,
the Nikkei News Service reported.
	   According to the newspaper, Japanese government officials and
leading members of the LDP told U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers of the permanent tax cut plans when he visited
Japan in mid-June.
	   At the latest, Hashimoto will formally announce the cuts before
his scheduled meeting on July 22 with U.S. President Bill Clinton
in Washington, the Yomiuri reported.

	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Fiji's national airline Air Pacific Wednesday
posted its 12th successive annual profit, despite the Asian crisis
injuring the island nation's vital tourism industry.
	   The airline reported an after-tax profit of U.S. dlrs 3.95
million (Fiji dollars 8.3 million) for the year to March 31, 1998,
a U.S. dlrs 252,000 (Fiji dollars 600,000) improvement on the
previous year's result.
	   Air Pacific chairman Gerald Barrack said the result reflected
difficult times in the Asia-Pacific region, but that the directors
would recommend a dividend to shareholders at the annual meeting in
October.
	   Barrack said that after a difficult restructuring period, Air
Pacific was now ``postured for growth.''
	   The airline restructured its operations earlier this year,
sacking more than 100 employees.
	   In May, Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. increased its
shareholding in Pacific to 46 percent from 17.5 percent by buying
shares offered on the open market by the government, which kept 51
percent control.
	   Air Pacific revenue rose by 7.5 percent to U.S. 135.6 million
(Fiji dollars 284 million) and expenditure rose by 10 percent to
U.S. dlrs 132.6 million (Fiji dollars 278 million), the airline
said.
	   Passenger traffic rose by eight percent overall except for Japan
which dropped due to the withdrawal of an Osaka service and Los
Angeles where traffic was 59 percent above the previous year's
figure.
	   In November the airline will open a fourth weekly nonstop flight
from Fiji to Los Angeles.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's trade surplus widened to
dlrs 3.92 billion in June, thanks to a sharp 36.6-percent drop in
imports, the government said Wednesday.
	   But the country's exports dropped by 5.6 percent in June, the
second consecutive monthly contraction, the Commerce, Industry and
Energy Ministry said.
	   South Korea hoped to use its weak currency to ship more goods
abroad to surmount its financial crisis, but the falling value of
the Japanese yen was undermining that strategy.
	   Exports fell 3 percent in May, and government officials expected
further decreases in the months ahead. Japan and South Korea
compete in key export items, and the weak yen makes Japanese goods
cheaper overseas.
	   In June, customs-cleared exports fell to dlrs 11.7 billion and
imports plunged to dlrs 7.79 billion, resulting in a dlrs 3.92
surplus.
	   In the same month last year, South Korea posted a dlrs 104
million surplus.
	   The cumulative trade surplus in the first six months this year
reached dlrs 19.99 billion, compared with a dlrs 9.16 billion
shortfall a year ago. In the same period, exports increased 3.6
percent but imports decreased 36 percent.
	    &UR; ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai inflation is soaring as the
country grapples with economic crisis, with the Commerce Ministry
reporting Wednesday that consumer prices rose 10.7 percent in June,
the biggest increase in a decade.
	   The ministry attributed the increase to surging food prices,
especially rice and starch products and fruits and vegetables.
	   But Karun Kittisataporn, director general of the ministry's
Business Economics Department, said the increase was still below
the 12.2 percent forecast by the International Monetary Fund, which
is administering a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout for Thailand.
	   Inflation has been rising since Thailand abandoned exchange
rates pegged to the U.S. dollar a year ago, inadvertently sparking
the Asian economic crisis. The government has promised the IMF to
try to keep consumer price inflation at 10.5 percent this year.
	   Karun said he expected 1998 inflation to come in just under that
figure. The IMF has forecast that the June inflation figure will
represent the peak of year-on-year inflation, Karun said.
	   Year-on-year consumer inflation in the first half of 1998 was
9.7 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in the same period in 1997.
Analysts say year-on-year inflation should ease in the second half
of the year.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Europe is threatening to take a big
chunk out of Australia's share of the lucrative Asian beef export
market, a leading analyst warned Wednesday.
	   Professor Oswin Maurer, chairman of meat marketing at the
University of New England, said European Union beef producers could
enter the market as soon as the year 2000.
	   Under the 1987 Adriesen-Kerin Agreement, the EU vowed not to
sell subsidized beef in Asia.
	   However, Maurer said the EU was on target to reduce government
subsidies to producers.
	   He said it also planned to eliminate direct subsidies by the
next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks,
scheduled for 2000.
	   ``Once it has accomplished this it will have lifted the last
barrier preventing it from selling beef on Asia's markets,'' he
said.
	   A major European push into the region has the potential to cause
more long-term damage to Australia's beef export industries than
the current Asian economic crisis, he said.
	   In 1996-97, Australia sold 430,600 metric tons of beef,
excluding live exports, to markets in north and southeast Asia.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines will begin offering its
economy class passengers a frequent flyer miles program, which has
been limited so far to first and business class travelers, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Beginning in February 1999, all SIA passengers will earn air
miles on SIA and SilkAir flights, as well as on flights with SIA's
alliance partners: Lufthansa, Air New Zealand, Ansett Australia and
Ansett International.
	   SilkAir is the holiday operator arm of Singapore Airlines.
	   SIA's marketing director Huang Cheng Eng told The Straits Times
that the new program will also offer some additional benefits and
privileges for frequent flyers.
	   Details of the program will be revealed in October, but are
likely to include more personalized service on the ground and in
the air.

	   OLONGAPO, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. air cargo company Federal
Express diverted three planes from its Asian hub at Subic Bay
freeport after rival groups threatened a violent showdown over who
should head the special economic zone, officials said Wednesday.
	   The three planes, each carrying about 10 tons of cargo, were
diverted to Manila late Tuesday and early Wednesday, airport
officials said.
	   Richard Gordon, who has led the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority
since it was created at a former U.S. naval base in 1992, has
refused to step down after being dismissed by new Philippine
President Joseph Estrada.
	   Estrada appointed a longtime Gordon rival, former Rep. Felicito
Payumo, to the post, but Gordon insists he still has six years
remaining in his term because he was re-appointed by former
President Fidel Ramos in February.
	   A court in Olongapo City, adjacent to Subic, issued a three-day
restraining order Wednesday against the appointment of Payumo and
set a hearing Monday on Gordon's motion questioning the legality of
Estrada's order. It was not immediately clear whether Payumo would
be allowed to take over after three days.
	   Hundreds of Gordon's supporters barricaded all the gates leading
to the freeport Wednesday. They also used a huge crane to block a
highway tunnel where thousands of supporters of Payumo were
gathering.
	   One of them, Clara Macasaet, died following a heart attack as
she kept vigil at one of the gates.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appears to be in retaliation for efforts
by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases
movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada, who took office Tuesday, said that as a Ramos
appointee, Gordon should offer to resign according to tradition to
give the new president a free hand in choosing his own appointees.
	   Radio reports said some factories at the freeport shut down
Wednesday to prevent their workers from being caught in any violent
confrontation between the pro-Gordon and pro-Payumo groups.
	   Gordon's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to stop Payumo's
takeover to prevent violence, but withdrew their motion early
Wednesday, saying they would refile it with a lower court.
	   Subic, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Manila, was
converted into an industrial and tourism center after the Americans
left in 1992.
	   Gordon, the previous mayor of the neighboring city of Olongapo,
led volunteers who protected the former base from looters, and
wooed investors including Fedex and Acer, the Taiwanese computer
manufacturer. The industrial zone now employs about 67,000 workers,
more than double the number during the time it was a U.S. base.
	   Rhicke Jennings, managing director for Southeast Asia operations
of Fedex, said the company put into place a ``contingency plan''
starting Wednesday to ensure continued service to customers.
	   He said the plan involves diverting eight daily flights from
Subic to Manila and Taipei, Taiwan, as would be done in cases of
bad weather or ``other conditions.'' Jennings added that the
situation at Subic will be assessed day by day.
	   ``Fedex is very satisfied with the success of our operations in
the Philippines ... and we are optimistic about our operations
because the Philippine government continues to support the
international business community,'' Jennings said. ``We do not have
a political position about the (change in leadership). We leave it
to the Filipino people and their government to decide how the SBMA
should go forward from here.''

	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ Admirers of Princess Diana, many
bearing armloads of lilies, passed throught the imposing stone
gates of her ancestral home on Wednesday to pay their respects near
her gravesite and to see the mementoes of a life that ended
dramatically nearly a year ago.
	   On the day that would have been her 37th birthday, they went to
see the schoolgirl's letters, the celebrity princess' high-fashion
outfits, and the stunning silk dress of the bride setting out on an
ill-fated royal marriage.
	   All are exhibits in a new museum built by Diana's brother, Earl
Spencer at the Althorp estate in rural Northamptonshire and open to
150,000 paying visitors for the next two months .
	   Iwona Skibinski, 31, and her husband drove from Duesseldorf,
Germany just to visit Althorp. ``It wasn't just that she was a
beautifully dressed woman, but a person who was very socially
engaging. And she did so many good works _ such as her anti-land
mines campaign, and caring for children all over the world. And
that really touched me ,'' Mrs. Skibinski said.
	   But for many, the point of the visit is the ornamental lake and
the island where Diana was buried in a private family ceremony
after her death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash. They cannot visit the
the gravesite but can view the island from the water's edge, and a
site for floral memorials has been set aside.
	   Nearly 150,000 tickets _ called ``invitations to visit'' _ have
been sold at prices ranging from 5 pounds (dlrs 8) for children to
7.50 pounds (dlrs 12) for senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15)
for adults.
	   Like nearly everything associated with Diana, the opening of the
family home has been controversial. The Daily Telegraph recently
described the earl as ``a lost soul now tethering himself to the
memory of his lost sister.''
	   One item on display in the imposing stable block is a first
draft of Spencer's speech at Diana's funeral Sept. 6 in Westminster
Abbey in London, where he spoke bluntly about his sister's
frustration as a royal wife and his fear that the souls of her two
sons would be stifled by the pressures of palace life.
	   Displays in the museum include the dress Diana wore at her
wedding to Prince Charles at St. Paul's Cathedral in 1981, personal
effects from her childhood including her school uniform, candy box
and school reports, family photographs and home movies.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associated with Diana, ``but not
cheapening her memory in any way,'' the estate says.
	   However, residents in the nearby village of Great Brington have
expressed fear that the lure of Diana's grave would embroil them in
an English version of Graceland, the home and final resting place
of Elvis Presley.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Exhausted after spending four nights
sleeping in the streets of this quake-struck town, residents began
returning to their homes Wednesday.
	   Search teams found more bodies under the debris, bringing to 144
the number of dead found after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake rocked
southern Turkey Saturday, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, state aid and private donations poured in for the
reconstruction of the several thousand buildings damaged in the
quake. Turkish immigrants in Germany gathered 8,600 German marks
(about dlrs 4,800).
	   The total damage caused to the region has still not been
entirely assessed.
	   In Ceyhan, most of the casualties came in the collapse of five
multi-story buildings, prompting investigations into their
construction.
	   In nearby Adana -- along with Ceyhan the hardest hit by the
quake -- it was mostly the slum areas that suffered, leaving many
with little or nothing left.

Philippine banks' resources decline, bad loans rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The resources of Philippine thrift
banks totaled 202.5 billion pesos (dlrs 4.9 billion) at the end of
March, less than 1 percent lower than a year earlier, the central
bank said Wednesday.
	   The central bank said the banking industry remained stable
despite an increase in the ratio of non-performing loans to 14.1
percent, which it termed manageable.
	   This ratio is much higher, however, than the 10.6 percent at the
end of December and nearly double the 7.4 percent at the end of
March 1997, before the start of the regional financial crisis that
forced the peso to depreciate and interest rates to soar.
	   The central bank said thrift banks have been most affected by
the regional financial crisis.
	   Unlike in other Southeast Asian countries embroiled in the
crisis, the Philippines' larger so-called universal banks have been
spared from cash flow or crisis-related problems, the central bank
said.
	   In the Philippines, universal banks refer to commercial banks
with expanded licenses allowing them to venture into non-commercial
banking operations such as investment banking and fund management.
	   Since the start of the year, three thrift banks have been
ordered closed by the central bank. These banks experienced cash
flow problems triggered by the high interest rates, which caused
many companies to default on their loans or restructure them.
	   The central bank said the closure of these thrift banks did not
represent a threat to the Philippine banking system as their
combined assets represent far less than 1 percent of the banking
system's total resources.
	   Thrift banks, the smallest category of banks in the Philippines,
are required to have a minimum capital of 250 million pesos (dlrs
6.1 million). Universal banks are required to have at least 4.5
billion pesos (dlrs 110 million).

Indonesia announces rice distribution plan for poor people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ With millions of impoverished
Indonesians facing food shortages, the government said Wednesday it
will offer rice to low-income families at reduced prices.
	   The state logistics agency, Bulog, will sell rice to poor people
at 1,000 rupiah (7 U.S. cents) a kilogram beginning this month,
director Bedu Amang said. A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of rice now costs
up to twice that much.
	   The nine-month operation is expected to reach 40 million people
across the nation of 200 million people.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis since the 1960s,
with prices and unemployment rising fast. As many as 1,200 people
were killed in riots over price increases last month in Jakarta.
The riots helped dislodge President Suharto.
	   Food Minister A.M. Syafuddin said many of the people who need
rice have lost their jobs recently.
	   Under the rice distribution program, each family can buy 10
kilograms (22 pounds) of rice a month.
	   ``The operation is to prevent poor people from the threat of
hunger,'' Amang said.
	   Indonesia has said it will have to import 3.1 million tons of
rice in 1998 to compensate for production shortages caused by
prolonged drought and crop failure. Last year, Indonesia imported
350,000 tons of rice.

Russian coal miners resume railway blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners demanding wage arrears have launched a
new protest campaign and were again blocking the Trans-Siberian
railway, news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   Miners blocked rails and highways in three towns in the Kemerovo
region in central Siberia, the reports said. The region's governor,
Aman Tuleyev, met with miners on Tuesday and expressed sympathy
with their complaints, but he opposed blocking the rails, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Miners say the federal government has paid only two-thirds of a
1 billion ruble (dlrs 160 million) sum that was promised after the
miners blocked rails for two weeks in May, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   And the protesters are still demanding the government's
resignation.
	   The strike will last for two days, miners said. Union leaders
will then meet on July 3 to plan their next move, and miners in
other Kemerovo towns may block the rails again, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Meanwhile, about 200 striking miners from four Russian mining
regions, including Kemerovo, were still camped at the government
building known as the White House, promising to stay until
President Yeltsin is impeached or resigns. They have been there for
three weeks.
	   However, coal miners near the city of Orenburg, 1,400 kilometers
(860 miles) east of Moscow, lifted a rail and road blockade in the
region on Wednesday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Regional administrators agreed with trade unions to pay wage
arrears totaling 7.5 million rubles (dlrs 1.2 million) by August 1.
	   Thousands of Russian coal miners staged scattered strikes in
May, complaining that they hadn't been paid for months. The
protests disrupted rail traffic, but the miners agreed to return to
their jobs after being promised they would receive a portion of
their overdue wages.

South Korean car makers brace for grim year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean automakers will cut
production in half later this year and lay off 16,000 workers, an
industry group predicted Wednesday.
	   The forecast by the Korean Automakers' Association came in
tandem with rising threats by auto workers to call an industry-wide
strike later this month to protest spreading layoffs.
	   Sharp drops in domestic sales have left Hyundai, Daewoo and
other car makers with huge inventories of unsold cars and thousands
of redundant workers.
	   ``It has become inevitable to cut operation hours and reduce
work forces in the country's auto plants,'' said the association, a
lobby group representing the country's major auto companies.
	   The association said South Korea's car production will fall 20
percent to 2.25 million this year, the first contraction since the
country began producing cars in the 1970s.
	   Domestic sales will drop by 45 percent to 820,000 cars, while
exports will increase 8.6 percent to 1.43 million, the group said.
	   Assembly lines at Hyundai Motors Co., the country's No. 1
automaker, stood idle Wednesday as its workers put down their tools
in a one-day strike to protest company plans to shed 4,800 workers.
	   The union will call a bigger strike next Monday unless the
company retracts its layoff plans, labor leaders said.
	   ``The management should not take our threat lightly. For us,
this is a matter of life or death,'' said Hyundai union spokesman
Kim Kun-soo.
	   Hyundai was the first to resort to mass layoffs in a country
where the custom long has been to employ a worker for life _ a
custom now threatened by Asia's economic crisis.
	   Other car makers were expected to follow suit.
	   The Korean Metal Workers' Federation, a militant umbrella group
of auto and other heavy industry workers, said it was urging its
member unions to go on strike in mid-July.
	   Until the nation tumbled into an economic crisis late last year,
South Korea's car makers had been borrowing and expanding at a
rapid pace, with the hope of turning out 5 million cars annually by
2000.

Russian space experts postpone decision on Mir's future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space officials postponed a decision on
whether the Mir space station will have to be discarded ahead of
schedule because of a lack of government funding, a report said
Wednesday.
	   The Mir's current two-man crew plans to leave the station Aug.
25, and space official still don't know if they can afford to send
a replacement team. A decision has to be made before the end of
July in order to complete flight preparations.
	   No extension of the current team's stay is possible because the
working life of their escape capsule runs out in late August.
	   Space experts had been planning to discuss the funding problem
Thursday, but the meeting has been postponed for at least a week,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   At a session last week, top space officials sent a letter to
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko asking the government to pay up.
They want to get a response before deciding the Mir's future.
	   The government hasn't allocated any money for Mir operations
this year, and still owes 440 million rubles (dlrs 70 million) for
last year's missions, space officials said.
	   Russian space officials want to keep the station in orbit until
the end of 1999, and that would cost about 2 billion rubles (dlrs
320 million), ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Abandoning the Mir in August could cause problems. Left alone,
the 130-ton station will gradually spin out of orbit and fall back
to Earth within two years _ with large pieces possibly landing in
populated areas.
	   Discarding the Mir in a controlled fashion will be more
expensive. To guide the station's descent to Earth, Russia would
have to launch several cargo ships over a short period to dock with
the station. The cargo ships would use their engines to direct Mir
into lower orbits. Most or all of the Mir is expected to burn up
during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
	   The Mir has been in orbit for more than 12 years.

Rice millers threaten stoppage over foreign worker ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai rice millers, irate over a
government ban on foreign workers, say they will shut down 400
mills beginning Thursday.
	   Kriengsak Tapananond, a member of the Thai Rice Mills
Association, said Wednesday that the mills will remain closed until
the government solves the problem of how to replace the 20,000
foreign workers who will be lost to the industry.
	   The original plan called for all foreign workers to leave their
jobs by May 1. The deadline was extended to July 10 following a
meeting between rice mill operators and the government.
	   Efforts to recruit Thais to fill the jobs have been an almost
total failure. Many of the handful of Thais who have signed up at
job fairs have quit after just a few days of the grueling, low-pay
labor, which includes lifting 100-kilogram (220-pound) sacks.
	   Fishing, another industry whose physical requirements make it
unattractive for Thais, has been exempted from the ban.
	   Kriengsak said the 400 mills normally would produce 1 billion
baht (dlrs 24 million) worth of rice each day. There are more than
1,000 rice mills throughout the country.
	   He said the mills would stop rice purchases, hurting farmers and
leading to spoilage of large quantities of the grain.
	   Rice exporters and animal feed producers will also be affected,
he said.
	   The government decided to crack down on foreign workers last
year as the economic crisis made it evident there would be many
layoffs in almost every sector of business. A estimated 2 million
people will be unemployed this year.
	   Of 20,000 foreign workers in the rice industry, most come from
Myanmar, while the second largest group comes from Cambodia, said
Kriengsak.
	   Kriengsak said foreigners were paid less than Thais in the past
but their wages have matched the Thai minimum wage since 1991, when
a labor shortage emerged.
	   On Tuesday, a Labor Ministry official said Thailand will
reconsider its plan to expel illegal foreign workers since some
industries are unable to recruit Thais to replace them.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Labor
Minister Trairong Suwankhiri would meet business leaders July 15 to
reconsider the policy.

Bomb damages post office in Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A bomb exploded behind a post office in the
southern French port of Marseille on Wednesday, injuring two people
and blowing out the windows of the building, French police said.
	   The explosion awoke many residents, who ran into the streets
after the bomb went off. The blast also broke windows in several
apartments.
	   Two people were injured by flying glass, police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, but
police were looking into whether it might have been carried out by
Corsican nationalists, who are believed to be behind a number of
attacks in Marseille in recent months.
	   A bomb in early May devastated the entrance to a hotel. Over the
last two years, post offices, banks as well as police stations have
been attacked in Marseille and Aix-en-Provence.
	   Corsica belongs to France, and nationalists want more autonomy
for the Mediterranean island.

Serb forces eye KLA stronghold after taking back mine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serb forces moving west to Drenica, reports of
shooting near Kijevo. &QL; 
 &UR; With Kosovo-Determined Rebels &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo Wednesday, in an attempt to stave off
Serbian security forces in the secessionist province.
	   After Serbian forces recaptured a strategic coal mine region
from the Kosovo Liberation Army Tuesday, the Albanians moved west
to the Drenica region, police said Wednesday.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanian's fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement of the Kosovo conflict. A U.S. envoy said Tuesday that
the ethnic Albanian rebels have no clear military chain of command
to negotiate a cease-fire.
	   Serb forces recaptured the Belacevac mine region after two days
of nearly non-stop fighting in the village. The mine is
strategically important because it supplies coal to the nearby
Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most of Kosovo
as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece during peak summer
months.
	   Along with the Belacevac, Serbian media have suggested the other
goal of this week's offensive was to break the 2-week-old standoff
at Kijevo.
	   No fighting was reported in the Kijevo Wednesday.
	   The KLA attacked the Serb village of Drsnik, killing a
26-year-old villager, Tanjug state news agency said. The shooting
lasted for several hours, before the KLA withdrew, the agency said.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, the crossroads village has been a flashpoint since the
Kosovo Liberation Army surrounded it earlier this month and cut off
its Serb inhabitants and police. The KLA fighters themselves were
surrounded by Serb police checkpoints.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   A senior U.S. official in Washington acknowledged Tuesday that
the United States is continuing to hold private talks with leaders
of the political wing of the KLA, who were said to have responded
positively to U.S. conditions for negotiations.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright again demanded
Tuesday that Milosevic withdraw Serb special forces and the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
	   ``Milosevic is digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper in
terms of increasing the level of violence, and the violence has to
stop,'' she said in Shanghai, China, where she was accompanying
President Bill Clinton on a nine-day state visit.

Tokyo high court acquits man in 1981 murder of his wife in Los
</HEADLINE>
Angeles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo high court acquitted a Japanese man
Wednesday of arranging the slaying of his wife in a sensational
murder case in Los Angeles in 1981.
	   Kazuyoshi Miura, 50, was released later in the day from the
Tokyo Detention Center, where he had been detained since his arrest
in September 1985.
	   The High Court overturned a 1994 lower court's finding that
Miura planned to kill his wife, Kazumi, then 28, in conspiracy with
a friend in Los Angeles.
	   Miura and his wife were visiting Los Angeles on Nov. 18, 1981,
when they were shot in a parking lot. Miura was hit in the right
leg, while his wife was shot in the head.
	   She remained in a coma until she died in a hospital in Japan a
year later. The case gained nationwide media attention in Japan in
the early 1980s because Mrs. Miura, on a stretcher with her husband
by her side, was flown back to Japan in a U.S. military aircraft.
	   Throughout his trial, Miura maintained his innocence, saying he
and his wife had been shot in an attack by robbers.
	   In Wednesday's ruling, presiding Judge Norio Akiyama said there
was ``no sure evidence'' to conclude that Miura had arranged for
anyone to shoot his wife.
	   The judge also said there has been no clarification of who the
shooter might have been.
	   On Wednesday, the High Court also upheld a lower court's
acquittal of Yoshikuni Okubo, 46, Miura's friend and the man the
prosecution alleged was the shooter.
	   In 1984, a Japanese weekly magazine carried a series of articles
alleging that Miura was behind his wife's death in a scheme to
collect 163 million yen (dlrs 1.18 million) from her life insurance
policies.
	   Police filed murder charges against Miura in November 1988.
	   In a separate case, Miura was convicted in August 1987 of
enlisting a mistress' aid in an unsuccessful attempt to kill his
wife. He served a six-year sentence. That attempt occurred three
months before the fatal shooting. Miura is appealing the sentence.

Filipino sailors face deportation from Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Filipino sailor facing deportation
from Canada says he fears for his family's safety after he
testified against Taiwanese sailors accused of killing three
stowaways.
	   Esmeraldo Esteban, 43, is one of four Filipino sailors from the
container ship Maersk Dubai who are now making a last-minute appeal
to the federal government to be allowed to stay in Canada.
	   The sailors debarked from the Maersk Dubai in Halifax in May
1996 and told police that three Romanian stowaways had been forced
off the ship at sea.
	   The federal Department of Citizenship and Immigration has
ordered that Esteban and his three countrymen _ Rodolfo Miguel,
Ariel Broas and Juanito Ilagan _ leave Canada on Thursday.
	   But that order will not be enforced while their lawyer, Lee
Cohen, makes a final appeal to the department to allow the men to
stay on compassionate and humanitarian grounds.
	   Esteban, who is holding down three jobs and supports his wife
and three children in the Philippines, insists that his family
would be in danger if he returns to the Philippines. He said that
when he testified at an extradition hearing for seven Taiwanese
officers charged with murdering the stowaways, his family was
harassed and intimidated by men who urged his wife to stop him from
giving evidence.
	   He said he believes he would get the same treatment in his
homeland.
	   ``There is no way I could go to live in the Philippines,'' he
told the Globe and Mail of Canada. ``If I go home I will not be
able to see my family. That would put them in danger. I'm pretty
sure there would be retaliation.''
	   Late last year, the federal Immigration and Refugee Board
rejected the four men's applications to be admitted to Canada as
refugees. The board accepted that their families had been harassed
but said it could not determine who was harassing them and it could
not find that the men had a reasonable fear of persecution due to
their political or religious beliefs.
	   The Taiwanese sailors' extradition hearing ended when a judge of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that although crimes
appeared to have been committed, the court could not rule on
Romania's request to extradite the sailors because the incidents
were alleged to have happened in international waters.
	   Since they testified, the Filipinos have received widespread
support for their application to stay in Canada. Some supporters
planned a 24-hour prayer vigil Wednesday on the Halifax waterfront.

New UBS announces sale of subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The newly merged United Bank of
Switzerland said Wednesday that Italian insurance company
Assicurazioni Generali intends to buy two of its subsidiaries.
	   The sale of Banca della Svizzera Italiana, a subsidiary in the
Italian-speaking state of Ticino, and Bosslab Corp., which provides
information technology for banking services, were among conditions
imposed on the new UBS by regulators.
	   The sale price for the two will total 1.92 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 1.32 billion), UBS said in a statement. The sale is subject
to approval by Italian and Swiss regulators.
	   The bank said it would use the proceeds of the transaction,
which it expects to contribute an additional profit of some 1
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 690 million) this year, to pursue its
strategic goals in private banking.
	   Assicurazioni Generali gave the same terms of purchase announced
by UBS. The insurance company said it is trying to increase its
presence in the area of managed savings.
	   The new UBS, with dlrs 627 billion in assets, now the world's
second largest behind Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, started
trading Monday. It is the product of the merger of Swiss Bank Corp.
and Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   Switzerland's antitrust watchdog in May conditionally approved
the merger, which cleared its final hurdle of approval by the U.S.
Federal Reserve in June.
	   UBS must, if possible, sell by next March some 25 bank branches
as a package to one single buyer interested in establishing itself
as a Swiss retail bank, the regulators said.
	   It also has to divest Banca della Svizzera Italiana, Bosslab
Corp. and another Swiss subsidiary, Solothurner Bank.

Gift-wrapped explosives planted at Cambodian rally, party says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on parcel passing, 6th graf, official
says case looks like intimidation, 10th graf. Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Six gift-wrapped packages filled
with explosives were planted at an opposition party campaign rally
attended by 1,000 people but were detected before they could
explode, the party said Wednesday.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, one of two chief opposition groups
contesting the July 26 polls, accused Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
and his ruling Cambodian People's Party of terrorizing opponents.
	   ``It's a campaign of intimidation and everybody knows it,'' said
Eng Chhay Eang, party leader Sam Rainsy's chief of staff. ``The
threats and violence all come from one side, Hun Sen's
organization.''
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a political
demonstration led by Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's harshest critics.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 injured.
	   A party statement said that about 1,000 supporters had gathered
Tuesday in front of party headquarters in Battambang, the country's
second-largest city, to start a parade.
	   Four men came through the crowd carrying parcels wrapped up like
cakes in silver paper, the party said. They tossed the parcels to
members on a car and tractor joining the parade as if they were
gifts, invited people to open them when hungry and left.
	   ``Everyone was surprised when they opened them up,'' said Lon
Phon, the party's main candidate in Battambang.
	   Inside were five explosive devices, apparently a type of land
mine, the statement said. The parcels were quickly removed from the
scene.
	   Local human rights workers confirmed the parcels held
explosives. Police, however, said they had not yet been informed
about the case.
	   ``If we can prove it, the act is clearly one of political
intimidation,'' said Ham Monny, a member of the provincial election
commission.
	   The opposition, human rights and watchdog groups have accused
Hun Sen of using murder and intimidation to make sure he wins the
election.
	   Sam Rainsy was not in the country. In last year's attack, widely
blamed on Hun Sen, he was slightly injured. A bodyguard who
shielded him from a blast was killed.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last year.
	   Earlier, election organizers issued an urgent appeal to the
international community for additional funds and observers.
	   Only 500 foreign observers are slated to be in the country by
election day, though the Cambodians want one for each of the 1,700
counting centers.
	   Cambodia has been promised more than dlrs 11 million in election
aid from the European Union, a similar amount from Japan and almost
dlrs 3 million from the United States.
	   The United States, which has serious doubts about the
government's ability to conduct a fair election, is providing the
money solely to private groups.
	   Kassie Neou, vice chairman of the National Election Committee,
also said there was a ``serious shortfall'' of money, especially
for transport to bring ballot boxes from outlying areas for
counting.
	   The committee said last week that it would need dlrs 5.1 million
more.

	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ Admirers of Princess Diana, many
bearing armloads of lilies, passed through the imposing stone gates
of her ancestral home on Wednesday to pay their respects near her
gravesite and to see the mementoes of a life that ended
dramatically nearly a year ago.
	   On the day that would have been her 37th birthday, they went to
see the schoolgirl's letters, the stunning silk dress of the bride
setting out on an ill-fated royal marriage, and the celebrity
princess' high-fashion outfits.
	   All are exhibits in a new museum built by Diana's brother, Earl
Spencer at the Althorp estate in rural Northamptonshire and open to
150,000 paying visitors for the next two months .
	   Iwona Skibinski, 31, and her husband drove from Duesseldorf,
Germany just to visit Althorp. ``It wasn't just that she was a
beautifully dressed woman, but a person who was very socially
engaging. And she did so many good works _ such as her anti-land
mines campaign, and caring for children all over the world. And
that really touched me ,'' Mrs. Skibinski said.
	   But for many, the point of the visit is the ornamental lake and
the island where Diana was buried in a private family ceremony
after her death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash. They cannot visit the
the gravesite but can view the island from the water's edge.
	   ``We just wanted to pay our respects really,'' said Emma Gore,
18, who had gone to London for Diana's funeral. ``The whole thing
is beautiful, it is really lovely. Very tranquil.''
	   She and her husband Shaun, 30, laid a bunch of chrysanthemums on
the lawn in front of the lakeside classical temple that is a
memorial to the princess.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ While officials toasted and congratulated one
other on Hong Kong's first year under Chinese rule, a small group
of protesters marked the anniversary with a colorful rally through
Hong Kong's downtown streets.
	   Wearing yellow arm bands which they said symbolized peace, the
activists said there was no reason to celebrate.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the populist Frontier movement, who will
take her place in a new legislature Thursday, said, ``Both the
political and economic situations are looking quite dismal.''
	   Most people in Hong Kong give China high marks for keeping hands
off since it regained sovereignty a year ago. But Lau said
government officials have made no promises to speed up democratic
reforms, and they have ``no coherent policies'' to lift Hong Kong
out of its economic troubles.
	   The 150 protesters included students, politicians, and labor and
women's rights activists. Some wore T-shirts with such sayings as:
``To resist is to win.''
	   ``Everyone has the right to work. I have the right to protest,''
they chanted in the 5-kilometer (three-mile) march. Some beat
tribal drums and sang songs declaring their rights.
	   Last year, nearly 3,000 people attended a similar rally, which
activists said was the first test of the government's tolerance of
dissenting views. Despite some restrictions on protests, civil
liberties generally are intact a year later.
	   ``There haven't been any major changes'' in civil rights, said
36-year-old Winnie Lai, dressed in military-style pants and smoking
a rolled cigarette under the scorching sun.
	   ``But it's important for us to stand up and declare our rights''
before authorities take them away, said Lai, a translator.

Indonesian government to continue investigation of Suharto
</HEADLINE>
foundations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general said
Wednesday he will continue an investigation into charitable
foundations controlled by former President Suharto.
	   But newly installed Attorney General Andi Ghalib urged
Indonesians not to assume that Suharto was guilty of illegal
accumulation of wealth.
	   Suharto, 76, quit May 21 following riots and protests amid the
worst economic crisis in decades. His family amassed vast wealth
during his 32 years in power.
	   ``I agree with the statement `justice for all,''' including for
Suharto, said Ghalib, an army lieutenant general.
	   However, he denied reports that the former president is under
investigation. ``We are only on the stage of questioning,'' he
said.
	   He said that so far, there was no evidence that Suharto had
stashed his wealth abroad. Prosecutors are looking into more than a
dozen foundations controlled by the Suharto family.
	   ``We have been checking on these foundations,'' Ghalib said of
the current nationwide investigation by his office.
	   Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo, a banker and entrepreneur,
has challenged those accusing the ex-president of corruption to
provide evidence.
	   He insisted that the ex-president and his family have no
objections to investigations into their wealth.
	   Democracy activists are demanding an investigation into the
Suharto clan's money, estimated at billions of dollars.
	   The powerful military, now led by Gen. Wiranto, a former Suharto
adjutant, has argued against such an investigation, saying it would
prompt national disunity.
	   Responding to popular resentment over the Suharto family
fortune, new President B.J. Habibie has begun reviewing some state
contracts with companies controlled by the clan. Some have already
been canceled.

World Cup: Adidas halts Chinese soccer ball production over labor
</HEADLINE>
camp tie &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Adidas, one of the World Cup's official sponsors,
said Wednesday that it is canceling all orders for soccer balls
made in China after a report linked production with prison labor.
	   The German sports goods giant said that licensees and
subcontractors were likely involved in the manufacturing of
thousands of soccer balls branded with the Adidas and official
World Cup logo, according to the Wall Street Journal Europe.
	   The newspaper cites an official at the Dazhong Agricultural
Machinery Factory, which is attached to a labor camp near Shanghai,
as saying that the firm has made balls for Shanghai Union Ball
Enterprise Corp. Shanghai Union makes Adidas-branded balls for
Japan's Molten Corp. and an Adidas subsidiary through a production
deal with Shanghai-based Mortex Ltd.
	   Adidas is now canceling further production by the
subcontractors, the report said.
	   The balls concerned are not those used in the World Cup but are
copies intended for general sale.
	   In a statement, Adidas said that henceforth no third parties
would make the balls and that production would be centralized at
Adidas Asia-Pacific in Hong Kong.
	   ``Our aim is to have the utmost control over the Adidas brand.
Sourcing our products plays an important role in the perception of
our brand by our consumers,'' said company president Robert
Louis-Dreyfus. ``We are determined to directly control the whole
value-chain.''

Some 184 Kurds caught in Italian southern coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIACE, Italy (AP) _ Italian police on Wednesday caught 184 Kurds
who reached the southern coast after a sea trip from Turkey, news
reports said.
	   The Kurds, who included 72 children, were of Turkish and Iraqi
nationality.
	   With warm temperatures and calm waters, would-be immigrants have
been arriving nearly every day on Italy's long coastlines.
	   Wednesday's arrivals were kept in a shelter in a nearby town
until authorities examine their cases. Under new laws most of them
face immediate expulsion.
	   Italy tried to tighten its frontiers after clandestine arrivals
by hundreds of Kurdish refugees from Turkey earlier this year led
to an outcry by Germany and other European Union members. Germany
claimed that Italy was a transit point for refugees seeking jobs
and to reach their families in northern Europe.
	   Illegal immigrants who are given expulsion orders are now
escorted to the border immediately.

Three European ambassadors visit jailed East Timorese rebel

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with military commander saying troops still needed in
East Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Trying to promote peace in disputed
East Timor, three European ambassadors on Wednesday visited a
jailed rebel leader from the Indonesian-controlled territory.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, Austria and the Netherlands returned
Tuesday from a fact-finding mission to East Timor, where security
forces shot two pro-independence protesters during rallies that
were staged to impress the visiting diplomats.
	   They are part of a European Union effort to mediate a solution
to the long-running conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
	   After leaving Jakarta's Cipinang jail, the ambassadors did not
comment on their meeting with Xanana Gusmao, a rebel chief who had
fought Indonesian troops since they invaded East Timor in 1975.
	   Meanwhile, a military commander said Wednesday it was not yet
time to withdraw Indonesian troops from East Timor, despite pledges
from the government that it is willing to pull out some soldiers
gradually.
	   ``The East Timorese still need the military, not for combat but
to help them develop the province and improve their welfare,'' the
official Antara news agency quoted Maj. Gen. Adam Damiri as saying.
	   Many East Timorese revere Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year
sentence, and demand his release as well as a vote on independence.
	   He has international stature, too: South African President
Nelson Mandela visited him in prison last year during a state trip
to Indonesia and called for his release. Then-President Suharto
rejected the appeal.
	   President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, has offered to free
Gusmao and grant East Timor special status in return for
international recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory.
	   The ambassadors who visited Gusmao are Robin Christopher of
Britain, Paul Brouwer of the Netherlands and Viktor Segalla of
Austria. They were accompanied by Klaus Peter Schmallenback,
representative of the European Commission office in Jakarta.
	   Hamish Daniel, spokesman at the British Embassy, confirmed the
jail visit.

Fighting tears at Bissau and Mansoa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Machine-gun fire and
rocket-propelled grenades tore through the capital of Bissau and
the nearby town of Mansoa on Wednesday, one day after peace talks
were canceled amid fierce fighting between government soldiers and
renegade troops.
	   Loyalist forces have been building up in Mansoa, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported, apparently eyeing the powerful radio and
TV transmitter in the nearby town of Nhacra, which is held by the
rebels.
	   In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, meanwhile, foreign ministers of the
Economic Community of West African States were meeting Wednesday to
discuss whether to send peacekeepers to help bring an end to the
fighting.
	   Last week, besieged President Joao Bernardo Vieira said he would
be willing to accept additional help from the group's peacekeeping
wing, known as ECOMOG.
	   Largely made up of Nigerians, ECOMOG has stepped into trouble
spots before in West Africa. Most recently, they forced out a coup
leader in Sierra Leone, replacing the elected government.
	   On Tuesday, hours before a government delegation was to meet
with renegade leaders to discuss a cease-fire in this former
Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip, artillery and rocket
fire slammed into the capital of Bissau and its outlying areas.
	   The talks were canceled as both sides accused the other of
launching the attack.
	   Rebel leaders had earlier demanded that Senegal and Republic of
Guinea, which are fighting in support of Vieira, withdraw their
troops before peace negotiations continue.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a cease-fire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers.
	   Portugal's ambassador in Bissau, Francisco Henriques da Silva,
was following up on mediation efforts launched over the weekend by
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, a foreign ministry
spokeswoman said in Lisbon.
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane tried to topple
Vieira earlier this month. The coup attempt degenerated into near
civil war in and around the capital and some nearby towns.
Guinea-Bissau's military is split between allegiances to Vieira and
Mane.
	   The government has offered a pardon to rebel soldiers who lay
down their arms and a life in exile to officers who masterminded
the uprising, which began June 7.
	   Over the weekend, Senegal sent additional troops to Bissau to
counter increasing support for the rebels. A growing number of
people support rebel claims that Vieira's government was riddled
with corruption.
	   Aid agencies warn that Bissau's displaced population _ many of
whom have moved to the central towns of Mansoa, Bafata and
Canchungo _ are putting heavy pressure on food reserves.

Turkish troops kill 41 Kurdish rebels in southeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish troops have killed 41 Kurdish
rebels in clashes in the southeast, officials said here Wednesday.
	   Thirty-five of the guerrillas were killed in the province of
Hakkari, where the borders of Turkey, Iraq and Iran converge.
	   It was not clear when the clashes took place. The report could
not be verified independently.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, has been fighting to create an
autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey's southeast since 1984. Some
37,000 people have died in the conflict.

Asian stock markets close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed higher across the
board Wednesday, with share prices soaring in Seoul and Tokyo on
the strength of the Japanese currency.
	   The U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen on a report that the
Japanese government will cut taxes to bolster the economy.
	   It was quoted at 138.24 yen in late afternoon, down 1.71 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
139.16 yen overnight.
	   Shares on the Seoul Stock Exchange surged on the back of the
stronger yen, with the key Korea Composite Stock Price Index rising
17.68 points, or 5.6 percent, to close at 315.20.
	   Traders said comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
that South Korea appears to be moving in the right direction with
its economic reforms also boosted the South Korean market.
	   Rubin made his remarks to representatives of the American
business community in Seoul.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 532.62
points, or 3.36 percent, closing at 16,362.89 _ its highest since
April 10.
	   The benchmark average now has climbed for six sessions, gaining
almost 9 percent. On Tuesday, it gained 464.54 points, or 3.02
percent.
	   Japanese financial markets have rallied on growing expectations
that the governing Liberal Democratic Party will propose a sweeping
tax cut ahead of upper house elections July 12.
	   Investors are optimistic a tax cut would spur consumer spending,
lifting Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Malaysian shares also surged in reaction to gains on the
Japanese market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 15.59
points, or 3.4 percent, to 471.23.
	   In Singapore, shares closed sharply higher as a change in
sentiment on Japan was taken as an opportunity to put funds back
into the local market, dealers said.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index closed
28.44 points, or 2.7 percent, higher at 1,095.10.
	   The markets were closed in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand for
holidays.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher for a second day. The
Composite Index rose 10.621 points, or 2.4 percent, to 456.541.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on the back
of a stronger New Zealand dollar. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose
43.99 points, or 2.2 percent, to 2,008.58.
	   MANILA: Philippine stocks closed higher, extending their rebound
to a third trading day. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 21.83 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,781.96.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher after a late rally
in resource stocks, thanks to improved metals prices and renewed
investor optimism. The All Ordinaries Index rose 31.0 points, or
1.1 percent, to 2,699.4.

Parliament approves new administrative division into 15 provinces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist-dominated parliament approved
a plan Wednesday to decentralize Poland's administrative system and
reduce the number of provinces from 49 to 15, but the president was
expected to veto the legislation.
	   The governing coalition, made up of the Solidarity bloc and the
center-right Freedom Union, is short of the three-fifths majority
required to overrule a presidential veto.
	   Ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski has vowed to veto
the plan and has campaigned instead for a return to the pre-1976
division into 17 provinces. His veto was expected Thursday.
	   The powerful lower house, or Sejm, voted 195-40 with 165
abstentions to accept the reform plan, which was approved earlier
by the upper house.
	   The opposition ex-communist Social Democracy of Poland also
wants 17 provinces and abstained from the voting. The leftist
peasants' caucus also did not vote, saying it supports only the
current division into 49 provinces.
	   The reform plan by the Solidarity-led government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek would do away with the communist-era
administration and transfer power to municipalities. It would take
effect Jan. 1.
	   The reform has broad support among politicians, but the
government and the leftist opposition disagree over the number of
provinces to create.
	   The original Cabinet plan provided for reducing the number of
provinces to 12. But following protests from residents in cities
that would lose their status as provincial capitals and hard
bargaining with the opposition, the government agreed to increase
the number to 15.
	   Government experts say that increasing the number further would
result in provinces that are too small to be efficient.
	   Kwasniewski has toured several provinces and argues Poles favor
the leftist plan. He wants to keep the northwestern province of
Koszalin and the central province of Kielce in the redrawn map. His
critics argue he hopes to win supporters in those provinces ahead
of seeking re-election in 2000.
	   Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski has threatened to cut
contacts with the president if he vetoes the government plan.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A suspect was killed and three police
officers were wounded during a failed escape attempt by 14
detainees in western Ukraine, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The detainees were being transported in a police van to a
detention center in the town of Lviv on Monday when they started to
rock the vehicle, smashing its doors and ripping out metal bars
covering the windows.
	   They managed to seize a pistol and an assault rifle from police
guards in the van. One of the detainees opened fire, wounding the
van's driver _ who managed to return fire and kill the assailant,
identified only as 34-year-old Chunchukov, who already had a
criminal record, the report said.
	   Two officers were injured in the scuffle before managing to
subdue the detainees, who are suspected of robberies, it said. The
driver, who was wounded in the head, underwent an operation and
remains in serious condition, it added.
	   Ukrainian newspapers said police authorities launched an
investigation into the incident. They noted that the large number
of detainees in one vehicle apparently violated regulations.

	   ASOGUN, Japan (AP) _ American women won three of their four
matches Wednesday, helping their team break a 6-6 tie and surge to
a 22-14 lead with one round left in the annual 54-hole Fuji Xerox
U.S.-Japan Collegiate Golf Championship.
	   The American men took five of their eight matches on a day of
singles play.
	   The two teams had played doubles matches Tuesday. Each victory
is worth two points and each team gets one point for a tie.
	   The last 24 points will be decided in another round of singles
matches Thursday.
	   Azuma Yano of Japan's Nihon University had the day's best round,
an 8-under-par 64, to beat Jeremy Parrott of Georgia, who shot a
71.
	   Ben Curtis of Kent State shot the best American score, beating
Tadayoshi Wada of Tohoku Fukushi 68-74.
	   The men played over a 6,948-yard (6,323-meter), par-72 layout
and the women over a 6,485-yard (5,901-meter), par-72 layout at
Verde Sano Country Club in Asogun, 90 kilometers (54 miles)
northwest of Tokyo.
	   The United States leads Japan 15-7 in the series, which began in
1975.

New UBS announces sale of subsidiaries

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The newly merged United Bank of
Switzerland said Wednesday that Italian insurance company
Assicurazioni Generali intends to buy two of its subsidiaries.
	   The sale of Banca della Svizzera Italiana, a subsidiary in the
Italian-speaking canton (state) of Ticino, and Bosslab Corp., which
provides information technology for banking services, were among
conditions imposed on the new UBS by regulators.
	   The sale price for the two will total 1.92 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 1.32 billion), UBS said in a statement. The sale is subject
to approval by Italian and Swiss regulators.
	   The bank said it would use the proceeds of the transaction,
which it expects to contribute an additional profit of some 1
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 690 million) this year, to pursue its
strategic goals in private banking.
	   Assicurazioni Generali gave the same terms of purchase announced
by UBS, also saying it expected the deal to be completed during the
last four months of the year.
	   The insurance company said the purchase complements its strategy
of beefing up its presence in managed savings, and will improve its
position as a global operator in financial and insurance services.
	   The company bought Fiat's financial services arm, Prime, in
1996.
	   The new UBS, with dlrs 627 billion in assets, now the world's
second largest behind Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, started
trading Monday. It is the product of the merger of Swiss Bank Corp.
and Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   Switzerland's antitrust watchdog in May conditionally approved
the merger, which cleared its final hurdle of approval by the U.S.
Federal Reserve in June.
	   UBS must, if possible, sell by next March some 25 bank branches
as a package to one single buyer interested in establishing itself
as a Swiss retail bank, the regulators said.

economic globalization and an epidemic of modernization, citizens
and lovers of the world's small islands on Wednesday began a
discussion on their future in the third millennium.
	   ``Islands have become a prime destination of continentals, but
for how long will islands retain their qualification as paradise?''
said Mauritian Prem Saddul, chairman and secretary-general of the
Islands V conference on this small island in the western Indian
Ocean.
	   About 100 people, some of whom traveled more than halfway around
the world _ from other islands _ are taking part in four days of
seminars, discussions and networking under the auspices of the
International Small Islands Studies Association _ a laid-back group
of ``scholars, researchers and other interested persons ...
concerned with small islands.''
	   Grant McCall, a professor of social anthropology from the
University of New South Wales in Australia, has coined his own
science of ``nissology'' or ``the study of islanders on their own
terms.''
	   Peter Meincke of Canada's University of Prince Edward Island is
working on an Island Web Consortium to allow citizens of the
Caribbean, Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Pacific islands to exchange
information that could be vital to their survival.
	   And Chris McMurray of the Australian National University is
concerned about what she calls ``the epidemic of modernization''
that is sweeping small islands, particularly in the South Pacific _
malls, fast food chains and satellite television that are
overwhelming local cultures.
	   Not all islands under examination at ``Small Islands in the
Third Millennium: Problems and Prospects of Island Living'' are
states, although 32 of the world's 49 independent nations with
populations of less than 1.5 million are islands.
	   Some like Martinique, the Falklands, Jersey, Reunion and New
Caledonia are overseas territories or integral parts of other
countries.
	   What are the limits of a small island? Population is more a
determining factor than size, according to economist Mark Hampton
of the University of Portsmouth in England. Greenland, though
comparatively large, has a tiny population that depends on coastal
resources for survival.
	   Opening-day speakers from Mauritian President Cassam Uteem to
Vima Rama-Bidesi, a marine affairs specialist at the University of
the South Pacific in Fiji, agreed that greater regional cooperation
is the only way small, scattered islands can face the onslaught of
economic globalization, educate their citizens to compete in the
21st century and preserve their special environments.
	   Such fora already exist in greater or lesser degrees of
efficiency in the South Pacific, the western Indian Ocean and the
Caribbean.
	   Theo Hills, current president of the ISISA executive committee
and professor of geography at Montreal's McGill University, has
great hopes for the ``No Golf Movement'' that has taken root in
Japan.
	   ``They have been reasonably successful in stemming the tide of
golf courses and alerted a lot of people in the Pacific Islands''
to the threat of widespread construction of golf courses on small
islands where the interests of citizens often take a back seat to
those of golfers, he said.
	   At the close of the conference, participants hope to come up
with a declaration that would commit small islands to a future of
sustainable development.

Russian soldier sentenced to death for killing six comrades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A military court sentenced a soldier to death
Wednesday for killing six people, including his commanding officer,
a news agency reported.
	   Sergei Lepnyov, a cadet in Russia's northern Caucasus, was found
guilty of killing his captain and five other cadets on March 8 last
year.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has imposed a moratorium on executions,
and although courts continue to hand down death sentences, the
country has not carried out the sentences since 1996.
	   Russia promised to abolish the death penalty when it joined the
Council of Europe. But hard-liners in the Russian parliament have
blocked Yeltsin's efforts to outlaw the practice, arguing that the
death penalty is needed to keep soaring crime under control.

Gift-wrapped explosives planted at Cambodian rally, party says

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. envoy alleging four political murders in
past six weeks, grafs 5-7. Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Six gift-wrapped packages filled
with explosives were planted at an opposition party campaign rally
attended by 1,000 people but were detected before they could
explode, the party said Wednesday.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, one of two chief opposition groups
contesting the July 26 polls, accused Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
and his ruling Cambodian People's Party of terrorizing opponents.
	   ``It's a campaign of intimidation and everybody knows it,'' said
Eng Chhay Eang, party leader Sam Rainsy's chief of staff. ``The
threats and violence all come from one side, Hun Sen's
organization.''
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a political
demonstration led by Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's harshest critics.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 injured.
	   Separately, Thomas Hammarberg, the top U.N. human rights envoy
to Cambodia, released a report saying that at least four killings
in the past six weeks appeared to have ``political aspects.''
	   Hammarberg urged political parties ``to prevent any tendency
toward intimidation or incitement to violence.''
	   More than 140 allegations of political intimidation or violence
have been received by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights
since mid-May and are being investigated, the report said.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party said in a statement that about 1,000
supporters had gathered Tuesday in front of party headquarters in
Battambang, the country's second-largest city, to start a parade.
	   Four men came through the crowd carrying parcels wrapped up like
cakes in silver paper, the party said. They tossed the parcels to
members on a car and tractor joining the parade as if they were
gifts, invited people to open them when hungry, and left.
	   ``Everyone was surprised when they opened them up,'' said Lon
Phon, the party's main candidate in Battambang.
	   Inside were five explosive devices, apparently a type of land
mine, the statement said. The parcels were quickly removed from the
scene.
	   Local human rights workers confirmed the parcels held
explosives. Police, however, said they had not yet been informed
about the case.
	   ``If we can prove it, the act is clearly one of political
intimidation,'' said Ham Monny, a member of the provincial election
commission.
	   The opposition, human rights and watchdog groups have accused
Hun Sen of using murder and intimidation to make sure he wins the
election.
	   Sam Rainsy was not in the country. In last year's attack, widely
blamed on Hun Sen, he was slightly injured. A bodyguard who
shielded him from a blast was killed.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost when he deposed his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last year.
	   Earlier, election organizers issued an urgent appeal to the
international community for additional funds and observers.
	   Only 500 foreign observers are slated to be in the country by
election day, though the Cambodians want one for each of the 1,700
counting centers.
	   Cambodia has been promised more than dlrs 11 million in election
aid from the European Union, a similar amount from Japan and almost
dlrs 3 million from the United States.
	   The United States, which has serious doubts about the
government's ability to conduct a fair election, is providing the
money solely to private groups.

Sacked Philippine pilots, workers seek Estrada's help to recover

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of dismissed Philippine
Airlines pilots and ground personnel demonstrated near the
presidential palace Wednesday, urging new President Joseph Estrada
to intervene in the airline's labor disputes and help them recover
their jobs.
	   Carrying a black coffin marked ``job security,'' the
demonstrators delivered the first labor protest at the doorstep of
Estrada, who was inaugurated Tuesday as the country's 13th
president.
	   ``The PAL labor dispute is a test case for Estrada,'' said
Alexander Barrientos, president of the airline's ground personnel.
``This will show which side he is on.''
	   Leaders of three PAL unions representing pilots, flight
attendants and ground workers were allowed by police to enter
Malacanang palace and deliver a letter seeking Estrada's help to an
official.
	   Estrada was out of the palace during the rally. In his inaugural
address Tuesday, the former movie star pledged to narrow the gap
between the rich and the poor during his six-year term.
	   PAL's current labor troubles began when its more than 600 pilots
staged a devastating 22-day strike starting June 5, aggravating
financial losses arising from Asia's currency storm and scuttling
an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a labor
department order to return to work by June 9. The union was
protesting an airline plan to retire some pilots with 20 years of
service or 20,000 flight hours, which is allowed under a collective
bargaining agreement.
	   The pilots ended their strike Friday, arguing that their lawyer
had received the order only the previous day. They tried to return
to work but were rejected by the airline, which said they would be
accepted back only if they reapplied as new applicants.
	   Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the pilots' union, said about
90 pilots have complied with management's condition.
	   The pilots' union accused the airline of shutting them out in an
illegal lockout and also sought to prevent PAL from hiring
replacements, including Indonesian and Malaysian pilots.
	   The strike worsened the financial woes of Asia's oldest airline,
bringing it to the brink of closure. Airline officials say the
company lost more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in revenue
because of the strike.
	   At the height of the walkout, the airline laid off 5,000 of its
more than 13,000 workers to scale down its operations and stave off
more losses, causing the airline's flight attendants and ground
personnel to threaten to strike as well.
	   PAL said more employees may be laid off under an airline
rehabilitation plan that calls for a leaner work force, disposal of
40 out of 54 planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its
routes and sale of some subsidiaries. PAL says it now needs only
200 pilots.
	   In earlier comments on PAL's labor woes, Estrada said he
preferred that the government keep its hands off the airline, owned
by a close friend, business tycoon Lucio Tan.
	   Estrada opposes a government bailout of PAL as well, saying the
government is short of cash.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter caught fire and crashed in
Siberia shortly after takeoff Wednesday morning, killing three
people, including one Canadian and one Lebanese, officials said.
	   The Mi-8 helicopter, which was carrying 16 people _ including
several employees of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development _ crashed near the city of Ulan-Ude in southern
Siberia, not far from the border with Mongolia, EBRD spokesman Ben
Atkins said in a telephone interview from London.
	   The helicopter belonged to an civilian company and was making a
flight on a gold-prospecting mission for a private company, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The helicopter caught fire and crashed shortly after takeoff,
the reports said.
	   Head of the local aircraft factory Anatoly Abashev said the
pilot reported losing control of the helicopter, ITAR-Tass said.
Witnesses saw the craft shaking violently after it lifted only a
few meters (yards) from the ground, the report added.
	   One of the dead was a Randa Smine, a Lebanese staffer with the
EBRD, Atkins said. Also killed was Canadian Colin Chapman and a
Russian citizen, news reports said.
	   ``We are shocked and saddened by this morning's event,'' Atkins
told The Associated Press.
	   The 13 survivors suffered injuries and were receiving treatment,
ITAR-Tass said. Those seriously hurt included Canadians David
Mojeur, 52, and Elizabeth Martin, 42, the report said.

Kinkel says NATO intervention in Kosovo wouldn't be immediate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Wednesday that Kosovo Albanians shouldn't expect immediate
NATO intervention in their separatist province.
	   Kinkel said no mandate was in sight from the U.N. Security
Council for such an intervention, because council members Russia
and China oppose the move. Kinkel also said that if Western nations
intervene in Kosovo without at least securing the support of
Russia, it would damage Russia's efforts to mediate in the Kosovo
conflict.
	   ``Therefore, one shouldn't awake illusory expectations in the
Kosovo Albanians that NATO will intervene tomorrow,'' Kinkel said
on Deutschlandfunk radio. He didn't want to speculate about whether
an intervention was ``a question of weeks or months.''
	   The Kosovo Albanians have appealed for NATO intervention to end
attacks by Serb forces in their separatist province.
	   Key NATO members, including the United States, have said the
Security Council's blessing is not needed for NATO intervention,
but other allies, including Russia, disagree.
	   Germany has not spoken with one voice on the issue: Kinkel says
he supports a U.N. mandate before any intervention, but Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe has said that consensus among NATO nations
would be enough for an intervention.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.

Anwar sees allegations in book as part of `conspiracy'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
on Wednesday denied allegations in a book about him, saying they
were part of a ``conspiracy to tarnish my image.''
	   ``You name every single sin you can think of and it has been
attributed to me,'' Anwar Ibrahim told reporters.
	   The book ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be Prime Minister'' came
out on the eve of the annual general assembly of the ruling United
Malays National Organization last month.
	   It contained allegations including illicit sex, bribery and even
attempts to undermine the country's leadership, Anwar said. He
threatened to ``teach the authors a lesson.''
	   ``I think this is a conspiracy to tarnish my image. I want to
put a stop to this. ... These are serious fabrications.''
	   Anwar, who is also finance minister, did not say whom he
suspected of being behind the conspiracy.
	   The book was authored by Khalid Jafri, a former editor of a
defunct tabloid newspaper, and published by Media Pulau Lagenda.
	   Anwar obtained a court injunction barring distribution of the
book. He said Wednesday that police action could also be taken
against the authors.
	   Anwar is Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's anointed successor,
but the two have lately been at odds over how to revive the
country's economy.
	   He has often been a victim of privately circulated ``poison
pen'' letters alleging abuse of power and sexual misconduct. A book
was also published last year, titled ``Anwar Trapped,'' about
alleged sex scandals involving him.

Arafat calls for international help to stop Jerusalem plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Warning that his patience is running
out, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that Israel's
new plan for tightening its hold over disputed Jerusalem could dash
the last hopes for Mideast peace.
	   The Palestinians will use all means to defend the city, Arafat
told the Palestinian legislature. ``The battle for Jerusalem is a
battle of life and death for the Palestinian people,'' Arafat said,
wagging his finger from time to time to make a point.
	   ``This (Israeli) settlement aggression is a total destruction of
the peace process,'' Arafat told the legislators.
	   Arafat demanded that Arab countries convene a summit on the
future of the city that is home to the third-holiest shrine of
Islam. He also urged the U.N. Security Council, which began debate
on the Jerusalem plan Tuesday, to condemn Israel. The council has
shelved the matter indefinitely without a vote.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the Palestinians sent a message to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, asking him not to veto a Security Council
condemnation of Israel, said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Erekat said a U.S. veto would raise questions about Washington's
role as mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. ``If this
(a veto) should happen, then we can no longer say that the United
States is the co-sponsor'' of the peace process, Erekat said.
	   The Israeli plan, introduced last month, would expand the city's
boundaries westward, into Israel proper, to increase the Jewish
population. It would also extend Jerusalem's municipal authority to
nearby Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. The
future of the city of 420,000 Jews and 180,000 Palestinians is to
be determined during negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   However, Netanyahu reiterated earlier this week that he would
never compromise on Jerusalem and that his government would
continue building neighborhoods for Jews in the eastern sector.
	   In his speech Wednesday, Arafat said the Palestinians would
never settle for Israeli control over all of the city.
	   ``The patience of the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian
people has run out,'' Arafat said. ``Let Netanyahu and his
government know that Jerusalem is a red line, and that there is not
one person among us who would make concessions on any grain of soil
of Jerusalem.''

category codes:
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Praising the ``ingenuity and energy'' of
China's cosmopolitan center of capitalism, U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged his communist hosts Wednesday to open markets, battle
corruption and clean up the environment. Clinton expressed regret
that his long China trip hasn't brought strong agreements needed
for China's admission to the World Trade Organization. ``I'm
disappointed that we didn't make more progress on this issue, but
we'll keep working at it until we reach a commercially viable
agreement,'' he said. ``For China, as for America, the promise for
the future lies in helping our citizens to master the challenges of
the global economy, not to deny them or run away from them,''
Clinton told China-based American business leaders before touring
Shanghai's gleaming new stock market. (CLINTON CHINA)
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Outgunned and outnumbered, Kosovo
Albanian rebel fighters insist they eventually will control Kosovo
even if they lose many more battles. The fight for a coal mine and
villages near Belacevac proved both points: the Albanians'
inability to hold territory against superior Serb firepower and
their ability to melt away to fight another day. Rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army strike suddenly, have intimate knowledge of
the rugged local terrain, enjoy popular support and are unwavering
in their will to prevail. With those qualities, the rebels claim
they will overwhelm powerful Serbian forces. ``We have the
people,'' Abi Beleim Berisha, a local KLA commander west of the
capital Pristina, said Tuesday. ``We are fighting for our
homeland.'' (KOSOVO DETERMINED REBELS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After questioning each other's competence and
quarreling over Mideast peacemaking, Israel's president and prime
minister met Wednesday and agreed to stop trading blame in public.
However, there was no indication that President Ezer Weizman and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu settled their differences during
the 70-minute meeting at the president's residence. The
high-profile confrontation began Monday when Weizman blamed
Netanyahu for the deadlock in the peace talks with the Palestinians
and said it was time to call early elections. (ISRAEL PALESTINIANS)

	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ Admirers of Princess Diana, many
bearing armloads of lilies, passed through the imposing stone gates
of her ancestral home on Wednesday to pay their respects near her
gravesite and to see the mementos of a life that ended dramatically
nearly a year ago. On the day that would have been her 37th
birthday, they went to see the schoolgirl's letters, the stunning
silk dress of the bride setting out on an ill-fated royal marriage,
and the celebrity princess' high-fashion outfits. All are exhibits
in a new museum built by Diana's brother, Earl Spencer at the
Althorp estate in rural Northamptonshire and open to 150,000 paying
visitors for the next two months. (BRITAIN DIANA'S GRAVE)

Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed higher across the
board Wednesday, with share prices soaring in Seoul and Tokyo on
the strength of the Japanese currency. The U.S. dollar tumbled
against the yen on a report that the Japanese government will cut
taxes to bolster the economy. It was quoted at 138.24 yen in late
afternoon, down 1.71 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its
late New York rate of 139.16 yen overnight. Shares on the Seoul
Stock Exchange surged on the back of the stronger yen, with the key
Korea Composite Stock Price Index rising 17.68 points, or 5.6
percent, to close at 315.20. Traders said comments by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin that South Korea appears to be moving in the
right direction with its economic reforms also boosted the South
Korean market. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Russia's
faltering economy was once again shrinking and he pleaded with
parliament Wednesday to swiftly approve an austerity package aimed
at halting a worsening financial crisis. Kiriyenko outlined the
government's recovery plan in a speech to parliament Wednesday
morning, but the Communists who dominate the legislature have not
yet indicated whether they will pass the measures. ``To delay the
decision is also a decision in itself, the consequences of which
are very serious,'' Kiriyenko said. The Russian economy grew by a
modest 0.8 percent last year, its first sign of growth in almost a
decade. But it has declined 0.2 percent in the first five months of
this year and the country is facing a worsening financial crisis,
the premier said. (RUSSIA ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean automakers will cut
production in half later this year and lay off 16,000 workers, an
industry group predicted Wednesday. The forecast by the Korean
Automakers' Association came in tandem with rising threats by auto
workers to call an industry-wide strike later this month to protest
spreading layoffs. Sharp drops in domestic sales have left Hyundai,
Daewoo and other car makers with huge inventories of unsold cars
and thousands of redundant workers. ``It has become inevitable to
cut operation hours and reduce work forces in the country's auto
plants,'' said the association, a lobby group representing the
country's major auto companies. (SKOREA CARMAKERS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen shares jumped Wednesday
after a report said the carmaker was in talks with Swedish
automotive group Volvo about a possible link-up. Volvo says its
chief, Leif Johansson, met with Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech
last Friday in Goteborg, Sweden, but has refused to comment
further. Volkswagen declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal
Europe, in Wednesday editions, quoted unidentified sources as
saying the two companies were in preliminary talks on a business
cooperation that could eventually lead to a merger. (GERMANY VW

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai rice millers, irate over a
government ban on foreign workers, say they will shut down 400
mills beginning Thursday. Kriengsak Tapananond, a member of the
Thai Rice Mills Association, said Wednesday that the mills will
remain closed until the government solves the problem of how to
replace the 20,000 foreign workers who will be lost to the
industry. The original plan called for all foreign workers to leave
their jobs by May 1. The deadline was extended to July 10 following
a meeting between rice mill operators and the government. Efforts
to recruit Thais to fill the jobs have been an almost total
failure. Many of the handful of Thais who have signed up at job
fairs have quit after just a few days of the grueling, low-pay
labor, which includes lifting 100-kilogram (220-pound) sacks.

Army: 59 of the Jewish settlements not vital for security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army caused a furor in parliament
when it presented a map of Israel's security interests in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip that left out 59 of 159 Jewish settlements.
	   The map, submitted Tuesday to parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee, was a general indication of the army's thinking
on what land Israel could safely hand over to the Palestinians.
	   The settlements not considered vital to Israel's security were
in the center of the West Bank. The map envisions keeping about 50
percent of the West Bank under Israeli rule, including a
20-kilometer-wide (13 miles) buffer along the Jordanian border.
	   ``This map leaves graves threats to the strategic security of
the state of Israel,'' said committee chairman Uzi Landau, a
legislator from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party.
	   Landau is categorically opposed to handing over any land to the
Palestinians.
	   However, opposition legislators said the map undermined
Netanyahu's argument that Israel cannot safely hand 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians in an upcoming troop withdrawal,
as proposed by the United States.

Beer sponsor will withdraw ads for Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Beer maker Carlsberg said
Wednesday it was stripping its advertisements off buses and taxis
after the company was asked to cancel its sponsorship for the
Commonwealth Games.
	   The Malaysian government asked the Danish company last week to
terminate its contract with Sukom, the official organizing
committee of the games that start Sept. 11. The government said the
advertisements for liquor were not allowed in the predominantly
Muslim country.
	   Chin Voon Loong, a Carlsberg official, said in a statement that
the company had ended its agreement with its media operator, Citra
Benua, and would immediately withdraw advertisements from public
vehicles, the government news agency Bernama reported.
	   The agreement between Carlsberg and Sukom was signed in 1996.
	   Carlsberg, one of the main sponsors for the games, had
contributed 5 million ringgit (dlrs 1.3 million) to Sukom and spent
3 million ringgit (dlrs 750,000) on promotion.
	   Last week, Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, delivering a
message from the Cabinet, told Carlsberg: ``It would be in the best
interest of all parties'' for the company not to sponsor the games.
	   Although Malaysian liquor laws are liberal, the Islamic country
discourages Muslims from drinking in public.
	   The decision is sure to add to the financial woes of the
organizers, who are struggling to raise money for the games amid
Malaysia's worst economic crisis in a decade.

</HEADLINE>
development &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's Cabinet has outlined seven major
measures to boost economic development in the second half of the
year, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Wednesday.
	   They include promoting agriculture production and processing,
revamping state-owned enterprises, readjusting and attracting more
domestic and foreign investment, renovating the banking and
monetary systems and speeding up job creation.
	   The government also rescheduled investment for some
infrastructure projects. It cited poor management as among the
reasons for slower-than-forecast growth in gross domestic product,
which was 6.64 percent in the first six months, compared with 8.8
percent last year.
	   Low economic efficiency and competitiveness, damage from Typhoon
Linda and a recent drought, and the fallout from the Asian
financial crisis are also being blamed.
	   Speaking at a two-day meeting that concluded in Ho Chi Minh City
Tuesday, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai warned of new difficulties
and challenges, including possible flooding and the deepening
impact of the regional troubles.
	   Khai urged Cabinet members and local government officials to
improve their performance.
	   Khai has held numerous meetings with local and foreign investors
and local government leaders since taking office last September.
	   Entrepreneurs have praised Khai's new style of governance while
expressing frustration with the red tape and bureaucracy at the
level that policy is implemented.

U.S. Treasury head urges speed up of South Korean restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAULINE JELINEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
prodded South Korean conglomerate chiefs Wednesday to speed up
business reform as part of the nation's economic restructuring.
	   Seven months after South Korea negotiated a dlrs 58 billion
bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the giant
conglomerates, or chaebol, are still dragging their feet on
changing old, unsound business practices that helped push the
nation into last year's currency crisis.
	   Rubin told a news conference before meeting with the business
heads that he ``wanted to hear their commitment on reforming those
practices.''
	   ``We will certainly be discussing with the chaebol the
importance of getting on with restructuring ... as quickly as
possible,'' Rubin said.
	   Leaving the meeting an hour later, Rubin declined to comment on
the session. But an observer at the meeting said Rubin warned the
conglomerate chairmen that foreign investors will continue to hold
back badly needed capital until they are certain business will
reform.
	   South Korea's chaebol are huge business groups, some with as
many as 50 or more subsidiaries, that economists say overexpanded
and overdiversified during the nation's boom years on bad loans won
through collusion with government and bankers.
	   Conglomerates have agreed publicly that they need to restructure
themselves into leaner, more efficient operations, but have done
little to that end in the view of most analysts and investors.
	   The session was Rubin's final meeting in a four-country tour to
assess progress made since the Asian financial crisis began a year
ago on July 2 in Thailand and spread throughout the region. He also
stopped in China, Thailand and Malaysia.

Dalai Lama's group charges monks, nuns killed by Chinese prison
</HEADLINE>
guards &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Exiled Tibetans say a monk, four nuns
and another inmate were killed by Chinese guards during
independence demonstrations in their homeland's most notorious
prison last month.
	   The Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, an arm of the
Dalai Lama's government-in-exile, said in a statement this week
that it had received several reports of the deaths at Drapchi
prison on the outskirts of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa from people
who recently arrived in India.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Elizabeth Cossor, a spokeswoman for the center, said Wednesday
that it was not clear how many of the dead were political
prisoners. Buddhist monks and nuns remain loyal to the Dalai Lama,
their political and spiritual leader, and are often imprisoned for
their activities in the independence movement.
	   Chinese soldiers seized Tibet in 1950. After an abortive
uprising in 1959, the Dalai Lama led more than 100,000 Tibetans
into exile.
	   Cossor said the prison demonstrations were inspired in part by
word reaching Tibet of a hunger strike by exiles in India.
	   Among the dead was Karma Dawa, described by the center as a
``nonpolitical'' prisoner who threw pamphlets reading ``Free
Tibet'' into a crowd of prisoners gathered for a Chinese
flag-raising ceremony on May 1.
	   The center said the exact cause of Dawa's death was not clear,
but that other prisoners had feared he would be executed for
leading the demonstration.
	   Guards fired on the International Labor Day demonstration,
killing an imprisoned monk. A nun tortured during questioning about
the demonstration also died, the center said.
	   Four nuns were killed when guards fired on another demonstration
that erupted three days later, the center said.

Superstitious Estrada asks spiritual adviser to bless room where
</HEADLINE>
chandelier fell &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' superstitious new
president, Joseph Estrada, said Wednesday he has ordered holy water
to be sprinkled in a room in the presidential palace where a
chandelier fell during his first day in office.
	   Estrada told reporters he also has ordered the National Bureau
of Investigation and the commander of the Presidential Security
Group to investigate Tuesday's incident.
	   Estrada, who was sworn in at noon Tuesday, said he was leaving
the palace music room to induct new members of his Cabinet in the
afternoon when the chandelier dropped to the floor.
	   ``It's mysterious. It is very suspicious,'' said Estrada. ``God
took care of me.''
	   Estrada said he asked his spiritual adviser, Mike Velarde,
founder of the El Shaddai charismatic movement, to bless the music
room after the incident.
	   He said he will also ask for a blessing of the rest of the
palace later.
	   Estrada often jokes about reports the presidential palace is
haunted, and takes extra efforts to avoid being referred to as the
country's 13th president because of the bad luck associated with
the number.
	   During the campaign, he grew a goatee because he was told by a
feng shui expert it would bring him luck. He picked certain
locations for campaign appearances and rejected others because of
considerations of luck, and believes his ever-present wristband is
a good-luck charm.

Taiwanese officials sensitive to Clinton summit; public more
</HEADLINE>
relaxed &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, LEADS throughout with more reaction to Clinton's
statements &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ It was just a repetition of U.S. policy,
but President Bill Clinton's comments about Taiwan during his tour
of China landed hard on this island.
	   The policy is known in China as the ``three no's'' _ no
independence for Taiwan, no de facto independence, and no
membership in international organizations that require statehood.
	   It is a key element in the contentious relationship between the
mainland and the island where Nationalist forces landed in 1949
after losing the Chinese civil war to Communists. And there was
little understanding in Taiwan on Wednesday for why the leader of
Taiwan's great ally had to state U.S. policy in public.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Taiwan should not be
upset over a reiteration of longstanding policy.
	   Clinton didn't put the policy on paper, and he reaffirmed
Washington's commitment to help Taiwan defend itself.
	   Though lower-ranking officials have made exactly the same
remarks in the past, Clinton's statement on Tuesday in Shanghai
still appeared here to give U.S. policy added punch and slant it
toward the mainland.
	   Taiwan was left with the queasy feeling that it had come out on
the short end of Washington's policy debate over China. Many in
Taiwan assumed that Clinton's comments were pre-arranged to entice
China into better cooperation on a range of issues.
	   But James Soong, a powerful official of the governing
Nationalist Party, chided Clinton for what he said was presuming to
speak on behalf of Taiwan.
	   ``No one can use our 21 million people's interests as a
bargaining chip,'' Soong said after Wednesday's weekly meeting of
the Nationalist hierarchy. On Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry had
said that the United States and China ``have no right to discuss
Taiwan's affairs.''
	   Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China
in 1979, but maintains strong unofficial relations and is obliged
by law to ensure the island can defend itself.
	   Taiwan has a prosperous, capitalist economy and in the past
decade has turned itself into a free-wheeling democracy. But
hyper-sensitive to anything that smells like a concession to China,
Taiwan went into policy pandemonium after Clinton's statement.
	   An immediate survey by the TVBS television network showed
support dropping for both reunification and independence in favor
of the status quo, a circle-the-wagons mentality that usually
appears in times of crisis.
	   Legislators from the three main parties, many of whom had
traveled to Washington to lobby before Clinton's departure,
denounced the remarks, but differed on a response.
	   The warming relationship between Beijing and Washington may make
China more reasonable when it come to talking to Taiwan. However,
some observers warn that Washington's response may limit Taiwan's
room to maneuver.
	   Supporters of independence and the ruling Nationalists, who
support reunification sometime far in the future, said President
Lee Teng-hui's drive for a higher international profile and
membership in the United Nations must continue.
	   Groups that more strongly advocate reunification urged the
government to abandon policies provocative to China, and said
Taiwan should focus on domestic issues to avoid being ``sold out.''
	   Since tensions between the United States and China over Taiwan
nearly boiled over in 1996, Washington has sought to engage China
while leaving Taiwan on a shelf, columnist Yu Yu-lin wrote in the
China Times.
	   ``Going public with the `three nos' was a necessary choice given
the international climate and new U.S.-China relationship,'' Yu
wrote. ``Taiwan has played out its role, and must play a different
one in the next stage.''

Brawls break out after England-Argentina game

 &UR; EDS: RETRANSMITS to add Writethru indicator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Rival fans brawled in
Saint-Etienne's city center and train station into the early
morning hours Wednesday, after a World Cup match between England
and Argentina.
	   World Cup organizers said 36 people arrested were charged with
theft, public drunkenness, attacks on police or a lack of valid
identification documents.
	   Fans were escorted to separate trains for each nation after the
match and taken back to Paris, the World Cup organizers said.
Police closed off much of the town center, and trams and buses were
diverted to avoid further trouble.
	   Five French youths who were arrested during disturbances Monday
night were convicted and sentenced Tuesday to prison terms of eight
days to one year.
	   North African French youths have clashed with or attacked
English fans since an England-Tunisia match in Marseille on June
15, the first of several matches marred by street violence.
	   Authorities nearly doubled security forces to about 1,600 police
for the Tuesday evening match between England and Argentina.
Officials had expected new violence by local youths as well as fans
from the two visiting countries that fought a war over the Falkland
Islands in 1982.
	   French police aided by a British hooligan-spotter arrested an
English suspect in Saint-Etienne on Monday.
	   The English suspect stepped off a train in this southeastern
town when a British officer identified the man as a ``category C''
soccer fan, considered among the most dangerous.
	   The officer alerted French police, who tried to check the
identity of the 25-year-old man. The suspect gave a policeman a
soccer-style headshot and was arrested, police said on customary
anonymity.
	   Authorities said the suspect was subject to expulsion or a quick
French court trial.
	   Since the World Cup began June 10, French police have arrested
more than 700 people, expelled more than a dozen fans, and turned
away more than 500 at the border. the Interior Ministry has said.
	   The Interior Ministry has tallied at least 3,200 injuries, most
of them slight. About 400 were hospitalized, including a policeman
in a coma who was attacked by German neo-Nazis in Lens.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Underscoring U.S. appeals for greater
religious freedom in China, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton today
toured a 78-year-old synagogue in Shanghai that was renovated with
Chinese money after years of official neglect.
	   The Ohel Rachel Synagogue, one of the last links to an era when
tens of thousands of Jews called Shanghai home, was used as a
warehouse until two months ago.
	   Mrs. Clinton toured the building for 20 minutes and witnessed
the donation of a Torah to Shanghai's Jewish community. She called
the restoration of the synagogue ``a very good example of respect
for religious differences and appreciation for the importance of
faith in one's life.''
	   But China's atheist government, which maintains strict controls
over religion, has not given permission for the building to be used
as a place of worship.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who accompanied Mrs.
Clinton to the synagogue, later met with Chinese spiritual leaders
to discuss religion, including Roman Catholic Bishop Alyosuis Jin
Luxian, 82, who spent 27 years in prison related to his work in the
church.
	   Albright told the leaders that ``America's interest in religion
and religious freedom does not grow out of some desire to interfere
in Chinese affairs or to favor one religion over others.''
	   ``Rather, it comes from our belief and our experience that
spiritual values are not Western or Eastern, capitalist or
socialist, but deeply human,'' Albright said.
	   The synagogue's restoration, costing more than dlrs 60,000, was
prompted by a promise from Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi to reopen it
as a historic site. Located on a narrow, traffic-filled street in
central Shanghai, the synagogue's stucco walls have been repainted
a crisp white, and its crystal chandeliers hang from an arched roof
over gleaming marble floors.
	   Xu made the promise to Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a member of a U.S.
religious delegation that visited China earlier this year and who
today showed Mrs. Clinton around the newly renovated temple.
	   Mrs. Clinton called the restoration an example of the Shanghai
government's willingness ``to honor the religious tradition and
history of the Jewish community in Shanghai.''
	   Schneier brought the Torah from Park East Synagogue in New York
City to donate to Shanghai's Jewish community, which traces its
roots in the city to the middle of the last century.
	   Mrs. Clinton looked at a photographic exhibition detailing the
long history of the Jewish community in Shanghai and the city's
role as a haven for some 20,000 Jews who sought refuge here from
Hitler's Germany. By the end of World War II, during which Japanese
soldiers used the synagogue as a stable, the Jewish population had
reached an estimated 24,000.
	   The synagogue, built in 1920, last held worshipers in 1952,
three years after the Communist government seized power. It was
then turned over to a government education commission.

HBO offers Holyfield dlrs 20 million for unification fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Home Box Office television network has offered
Evander Holyfield dlrs 20 million to fight Lennox Lewis to unify
the world heavyweight boxing titles.
	   HBO spokesman Seth Abraham said Holyfield had asked for dlrs 20
million for the fight and now he had no reason not to take it.
	   ``The only reason this fight will not go ahead is if Evander
Holyfield does not want it,'' Abraham said when he announced the
offer in London on Wednesday.
	   Abraham said Holyfield's contractural obligations with his
promoter Don King and the Showtime network did not prevent him from
fighting Lewis.
	   ``I believe he wants this fight. It's what everyone
wants...except Don King. King is the only obstacle to this fight,''
he said.
	   ``What we want to see is the reunification - this would be the
only unified crown in world boxing.''
	   ``Evander's record of accomplishment would be spoiled without a
fight against the only man who is his true peer today _ his equal
in the heavyweight ranks,'' he added.
	   Abraham said the venue _ either of two venues on the US eastern
coast _ the date, either Dec. 5 or Dec. 12, and the purse can be
guaranteed.
	   The promoters are billing the bout as the fight fans have been
waiting to see since 1992, when Riddick Bowe trashed the WBC title
belt after failing to fight Lewis _ then a challenger.
	   Lewis is expected to earn dlrs 10 million if Holyfield agrees to
put his WBA and IBF world title belts on the line for the
unification prize fight.
	   HBO also announced Wednesday it had completed a seven fight deal
with Lewis, commencing with his fight against Zeljko Mavrovic in
September.
	   Lewis' second scheduled fight in the new deal is the proposed
unification fight in December. He will fight at least two fights on
the HBO network per year until 2000.
	   HBO senior vice president Lou DiBella said Lewis' contract was
the most lucrative HBO had signed with any current boxer, including
Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones Jr and Prince Naseem Hamed.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo Wednesday, trying to keep Serb security
forces from recapturing more territory in the secessionist
province.
	   After Serb forces took back a strategic coal mine region from
the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday, the Albanians moved west to
the Drenica region, police said Wednesday.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, which is dominated by Serbia, could
erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement of the Kosovo conflict. A U.S. envoy said Tuesday that
the ethnic Albanian rebels have no clear military chain of command
to negotiate a cease-fire.
	   Serb forces recaptured the Belacevac mine region after two days
of nearly nonstop fighting in the village. The mine is
strategically important because it supplies coal to the nearby
Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most of Kosovo
as well as to Macedonia and northern Greece.
	   KLA rebels, meanwhile, attacked the Serb village of Drsnik,
killing a 26-year-old villager, Tanjug state news agency said. The
shooting lasted for several hours Tuesday before the KLA withdrew,
it said.
	   Serb media have suggested the other goal of this week's
offensive was to break a 2-week-old standoff at the village of
Kijevo. But no fighting was reported there Wednesday.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, the village has been a flashpoint since the KLA
surrounded it earlier this month and cut off its Serb inhabitants
and police. Serb checkpoints surround the KLA fighters.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. official acknowledged that the
Clinton administration was continuing to hold private talks with
leaders of the political wing of the KLA, who were said to have
responded positively to U.S. conditions for negotiations.

Princess Diana's family home opens for visitors to see her

<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ Admirers of Princess Diana, many
bearing armloads of lilies, passed through the imposing stone gates
of her ancestral home on Wednesday to pay their respects near her
gravesite and to see mementoes of a life that ended dramatically
nearly a year ago.
	   On the day that would have been her 37th birthday, they went to
see the schoolgirl's letters, the stunning silk dress of the bride
setting out on an ill-fated royal marriage, and the celebrity
princess' high-fashion outfits.
	   All are exhibits in a new museum built by Diana's brother, Earl
Spencer at the Althorp estate in rural Northamptonshire and open to
paying visitors for the next two months .
	   The international press massed outside the gates, while the
visitors filed in an orderly fashion into the estate. Daily
visitors are limited to 2,500 people with pre-purchased tickets.
	   Iwona Skibinski, 31, and her husband drove from Duesseldorf,
Germany just to visit Althorp.
	   ``It wasn't just that she was a beautifully dressed woman, but a
person who was very socially engaging. And she did so many good
works _ such as her anti-land mines campaign, and caring for
children all over the world. And that really touched me ,'' Mrs.
Skibinski said.
	   But for many, the point of the visit is the ornamental lake and
the island where Diana was buried in a private family ceremony
after her death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash. They cannot visit the
gravesite but can view the island from the water's edge.
	   ``We just wanted to pay our respects really,'' said Emma Gore,
18, who had gone to London for Diana's funeral. ``The whole thing
is beautiful, it is really lovely. Very tranquil.''
	   She and her husband Shaun, 30, laid a bunch of chrysanthemums on
the lawn in front of the lakeside classical temple that is a
memorial to the princess.
	   Earl Spencer mingled with the first visitors to the museum and
many asked to have photographs taken with him.
	   ``I hope you find this appropriate,'' said the earl, who has
been accused by some of cashing in on his sister's death.
	   Spencer has sold nearly 150,000 tickets _ called ``invitations
to visit'' _ at prices ranging from 5 pounds (dlrs 8) for children
to 7.50 pounds (dlrs 12) for senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs
15) for adults. He says profits will go to charity.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associated with Diana, ``but not
cheapening her memory in any way,'' the estate says.
	   Janet Lawrie, 43, among the first to complete the tour,
thoroughly approved.
	   ``It is very very beautiful, very very nice,'' Ms. Lawrie said.
``I don't think it could have been done any better. It is really
nice. Very tasteful.''
	   ``People were very quiet in there. It was very moving. ... I
know I for one had tears in my eyes.''
	   Lawrence Down, 44, agreed.
	   ``I cannot understand why the earl has been criticized. It is
very tasteful and well worth the entrance fee. I would recommend
anyone to come and see this. And I would come again,'' Down said.

Army: 59 of the Jewish settlements not vital for security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army caused a furor in parliament
when it presented a map of Israel's security interests in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip that left out 59 of 159 Jewish settlements.
	   The map, submitted Tuesday to parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee, was a general indication of the army's thinking
on what land Israel could safely hand over to the Palestinians.
	   The settlements not considered vital to Israel's security were
in the center of the West Bank. The map envisions keeping about 50
percent of the West Bank under Israeli rule, including a
20-kilometer-wide (13 miles) buffer along the Jordanian border.
	   ``This map leaves graves threats to the strategic security of
the state of Israel,'' said committee chairman Uzi Landau, a
legislator from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party.
	   Landau is categorically opposed to handing over any land to the
Palestinians.
	   However, opposition legislators said the map undermined
Netanyahu's argument that Israel cannot safely hand 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians in an upcoming troop withdrawal,
as proposed by the United States.

Details of Russia's stabilization package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Here are some of the key points from Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's speech to parliament Wednesday, when he
outlined the government's economic stabilization plan:
	   _ Russia's gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent during the
first five months of this year and prospects for growth at present
are not good.
	   _ The government currently collects 21 billion rubles (dlrs 3.4
billion) in taxes every month, but needs 25 billion rubles (dlrs
4.0 billion) to meet its commitments.
	   _ To cut down on bootleg alcohol industry, Kiriyenko called for
tougher controls on alcohol production and sales designed to bring
increased tax revenues.
	   _ Gas and electricity tariffs on producers will be cut by 50
percent, and the burden for payment will be shifted to consumers,
who currently pay very little for utilities.
	   _ The government wants to simplify the complicated tax system
and reduce the number of tax brackets from six to three. The top
tax rate would be lowered from 35 to 30 percent for both
individuals and companies.
	   _ Government debt continues to grow, and Moscow now spends 36.2
percent of the entire federal budget on servicing debt.

Russian prime minister says financial crisis demands urgent action
</HEADLINE>

parliament may pass some of the measures. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Russia's
faltering economy was once again shrinking and he pleaded with
parliament Wednesday to swiftly approve an austerity package aimed
at halting a worsening financial crisis.
	   Kiriyenko outlined the government's recovery plan in a speech to
parliament Wednesday morning, but the Communists who dominate the
legislature said they were inclined to support only some of the
measures.
	   ``To delay the decision is also a decision in itself, the
consequences of which are very serious,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   The Russian economy grew by a modest 0.8 percent last year, its
first sign of growth in almost a decade. But it has declined 0.2
percent in the first five months of this year, the premier said.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov accused the administration of
causing the crisis, and said the only solution was to oust the
government.
	   The Russian stock market has lost half its value this year,
foreign investors have been fleeing, and the government is short of
cash due to its inability to collect taxes and a drop in revenues
from oil exports.
	   Russia is seeking a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from
the International Monetary Fund to help stabilize its economy, but
Kiriyenko said any aid must be accompanied by financial reforms.
	   ``To simply take an IMF (loan) and not carry out a stabilization
program is senseless,'' he said. ``We'll have the same problems
within four to five months, only worse.''
	   So far, the crisis has been limited largely to Russia's
financial markets.
	   But the government's big fear is that the ruble will be
devalued, causing prices to rise and inflicting more economic pain
on hard-pressed Russians.
	   The government is proposing a package of 26 measures aimed
largely at cutting the budget and improving tax collection. The
government hopes the package will restore confidence to the markets
and convince the IMF to approve a new loan.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their pay months late due to
the government's chronic cash shortage, caused in large part by its
inability to collect taxes.
	   Communists in parliament have consistently opposed spending
cuts, arguing that the government should spend more to help
struggling individuals and industries.
	   Responding to Kiriyenko, Zyuganov said his party is likely to
support only a portion of the government's proposals, those that
lower tax rates and assist industry.
	   Russian lawmakers said some of the government's measures were
likely to get preliminary approval before the legislature begins
its summer recess on Friday.
	   But the legislature is likely to oppose some of the proposals,
and a final decision is not expected before a special session in
mid-July.

More autonomy in Kosovo needed, Italian minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Italy's foreign minister on Wednesday
said the only way to solve the crisis in Kosovo was to grant the
troubled region more autonomy, but he warned outright independence
could spark a war.
	   ``Serious autonomy is the only solution to the crisis as
independence could only lead to regional war,'' Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said at a news conference.
	   He reiterated his support for Romania and Slovenia joining NATO
in the next round of invitations ``not just for traditional
friendship but also from a strategic point of view,'' he said.
	   Regarding Romania's efforts to implement a market economy, Dini
said small and medium-sized businesses, the key to Italy's
prosperity, should be encouraged.
	   Dini was on a two-day visit to Bucharest, where he met Romanian
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu and was also to hold talks with Prime
Minister Radu Vasile.
	   Romania sees Italy as an old friend and both countries share a
Latin-based language.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Italy's foreign minister on Wednesday
said the only way to solve the crisis in Kosovo was to grant the
troubled region more autonomy, but he warned outright independence
could spark a war.
	   ``Serious autonomy is the only solution to the crisis as
independence could only lead to regional war,'' Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said at a news conference.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians seeking
independence from Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes up
Yugoslavia, has escalated since March. International diplomats
worry the fighting could spill over into the whole of the region.
	   Dini also reiterated his support for Romania and Slovenia
joining NATO in the next round of invitations ``not just for
traditional friendship but also from a strategic point of view,''
he said.
	   Regarding Romania's efforts to implement a market economy, Dini
said small and medium-sized businesses, the key to Italy's
prosperity, should be encouraged.
	   Dini was on a two-day visit to Bucharest, where he met Romanian
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu and was also to hold talks with Prime
Minister Radu Vasile.
	   Romania sees Italy as an old friend and both countries share a
Latin-based language.

England soccer team praised for bravery after World Cup defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One fan took it out on the TV set, and several
hundred others in dozens of towns and cities across England took to
the streets, smashing shop windows and fighting after England's
World Cup soccer dream collapsed.
	   Newspapers hailed England's team as heroes, battling with one
player short most of the time to hold Argentina to a draw _ only to
lose Tuesday night in St. Etienne, France, in a nail-biting 4-3
penalty shoot-out.
	   Police reported 45 arrests, mainly in southern England towns, as
shocked fans poured out of pubs.
	   England coach Glen Hoddle commented that ``it's a football match
at the end of the day _ it's not a matter of life and death.'' But
that's not how many saw England's World Cup defeat on penalties for
the third time in eight years.
	   In the country with the worst record for soccer hooliganism, and
a stunning record for fervor, the English know a disaster when they
see one.
	   A Sky TV phone-in was flooded with callers, many blaming David
Beckham, an 8-million-pound (dlrs 13.3) a year star with a Spice
Girl for a fiancee. He got sent off for a retaliatory kick at an
Argentine player who fouled him.
	   ``Beckham has let the team, the fans out there and everyone
watching at home down,'' said Ian Hawkins, 37. ``He should never
play for England again.''
	   Hawkins was among hundreds of dejected fans, many still wearing
their England replica shirts, who arrived at London's Waterloo
station Wednesday morning, streaming off the English Channel tunnel
train from France.
	   In Poole, on the south England coast, a 29-year-old man smashed
the TV set in his pub, The Tatnum, after England missed the final
penalty. Dorset police said six people were arrested in separate
incidents in the county.
	   In Peterborough, near Cambridge, police armed with riot shields
used tear gas to break up a crowd of about 100 fans fighting and
shouting in the town's Cathedral Square. A policeman was hit in the
face during the fracas, the most serious of 20 incidents in the
town.
	   Police reported scattered disturbances in several other southern
counties, but said most fans were well-behaved.
	   The story of England's defeat was splashed over national
newspapers. ``Heroes,'' said The Express. ``So Cruel,'' declared
the mass-circulation Sun, while The Mirror announced, ``10 Heroic
Lions, One Stupid Boy.''
	   ``Outcha,'' said The Daily Star, playing on the notorious Sun
headline ``Gotcha'' when Britain sank an Argentine warship when the
countries went to war for real over the Falkland Islands colony in
1982. England won that one.
	   The upbeat note continued with an announcement by British
Airways that it was sending a Concorde supersonic jet to bring the
team home.
	   An estimated 28 million people watched the match on TV, causing
one of the biggest power surges ever recorded _ 2,100 megawatts,
said the National Grid, which operates the power lines.
	   ``The surge at half-time was equivalent to that reached in 1985
during an episode of `Dallas' when JR was shot,'' National Grid
spokesman Sean Regan said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who watched the game on
television in his Downing Street home with his children, praised
the team as epitomizing ``the English spirit at its very best.''
	   ``I think people do feel a sense of frustration because the team
had really come into its own,'' Blair said.
	   During the Wednesday morning rush-hour, there was little
sympathy for Beckham in Manchester, where the player is a star of
the Manchester United team.
	   ``He's supposed to be a professional. He's paid millions of
pounds a year and he goes and does something like that in an
important game,'' said draughtsman Gary Foden, 32, on his way to
work. ``It cost England the match. ''

Tajikistan's ex-rebels return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Another group of ex-rebel fighters in Tajikistan
has started on a trip home from neighboring Afghanistan on
Wednesday, a news report said.
	   Some 150 former rebel fighters will be disarmed and brought back
to Tajikistan under an agreement worked out by the National
Reconciliation Commission in the Central Asian nation, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The commission includes members of the hard-line government as
well as the former rebels.
	   Another 150 former rebels are waiting in Afghanistan's northern
provinces, near the border with Tajikistan, for their turn to come
home, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Sporadic clashes have continued in Tajikistan despite a peace
agreement signed by the government and the rebels last year.
	   But the government has given amnesty to some rebels and brought
others into the cabinet. An opposition newspaper that was shut down
during the war has reappeared, and several new papers have started
along with new political parties.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter caught fire and crashed in
Siberia shortly after takeoff Wednesday morning, killing three
people, including one Canadian and one Lebanese, officials said.
	   The Mi-8 helicopter, which was carrying 16 people _ including
several employees of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development _ crashed near the city of Ulan-Ude in southern
Siberia, not far from the border with Mongolia, EBRD spokesman Ben
Atkins said in a telephone interview from London.
	   The helicopter belonged to an civilian company and was making a
flight on a gold-prospecting mission for a private company, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The helicopter caught fire and crashed shortly after takeoff,
the reports said.
	   Head of the local aircraft factory Anatoly Abashev said the
pilot reported losing control of the helicopter, ITAR-Tass said.
Witnesses saw the craft shaking violently after it lifted only a
few meters (yards) from the ground, the report added.
	   One of the dead was a Randa Smine, a Lebanese staffer with the
EBRD, Atkins said. Also killed was Canadian Colin Chapman and a
Russian citizen, news reports said.
	   ``We are shocked and saddened by this morning's event,'' Atkins
told The Associated Press.
	   The 13 survivors suffered injuries and were receiving treatment,
ITAR-Tass said. Those seriously hurt included Canadians David
Mojeur, 52, and Elizabeth Martin, 42, the report said.

Prime minister wins support for Aboriginal land rights deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with both Aborigines and ranchers relatively pleased
with compromise; details of deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard struck a
deal with a key independent senator Wednesday to adopt a
long-delayed Aboriginal land rights law, winning praise from all
sides.
	   By reaching the compromise, Howard avoids having to dissolve
Parliament and call an early election to resolve the problem while
the polls show his popularity at an all-time low, at 34 percent.
	   The bill limits claims by Aborigines on access to the vast
tracts of lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and
miners _ some 42 percent of Australia's land mass.
	   Aboriginal access mainly consists of the right to cross the land
to hunt or seek water, to visit sacred sites, or to hold clan
gatherings.
	   The ranchers, farmers and miners say they can't manage their
businesses properly if the land is subject to Aboriginal access
claims.
	   Howard reached a final compromise Wednesday with independent
Sen. Brian Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the
narrowly divided Senate.
	   The key element of the compromise was that Aborigines lost a
federal right to negotiate land claims, but gained an equivalent
right under state laws that already gave farmers, ranchers and
miners a similar right.
	   ``This looks terribly like the right to negotiate ... under a
different guise,'' said Aboriginal activist Noel Pearson.
	   The government also dropped its demand that land claims be
phased out after six years.
	   Under the compromise, Aboriginal land holders and claimants will
have the right to be notified of proposed mining on their land and
to object to it.
	   Mining companies also would be required to consult with
Aborigines about ways of minimizing the impact of their operations.
	   There will be provision for mediation in case of disputes, and
matters can be arbitrated, where mediation fails.
	   Harradine was jubilant about the result: ``This outcome avoids a
race-based ... election which, I believe, would have posed a
serious threat to the fabric of Australian society.''
	   Australia's ranchers called the outcome the least risky course
available in the circumstances.
	   Minerals Council of Australia executive director Dick Wells
said, ``The amended act will allow the industry to get on with its
business in a way which respects the rights of others and continues
to generate wealth and jobs for all Australians.''
	   Western Australia and the Northern Territory had threatened to
oppose the deal, but were brought into line when guaranteed that
the federal government would compensate them for 75 percent of the
value of any lands they lose in the future under the new law.
	   Howard had been threatening to call an election on the issue
since Harradine blocked passage of the legislation in April, and
set July 4 as a deadline for the law to be passed.
	   The next election must be held by May 1999, but some analysts
said an August poll was likely if it was called early.
	   Compromise talks between Harradine and Howard were reopened
after the surprising success of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
in Queensland state elections June 13.
	   One Nation, which opposes special welfare payments to Aborigines
and Asian immigration, took 11 seats in the 89-member state
Parliament, many at the coalition's expense.
	   One Nation wants to abolish native title.
	   The government introduced the so-called 10-point native title
plan to spell out the exact extent of a 1996 High Court ruling
recognizing Aborigines' right to lay non-exclusive claim to
government-held land leased to farmers and miners.

	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish troops have killed 41 Kurdish
rebels in clashes in the southeast, officials said here Wednesday.
	   Thirty-five of the guerrillas were killed in the province of
Hakkari, where the borders of Turkey, Iraq and Iran converge.
	   Three soldiers were also killed in the shootout, the Anatolia
news agency said.
	   It was not clear when the clashes took place. The report could
not be verified independently.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, has been fighting to create an
autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey's southeast since 1984. Some
37,000 people have died in the conflict.

Police find child amid squalor in an attic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Unable to walk or talk, a scrawny
little girl kept inside her home since her birth nearly four years
ago was discovered by police tucked away in an attic amid rotting
garbage.
	   ``There was garbage, flies, mosquitoes, a little bed, and the
child was sleeping in it,'' Hague police spokeswoman Henriette de
Wilde said Wednesday.
	   The child can neither walk nor speak and has the abilities of a
2-year-old despite being almost 4, apparently due to the effects of
her long isolation and neglect.
	   Her 37-year-old mother told police the girl had never been
outside.
	   She was hospitalized for malnutrition Monday after she was found
living in the squalor. Police were called to the apartment building
in this western Dutch city after a housing inspector making a
routine check said the mother refused to open her door.
	   Neighbors had complained of a stench in the past but had never
alerted authorities.
	   The mother had apparently severed all ties with her family, said
De Wilde. There was no information about the child's father.
	   Police have launched an investigation, but the mother has not
been charged with any crime.
	   The girl was placed under the supervision of a local child
protection agency, while the mother underwent psychiatric
evaluation. Their names were not released in line with Dutch police
practice.
	   The fate of the child will be determined by a judge after
authorities complete their investigation.

Rice millers threaten stoppage over foreign worker ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Thai export figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai rice millers, irate over a
government ban on foreign workers, say they will shut down 400
mills beginning Thursday.
	   Kriengsak Tapananond, a member of the Thai Rice Mills
Association, said Wednesday that the mills will remain closed until
the government solves the problem of how to replace the 20,000
foreign workers who will be lost to the industry.
	   A stoppage would affect rice exporters, whose shipments in this
year's first half grew by 40.2 percent from January-June last year.
	   The exports totaled 3,289,825 metric tons, compared with
2,345,478 tons in last year's first half, said an official of the
Commerce Ministry's Department of Foreign Trade.
	   The value of the exports was not given. Thailand is the world's
largest rice exporter.
	   The original plan called for all foreign workers to leave their
jobs by May 1. The deadline was extended to July 10 following a
meeting between rice mill operators and the government.
	   Efforts to recruit Thais to fill the jobs have been an almost
total failure. Many of the handful of Thais who have signed up at
job fairs have quit after just a few days of the grueling, low-pay
labor, which includes lifting 100-kilogram (220-pound) sacks.
	   Fishing, another industry whose physical requirements make it
unattractive for Thais, has been exempted from the ban.
	   Kriengsak said the 400 mills normally would produce 1 billion
baht (dlrs 24 million) worth of rice each day. There are more than
1,000 rice mills throughout the country.
	   He said the mills would stop rice purchases, hurting farmers and
leading to spoilage of large quantities of the grain.
	   The government decided to crack down on foreign workers last
year as the economic crisis made it evident there would be many
layoffs in almost every sector of business. An estimated 2 million
people will be unemployed this year.
	   Of 20,000 foreign workers in the rice industry, most come from
Myanmar, while the second largest group comes from Cambodia, said
Kriengsak.
	   Kriengsak said foreigners were paid less than Thais in the past
but their wages have matched the Thai minimum wage since 1991, when
a labor shortage emerged.
	   On Tuesday, a Labor Ministry official said Thailand will
reconsider its plan to expel illegal foreign workers since some
industries are unable to recruit Thais to replace them.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Labor
Minister Trairong Suwankhiri would meet business leaders July 15 to
reconsider the policy.
	   The Commerce Ministry official said exports increased because of
high demand for rice among major importers, particularly Indonesia,
whose own food production has been affected by the disruptive
weather patterns of El Nino.
	   For June alone, rice exports totaled 491,682 tons, up 3.9
percent from 473,377 tons in June 1997.
	   Indonesia wants to import 5 million to 6 million tons of rice
this year, and more than 1 million tons is expected to be supplied
by Thailand, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Indonesia had said it would have to import 3.1 million tons of
rice in 1998, compared to 350,000 tons last year.
	   Vietnam, Thailand's main competitor, has limited its rice
exports to meet domestic needs after over-exporting earlier this
year, the official said.

Dodgers outfielder cleared of drunk driving charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Prosecutors decided not to file drunken
driving charges against Dodgers outfielder Raul Mondesi due to a
lack of evidence, a district attorney's office spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
	   Mondesi, 27, was arrested June 13 in suburban Glendale for
investigation of driving under the influence of alcohol. His
blood-alcohol level was .083 percent, slightly above the legal
limit for driving in California, which is .08 percent, police said.
	   Officers pulled over Mondesi after they spotted his car moving
slowly with its high beams on. He failed field sobriety tests,
police said.
	   The case was evaluated by a prosecutor who determined there
wasn't enough evidence to file charges, said district attorney's
office spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin.
	   ``I want to thank the district attorney's office for seeing to
it that justice was done in my case,'' Mondesi said in a statement
released by the Dodgers.
	   ``Playing baseball in America has been the greatest thrill in my
life and I am thankful for the opportunity to play here,'' said the
native of the Dominican Republic. ``I want to thank the fans and
the Los Angeles Dodgers who have stood by and supported me during
this unfortunate incident.''

Parliament approves new administrative division into 15 provinces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president, premier to meet later today &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist-dominated parliament approved
a plan Wednesday to decentralize Poland's administrative system and
reduce the number of provinces from 49 to 15, but the president was
expected to veto the legislation.
	   The governing coalition, made up of the Solidarity bloc and the
center-right Freedom Union, is short of the three-fifths majority
required to overrule a presidential veto.
	   Ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski was to meet later
Wednesday with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek to discuss the
president's decision.
	   Buzek, who heads the Solidarity-led coalition government, said
it would be ``good for Poland'' if he did not veto the map of 15
provinces.
	   ``We could move on to implement the other elements of the
reform,'' Buzek said.
	   Kwasniewski has vowed to veto the plan and has campaigned
instead for a return to the pre-1976 division into 17 provinces.
His veto was expected Thursday.
	   The lower house, or Sejm, voted 195-40 with 165 abstentions to
accept the reform plan, which was approved earlier by the upper
house.
	   The opposition ex-communist Social Democracy of Poland also
wants 17 provinces and abstained from the voting. The leftist
peasants' caucus also did not vote, saying it supports only the
current division into 49 provinces.
	   The reform plan by the Solidarity-led government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek would do away with the communist-era
administration and transfer power to municipalities. It would take
effect Jan. 1.
	   The reform has broad support among politicians, but the
government and the leftist opposition disagree over the number of
provinces to create.
	   The original Cabinet plan provided for reducing the number of
provinces to 12. But following protests from residents in cities
that would lose their status as provincial capitals and hard
bargaining with the opposition, the government agreed to increase
the number to 15.
	   Government experts say that increasing the number further would
result in provinces that are too small to be efficient.
	   Kwasniewski has toured several provinces and argues Poles favor
the leftist plan. He wants to keep the northwestern province of
Koszalin and the central province of Kielce in the redrawn map. His
critics argue he hopes to win supporters in those provinces ahead
of seeking re-election in 2000.
	   Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski has threatened to cut
contacts with the president if he vetoes the government plan.

Global warming bleaching coral reefs in Bay of Bengal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The coral reefs surrounding the Andaman
islands in India's Bay of Bengal are dying, a scientist said
Wednesday, warning an entire ecosystem is at risk.
	   Much of the reef is bleached in appearance, a sign the coral has
died, and some is ``dying slowly,'' said Ramakrishna Sastry, who
heads a project on biodiversity being conducted by the Worldwide
Fund for Nature's India office. He said global warming, which was
resulting in higher sea temperatures, could be the problem.
	   The reefs, Sastry said, protect the sea coast and a number of
animal species. If they die, ``the ecological links will break. A
large number of people depend on the reefs for fishing and mining
of corals.''
	   Scientists were studying fish when they noticed the problems in
the 960-square-kilometer (370-square-mile) coral reef bed around
India's Andaman and Nicobar islands.
	   The team found 70 percent of the coral in the Andaman chain and
about 40 percent in the Nicobar group of islands had lost their
brilliant colors, Sastry said.
	   In response, the Indian government agreed to set up a committee
of experts from various fields to determine the causes and to find
ways to save the reefs, Sastry said.
	   A study released last month by the World Resources Institute
said that nearly 60 percent of the Earth's living coral reefs, some
of which are more than 2 million years old, are threatened by human
activity from coastal development and overfishing to inland
pollution.
	   Reefs are sensitive to pollution and even to unusually warm
water.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton highlighted ecologists' concerns
about coral reef degradation at a conference on oceans in June in
Monterey, California, at which he pledged dlrs 6 million to help
restore degraded reefs in U.S. coastal waters.
	   Coral reefs, some of which are still alive after 2.5 million
years, consist of thousands of small organisms and a coating formed
by a single-cell plant that gives off the coral's distinctive
bright colors. They are home to a fourth of all marine fish
species, according to scientists.

Fighting tears at Bissau and Mansoa

failure, humanitarian problems. No Pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Machine-gun fire and
rocket-propelled grenades tore through the capital of Bissau and
the nearby town of Mansoa on Wednesday, one day after peace talks
were canceled amid fierce fighting between government soldiers and
renegade troops.
	   Loyalist forces have been building up in Mansoa, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported, apparently eyeing the powerful radio and
TV transmitter in the nearby town of Nhacra, which is held by the
rebels.
	   In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, meanwhile, chiefs of defense staff of
the Economic Community of West African States were meeting
Wednesday to discuss whether to send peacekeepers to help bring an
end to the fighting. The decision of the defense staff officials
will be passed to defense ministers and foreign ministers from the
group, who are expected to meet in Abidjan on Thursday and will
decide how to act.
	   Last week, besieged President Joao Bernardo Vieira said he would
be willing to accept help from the group's peacekeeping wing, known
as ECOMOG.
	   Largely made up of Nigerians, ECOMOG has stepped into trouble
spots before in West Africa. Most recently, they forced out a coup
leader in Sierra Leone, replacing the elected government.
	   On Tuesday, hours before a government delegation was to meet
with renegade leaders to discuss a cease-fire in this former
Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip, artillery and rocket
fire slammed into the capital of Bissau and its outlying areas.
	   The talks were canceled as both sides accused the other of
launching the attack.
	   Fernando Jorge Cardoso, an Africa analyst at Lisbon's Institute
of Strategic and International Studies, said the failure of
Tuesday's talks came as no surprise, since the Portuguese and
Angolan mediating effort had not included Senegal and France.
	   ``Both of these countries are involved. Senegal is interested in
controlling the support of the Casamance separatists. And France
has an indisputable political influence in the area,'' Cardoso said
in a phone interview.
	   Rebel leaders had earlier demanded that Senegal and Republic of
Guinea, which are fighting in support of Vieira, withdraw their
troops before peace negotiations continue.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a cease-fire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers.
	   Portugal's ambassador in Bissau, Francisco Henriques da Silva,
was following up on mediation efforts launched over the weekend by
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, a foreign ministry
spokeswoman said in Lisbon.
	   The Angolan ambassador to Portugal Jose Patricio, left Lisbon on
Wednesday and is trying to get into Bissau, where he will try to
continue the mediation along with da Silva.
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane tried to topple
Vieira earlier this month. The coup attempt degenerated into near
civil war in and around the capital and some nearby towns.
Guinea-Bissau's military is split between allegiances to Vieira and
Mane.
	   The government has offered a pardon to rebel soldiers who lay
down their arms and a life in exile to officers who masterminded
the uprising, which began June 7.
	   Over the weekend, Senegal sent additional troops to Bissau to
counter increasing support for the rebels. A growing number of
people support rebel claims that Vieira's government was riddled
with corruption.
	   Aid agencies warn that Bissau's displaced population _ many of
whom have moved to the central towns of Mansoa, Bafata and
Canchungo _ are putting heavy pressure on food reserves.
	   Fernando Nobre, a doctor from the Portuguese relief group AMI _
the Portuguese acronym for International Medical Assistance _ said
some 50,000 refugees were still in urgent need of help just in
Gabu, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Bissau.
	   AMI arrived in Gabu 10 days after the conflict started and found
refugees starving to death.

EU countries must decide on safety of teething products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Wednesday it is up to the 15 EU countries to decide
whether to ban plastic teething products containing chemicals that
may pose a health risk.
	   The EU executive body said it lacks scientific evidence to
impose an EU-wide ban on toys that contain two widely-used
phthalates, a chemical substance used in plastic objects to make
them supple.
	   ``We are waiting for the result of tests being carried out in
the Netherlands ... before we can take any legal measure,'' said
Pietro Petrucci, EU consumer affairs spokesman.
	   These results will be confirmed around the end of August,
Petrucci told reporters.
	   The Commission opened an investigation into the use of
phthalates at the request of Spain and Denmark amid fears that a
chemical reaction between saliva and certain phthalates could cause
cancer.
	   Scientists must determine what level of phthalates leaking from
toy to mouth could pose a health risk and whether the substance
goes through the digestive system or remains in the body.
	   Meanwhile, the Commission recommended the 15 EU governments
monitor safety of ``child-care articles and toys made of soft PVC
containing phthalates, for children under three years of age, which
are to be put in to the mouth, such as teething rings.''
	   European toy manufacturers welcomed the decision not to impose
an EU-wide ban, calling the health concerns ``unfounded.''
	   ``There is absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest that
phthalates can harm young children,'' said Maurits Bruggink,
secretary general of Toys Industries of Europe.
	   In a statement Bruggink said manufacturers would support the
introduction of standardized EU-wide testing to restore public
confidence in the products.

Hong Kong marks year of reversals in subdued handover anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of protests, comments from
residents &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong marked the first anniversary
Wednesday of its return to China, reassured that Beijing would
allow it to manage its own affairs but sobered by uncertainty over
its ability to do so.
	   The territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin told Hong Kong's 6.5 million people that
their future increasingly would be tied to that of the vast
mainland.
	   Festivities included a flag-raising ceremony on the harbor-side
site of last year's handover ceremony and a variety show including
Chinese dancers as well as stars of the Cantonese pop music scene.
	   Small protests against the Hong Kong government and Beijing had
no impact on the ceremonies.
	   Jiang, fresh from his summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
also will dedicate Hong Kong's new dlrs 20 billion international
airport before going home Thursday. Clinton is to arrive at the
airport just hours later for a brief visit ending his tour of
China.
	   In speeches, Tung and Jiang both praised China's ``one country,
two systems,'' under which the territory is responsible for its own
affairs, and expressed confidence in the future.
	   ``When we look north, the bright future of our motherland adds
much to our valor,'' Tung said in a speech. ``With the
reunification, our interests and those of our nation are
intricately linked.''
	   Tung told a banquet Wednesday night that Hong Kong's economic
troubles would be worse if it couldn't depend on support from the
mainland. In its effort to dig itself out of recession, he said
earlier, Hong Kong would promote cooperation with the mainland,
particularly its dynamic southern regions.
	   ``The policy of one country, two systems is a guarantee for the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,'' Jiang said.
``The policy will benefit Hong Kong by maintaining its place in the
world of international finance.''
	   He said it also could show the way for reunification with Taiwan
_ perhaps the most contentious issue of all. The island
categorically rejects reunification with China under terms similar
to those given Hong Kong.
	   In Hong Kong's first year under Chinese rule, nothing turned out
as it first seemed.
	   Widespread fears that China would limit political freedoms have
subsided. However, Hong Kong's confidence in its economic prowess
has been shaken by Asia's financial crisis. Economically, the
mainland has turned out to be a source of stability.
	   Even such a determined foe of Beijing as Martin Lee, Hong Kong's
de facto opposition leader, acknowledged that the worst
pre-handover fears so far have not come true.
	   Lee, writing in the English-language South China Morning Post,
said that Hong Kong residents had acted to protect their freedoms.
	   ``In this historic first year as part of China, Hong Kong people
_ who many had long suggested were interested only in their wallets
_ shattered the myth they cared nothing for their rights and
freedoms,'' Lee wrote.
	   About 150 protesters marched through crowded downtown Hong Kong,
saying they had no reason to celebrate.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the populist Frontier movement, said
government officials have made no promises to speed up democratic
reforms, and they have ``no coherent policies'' to lift Hong Kong
out of its economic troubles.
	   Other groups appeared outside the convention center that juts
into the harbor, where Tung gave the banquet.
	   One group called for Jiang's resignation and a reassessment by
the Beijing leadership of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The group
carried a traditional Chinese coffin to honor those who died at
Tiananmen. After several attempts to lift the coffin over a police
cordon, the group set the coffin on fire.
	   But the economy was more worrisome to Hong Kong residents than
politics. Unemployment has soared to a 15-year high of 4.2 percent,
and is expected to go higher. The stock market's key index has
dropped by about half, and the economy has plummeted into
recession.
	   Uncomfortable in politics, Tung has suffered a drop in
popularity because of his slow reactions to challenges. A recent
poll found him less popular than the last British colonial
governor.

 &UR; Khatami sees change in U.S. tone towards Iran

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United Stis election last year, was speaking to
reporters covering the visit of Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi.
	   Asked about his response to remarks by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last month,
Khatami said: ``Changes are seen in their tone. We judge their
sincerity by action and not only words.
	   ``We hope this change of tone is a sign of better understanding
of American politicians from the status of the Islamic Republic of
Iran,'' Khatami was quoted as saying by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
	   Clinton said June 18 that Iran was ``changing in a positive
way'' that could lead to a return to normal relations.
	   Albright said the previous day that while the gap between the
United States and Iran remained wide, ``it is time to test the
possibilities for bridging this gap.''
	   The United States broke off relations with Iran after militants
stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 Islamic
revolution and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has promoted sporting and
cultural exchanges with the United States, but has stopped short of
calling for diplomatic ties.

Police find child amid squalor in an attic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Unable to walk or talk, a scrawny
four-year-old girl kept inside her home since birth was discovered
by police tucked away in an attic amid rotting garbage.
	   ``There was garbage, flies, mosquitoes, a little bed, and the
child was sleeping in it,'' Hague police spokeswoman Henriette de
Wilde said Wednesday.
	   The child can neither walk nor speak and has the abilities of a
2-year-old despite being almost 4, apparently due to the effects of
her long isolation and neglect.
	   Her 37-year-old mother told police the girl had never been
outside.
	   She was hospitalized for malnutrition Monday. Police were called
to the apartment building in this western Dutch city after a
housing inspector making a routine check said the mother refused to
open her door.
	   Neighbors had complained of a stench in the past but had never
alerted authorities.
	   The mother had apparently severed all ties with her family, said
De Wilde. There was no information about the child's father.
	   Police have launched an investigation, but the mother has not
been charged with any crime.
	   The girl was placed under the supervision of a local child
protection agency, while the mother underwent psychiatric
evaluation. Their names were not released in line with Dutch police
practice.
	   The fate of the child will be determined by a judge after
authorities complete their investigation.

World Cup: Bebeto struggles in final championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Barely 20 minutes into the
game, the boos began drifting down from the stands. The target was
the same as always: Bebeto.
	   Nothing he did seemed to please the fans. Ronaldo's pass was off
the mark? Bebeto was out of position. A tough ball in traffic?
Bebeto blew it again. The crowd chanted for Denilson, Edmundo _
anybody, it seemed, except Bebeto.
	   Four years after he teamed up with Romario to lead Brazil to a
fourth World Cup title, Bebeto's prestige has sunk to a low ebb.
His critics say he's too old, too slow, and undeserving of a
starting spot on the Brazilian attack.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo doesn't agree. Bebeto does everything we ask
of him, he says. In fact, Zagallo cites Bebeto as an example for
the often-static Ronaldo.
	   ``Bebeto at 34 moves like nobody else,'' Zagallo said. ``But no
one seems to see this.''
	   After every game, reporters ask Zagallo if he plans to bench
Bebeto and start Denilson. The answer each time has been no, Bebeto
is fulfilling expectations and _ for now _ remains a starter.
	   But against Chile, Zagallo pulled Bebeto early in the second
half and sent in Denilson. Afterwards, the coach said he preferred
Brazil's play in the second half, even though the team scored three
of its four goals in the opening period.
	   Outside the locker room, Bebeto didn't hide his frustration.
	   ``I just don't understand. The others make bad passes, but the
fault is always mine,'' he said. ``I'll take the first period a
thousand times if we score three goals.''
	   Chief among the ``others'' is Ronaldo, and the lack of rapport
between the two is one of Bebeto's problems. The two-time FIFA
Player of the Year has a guaranteed spot in the lineup, so it's his
partner _ whoever he may be _ who must adjust.
	   The two got off to a bad start at the 1996 Olympics, when Brazil
played poorly and finished third. Bebeto complained that Ronaldo
hogged the ball, while Ronaldo sniped that the team lacked
leadership.
	   Although they made up at training camp, Ronaldo has said his
preferred linemate was Romario, dropped from the squad with a calf
injury on the eve of the Cup.
	   Bebeto also clashed with Dunga. The team captain complained that
Bebeto was slow setting up to defend a free kick, Bebeto answered
back, and Leonardo had to step between the two to avert a physical
confrontation.
	   Bebeto blames his woes on persecution by the partisan fans and
the press from Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city. He says they are
against him because he plays in rival Rio de Janeiro.
	   Still, it's true that Bebeto is a step slower than in '94. He
rarely makes the whirlwind charges of four years ago, or floats
backward for the volley shot that was his trademark.
	   Instead, he plays for the team. His passing is still sharp, and
he roams the field tirelessly to shake his defender and open spaces
for teammates. He even was Brazil's top scorer in the first round
with two goals.
	   But looking over his shoulder is Denilson, the 20-year-old
dribbling dervish from Sao Paulo. His boyish grin and in-your-face
style enchant fans, and, along with 21-year-old Ronaldo, he
represents the future.
	   ``Sure, fans like Denilson. His flashy soccer is pleasing, and
he's an option to change the team,'' said team coordinator Zico.
``But Bebeto has the experience and the maturity to understand
that.''
	   In his third and final Cup, Bebeto isn't ready to quit.
	   ``I'm 34, but with the head and the body of a kid,'' said
Bebeto, who was world champion for Brazil's 1983 junior team when
Ronaldo was still in kindergarten.
	   The booing hurts more because it's unfair, he said.
	   ``I'm a world champion,'' he said. ``I don't have to prove
anything to anyone.''

Russian coal miners resume railway blockade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 6-7 with comment from deputy prime minister. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners demanding wage arrears have launched a
new protest campaign and were again blocking the Trans-Siberian
railway, news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   Miners blocked rails and highways in three towns in the Kemerovo
region in central Siberia, the reports said. The region's governor,
Aman Tuleyev, met with miners on Tuesday and expressed sympathy
with their complaints, but he opposed blocking the rails, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Miners say the federal government has paid only two-thirds of a
1 billion ruble (dlrs 160 million) sum that was promised after the
miners blocked rails for two weeks in May, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   And the protesters are still demanding the government's
resignation.
	   The strike will last for two days, miners said. Union leaders
will then meet on July 3 to plan their next move, and miners in
other Kemerovo towns may block the rails again, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the government owed
miners throughout Russia 3.7 billion rubles (dlrs 600 million).
	   But he also said that coal consumers must also take blame for
the wage crisis. They owe mines 8.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.4
billion) for purchased coal, he said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Meanwhile, about 200 striking miners from four Russian mining
regions, including Kemerovo, were still camped at the government
building known as the White House, promising to stay until
President Yeltsin is impeached or resigns. They have been there for
three weeks.
	   However, coal miners near the city of Orenburg, 1,400 kilometers
(860 miles) east of Moscow, lifted a rail and road blockade in the
region on Wednesday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Regional administrators agreed with trade unions to pay wage
arrears totaling 7.5 million rubles (dlrs 1.2 million) by August 1.
	   Thousands of Russian coal miners staged scattered strikes in
May, complaining that they hadn't been paid for months. The
protests disrupted rail traffic, but the miners agreed to return to
their jobs after being promised they would receive a portion of
their overdue wages.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton interview by Chinese television. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Praising the ``ingenuity and energy'' of
China's cosmopolitan center of capitalism, U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged his communist hosts Wednesday to open markets, battle
corruption and clean up the environment.
	   Clinton expressed regret that his long China trip hasn't brought
strong agreements needed for China's admission to the World Trade
Organization.
	   ``I'm disappointed that we didn't make more progress on this
issue, but we'll keep working at it until we reach a commercially
viable agreement,'' he said.
	   ``For China, as for America, the promise for the future lies in
helping our citizens to master the challenges of the global
economy, not to deny them or run away from them,'' Clinton told
China-based American business leaders before touring Shanghai's
gleaming new stock market.
	   Speaking in the sun-streaked atrium of a high-rise hotel,
Clinton called on China to open its markets.
	   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' the president said.
	   He noted that he and President Jiang Zemin failed to reach
agreement on lowering trade barriers and other economic reforms,
conditions that must be met before China gains entry into the WTO.
	   While pushing Congress to renew normal trade relations with
China, Clinton said he wasn't ready to try to make those relations
permanent.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with China is about dlrs 50 billion and
rising. America buys one-third of China's exports and should, in
turn, get ``a fair shot at China's markets,'' he said.
	   Delivering a strong environmental message, Clinton said he
couldn't ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
anti-pollution measures. ``But as a citizen of the world and the
leader of my country, I have a responsibility to ask us all to work
together for a planet that our grandchildren can still enjoy living
on. And so do you.''
	   Afterward, Clinton toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange during a
lunch-time pause in trading. Instead of stock prices, the
electronic readout board glowed with a red and yellow presidential
welcome.
	   Traders shook Clinton's hand and gave him a red trader vest with
the yellow number 1998 on its back. He didn't ring the opening bell
_ here a huge gong _ as Jiang did when he visited the New York
Stock Exchange last October during his U.S. visit.
	   While there, Chinese television interviewed the president for
nearly half an hour for a program to be broadcast during prime time
the next day, the White House said. He was asked 19 questions, all
friendly.
	   Asked who had the tougher job _ Clinton or Jiang _ the president
said, ``Oh, I don't know,'' explaining that China faces enormous
challenges and the United States is dealing with a post-Cold War
world in which, he predicted, America would one day lose superpower
status.
	   ``America has this role which is temporary _ it won't last
forever _ as the only superpower in the world,'' Clinton said in a
transcript the White House provided. ``I have a lot of work to do
to deal with America's challenges and problems at home,'' he added,
``and then to try to get the American people to support our nation
doing what we should do as a force for peace and prosperity and
stability around the world.''
	   He also praised China for making ``a genuine movement toward
openness and freedom'' which, he said, ``I hope will continue and
increase.''
	   Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry noted it was the third time
Clinton had been featured on state-controlled Central Chinese
Television since his visit began, including during a live speech to
Peking University and at his joint news conference with Jiang.
	   ``The president was delighted to have another opportunity to
address the people of China'' through television, McCurry said.
	   Clinton also met privately with Chinese entrepreneurs, who are
at the forefront of Shanghai's and China's developing free market
system, replacing money-losing state enterprises and a command
economy.
	   Highlighting housing reform, the president visited with Yu
Jinyuan, a resident of Jin Hui Gardens, apartments where several
families have become first-time homeowners and no longer rely on
state-owned company apartments.
	   Clinton announced a U.S.-China residential building counsel to
promote energy-efficient home-building materials, and said the
Commerce Department would bring Americans to China to help
establish a better home-financing system, stronger property rights
and mortgage markets.
	   Home ownership has made America stronger, he said, and could
also strengthen China.
	   Clinton, enjoying his second day in this thriving Western-style
city, said he had seen many ``examples of the kind of ingenuity and
energy'' needed to ``maximize the potential of the people of
China.''
	   But he declared that both Shanghai and China ``face major
challenges in advancing economic progress beyond the present
point.''
	   He called on China to dismantle its state-run industries and
improve its legal and regulatory systems, and urged ``strong
efforts to combat corruption.''
	   American businesses, he said, should set an example for fair
labor and business practices.
	   Clinton praised U.S. business leaders who work in China, saying
they have been nurturing ``China's ongoing evolution to a more
open, stable and prosperous society.''
	   Making the case that a freer Chinese economy will lead to more
political openness in the repressive society, the president said,
``The more China enters the world community and the global economy,
the more the world will strengthen freedom and openness in China.''

Ethiopia improves Djibouti port amid conflict with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Landlocked Ethiopia said Wednesday
it will spend 21 million birr (dlrs 3 million) to improve services
at Djibouti's Red Sea port because its border conflict with Eritrea
has slowed trade.
	   The money will be used to buy cranes to lift heavy cargo and to
build warehouse and other facilities at the port, said government
spokeswoman Selome Tadesse.
	   Ethiopia had special arrangements to continue using its former
Red Sea ports of Massawa and Assab after Eritrea became independent
from Ethiopia in 1993. But the flow of goods through the ports
stopped when a border dispute erupted between the Horn of Africa
neighbors on May 6.
	   Before the outbreak of hostilities, Ethiopian imports through
Djibouti, principally refined petroleum products, amounted to
300,000 tons over a two-month period. With exclusivity assured _ at
least in the short run _ Djibouti may handle as much as 2.5 million
tons of Ethiopian imports for the year.
	   Djibouti _ a 23,200 square-kilometer (8,958-square-mile)
volcanic chunk in the crook of northeastern Africa where the Red
Sea meets the Gulf of Aden _ lives from port revenues.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ While officials toasted and congratulated one
another on Hong Kong's first year under Chinese rule, a small group
of protesters marked the anniversary with a colorful rally through
Hong Kong's downtown streets.
	   Wearing yellow arm bands which they said symbolized peace, the
activists said there was no reason to celebrate.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the populist Frontier movement, who will
take her place in a new legislature Thursday, said, ``Both the
political and economic situations are looking quite dismal.''
	   Most people in Hong Kong give China high marks for keeping hands
off since it regained sovereignty a year ago. But Lau said
government officials have made no promises to speed up democratic
reforms, and they have ``no coherent policies'' to lift Hong Kong
out of its economic troubles.
	   The 150 protesters included students, politicians, and labor and
women's rights activists. Some wore T-shirts with such sayings as:
``To resist is to win.''
	   ``Everyone has the right to work. I have the right to protest,''
they chanted in the 5-kilometer (three-mile) march. Some beat
tribal drums and sang songs declaring their rights.
	   Another small protest outside an official banquet in the evening
ended with minor scuffles with police.
	   The protesters, including members of the radical April 5 Action
Group and the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's main opposition party,
called for the resignation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and a
reassessment of the 1989 Chinese military crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
	   The protesters carried a dummy coffin to honor those killed by
Chinese soldiers on June 4, 1989. A banner on it said: ``People's
heroes shall be immortal.''
	   They set the coffin on fire after several unsuccessful attempts
to lift it over a police cordon.
	   Last year, nearly 3,000 people rallied hours after the change of
sovereignty, which activists said was the first test of the
government's tolerance of dissenting views. Despite some
restrictions on protests, civil liberties generally are intact a
year later.
	   ``There haven't been any major changes'' in civil rights, said
36-year-old Winnie Lai, dressed in military-style pants and smoking
a rolled cigarette under the scorching sun.
	   ``But it's important for us to stand up and declare our rights''
before authorities take them away, said Lai, a translator.

Taipei subway sees first fatality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taipei's new mass transit system suffered
its first fatality Wednesday when an unidentified woman apparently
jumped in front of a train.
	   The woman was standing alone on the far end of the platform at
the central Chungshan underground station before disappearing in
front of a southbound train pulling into the station during the
morning rush hour, police said.
	   Station officers evacuated the train and closed off the platform
while police removed her body.
	   The 22.8-kilometer (14-mile) line runs from Taipei's central
train station to the town of Tamsui, on the coast northwest of the
capital.
	   It opened last year, joining another elevated line running in
the eastern part of the city as the first of the system's five
lines to operate.
	   The much delayed and over-budget system is scheduled to be fully
operational by 2000, with a total length of 86.8 kilometers (53.8
miles). Total cost for the project is more than U.S. dlrs 18
billion.

Revolutionary Israeli solution for road accidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - More Israelis have been killed in road
accidents than in wars with the Arabs, and neither stiff fines nor
publicity campaigns have succeeded in lowering the death toll.
	   Now a Jerusalem car upholsterer is trying a novel solution - a
mezuza, the little box containing passages from the Scriptures that
Jews traditionally nail to the doorposts of their homes.
	   Yaacov Vanunu has been installing mezuzas on the door-posts of

Inside, written on a tiny piece of paper, is a verse from Psalm 91:
``For He has charged his angels to guard you wherever you go.''

German citizen investigated after allegedly trying to smuggle baby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A German man who tried to illegally
take a one-month old Romanian baby out of the country, is being
investigated for attempted smuggling, police said Wednesday.
	   Thomas Gerhard Heyman, a German citizen, is being held freely in
Romania, pending completion of the investigation, said Capt.
Constanta Nastasia of the border police.
	   Romania earned a reputation as a baby market after the fall of
Communism nine years ago. Many foreigners flocked to the country to
adopt unwanted children, aided by corrupt judges and lawyers.
	   A newly instituted law obliges foreign citizens to stay at least
six months in Romania before they will be considered eligible to
adopt Romanian children.
	   The incident occurred June 26, when Heyman tried to take the
baby out of the country, allegedly telling customs officials it was
his son by a Romanian woman.
	   But upon further investigation, police discovered it was
Heyman's first trip to Romania and the woman he claimed to be the
the mother had never been out of the country.
	   The child's mother and an employee of Band German adoption
agency are also being investigated.

Italian premier says his visit will improve Iran-West ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
Wednesday his visit to Iran will help ease the country out of its
international isolation.
	   Prodi, the first EU leader to travel to Iran since a 1992 visit
by Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, said he spoke to
U.S. President Bill Clinton about his visit.
	   ``I consulted with President Clinton before coming to Tehran.
This trip will have far-reaching implications. It will not only
improve ties between Tehran and Rome, but also between Iran and the
West,'' Prodi told reporters. He gave no details.
	   The 15-nation EU broke off regular meetings with Iranian
officials and withdrew its ambassadors in April 1997 after a German
court implicated the Tehran government in the 1992 assassination of
four Kurdish Iranian dissidents in Berlin. The envoys returned late
last year and in March the EU agreed to resume dialogue with Iran.
	   Iran has had no diplomatic ties with the United States since
Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and
held Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Iran's Vice-President Hassan Habibi said Prodi's visit was of
great importance for the two countries.
	   ``We consider this trip an international message,'' Habibi said
after talks with Prodi Wednesday.
	   Prodi also met with President Mohammad Khatami and later
addressed a cultural conference at Tehran University called ``Look
to the East.''
	   On the economic front, the Tehran government is seeking to
increase trade with Italy, which is Iran's fourth biggest trading
partner. Trade between the two countries totaled dlrs 2.3 billion
last year.
	   Khatami has tried to improve ties with the West since he took
office in August. He has promoted cultural and sporting exchanges
with the United States and eased social restrictions imposed by the
clergy after the 1979 revolution.
	   The Italian Embassy in Tehran said Prodi, who arrived here
Tuesday night, would cut short his three-day visit and leave Iran
Wednesday evening. No reason was given for the change.

At least five dead, 18 wounded in two attacks in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Two powerful bombs exploded in Algeria,
killing five people and injuring 18 others, a government communique
said Wednesday.
	   An explosion occurred Wednesday in a crowded market in Bab
Ezzouar, a western suburb of the capital Algiers. One person was
killed and four injured. However, eyewitnesses said at least 10
people were injured in the attack and the stampede out of the
market that followed.
	   A separate bomb on Tuesday evening in the Khemis Djema, a
village about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Algiers left four
person dead and 14 others injured. Eyewitnesses there said the bomb
had been hidden in a parked car.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombings.
	   Such attacks are usually attributed to the Armed Islamic Group,
the most powerful group of opponents to the government now active
in Algeria.
	   The North African country has been shaken by unrest over the
past week by protests by thousands of people protesting a new
Arabic-only law that is set to go into effect this weekend, as well
as the assassination of popular singer Lounes Matoub last week.
	   The language law, due to come into effect Sunday, would
effectively ban from official use other languages including Berber,
also known as Tamazight, and French, which is widely used in this
former French colony.
	   Many people see the Arabic-only law as an effort by the
military-backed government to appease supporters of Islamic
movements in a 6-year-old insurgency that has left more than 75,000
people dead.
	   The Muslim insurgency began after the government canceled
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was set to win.

Tauziat upsets Davenport to reach semis,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Tops with first quarterfinal result; edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Nathalie Tauziat upset second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport in straight sets Wednesday to reach her first
Grand Slam semifinal.
	   The 16th-seeded Frenchwoman, who had lost her last seven matches
to the American, won 6-3, 6-3 to become the first player to reach
the Wimbledon final four.
	   ``That was by far the best tennis she ever played against me,''
Davenport said. ``She just outplayed me completely today.''
	   Tauziat played an effective serve-and-volley game, while
Davenport sprayed errors all over the court. The match ended with
Davenport serving a double fault and Tauziat letting out a shriek
of delight.
	   The defeat ended Davenport's bid to reach her fourth straight
Grand Slam semifinal. Tauziat had taken only one set off Davenport
since beating her in their first meeting at Wimbledon in 1993.
	   Tauziat will face the winner of the quarterfinal between Monica
Seles and Natasha Zvereva.
	   In the other women's quarters, defending champion Martina Hingis
faced Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, and Venus Williams took on Jana
Novotna.
	   The men's quarters featured a slugfest between defending
champion Pete Sampras and big-serving Australian Mark
Philippoussis.
	   No. 3 Petr Korda was pitted against Tim Henman, bidding to
become the first British man to reach the semifinals since 1973 and
the first homegrown men's champion since 1936.
	   The 1996 champ, Richard Krajicek, faced little-known Davide
Sanguinetti, a 65th-ranked Italian. Krajicek aggravated an injury
to his right knee in his fourth-round win over Wayne Ferreira and
said he wasn't sure whether he would be fully fit.
	   In the other match, former two-time finalist Goran Ivanisevic
was up against Jan Siemerink.
	   ``I'm playing maybe the best tennis I've ever played here,''
said the 14th-seeded Croatian, who had won just one match in his
five previous Grand Slam events. ``Maybe this is the breakthrough,
Maybe this is the Grand Slam. After five poor ones, there has to
come one good one.''
	   Sampras, on course for his fifth Wimbledon title in six years,
said Tuesday that men's tennis needs rivalries, personalities and
NBA-type marketing to boost its sagging popularity.
	   Referring to his short-lived rivalry with Andre Agassi a few
years ago, he said, ``You definitely need Americans playing well to
have this game be successful in the States.''
	   Sampras also reflected on the success of the 1970s and early
'80s when Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors played each
other in numerous Grand Slam semifinals and finals.
	   ``They were all different personalities and they all hated each
other,'' he said. ``It's great theater. And now, it's sad but true.
That's what the game needs. It needs a little controversy. It needs
a Dennis Rodman type of guy.
	   ``You need a hatred, or whatever you want to call it. You need a
rivalry. You need something so that people not following the game
might follow the game.''
	   Sampras, who has been criticized for being ``boring'' and not
doing enough to generate interest in the game, said it's not his
job to make waves.
	   ``I'm obviously worrying about my tennis,'' he said. ``There's
only so much I can do.''
	   So don't expect Sampras to start imitating Rodman.
	   ``I'm pretty normal,'' he said. ``Because you play good tennis,
everyone thinks there's got to be something a little bit quirky
about you, and there really isn't about me. I'm kind of your normal
guy that happens to play good tennis, and that's really it. There's
not a lot to analyze with me.''

Hospitals on full alert to deal with heat wave, air pollution

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With temperatures and smog levels reaching
dangerous levels, hospitals were placed on full alert Wednesday to
deal with a heat wave that is expected to worsen over the weekend.
	   ``All hospitals are ready for any emergency cases,'' said Health
Minister Kostas Geitonas.
	   According to the environmental group Greenpeace, some pollution
levels surpassed European Union limits in central Athens as
temperatures edged 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit).
High temperatures and lack of wind combine to elevate air pollution
levels in the mountain-ringed Athens basin.
	   State and municipal authorities also began setting up special
air-conditioned rooms for elderly people and those with respiratory
problems to cope with temperatures expected to reach 42 degrees
Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) by Friday.
	   Last week, more than 100 people were hospitalized for
heat-related ailments as temperatures started to climb.
	   Air-conditioned areas were first set up in municipal buildings
and retirement homes two years ago for people without cooling
systems in their homes. A heat wave in 1987 was blamed for more
than 900 deaths around Greece.
	   In central Athens, Greenpeace staged a mock funeral for a smog
victim outside the Environment Ministry. The group called on the
government to restrict traffic in this city of nearly 5 million
people.
	   Although car traffic is restricted in the city center, Athens'
1.3 million cars and 600,000 motorcycles are still blamed for much
of the air pollution that chokes the capital.

	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Machine-gun fire and
rocket-propelled grenades tore through the capital of Bissau and
the nearby town of Mansoa on Wednesday, one day after peace talks
were canceled amid fierce fighting between government soldiers and
renegade troops.
	   Hundreds of people were fleeing the fighting in Mansoa, filling
the roads toward Bafata, about 110 kilometers (66 miles) to the
east.
	   ``We're running because its so hard there now,'' said Aliu Mane,
a refugee on the road just outside Mansoa. `I don't know where I'm
going to find food. I don't know where I'm going.''
	   At least three civilians had been killed in the town since
Wednesday night, all apparently by shrapnel, and twelve injured.
	   Intense gunfire continued to rock the town into early afternoon,
though with soldiers from each side in various areas it was unclear
who controlled it.
	   ``This is an injustice to the people,'' said Father Maurice
Fioravanti, a Catholic missionary in Mansoa. ``We lack food and
medicine but all they do is fight.''

World Cup: Tranquil striker confident about match with France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italy's newest star Christian Vieri said
Wednesday he was looking forward to taking advantage of his ``magic
moment'' and help his team defeat France in Friday's quarterfinal
match.
	   However the 24-year-old centerforward, who has scored five World
Cup goals, said he was giving priority to Italy's fortunes more
than to the possibility of clinching the prestigious title of top
striker.
	   ``The main goal is that Italy goes on in the tournament. If I
can continue my scoring streak the better,'' Vieri said at Italy's
training camp. ``I want to take advantage of this magic moment, but
I'm not obsessed with the strikers standings.''
	   By scoring in each of the four World Cup matches played by Italy
so far, the strongly built striker of Atletico Madrid is co-leader
in the strikers standings with Argentine Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Vieri is one goal short of former Italian World Cup heroes Paolo
Rossi and Salvatore Schillaci who were the top World Cup strikers
in 1982 and 1990 with six goals each.
	   Vieri, who grew up in Australia where his father was
player-coach with a local soccer team, has been overshadowing
original team stars Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto Baggio with
his explosive start in the competition.
	   He had scored only two goals in eight matches on the Italian
team before traveling to France '98.
	   ``I'm tranquil, whatever happens to me. This is my real
strength,'' Vieri said.
	   Vieri said he had overcome a sore muscle problem, which forced
him to skip a tuneup game Tuesday.
	   ``I'm fit, in good form,'' Vieri said. ``I'm ready to play
France.''
	   Vieri is expected to lead Italy's attack in a pair with Del
Piero. Both will be facing a well-known opponent, Zinedine Zidane.
	   Vieri, a teammate of Del Piero and Zidane at Juventus in 1997
before moving to the Spanish league, said he considered the French
midfielder ``the best world player in his role.''
	   ``He's a great player, and a great man off the field. We are
friends. He's very important for the French team. I hope he can't
play at his best against us,'' Vieri said.
	   Vieri considered France ``a tough team with a strong defense and
an attack not as good as Italy's.''
	   ``We may lose against a great opponent. It would be no shame
losing to France. But I'm confident we will get through.''
	   He said he was taking advantage of coach Cesare Maldini's
tactics, giving Italian forwards the chance of fast counterattacks.
	   Italy scored eight goals and allowed three in four World Cup
matches.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Activists and academics at the World AIDS Congress
Wednesday called for more realistic action to address the
increasing spread of the AIDS virus through drug injection.
	   But poverty and a collapse in drug prices, along with an
increase in drug trafficking and harsh government attitudes in many
countries, stand in the way of preventing the problem, they said.
	   In some countries, infection through drug use accounts for more
HIV infections than sex.
	   ``The law and order approach has not been successful in
eliminating drug use,'' said Palani Narayan of Thailand-based group
Asian Harm Reduction Network.
	   A U.N. report last week said that in Malaysia and Vietnam among
others, three-quarters of recorded HIV cases are among drug
addicts. In the last two years, four out of five new HIV infections
in Russia have been among the same group, it said.
	   Even encouraging people to buy clean needles is ``easier said
than done'' in Asian slums, Narayan said. ``There is a need to
recognize drug users as citizens.''
	   Gerry Stimson of Imperial College, London and Moruf Adelekan of
Nigeria's University of Ilorin both pointed to a risk of heroine
and cocaine injection spreading to poorer parts of society in
developing countries.
	   But Stimson said the first people to inject are ``the pleasure
classes _ people who have the time, the money, the opportunity to
inject.''
	   In Nigeria, injection is still generally confined to a few
middle-class people who have no problem obtaining needles, Adelekan
said.
	   He warned that a depressed economic climate and a collapse in
drug prices could help spread the practice. ``It's a good
opportunity to catch it at this level.''
	   A flood of adulterated drugs could also push up injection rates,
said Narayan, who said that injecting is often the only way for
users to ``get a high'' from weaker drugs.
	   Speakers agreed that far too few needle-exchange programs are in
place. In Asia, ``sadly we have been hitting our heads against a
brick wall for several years,'' Narayan said.
	   However, he praised Vietnamese and Indian programs supported by
national or local government.
	   In 1997, 116 countries reported cases of intravenous drug use
and 96 of those reported HIV cases connected to drug injection,
according to the World Health Organization.
	   In April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
pushed through legislation that would permanently ban federal
funding of needle exchanges, saying it would jeopardize the battle
against drugs.
	   However, not all at the conference agreed that drug use in
itself was undesirable.
	   Annie Madden of Australia, who described herself as an injecting
drug user of some 15 years, rejected as patronizing the assertion
that efforts should be aimed at stopping people injecting in the
first place.
	   ``They are people who have made the deliberate choice to use
drugs because they are nice and they enjoy them,'' she said,
describing drugs as ``just commodities.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ Novelist Fay Weldon, under fire for her assertion
in a magazine interview that rape ``isn't the worst thing that can
happen to a woman,'' says her comments were misinterpreted.
	   ``I did say those words,'' Ms. Weldon said. ``But what I said
next wasn't quoted: that rape's not the worst thing that can happen
to a woman _ death is.''
	   Radio Times magazine reported this week that the author of ``The
Lives and Loves of a She Devil'' and ``The Hearts and Lives of
Men'' called for the criminal charge of rape to be changed to
aggravated assault and asked society to stop ``glamorizing'' rape.
	   In the article, Ms. Weldon said she was drawing her conclusions
from firsthand experience when a male friend tried to rape her in
the back of a taxi.
	   ``It was nasty, but didn't shatter my view of men,'' she was
quoted as saying. ``The man simply wanted sex. Now, it's
unfashionable to say this, but rape isn't the worst thing that can
happen to a woman if you're safe, alive and unmarked afterwards.''
	   On Tuesday, Ms. Weldon said her comments were misunderstood and
that she supports the work of anti-rape organizations.
	   ``If it has stirred up a change to rape laws, then I am
pleased,'' she said.
	   A statement from Radio Times said editors there were surprised
at Weldon's claim her comments were misinterpreted, saying she had
``confirmed in writing the words that were reported.'' The magazine
said it had asked her to do so because editors recognized the
``sensitivity of the subject.''

Philippines to explain Estrada's economic program to foreign
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada will send
top aides to Japan, the United States and Britain to explain that
he's no longer a movie star and instead is a government leader with
a sound economic program, an official said Wednesday.
	   ``Estrada is known as a movie actor. He's not yet known as
Estrada the president, so his programs have to be articulated,''
said Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, who is part of the
high-level team.
	   Estrada, a former B-movie star who campaigned on a pro-poor
platform, was inaugurated Tuesday as the country's 13th president.
Many news reports about him have focused on his checkered past _ a
history of womanizing, heavy drinking and gambling, which he claims
to have overcome.
	   Siazon said he would join Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu,
Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Pardo and Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson on a two-day trip to Tokyo starting Aug. 3.
	   In addition to explaining Estrada's economic policy, the group
will seek financing for two projects from the Japanese government,
Siazon said. From Tokyo, the team will travel to New York,
Washington and London.
	   Estrada has said he will continue most of Ramos' economic
policies and reforms. Ramos dismantled many monopolies and
deregulated key industries, allowing the economy to recover from
more than a decade of stagnancy.
	   The Philippines' economic advances, however, were slowed by the
Asian financial storm that began last year, and Estrada faces a
steep budget deficit.
	   As of May, the budget deficit was estimated at 15.4 billion
pesos (dlrs 385 million) but could balloon to 30 billion pesos
(dlrs 750 million) by the end of the year due to declining revenue
collections, Espiritu says.
	   Many businessmen have looked askance at Estrada, considering him
an undereducated buffoon with little ability to extricate the
Philippine economy from the currency crisis.

South Korea to free more political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will grant special amnesty
to political prisoners even if they do not sign statements
promising to abandon their ideological beliefs, the Justice
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The ministry made the announcement shortly after President Kim
Dae-jung ordered a major amnesty for political prisoners to mark
the Aug. 15 anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese
colonial rule in 1945.
	   Until now, South Korea had demanded that political prisoners
first sign the so-called ``conversion letter'' before they could be
considered for special pardon.
	   Amnesty International and other human rights groups have
denounced that practice as undemocratic.
	   According to human rights activists, there are 500 political
prisoners in South Korea. Many of them are student activists
convicted of supporting North Korean ideology.
	   Seventeen political prisoners have served more than 15 years.
Human rights groups say those long-term prisoners were convicted of
being communist spies and sentenced to life in kangaroo military
courts on the basis of confessions elicited by torture.
	   Those old prisoners have refused to sign the conversion letter.
	   Among them is Woo Yong-gak, 69, believed to be the world's
longest-serving political prisoner. Woo has been held in solitary
confinement for 40 years for espionage, despite being partially
crippled by a stroke.
	   On Wednesday, President Kim called the conversion letter
impractical and outdated, his spokesman, Park Ji-won, said.
	   ``Even if a person signs the conversion letter a hundred times,
you never know what he really believes,'' Kim was quoted as telling
Justice Ministry officials.
	   Kim took office in February as the first opposition leader to
take power in South Korean history. He was persecuted by past
military governments and was kept in prison for more than six years
in the 1970s.
	   He freed 74 political prisoners in an amnesty in March that
affected 5.5 million people, mostly traffic offenders and petty
criminals whose records were erased.
	   Human rights groups have demanded that Kim free the other
political prisoners.
	   It is customary in South Korea for the government to grant a
special amnesty to ``exemplary prisoners'' on major national
holidays.

Twenty-eight World War II shells found in Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ As many as 28 unexploded artillery shells
from World War II have been found in the Ukrainian capital, civil
defense officials said Wednesday.
	   Twenty-four shells were found in a forest grove in southern Kiev
on Tuesday. Four more were discovered at two other locations, the
Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Such finds are common in Ukraine, which was a site of heavy
battles between Soviet and Nazi German forces during World War II.
Shells, bombs and other weapons often turn up in Ukrainian villages
and towns, including Kiev.
	   Last week, three unexploded shells and several machine-gun
cartridges were discovered and rendered harmless near the landing
strip of Kiev's international Boryspil Airport.

Australia stopover on Taiwan premier's South Pacific visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Premier Vincent Siew may make a
controversial refueling stopover in Australia during his upcoming
visit to several South Pacific islands, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Siew leaves Thursday for the island kingdom of Tonga, where he
will attend the 80th birthday party of King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. He
then visits Fiji and the Solomon Islands, where he will attend
independence day festivities and a festival of Polynesian culture.
	   Tonga and the Solomon Islands are two of just 27 countries that
have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Fiji recognizes Taiwan's
rival, China, but maintains close relations with Taipei's
Nationalist rulers.
	   Siew may make a brief refueling stop in Australia on his return
leg, the United Daily News reported. That would be sensitive
because Australia, like most countries, recognizes China, which
objects strongly to its diplomatic partners accepting visits from
high-ranking Taiwanese officials.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
manage its own foreign relations.
	   Reporters traveling with Siew will be diverted to the
U.S.-administered island of Guam to keep his Australian visit low
key, the paper said.
	   Taiwan's economic strength amid the Asian financial crisis has
made nations in the region more willing to accept visits from
Taiwanese leaders. Siew has already visited Malaysia, the
Philippines and Malaysia this year, although none of them
recognizes Taiwan.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Outgunned and outnumbered, Kosovo
Albanian rebel fighters insist they eventually will control Kosovo
even if they lose many more battles.
	   The fight for a coal mine and villages near Belacevac proved two
points: the Albanians' inability to hold territory against superior
Serb firepower and their ability to melt away to fight another day.
	   Rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army strike suddenly, have
intimate knowledge of the rugged local terrain, enjoy popular
support and are unwavering in their will to prevail. With those
qualities, the rebels claim they will overwhelm powerful Serbian
forces.
	   ``We have the people,'' Abi Beleim Berisha, a local KLA
commander west of the capital Pristina, said Tuesday. ``We are
fighting for our homeland.''
	   Three hours later, Serb tanks, artillery and infantry swarmed
Berisha's post, taking Belacevac. But the KLA already was fighting
the Serbs elsewhere in Kosovo.
	   By Wednesday the rebels had regrouped in an effort to prevent
the Serbs from capturing any more territory.

Khatami sees change in U.S. tone towards Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iran-European Union &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States is adopting a different
tone towards Iran, but it should demonstrate its good intentions
through deeds, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday.
	   Khatami, who is credited with softening Iran's attitude toward
the United States since his election last year, was speaking to
reporters covering the visit of Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi.
	   Asked about his response to remarks by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last month,
Khatami said: ``Changes are seen in their tone. We judge their
sincerity by action and not only words.
	   ``We hope this change of tone is a sign of better understanding
of American politicians from the status of the Islamic Republic of
Iran,'' Khatami was quoted as saying by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
	   Clinton said June 18 that Iran was ``changing in a positive
way'' that could lead to a return to normal relations.
	   Albright said the previous day that while the gap between the
United States and Iran remained wide, ``it is time to test the
possibilities for bridging this gap.''
	   The United States broke off relations with Iran after militants
stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran following the 1979 Islamic
revolution and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has promoted sporting and
cultural exchanges with the United States, but has stopped short of
calling for diplomatic ties.

President to undergo further surgery on July 27
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel plans
to undergo abdominal surgery on July 27, but the operation could be
postponed if necessary.
	   Miroslav Cerbak, head of the team of doctors treating the
president, said Wednesday that Havel's recovery was satisfactory
and the surgery which would remove a tube inserted into Havel's
colon could proceed according to plan.
	   Havel suffered a ruptured colon and acute peritonitis in April
while on vacation in Austria. His recovery was complicated by
breathing problems after phlegm blocked his windpipe, forcing
doctors to perform a tracheotomy.
	   On May 13, he was released from hospital and retreated to the
presidential residence in Lany, outside Prague, to rest.
	   Doctors were originally expecting to remove the tube by mid-June
but later decided to postpone the surgery, saying Havel was not yet
ready.
	   According to Jiri Pehe, Havel's political adviser, the operation
can be easily postponed to allow Havel continue his role as a power
broker in the so-far inconclusive talks on forming the country's
new government following general elections held on June 19-20.

Prime minister wins support for Aboriginal land rights deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with farmers' reaction, grafs 14-15, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard struck a
deal with a key senator Wednesday to adopt a long-delayed
Aboriginal land rights law, winning tempered praise from all sides,
including the Aborigines.
	   By reaching the compromise, Howard avoids having to dissolve
Parliament and call an early election to resolve the problem while
the polls show his popularity at an all-time low, at 34 percent.
	   The bill limits claims by Aborigines on access to the vast
tracts of lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and
miners _ some 42 percent of Australia's land mass.
	   Aboriginal access mainly consists of the right to cross the land
to hunt or seek water, to visit sacred sites, or to hold clan
gatherings.
	   The ranchers, farmers and miners say they can't manage their
businesses properly if the land is subject to Aboriginal access
claims.
	   Howard reached a final compromise Wednesday with independent
Sen. Brian Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the
narrowly divided Senate.
	   The key element of the compromise was that Aborigines lost a
federal right to negotiate land claims, but gained an equivalent
right under state laws that already gave farmers, ranchers and
miners a similar right.
	   ``This looks terribly like the right to negotiate ... under a
different guise,'' said Aboriginal activist Noel Pearson.
	   The government also dropped its demand that land claims be
phased out after six years.
	   Under the compromise, Aboriginal land holders and claimants will
have the right to be notified of proposed mining on their land and
to object to it.
	   Mining companies also would be required to consult with
Aborigines about ways of minimizing the impact of their operations.
	   There will be provision for mediation in case of disputes, and
matters can be arbitrated, where mediation fails.
	   Harradine was jubilant about the result: ``This outcome avoids a
race-based ... election which, I believe, would have posed a
serious threat to the fabric of Australian society.''
	   Australia's ranchers called the outcome the best they could hope
for.
	   ``Australia's farmers have accepted that the agreement on native
title reached between the federal government and Sen. Harradine is
the option of least risk for pastoral leaseholders,'' said the
acting president of the National Farmers Federation, Wayne Cornish.
	   Minerals Council of Australia executive director Dick Wells
said, ``The amended act will allow the industry to get on with its
business in a way which respects the rights of others and continues
to generate wealth and jobs for all Australians.''
	   Western Australia and the Northern Territory had threatened to
oppose the deal, but were brought into line when guaranteed that
the federal government would compensate them for 75 percent of the
value of any lands they lose in the future under the new law.
	   Howard had been threatening to call an election on the issue
since Harradine blocked passage of the legislation in April, and
set July 4 as a deadline for the law to be passed.
	   The next election must be held by May 1999, but some analysts
said an August poll was likely if it was called early.
	   Compromise talks between Harradine and Howard were reopened
after the surprising success of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
in Queensland state elections June 13.
	   One Nation, which opposes special welfare payments to Aborigines
and Asian immigration, took 11 seats in the 89-member state
Parliament.
	   One Nation wants to abolish native title.
	   The government introduced the so-called 10-point native title
plan to spell out the exact extent of a 1996 High Court ruling
recognizing Aborigines' right to lay non-exclusive claim to
government-held land leased to farmers and miners.

President orders government to prepare reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma ordered
his Cabinet to swiftly prepare and approve measures to stop the
country's economic decline and avert a looming financial crisis,
his spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The orders are part of Kuchma's campaign to stabilize the
economic situation in Ukraine, said the spokesman, Oleksandr
Maydannyk.
	   Ukraine's economy has deteriorated recently due to the
government's inability to collect planned budget revenues and the
need to repay billions of dollars in redemption for domestic bonds.
Investors have stayed away from Ukraine because of its stalled
reforms and the recent crisis in other developing markets.
	   Maydannyk said Kuchma's measures were mainly aimed at reducing
tax rates, introducing tax breaks for large foreign investors,
decreasing the amount of foreign borrowing and attracting more
investments from abroad.
	   Foreigners have invested only about dlrs 2 billion in Ukraine
since it gained independence in 1991, because of the uncertain tax
and legal climate and the lack of economic reforms.
	   The government has relied largely on foreign borrowing in the
last two years to finance the budget deficit and pay off more than
5 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.5 billion) in overdue salaries and social
benefits.
	   The situation became critical this summer when the government's
monthly foreign debt payments started to exceed budget revenues.
	   Ukraine has again asked the International Monetary Fund for a
three-year, dlrs 2.5 billion loan it was refused last summer. The
government must implement about 90 conditions before the IMF will
consider the loan.
	   Maydannyk said other measures ordered by the president deal with
possible amnesty for Ukrainians who would bring back money stashed
abroad, providing state support for the agricultural sector and
rapid privatization of the country's telecommunications monopoly,
Ukrtelekom.
	   He said Kuchma may sign three other decrees this week, one of
which would simplify the procedure of tax payments and accounting
for small- and medium-sized businesses.

EU moves to tie African franc to euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union moved Wednesday to
ensure that the replacement of the French franc by the euro won't
undermine the stability of the finances of 15 African nations whose
currencies are linked to the French money.
	   Under proposals due to be debated by EU finance ministers
Monday, the French Treasury will defend a fixed parity between the
euro and the African nations' CFA franc in the same way as it now
backs the rate of 100 CFA francs to the French franc.
	   The exchange rate between the euro and the CFA franc will be
fixed when the EU's common currency is launched on Jan. 1. It will
be based on the rate at which the French franc is absorbed into the
euro.
	   The proposals, put forward Wednesday by the EU's executive
Commission, will oblige France to keep EU institutions informed of
any plans to change the exchange rate between the euro and the CFA
franc.
	   Despite assurances from France, the impending demise of the
franc has provoked fears in CFA nations that they could fall victim
to the kind of wild financial instability that often plagues
African countries without a peg to a strong Western currency.
	   The CFA franc is used by Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon,
Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Chad.
	   The proposed EU rules would also apply to the franc of the
Comoros islands off Africa's southeastern coast which is fixed at
75 to one French franc.

fire Wednesday when it was destroyed shortly before it overflew a
crowded beach near this resort on the island of Crete.
	   According to state television, Greek air force officers ordered
a high-altitude Nike-Ajax anti-aircraft missile to self-destruct at
4,000 feet (1,219 meters) shortly after it veered off course
following its launch from a NATO weapons range near this port city.
	   The missile, launched for a test, was heading towards a popular
beach when the order was given, media reports said.
	   Hot fragments landed in an uninhabited mountain forest near the
range and caused a blaze, being fought by local fire fighting
teams.

Malaysia to pump money into deferred infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said Wednesday a new fund of 5 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.2 billion)
will be created to revive infrastructure projects that were
deferred or abandoned after the country's economy began sinking.
	   The fund would help complete half-finished projects, he told
reporters.
	   The critical areas identified for this fund were public
transport, sewerage, solid wastes and water supply.
	   ``We'll have to come out with a stimulus package. I've also
alluded to the fact we will register a deficit, but the economy has
to rebound,'' Anwar said.
	   ``And if it takes the government to provide the engine of
growth, then we will have to do it.''
	   Economic policy makers have been moving toward an expansionary
stance in recent weeks.
	   Last month, Anwar announced a 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.6
billion) government spending program. Last week, Bank Negara, the
country's central bank, also raised fears of a monetary easing,
announcing that around 8 billion ringgit (dlrs 2 billion) would be
pumped into the banking system by reducing commercial banks'
reserve requirements.
	   Money for the new 5 billion ringgit fund would be raised by bond
issues, Anwar said. The government had not decided whether these
would be offered to domestic or international markets.
	   Anwar said the creation of the new fund did not automatically
mean that monetary policy is being eased, but that the government
had a role to play when banks were unwilling to extend new credit.
	   Many ambitious megaprojects such as a big dam and a new
administrative complex were put on hold as Malaysia's economic
plight worsened when the currency and stock market tumbled last
year.

Italian premier says his visit will improve Western ties with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
Wednesday his visit to Iran will help ease the country out of its
international isolation.
	   Prodi, the first EU leader to travel to Iran since a 1992 visit
by Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, said he spoke to
U.S. President Bill Clinton about his visit.
	   ``I consulted with President Clinton before coming to Tehran.
This trip will have far-reaching implications. It will not only
improve ties between Tehran and Rome, but also between Iran and the
West,'' Prodi told reporters. He gave no details.
	   The 15-nation EU broke off regular meetings with Iranian
officials and withdrew its ambassadors in April 1997 after a German
court implicated the Tehran government in the 1992 assassination of
four Kurdish Iranian dissidents in Berlin. The envoys returned late
last year and in March the EU agreed to resume dialogue with Iran.
	   Iran's Vice-President Hassan Habibi said Prodi's visit was of
great importance for the two countries.
	   ``We consider this trip an international message,'' Habibi said
after talks with Prodi Wednesday.
	   Prodi also met with President Mohammad Khatami and later
addressed a cultural conference at Tehran University called ``Look
to the East.''
	   On the economic front, the Tehran government wants to increase
trade with Italy, which is Iran's fourth biggest trading partner.
Trade between the two countries totaled dlrs 2.3 billion last year.
	   Khatami has tried to improve ties with the West since he took
office in August. He has promoted cultural and sporting exchanges
with the United States and eased social restrictions imposed by the
clergy after the 1979 revolution.
	   The Italian Embassy in Tehran said Prodi, who arrived here
Tuesday night, would cut short his three-day visit and leave Iran
Wednesday evening. No reason was given for the change.

Switzerland imposes sanctions on Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Wednesday joined its
European neighbors in imposing sanctions on Yugoslavia in
punishment for its crackdown on Kosovo.
	   The ruling coalition cabinet announced in a statement a ban on
arms exports to Yugoslavia and on the delivery of goods which could
be used for internal repression or terrorist purposes.
	   The measures, which came into effect Wednesday afternoon,
included the freezing of any assets in the country belonging to the
Serbian and federal Yugoslav governments.
	   The government also banned any public financial backing for new
investments in Serbia and exports to the republic.
	   ``Switzerland has an interest in supporting the efforts made by
the international community to achieve a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo conflict,'' the statement said.
	   In June, the European Union widened its economic sanctions
against Belgrade to add a ban on commercial flights by Yugoslav
airlines to all 15 EU nations.
	   It already had banned new investments in Serbia, frozen the
country's assets abroad, banned all arms exports and restricted
travel visas for Yugoslav officials.

HBO offers Holyfield dlrs 20 million for unification fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Abraham quotes 9th graf, Lewis's manager quotes last

<TEXT>
	   BY JOHN PYE
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Home Box Office television network has offered
Evander Holyfield dlrs 20 million to fight Lennox Lewis to unify
the world heavyweight boxing titles.
	   HBO spokesman Seth Abraham said Holyfield, IBF and WBA world
heavyweight title holder, had asked for dlrs 20 million for the
fight and now he had no reason not to take it.
	   ``The only reason this fight will not go ahead is if Evander
Holyfield does not want it,'' Abraham said when he announced the
offer in London on Wednesday.
	   The offer was sent to Holyfield in writing.
	   Abraham said Holyfield's contractual obligations with his
promoter Don King and the Showtime network did not prevent him from
fighting WBC champion Lennox Lewis.
	   ``I believe he wants this fight. It's what everyone
wants...except Don King. King is the only obstacle to this fight,''
he said.
	   ``What we want to see is the reunification - this would be the
only unified crown in world boxing.''
	   ``Evander's record of accomplishment would be spoiled without a
fight against the only man who is his true peer today _ his equal
in the heavyweight ranks,'' he added.
	   Abraham said the venue _ either of two venues on the US east
coast _ the date, either Dec. 5 or Dec. 12, and the purse can be
guaranteed.
	   ''We should agree that this Holyfield-Lewis match is an
important one to lift our sport. We should arrange it for this
purpose alone,'' he said.
	   ''We seek no options of any sort on future prizefights of
Holyfield. Ours is a one-fight proposition and offer.''
	   The promoters are billing the bout as the fight fans have been
waiting to see since 1992, when Riddick Bowe trashed the WBC title
belt after failing to fight Lewis _ then a challenger.
	   Lewis is expected to earn dlrs 10 million if Holyfield agrees to
put his WBA and IBF world title belts on the line for the
unification prize fight.
	   HBO also announced Wednesday it had completed a seven fight deal
with Lewis, commencing with his WBC defense against Croatia's
Zeljko Mavrovic on the Indian Reservation Foxoods, Connecticut, on
Sept. 26.
	   Lewis' second scheduled fight in the new deal is the proposed
unification fight in December. He will fight at least two fights on
the HBO network per year until 2000.
	   HBO senior vice president Lou DiBella said Lewis' contract was
the most lucrative HBO had signed with any current boxer, including
Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones Jr and Prince Naseem Hamed.
	   Lewis could earn up to dlrs 100 million under the seven-fight
agreement, the projected figure based on a successful record and
his cut of potential pay-per-view earnings.
	   Lewis' manager Frank Maloney said the seven-fight deal was a
lucrative contract for Lennox but also demonstrated the value HBO
placed in him.
	   However, he was not convinced the unification fight between
Holyfield and Lewis was a certainty.
	   Maloney told British cable television network L!VE TV the
chances of the fight going ahead were about as good as England
winning the soccer World Cup _ England bowed out of the World Cup
the previous night.

Japan's automobile sales fall 9 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales of new automobiles in Japan fell for the 15th
straight month in June as a sluggish economy and worries about the
country's shaky banks kept consumers out of dealers' showrooms.
	   Sales of new cars, trucks and buses fell 9 percent in June from
the year-earlier month to 380,708, the Japan Automobile Dealers'
Association said Wednesday.
	   The 15-month decline is the longest ever, breaking the previous
record of 14 straight months from April 1993 to May 1994.
	   Demand for Japanese cars remains strong in the United States but
sales at home have lagged since a sales tax increase last year.
Exports to Asia have also slumped since a financial crisis sent
regional currencies into a tailspin.
	   Sales of passenger cars fell 2.2 percent to 278,413, truck sales
plummeted 24.1 percent to 101,281 and bus sales dipped 7.3 percent
to 1,014.
	   Last year's increase in the national sales tax to 5 percent from
3 percent and worries about Japan's weak financial system have
discouraged consumers, a spokesman for the association said.
	   Sales of new vehicles may contract for the full year even though
a package of tax cuts and public spending designed to boost the
economy should lead to a recovery starting in the fall, the
spokesman said.
	   By maker, Toyota's sales in June fell 8.3 percent to 149,623
vehicles, sales of Nissans dipped 2.0 percent to 79,362 and
Mitsubishi Motors' sales sank 20.5 percent to 26,060. Mazda's sales
contracted 3.9 percent to 24,446 vehicles.
	   Only Honda's sales rose, gaining 2.3 percent to 48,490 vehicles,
helped by sales of its new Capa compact-sports-utility vehicle,
which went on sale in April.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hingis, Krajicek wins &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Martina Hingis
outlasted Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in a three-set baseline battle
Wednesday to reach the Wimbledon semifinals.
	   The top-seeded Swiss dropped her first set of the tournament but
outplayed the French Open champ in the final games to emerge as a
6-3, 3-6, 6-3 winner.
	   The 1 hour, 46-minute match featured long baseline rallies and
seemed more appropriate to the clay of the French Open than the
grass of Wimbledon. Several times in the final set, Hingis appeared
tired and out of breath.
	   The fifth-seeded Spaniard, known for her tireless retrieving,
pushed Hingis to the brink as she saved nine consecutive break
points over the second and third sets.
	   Hingis finally converted on the 10th break point, ripping a
backhand pass that ended a long, corner-to-corner rally and gave
her a 4-2 lead in the third set. She raised her arms in triumph and
caught her breath by sitting on a linesman's chair at the back of
the court.
	   Although Sanchez Vicario broke back in the next game, Hingis won
the next two games to close out the match. She smiled with relief
and pumped both fists after hitting an inside-out forehand which
the Spaniard returned wide.
	   Hingis will face the winner of the quarterfinal between Venus
Williams and Jana Novotna.
	   Nathalie Tauziat upset second-seeded Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 6-3
to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal. The 16th-seeded
Frenchwoman had lost her last seven matches to the American.
	   ``That was by far the best tennis she ever played against me,''
Davenport said. ``She just outplayed me completely today.''
	   Tauziat played an effective serve-and-volley game, while
Davenport sprayed errors all over the court. The match ended with
Davenport serving a double fault and Tauziat letting out a shriek
of delight.
	   The defeat ended Davenport's bid to reach her fourth straight
Grand Slam semifinal. Tauziat had taken only one set off Davenport
since beating her in their first meeting at Wimbledon in 1993.
	   Tauziat will face the winner of the quarterfinal between Monica
Seles and Natasha Zvereva.
	   In the first men's quarterfinal, 1996 champion Richard Krajicek
cruised to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 win over 65th-ranked Davide Sanguinetti
of Italy.
	   The men's quarters featured a slugfest between defending
champion Pete Sampras and big-serving Australian Mark
Philippoussis.
	   No. 3 Petr Korda was pitted against Tim Henman, bidding to
become the first British man to reach the semifinals since 1973 and
the first homegrown men's champion since 1936.
	   In the other match, former two-time finalist Goran Ivanisevic
was up against Jan Siemerink.
	   ``I'm playing maybe the best tennis I've ever played here,''
said the 14th-seeded Croatian, who had won just one match in his
five previous Grand Slam events. ``Maybe this is the breakthrough,
Maybe this is the Grand Slam. After five poor ones, there has to
come one good one.''
	   Sampras, on, 13th graf

Berlusconi's Fininvest reports 50 percent increase in consolidated
</HEADLINE>
net profit

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Fininvest, the media and retail group
controlled by former premier Silvio Berlusconi, on Wednesday
reported that consolidated net profit rose 50 percent in 1997 from
the year before.
	   Fininvest's profit jumped to 595 billion lire (dlrs 334 million)
in 1997 from 398 billion lire (dlrs 223 million) in 1996.
	   The holding company's 1996 results were boosted by capital gains
from the quotation on the stock market of its television and
advertising arm, Mediaset, and financial services and insurance
holding company Mediolanum.
	   Fininvest's revenues inched down to 10.089 trillion lire (dlrs
5.66 billion) from 10.261 trillion lire (dlrs 5.76 billion) in
1996. The company attributed the slight decline to an accounting
change. On a comparable basis, revenues would have risen 0.9
percent, Fininvest said.
	   Berlusconi, whose media empire includes Italy's three main
private TV networks, also is leader of the center-right opposition.
	   He is under investigation in several corruption-related cases,
and was convicted in December in a case centering on a film company
deal and given a suspended 16-month sentence.

President to undergo further surgery July 27
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel plans
to undergo abdominal surgery on July 27, but the operation could be
postponed if necessary.
	   Miroslav Cerbak, head of the team of doctors treating the
president, said Wednesday that Havel's recovery was satisfactory
and the surgery which would remove a tube inserted into Havel's
colon could proceed according to plan.
	   Havel suffered a ruptured colon and acute peritonitis in April
while on vacation in Austria. His recovery was complicated by
breathing problems after phlegm blocked his windpipe, forcing
doctors to perform a tracheotomy.
	   On May 13, he was released from the hospital and went to a
presidential retreat to rest.
	   Doctors were originally expecting to remove the tube by mid-June
but later decided to postpone the surgery, saying Havel was not
ready.
	   According to Jiri Pehe, Havel's political adviser, the operation
can be easily postponed to allow Havel continue his role as a power
broker in the so-far inconclusive talks on forming the country's
new government following general elections held on June 19-20.

EU refers U.S export subsidies case to WTO panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Wednesday asked
the World Trade Organization to appoint a panel to settle a dispute
with the United States over U.S. tax cuts for firms with offshore
subsidiaries.
	   ``This is a violation of fundamental WTO rules,'' said EU Trade
Commissioner Leon Brittan. In a statement, he called the tax cuts a
``clear subsidy'' from the U.S. taxpayer to industry.
	   The EU's executive Commission launched a formal complaint to the
WTO last November, arguing the tax cuts give American companies an
unfair advantage in international markets.
	   Under customary procedure, after a complaint has been made to
the WTO the two parties have two months to try and settle the issue
bilaterally. In March, the EU asked for an extension of that
period.
	   The decision to appoint a panel is likely to be taken by the
WTO's dispute settlement body which is next scheduled to meet July
23.
	   ``Tax exemptions worth an annual dlrs two billion are currently
extended to American companies exporting through Foreign Sales
Corporations,'' or offshore subsidiaries, the Commission said in a
statement.
	   An EU official said U.S. firms with offshore subsidiaries get 64
percent corporate income tax relief on profits made through U.S.
offshore subsidiaries, and pay no taxes at all when they repatriate
the profits.
	   Most of these subsidiaries are based in the Virgin Islands,
others are in Barbados and in Guam, he said. The tax cut scheme
benefits mainly machinery makers, chemicals firms, transport firms
and exporters of soya beans.
	   Offshore subsidiaries account for an estimated annual turnover
of dlrs 152 billion and gross profits of around dlrs 10 billion,
which are exempt from normal U.S. taxation.
	   The EU and the United States often bicker over trade issues and
regularly accuse each other of violating WTO rules. Last May,
Washington lodged a formal complaint with the WTO on tax treatment
for exports in five EU countries - Belgium, Greece, Ireland, the
Netherlands and France.

Cambodia arrests two Americans, four Thais in big marijuana bust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Americans and four Thais were
arrested off Cambodia's southern coast last weekend after officials
discovered 3.3 tons of marijuana in their boat, police said
Wednesday.
	   A senior police official, Lak Vannak, said the six were arrested
Sunday in Cambodian waters off the coast of the southwestern
province of Koh Kong.
	   They have since been brought to Phnom Penh, he said, adding that
he was unable to reveal their identities.
	   The U.S. Embassy said it was aware of two arrests of people
identified as American citizens but could not provide further
details.
	   In the past few years, Cambodia has become a major exporter of
marijuana. It is also an important transit point for heroin coming
from the Golden Triangle, the opium-growing region where the
borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma meet.
	   Early last month, U.S. and Thai drug agents were taken into
Cambodian custody in the Koh Kong area during what was reported to
be a failed undercover operation against marijuana smuggling.
	   Cambodians believed to be maritime police tried to extort dlrs
400,000 for the release of a U.S. drug agent and five Thai
colleagues captured when the operation went awry, a Bangkok
newspaper reported.
	   The drug agents, seized on their boat during an operation in
which they posed as buyers of large quantities of marijuana, were
freed after negotiations between Thai and Cambodian authorities,
the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The report did not say if any money had been paid for the men's
release.
	   The Thai Foreign Ministry said the agents had been on a ``secret
mission'' near Cambodia's maritime province of Koh Kong. A ministry
spokesman said Cambodian maritime police apprehended the agents
June 5 had on charges of being in Cambodian territorial waters.
	   According to the Bangkok Post, which did not name its sources,
the agents were on a trawler just outside Cambodian waters, waiting
to take delivery of several tons of marijuana for shipment to the
United States.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman confirmed to The Associated Press that
an American citizen was aboard a vessel in the Gulf of Thailand on
the weekend of the early June incident and that the vessel was
detained.

Out-of-control missile causes forest fire on resort island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANIA, Greece (AP) _ An out-of-control missile caused a forest
fire Wednesday when it was destroyed shortly before it overflew a
crowded beach near this resort on the island of Crete.
	   According to state television, Greek air force officers ordered
a high-altitude Nike-Ajax anti-aircraft missile to self-destruct at
4,000 feet (1,219 meters) shortly after it veered off course
following its launch from a NATO weapons range near this port city.
	   The missile, launched for a test, was heading towards a popular
beach when the order was given, media reports said.
	   Hot fragments landed in an uninhabited mountain forest near the
range and caused a blaze, being fought by local fire fighting
teams.

Russian coal miners resume railway blockade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES miners are not blocking rails but just camping by
them, ADDS more details on miners' demands; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners demanding payment of back wages have
launched a new protest and were camping out along the
Trans-Siberian Railway, news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   Miners gathered near railroads and highways in three towns in
the Kemerovo region in central Siberia, the news agencies said. The
region's governor, Aman Tuleyev, met with miners on Tuesday and
expressed sympathy with their complaints, but opposed blocking the
rails, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Miners say the federal government has paid only two-thirds of a
1 billion ruble (dlrs 160 million) sum that was promised after they
blocked rails for two weeks in May, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The miners are demanding that authorities pay wage arrears,
create more mining jobs, and dismiss a criminal case under review
against the organizers of the May rail blockade. They also
continued to call for the government's resignation.
	   The protest will last for two days, miners said. Union leaders
will meet on Friday to plan their next move, and miners across
Kemerovo may block the rails again, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the government owed
miners throughout Russia 3.7 billion rubles (dlrs 600 million).
	   But he also said that coal consumers must take some blame for
the wage crisis. They owe mines 8.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.4
billion) for coal, he said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Meanwhile, about 200 striking miners from four Russian mining
regions, including Kemerovo, were still camped at the government
building in Moscow known as the White House, promising to stay
until President Boris Yeltsin is impeached or resigns. They have
been there for three weeks.
	   However, coal miners near the city of Orenburg, 1,400 kilometers
(860 miles) east of Moscow, lifted a rail and road blockade in the
region on Wednesday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Regional administrators agreed to pay wage arrears totaling 7.5
million rubles (dlrs 1.2 million) by Aug. 1.
	   Thousands of Russian coal miners staged scattered strikes in
May, complaining that they hadn't been paid for months. The
protests disrupted rail traffic, but the miners agreed to return to
their jobs after being promised they would receive some of their
overdue wages.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from president's interview &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Although she's spending a lot of time
beside her parents, Chelsea Clinton has managed a few solo moments
in China. She has slipped away for shopping excursions, a rickshaw
ride in Beijing and a spin on the dance floor in this bustling
coastal city.
	   The White House, in keeping with its policy of privacy for the
teen-ager, hasn't said much about what Chelsea has been doing as
she accompanies President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton on his
trip.
	   The president, in an interview Wednesday with Chinese
television, said Chelsea, 18 and on summer break after her freshman
year at Stanford University, was enjoying the chance to see the
country and meet young Chinese people. ``She said to me just
yesterday how incredibly exciting she thought Shanghai was, and how
she wished she could stay here a while when we leave and go back,
just to see more of it,'' he said.
	   Chelsea has been very much on public display here, in contrast
to the behind-the-scenes lifestyle she enjoys in Washington. She
has been seen playing animated tour guide at every sightseeing
stop, including one to view the Terra Cotta Warriors near Xi'an.
	   An only child, Chelsea has stuck by one or both of her parents
for many of their official events, from the welcoming ceremony last
Saturday at Beijing's Tiananmen Square to her mother's visit
Wednesday to the Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai.
	   The Clintons seem more relaxed with Chelsea around. The
president posed arm-in-arm with his daughter in the Forbidden City,
and the whole family joined hands as they walked atop the majestic
Great Wall of China.
	   Photographers were summoned Tuesday to capture images of Clinton
and his daughter strolling down the Old Shanghai alley of shops and
food counters. Clinton and Chelsea stopped on a stone bridge over a
lagoon swarming with gold fish and Chinese carp. They laughed and
threw popcorn into the water.
	   Even while she is at official events, Chelsea has managed to
slip away while her parents work. During their visit to the city's
new museum, Chelsea got a personal tour of centuries of Chinese
art.
	   In perhaps her most adventurous getaway, Chelsea caught a
rickshaw ride in the crowded streets before leaving Beijing on
Monday.
	   Then Tuesday night, Chelsea was on the dance floor at the Park
97 club in downtown Shanghai, attending a party for White House
press and staffers. Since she didn't bring any friends along on
this trip, Chelsea recruited some young White House aides as
dancing partners.

Swiss official: Bhutto probe checking current Pakistani premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A preliminary Swiss investigation of
drug-trafficking allegations involving former Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto also is checking for bank accounts of the
current premier, an official confirmed Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's name was among 353 people and
companies on a list that Federal Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte sent
Swiss banks April 20, said Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the
prosecutor.
	   But Blaser confirmed that, after the Pakistan Embassy in Bern
complained, Del Ponte sent a follow-up letter in May specifying
that Sharif ``is not included among the suspects.''
	   The May letter, printed in Wednesday editions of the Geneva
daily Le Temps, said Sharif was included because of ``the
statements of his political rivals.''
	   Del Ponte asked the banks to expedite their search for his name
among their accounts and report back last May 15, ahead of the May
30 deadline for the other names.
	   Blaser declined to say what the banks reported, but said only
that their responses were still being evaluated.
	   A search of Swiss bank accounts, usually carried out at the
request of another government, often is an initial step in a larger
investigation.
	   The prosecutor's office compiled the list of names on the basis
of information coming out of Pakistan in connection with Pakistani
allegations that Swiss banks were being used to launder proceeds
from drug trafficking, Blaser said.
	   The preliminary Swiss investigation was opened last February, he
confirmed.
	   In a separate investigation launched last year, Swiss officials
already have frozen a series of bank accounts linked to Ms. Bhutto;
her husband, Asif Ali Zardari; and mother, Nusrat Bhutto.
	   That investigation is based on Pakistani allegations that the
Bhutto family was receiving kickbacks on government contracts.
	   Swiss sources have said the total amount frozen in the
Bhutto-Zardari accounts is at least 20 million Swiss francs (dlrs
13 million). A Pakistani investigator has said he believes more
than dlrs 250 million is in the accounts.
	   Geneva Judge Daniel Devaud, who last month said he had indicted
three Swiss citizens on money-laundering charges in the corruption
investigation, said Wednesday he was still considering whether to
indict Ms. Bhutto and her husband.
	   Sharif, who succeeded Ms. Bhutto after she was ousted in 1996 on
charges that she robbed the public purse of millions of dollars,
established a commission to investigate corruption.
	   Ms. Bhutto has repeatedly denied her guilt and accused the
government of political victimization.

	   NICE, France (AP) _ Leave the ``beautiful game'' to the others.
The Germans have other qualities and they have worked for them in
the past. These assets are working for them again.
	   ``We can't play the way Brazilians play. No German team has ever
been able to do so,'' coach Berti Vogts said Wednesday. ``We worked
very hard on our stamina and our speed and in the second half, our
better fitness often becomes an advantage.''
	   Vogts was responding to criticism from home that the German team
may be winning, but is not entertaining.
	   ``I can only use the players that are available and that's what
I did,'' he said. ``We are among the top eight teams in the world
and look what teams have been eliminated.''
	   German determination, stamina, discipline and fighting spirit
have won the country three World Cup titles, often at expense of
more talented teams.
	   Germany rallied with two goals in the final 15 minutes to beat
Mexico 2-1 and reach the quarterfinals. It also had to rally a
two-goal deficit to draw Yugoslavia 2-2 in group play.
	   In both matches, the Germans used sheer will to overcome the
technical superiority of their opponents.
	   ``It has to do with tradition,'' captain and forward Juergen
Klinsmann said. ``Also, I think other nations are envious of us for
the way we are able to turn the games.''
	   ``I think we have some qualities in our mentality _ that we
never give up, even when we are behind,'' Klinsmann said. ``We are
still able to switch to a higher gear. This ability to play 90
minutes at full throttle, that's what other nations don't have.''
	   Other nations also don't have Klinsmann and his striking partner
Oliver Bierhoff, who have scored three goals each _ accounting for
six of Germany's eight goals.
	   In the quarterfinals Saturday in Lyon, Germany faces a familiar
opponent: Croatia.
	   In an ill-tempered match two years ago, Germany beat Croatia 2-1
in the quarterfinals of the European Championship and went on to
win the title. But Croatia could have easily won the game as well.
	   ``We know them and it's going to be a tough job,'' Klinsmann
said. ``Technically, they are very strong, they have very good
individuals.''
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic. We want to go to Paris and it really
depends only on us.''
	   ``They were very aggressive in Manchester,'' said Klinsmann, who
was nearly sent off for a vicious tackle. ``We must take charge
early and keep the pace high.''
	   Vogts hopes his 100th game as manager will bring his team more
success. Since he took the team over in 1990, he's won 66 times,
lost 11 and drawn the other 22.
	   ``I'm glad we are playing Croatia. We had a very tough game
against them two years ago,'' Vogts said.
	   Vogts said he didn't watch the Croatia's 1-0 victory over
Romania _ partly out of superstition.
	   At the 1992 European Championship in Sweden, Vogts watched
Denmark in the semifinals _ and Germany lost the final to Denmark.
He also watched Bulgaria at the 1994 World Cup in the United
States, only to see his team eliminated by the Bulgarians 2-1 in
the quarterfinals.
	   ``We have demonstrated how tough it is to beat us,'' Vogts said.
``Against Mexico, we showed marked improvement. But we still have
to improve.''
	   Croatia's game relies on the midfield creativity of Zvonimir
Boban and the scoring skill of Davor Suker.
	   ``We have to concentrate on our strengths and we have to try to
mark their best men out of the game and then we can win,'' Vogts
said. ``They may try to provoke us, but we must ignore it.''

KLA fighters regroup in western Kosovo after defeat

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo on Wednesday in an attempt to stave off
Serbian security forces in the secessionist province.
	   After Serbian forces recaptured a strategic coal mine region
from the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday, the Albanians moved
west to the Drenica region, police said.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement.
	   U.S. diplomats have held several unpublicized meetings with
leaders of the KLA's political wing but have not been able to
persuade them to agree to halt their attacks on Serb civilians or
negotiate a settlement of their conflict.
	   In another sign that pacifist Albanian leaders may merge with
the militants, top Albanian politicians met Wednesday in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina in an attempt to plot a joint position toward
the KLA and win its cooperation.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the political groups would become
the KLA's political wing.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   Serb forces recaptured the Belacevac mine region Tuesday after
two days of nearly non-stop fighting in the village. The mine is
strategically important because it supplies coal to the nearby
Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most of Kosovo.
	   Along with Belacevac, Serbian media have suggested the other
goal of this week's offensive was to break the 2-week-old standoff
at Kijevo.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, the crossroads village has been a flashpoint since the
KLA surrounded it earlier this month and cut off its Serb
inhabitants and police. The Albanian fighters themselves were
surrounded by Serb police checkpoints.
	   On Wednesday, no fighting was reported in the Kijevo area. The
KLA attacked the Serb village of Drsnik, killing a 26-year-old
villager, the Tanjug state news agency said. The shooting lasted
for several hours before the KLA withdrew, the agency said.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of Kosovo's population.
	   In Germany on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
Kosovo Albanians shouldn't expect immediate NATO intervention. He
said no mandate was in sight from the U.N. Security Council for
such an intervention, because council members Russia and China
oppose the move.
	   Kinkel also said that if Western nations intervene in Kosovo
without at least securing the support of Russia, it would damage
Russia's efforts to mediate in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``Therefore, one shouldn't awake illusory expectations in the
Kosovo Albanians that NATO will intervene tomorrow,'' Kinkel said
on Deutschlandfunk radio. He didn't want to speculate about whether
an intervention was ``a question of weeks or months.''

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A Finnish Air Force Hawk fighter plane
crashed Tuesday afternoon in Luopioinen, 170 kilometers (100 miles)
north of Helsinki. Both pilots survived.
	   The pilots ejected from the aircraft after reporting an engine
failure, said rescue operations chief Seppo Mannikko at the Tampere
Rescue Station. They were later spotted near the burning fuselage,
he said.
	   Seven Finnish Hawks have crashed since their introduction in
1980. A Hawk crash in April killed the pilot.
	   The Finnish defense forces have 54 British Aerospace Hawks, used
mainly for pilot training.

Muslim-Croat Federation Interior Ministry formally established
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The multiethnic Ministry of
Interior in the Muslim-Croat half of Bosnia was inaugurated
Wednesday, in a blow to hard-liners wanting ethnically separate
police forces for different parts of the country.
	   First to receive certificates at the inauguration ceremonies
were Interior Minister Mehmed Zilic, a Muslim, and his Croat
deputy, Jozo Leutar.
	   The top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
called Wednesday's inauguration ``the laying of a foundation stone,
'' but suggested much needed to be done before a truly multi-ethnic
and professional force was operating at full efficiency.
	   ``Next will come the bricks and mortar, then the walls, the
floors and the ceiling,'' he said. ``And then, when the structure
is in place, the Ministry will open for business.''
	   The Dayton peace accords ending the Bosnian war called for a
multi-ethnic police force across the country, reflecting the
country's ethnic mix as recorded by the last pre-war census in
1991. By the war's end in late 1995, most parts of the country had
``ethnically pure'' Serb, Croat or Muslim police units, reflecting
who was controlling a particular area.
	   The agreement foresees a professional police force which will
serve the citizens regardless of their ethnicity. Such a force
would be a pre-requisite to guarantee the safety of returning
refugees.
	   Only two of 10 administrative regions of the Muslim-Croat half
of Bosnia _ both controlled by hard-line Croats _ remain
unintegrated. But in the Bosnian Serb half of the country, the
process is further behind schedule.

Congolese opposition leader freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's foremost opposition leader was
freed from internal exile Wednesday and returned to Kinshasa.
	   Etienne Tshisekedi was arrested in February and banished to his
home village of Mupompa, about 700 kms (435 miles) west of the
capital.
	   The arrest was to stop Tshisekedi's ``irresponsible and
dangerous'' activities, Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji said
during a state television broadcast shortly after the exile was
ordered.
	   It was Tshisekedi's second arrest since President Larent Kabila
came to power in May 1997 following an eight-month rebellion in the
country formerly known as Zaire.
	   The opposition leader was also accused of defying Kabila's
decree that barred opposition political activities in Congo.
	   Tshisekedi met shortly before his arrest with Jesse Jackson, the
civil-rights leader and special U.S. envoy for Africa. The meeting
angered Kabila, who refused to meet with Jackson.
	   Tshisekedi's latest arrest also came not long after his party
distributed pamphlets calling for the release of imprisoned
colleagues.
	   Tshisekedi both served and opposed longtime dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko at various times during his rule.

Volkswagen, Volvo shares up on report of possible merger talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Volvo shares up too, Volvo Germany spokeswoman
playing down talks, additional background, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Shares of Volkswagen and Volvo jumped
Wednesday after a report said the two carmakers were in talks about
a possible link-up.
	   Neither company would confirm a merger was in the works. Auto
industry watchers, though, said such a step would be the right
strategic move to increase the heat on rival Daimler-Benz.
	   The Swedish automotive group Volvo confirmed that its chief,
Leif Johansson, met with Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech last
Friday in Goteborg, Sweden, but refused to comment further.
	   A spokeswoman for Volvo Germany in Cologne, though, sought to
play down the significance of the meeting, calling it ``completely
normal.'' She said the two men talked about the delivery of engines
and other components, adding that such conversations take place all
the time.
	   Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, had no immediate comment.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe, in Wednesday editions, quoted
unidentified sources as saying the two companies were in
preliminary talks on a business alliance that could eventually lead
to a merger.
	   The newspaper said Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, is
looking for a partner that could help it enter the market for
medium and heavy trucks. Volvo is one of the world leaders in that
area.
	   Currently, Volkswagen's commercial-vehicle division specializes
in light vans and minibuses.
	   Volvo, in turn, would benefit from cost savings and synergy
effects when sharing production with VW, said Georg Stuerzer, chief
car analyst at Munich-based Bayerische Vereinsbank.
	   Price might be a sticking point. In a takeover, VW would
presumably have to cough up cash or shares that go some way toward
covering Volvo's current market value of about 23.5 billion marks
(dlrs 13 billion). analysts said.
	   German companies seeking to stay competitive in the global
market have been increasingly aggressive about seeking partners
abroad.
	   Within the past two months, Volkswagen announced it intends to
buy two luxury automakers _ Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Britain and
Italy's Lamborghini _ and Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. shook the
auto world with their own merger plans.
	   Other industries, including chemicals and media giants, have
also gone on foreign shopping sprees in recent years
	   Bertelsmann, for example, is adding the biggest U.S. book
publisher, Random House, to its stable of print and music
companies. Siemens is buying Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
non-nuclear power generation business and Deutsche Telekom has a 10
percent stake in Sprint Corp.
	   In morning trading in Frankfurt, Volkswagen shares were up 4.2

World Cup: Puffing away, World Cup coaches cast smoke screen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A blue cloud hangs over the World Cup, a nicotine
haze that even invades the field during games.
	   Its source is the bench, the throne of soccer knowledge and
leadership, where every match coaches and their assistants can be
seen puffing away as pressure builds and patience wears out.
	   While some players, particularly from Eastern European teams,
are known to smoke, there hasn't been a case yet of a striker or
goalkeeper lighting up in the middle of the action.
	   But the coaches, led by Daniel Passarella of Argentina and
Herbert Prohaska of Austria, have no qualms about feeding their
habit during games. And the worldwide television pictures of these
figureheads of a supposedly healthful sport puffing away have upset
soccer's leadership.
	   FIFA said Wednesday that it had asked coaches not to smoke on
the bench or other areas of the field and was dismayed that they
continue to inhale.
	   ``We have done all we could to try to get the coaches not to
smoke, or at least not to smoke when the TV cameras are on them,''
federation spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``But it's the freedom of
the individual. The stadiums are not nonsmoking areas. We can't
send the gendarmes in on them.''
	   Four years ago, when the World Cup was held in the United
States, most of the stadiums where games were held banned smoking
as part of local law. Organizers of that event said they stressed
this to FIFA in making preparations for the tournament.
	   ``We absolutely emphasized that was the situation in our
stadiums, and that we had a policy of abiding by local
ordinances,'' said Jim Trecker, the communications director for
World Cup USA '94 and now deputy general secretary of the U.S.
Soccer Federation.
	   Trecker said the U.S. organizers took pains to distance
themselves from any possible taint of tobacco, whether it be no
smoking in the stadiums or sponsorship from tobacco companies.
	   ``That was part of an overall very strict anti-smoking policy
that America has with its athletics,'' Trecker said.
	   Still, some coaches were seen sneaking smokes in the U.S.
venues. And in France, where 34.3 percent of men and 28.3 percent
of women smoke and a rough-tasting Gauloises is as much a national
trademark as the best champagne, the benches have become free-fire
zones.
	   Cooper said FIFA had been approached before the tournament by a
French government anti-smoking campaign to crack down on smoking
coaches.
	   ``We passed along their concern,'' Cooper said. ``We wrote to
the coaches about it. It also was mentioned to the coaches during
their orientation (in March). But in the pressure of the moment,
it's hard for them to break a habit built up over long periods of
time. We'd prefer they didn't do it.''
	   Unlike the policy four years ago in the United States, any
anti-smoking movement here would have a hard time getting through
the local organizers. Michel Platini, the former French soccer star
who now heads the World Cup organizing committee, is a chainsmoker.
Ferand Sastre, the guiding force behind France's efforts to stage
the Cup, died last month after a long fight with lung cancer.
	   Cooper said that if FIFA couldn't get the coaches to quit, it at
least wanted to try to protect the soccer's image. He said the
federation had asked television directors to try to avoid camera
shots of coaches smoking.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain has approved the sale of the
anti-impotency drug, Viagra, the Gulf Daily News newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The move made Bahrain the third Gulf country after Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates to permit the sale of Viagra.
	   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Health Ministry official as
saying that the ministry had registered the drug after studying
samples received from the producer, the American pharmaceutical
firm Pfizer.
	   The drug can only be prescribed by consultant urologists, who
will be monitored by the Health Ministry, the official said.
	   Each pack containing four pills will sell for about dlrs 50 in
Bahrain, the paper added.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A group of Kuwaiti businessmen announced Wednesday
that they have set up an investment company with a paid-up capital
of 15 million dinars (dlrs 49 million).
	   The Global Investment House will offer services such as local
and international portfolio management and financial consulting,
according to an advertisement in the newspaper Al-Anba. The firm
will also establish other companies and investment funds.
	   ____
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Four Egyptian companies have won contracts
to export 25,000 tons of Egyptian rice to Iraq under the
oil-for-food program, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Wednesday.
	   The head of the Egyptian Trade Center in Baghdad, Awni Hashim,
told the agency that Iraq's trade ministry had decided to buy 50
million pounds (dlrs 14.7 million) worth of soap and detergents
from Egypt.
	   The contracts would be signed within the next three days, the
agency added.
	   The U.N. oil-for-food program enables Iraq to bypass sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited amounts
of oil to buy humanitarian goods.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The U.N. Sanctions Committee has given
Jordan the green light to sell Iraq dlrs 28.6 million worth of food
medicine, and humanitarian goods under the oil-for-food program.
	   The ministry of trade and industry said Wednesday the approval
of the latest 34 Jordanian contracts brought the total value of
exports to Iraq to dlrs 80 million since the program began in
December 1996.
	   The ministry said the contracts provided for the export of
vegetable oil, detergents and soap, medicine and medical equipment,
veterinary vaccine, antiseptics and plastic bags.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon has 313,000 vacant apartments and
offices, the government's Central Statistics Office said in a
report published in newspapers Wednesday.
	   The report, compiled after an 18-month census by the statistics
office, says there are some 200,000 empty houses and apartments and
113,000 empty non-residential units in the country.
	   At the same time, Lebanon is believed to have thousands of
people, often young people who are married or about to marry, who
cannot afford a home.
	   No figures are available for home-seekers, but earlier this year
the government decided to guarantee low interest or interest-free
loans for individuals wishing to buy apartments.
	   The housing glut stems from a haphazard construction boom in
1995-1997, when developers set out to replace or restore the
thousands of buildings that were destroyed or damaged during the
1975-90 civil war, the statistics office report said.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka snatched a thrilling
eight-run win over India in the last over of their 3-nation
Independence Cup cricket tournament match at the Sinhalese Sports
Club ground in Colombo on Wednesday.
	   Faced with a target of 172 in a game that was reduced to 36
overs due to wet conditions, the Indians caved in for a total of
163 as left arm spinner Sanath Jayasuriya plucked three wickets in
four balls in the final over.
	   The tourists were left with making 10 runs in the last over with
three wickets in hand but Jayasuriya gave Sri Lanka the win when he
had Anil Kumble stumped in the first ball for 4 and in the next
delivery sent back Robin Singh caught at mid-wicket for 50.
	   Singh and Ajit Agarkar (30) pulled out India from 75 for 6 with
a stand of 63 runs in 15.2 overs but victory for the tourists
seemed almost an impossibility after the latter was bowled by
Jayasuriya with the total at 138 in the 32nd over.
	   Singh, however, battled on to hit one six and two fours to bring
India near the target which later became far off when he was the
9th out with the total at 163.
	   The Indians got off to a forceful start producing 41 runs in the
first six overs but with the exit of Sachin Tendulkar, who gave
Kumara Dharmasena a return catch for 17, the tourists lost five
wickets in 4.2 overs for just 58 runs.
	   India earlier bowled to an effective line and length as the home
side kept losing wickets at regular intervals only to settle for a
score of 171 after Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss and invited the
Sri Lankans to take first lease of the wicket.
	   Paceman Ajit Agarkar produced best figures of 3 for 38 off eight
overs after striking in the first over of the innings when he had
Avishka Gunawardena caught at second slip Mohammed Azharuddin for a
``duck''.
	   Sanath Jayasuriya attempted to go on an all out onslaught but
was sent back at a time he looked dangerous when Hrishikesh
Kanitkar brought off a spectacular catch at deep square-leg diving
forward.
	   Jayasuriya hit three fours and one six and became the victim of
paceman Venkatesh Prasad who chipped in with two wickets which also
included the scalp of top scorer Aravinda de Silva for 62.
	   De Silva was the mainstay in the Sri Lankan innings playing 86
balls and stroking five fours after taking up position with the
total at 30 for 2 in the fifth over. He was adjudged
man-of-the-match for his knock which marked 50th time he hit the
half century mark in 229 one-day appearances.
	   Sri Lanka scored 58 runs in the first 10 overs but made a mere
21 runs in the last six overs.

World Cup: Dutch practice ``frustration toleration'' for Argentina
</HEADLINE>
clash &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Monaco (AP) _ The Netherlands will practice coping with
frustration before its quarterfinal clash against Argentina, coach
Guus Hiddink said Wednesday.
	   ``Frustration toleration is the name of the game,'' Hiddink
said, pointing to David Beckham's sending off as Argentina beat
England on penalties Tuesday to advance to the last eight.
	   ``We know what their norms are, and that they are very good at
inciting irritation,'' Hiddink added.
	   He urged FIFA and the match referee to be on the lookout for
such ploys. ``I think in this match they will have to be very
careful,'' he said.
	   The Dutch are susceptible to such tactics. Striker Patrick
Kluivert was sent off and suspended for two games after elbowing
Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' World Cup opener.
	   Staelens called Kluivert a rapist, the young AC Milan star
claimed. The comment referred to an allegation made against
Kluivert last year that he and a group of friends gang-raped a
woman in Amsterdam. Police investigated Kluivert but never charged
him in connection with the incident.
	   And Dennis Bergkamp was lucky to stay on the pitch in the
Netherlands' second round match against Yugoslavia Monday. He
appeared to stamp on Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic early in
the second half but the referee did not see the incident.
	   ``He was aggressive and I was aggressive too,'' Bergkamp said
Wednesday. France's Zinedine Zidane was sent off for a similar foul
against Saudi Arabia and suspended for two games.
	   Hiddink said he would talk to his players before the
quarterfinal about not rising to Argentine provocation.
	   ``They can play very sharply and provoke reactions. We must
avoid getting irritated.''
	   Although packed with talented stars like Bergkamp, Marc Overmars
and Jaap Stam, the Dutch team tends not to perform well when
players feel that they have been wronged by the referee.
	   Hiddink said that in training drills, he sometimes deliberately
makes bad calls to teach his players how to deal with
disappointment.
	   ``Our team is strong at playing good soccer but if there is an
injustice against us then we can get irritated.''

Belfast's new Assembly brings together enemies past and present
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with color as Assembly convenes; UPDATES that
Mallon sted Hume the Catholic leadership candidate; timing of
leadership vote uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Against the odds of history,
Northern Ireland's new Assembly convened Wednesday to elect a
Protestant leader and Catholic deputy and start down the slow road
of governing this divided country together.
	   Among the politicians gathered around the same table were
convicted IRA bombers and gun-runners, slayers of Catholic
civilians, retired cops and British soldiers _ and a camp of
Protestant hard-liners determined to scuttle the whole project.
	   In a symbol of the startlingly changed times, Mitchel
McLaughlin, the Catholic chairman of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, sat side by side chatting with Billy Hutchinson, who spent
16 years in prison for shooting two Catholics to death.
	   April's peace agreement struck around the same table by eight
parties specified that the Assembly's 108 members should make
decisions with the support of majorities of both its Catholic and
Protestant members.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of a 28-strong bloc of Protestants
opposed to the agreement, immediately signaled his determination to
make every step of decision-making a drawn-out fight Wednesday by
criticizing the Assembly's speaker for not informing the parties
how many of their members would be allowed to make speeches later.
	   The speaker, Lord Alderdice, ordered the meeting briefly
adjourned to allow each party's members to sign the Assembly's
official register, which required them to designate themselves as
Nationalist (Catholic), Unionist (Protestant) or Other.
	   The most fundamental compromise in the months ahead will be
agreeing which parties should hold which posts in a 12-member
administration called the Executive, which is expected to take over
six departments from the British government next year, including
education, economic development and health.
	   It may take months of haggling to appoint most of the Executive,
chiefly because most Protestant politicians refuse to let Sinn Fein
hold any posts unless the Irish Republican Army starts to disarm.
	   The peace agreement specifies that the IRA and truce-observing
paramilitary groups on the Protestant side should disarm by
mid-2000, something they all refuse to do.
	   Later Wednesday, politicians expect to vote on whether David
Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, should
become the Executive's first minister and Seamus Mallon, deputy
leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, its deputy first
minister.
	   Mallon's selection over the SDLP's leader, John Hume, surprised
some observers. Hume, a prime architect of the peace process, is
already a member of the British and European parliaments, while
Mallon has spent the past three years directing the SDLP
negotiating team.
	   As he arrived, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said that in a
``spirit of generosity'' his party's 18 members would vote for
Trimble, even though the Ulster Unionist leader has refused to
speak to him.
	   ``We want to be part of what we hope will be the beginning of a
new era for everyone who values the future of our children,'' Adams
said.
	   Under the Assembly's double-majority rules, the votes of Sinn
Fein aren't essential to pass decisions because the moderate SDLP
holds 24 seats in the two-party Catholic bloc.
	   On the more complex Protestant side, the voting situation is
precariously balanced. To deliver a majority of Protestants,
Trimble will need all of his 27 Ulster Unionist colleagues, a few
of whom oppose his acceptance of the agreement.
	   As insurance, Trimble has support from Hutchinson and David
Ervine of the Progressive Unionists, a party linked with the
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force, a gang that for three decades
treated the entire Catholic community as ``legitimate targets.''
	   The Sinn Fein benches included Adams and Martin McGuinness, whom
the history books credit as architects of the modern IRA; Gerry
Kelly, convicted of bombing London's Old Bailey courthouse in 1973;
and John Kelly, who helped arm the IRA at the start of its campaign
to abolish Northern Ireland in 1970.
	   In the Ulster Unionist ranks sat the party's deputy leader John
Taylor, who was shot 17 times by an IRA gunman in 1972 but somehow
survived.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A Finnish Air Force Hawk fighter plane
crashed Wednesday afternoon in Luopioinen, 170 kilometers (100
miles) north of Helsinki. Both pilots survived.
	   The pilots ejected from the aircraft after reporting an engine
failure, said rescue operations chief Seppo Mannikko at the Tampere
Rescue Station. They were later spotted near the burning fuselage,
he said.
	   Seven Finnish Hawks have crashed since their introduction in

EU says more work needed on Polish steel plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission broadly
welcomed Wednesday a Polish government plan to restructure and
privatize the country's steel industry in preparation for Poland's
membership of the European Union.
	   However, the EU executive body said it needed more information,
particularly on the planned sale of state-owned mills and
government subsidies to the industry.
	   ``The restructuring program will need to be further developed in
a number of areas,'' said a statement from the office of EU Foreign
Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek.
	   In particular, it said greater clarity was needed on the timing
and details of the planned privatization of Poland's two largest
steel mills Huta Katowice and Huta Sendzimira, which together
account for more than 60 percent of the industry.
	   The Polish government presented the plan to the EU on Tuesday
evening. It foresees cutting 40,000 of the 93,000 jobs in the
industry and aims at complete privatization of the industry by
2001.
	   The plan aims to make the Polish steel industry, which accounts
for 4.5 percent of the country's industrial production, independent
of government subsidies and able to compete in international
markets.
	   EU officials were pleased with Poland's decision to reduce
tariffs on EU steel imports from the current rate of 6 percent to 4
percent from Wednesday and the plan to scrap them altogether by
Jan. 1, 2000.
	   Poland, along with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Cyprus
and Estonia, is hoping to join the 15-nation EU early next decade.

KLA fighters regroup in western Kosovo after defeat

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanians' political meeting, Kinkel, U.S. talks

 &UR; With BC-Kosovo-Determined Rebels &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo on Wednesday in an attempt to stave off
Serbian security forces in the secessionist province.
	   After Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic
coal mine from the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday, the Albanians
moved west to the Drenica region, police said.
	   Foreign officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement.
	   U.S. diplomats have held several unpublicized meetings with
leaders of the KLA's political wing but have not been able to
persuade them to halt their attacks on Serb civilians or negotiate
a peaceful settlement.
	   In another sign that pacifist Albanian leaders may merge with
the militants, top Albanian politicians met Wednesday in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina in an attempt to plot a joint position toward
the KLA and win its cooperation.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the groups would become the KLA's
political wing.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   Serb forces recaptured the Belacevac mine Tuesday after two days
of nearly non-stop fighting in the nearby village. The mine is
strategically important because it supplies coal to the Obilic
power plant, which provides electricity to most of Kosovo.
	   The KLA attacked the Serb village of Drsnik, killing a
26-year-old villager, the Tanjug state news agency said. The
shooting lasted for several hours before the KLA withdrew, the
agency said.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of Kosovo's population.
	   In Germany on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
Kosovo Albanians shouldn't expect immediate NATO intervention. He
said no mandate was in sight from the U.N. Security Council,
because council members Russia and China oppose the move.
	   Kinkel also said that if Western nations intervene in Kosovo
without at least securing the support of Russia, it would damage
Russia's efforts to mediate in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``Therefore, one shouldn't awake illusory expectations in the
Kosovo Albanians that NATO will intervene tomorrow,'' Kinkel said
on Deutschlandfunk radio. He didn't want to speculate about whether
an intervention was ``a question of weeks or months.''

Burundi marks independence amid continuing conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Burundi's celebration of 36 years of
independence was tempered Wednesday by nearly five years of
violence that has claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people.
	   President Pierre Buyoya laid flowers at the grave of Prince
Louis Rwagasore, who was elected prime minister but assassinated by
political rivals three months before independence from Belgium in
January 1962.
	   Rwagasore's death proved to be a crucial event _ the lack of his
unifying influence led to open conflict between majority Hutus and
minority Tutsis.
	   Violence that flared again in 1993, has not subsided. More than
200,000 people, mostly civilians have died.
	   Last month, participants in the first all-party peace talks on
Burundi agreed to a cease-fire by July 20, and pledged to resolve
the country's often bloody conflicts through peaceful means.
	   But both sides subsequently said they have problems with the
accord.
	   Buyoya, a retired army major and a Tutsi who took power in a
coup in 1996, said he will continue to pursue peace, while pressing
for improvements to Burundi's economy.
	   The tiny coffee- and tea-growing country's development has been
stopped by a trade and transportation embargo imposed by
neighboring countries to force Buyoya to negotiate with rebels.
	   In a sign of continuing strained relations, Charles Mukasi,
leader of the hardline wing of the Tutsi UPRONA party, was trapped
in his office by a ring of soldiers during the celebrations
Wednesday. Mukasi is vehemently opposed to negotiations with the
rebels.
	   Also, between 20 and 30 Burundians are fleeing daily across the
border to Tanzania because they are uncertain about the truce, the
Guardian of Dar Es Salaam quoted the U.N. refugee agency as saying.
	   More than 160,000 Burundians are in six refugee camps around
Kigoma, Tanzania.

Yeltsin cancels high-speed rail link between Moscow, St.
</HEADLINE>
Petersburg &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin canceled the construction
of a controversial high-speed railway between Moscow and St.
Petersburg on Wednesday, a news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin's decree canceled previous mandates that ordered the
manufacture of rail cars and spelled out terms for creating a
company to manage the construction, Interfax said.
	   The government had a controlling stake in the company that was
to oversee the dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 8 billion project. Builders
planned to raise the money through loans and issuance of company
shares, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But the project, initiated in 1996, was opposed by
environmentalists almost immediately.
	   The proposed 650-kilometer (400-mile) link would have crossed
the Valdai National Park, possibly disrupting a watershed that
feeds the two biggest rivers in European Russia _ the Volga and the
Dnieper.
	   The presidential administration's newspaper, Rossiiskaya Gazeta,
also frequently criticized the project. It said reconstruction of
the existing 700-kilometer (440-mile) railway between Russia's two
largest cities would be far cheaper and environmentally safe.
	   Russia has an extensive rail network, but most trains are slow
and the equipment is antiquated. Many people rely on trains because
the country's highway system is even more dilapidated and
dangerous.

<TEXT>
	   PLUAKDAENG, Thailand (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. of the United States
and Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. officially opened a joint venture
auto assembly plant Wednesday in eastern Thailand.
	   The AutoAlliance (Thailand) Co. plant will produce Mazda
Fighter/B Series and Ford Ranger compact pickup trucks.
	   Annual production capacity is 100,000 completely built vehicles
and 35,000 component sets. Half of the completely built vehicles
and most of the component sets are expected to be exported.
	   In the booming mid-1990s, leading automakers like Ford decided
to set up or expand vehicle and parts manufacturing in Thailand,
using the country as an export center for Asia and beyond.
	   But the automotive industry, a leader in Southeast Asia and a
prime engine of domestic growth, suffered a shock in mid-1997 when
Asia's economic surge went into reverse.
	   ``We view the present economic situation in Thailand to be
short-term and we expect to see gradual recovery in the automobile
industry over the next two to three years,'' Ford Vice Chairman
Wayne Booker said at the launching ceremony.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who presided over the opening
of the dlrs 500 million plant, expressed gratitude for the
investment, which has created about 1,200 jobs.
	   Chuan said his government will continue efforts to make Thailand
an investor-friendly environment for automobile assembly and
production by restructuring tax and tariff structures.

Revolutionary Israeli solution for road accidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ More Israelis have been killed in road
accidents than in wars, and neither stiff fines nor publicity
campaigns have succeeded in preventing more deaths.
	   Now a Jerusalem car upholsterer is trying a novel solution _ a
mezuza, the little box containing passages from the Scriptures that
Jews traditionally nail to the door-posts of their homes.
	   Yaacov Vanunu has been installing mezuzas on the door-posts of
cars, just behind the driver's seat, for six dollars apiece.
Inside, written on a tiny piece of paper, is a verse from Psalm 91:
``For He has charged his angels to guard you wherever you go.''
	   Vanunu says he has already had plenty of buyers.

World Cup: Scalpers find rich pickings on streets of Paris
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Scalpers are transforming a stretch of the
boulevard that Parisians call the most beautiful in the world into
the central nervous system of an international black market network
for World Cup tickets.
	   Exploiting the enormous demand, and limited availability, of
tickets for the soccer tournament, scalpers can make tens of
thousands of francs a day by buying tickets on the famous Champs
Elysees and selling them to ticket agencies around the world,
especially in the United States.
	   ``This job is all about contacts with brokers back in the
States. I've been building them up for months,'' said a 21-year-old
Champs Elysees scalper who identified himself only as Robert from
Orlando, Florida. ``You can't just get on a plane to Paris and make
big money.''
	   And make big money he does.
	   On a good day, scalpers say that they can buy and sell up to 20
tickets, making a total profit that translates into thousands of
dollars.
	   The ultimate catch: tickets for the July 12 World Cup final,
which can be bought on the street for between 10,000 and 15,000
francs (dlrs 1,700-dlrs 2,500) and sold to ticket brokers for
double that amount.
	   The dozens of Champs Elysees scalpers _ almost all from Britain,
Canada and the United States _ ply their trade each day between the
Arc de Triomphe and the official World Cup store a few hundred
yards away.
	   They are a very different breed from the familiar scalpers who
normally make a few dollars buying and selling tickets outside
sports stadiums.
	   Tagged with ``I need tickets'' placards around their necks, the
normal routine in Paris is to negotiate prices with ticket sellers
on the street, before using a mobile phone to hawk the tickets to
brokers.
	   One New York ticket agency, Tickets USA, tells callers that
World Cup Final tickets are available for $6,000 and semifinal
places for $4,000, adding that it procures tickets from its
contacts on the street in Paris.
	   The company's Internet site says that it acquires tickets from
``personal and commercial outlets using contacts from private and
public segments.''
	   Back on the Champs Elysees, the most lucrative customers so far,
scalpers agree, have been Argentines, English, Jamaicans and most
of all Japanese.
	   ``The Japanese are absolutely crazy. All the scalpers here were
disappointed when they went out so early,'' says Brent, a scalper
from Toronto who has worked every Olympic Games and World Cup since
the early 1990s.
	   ``But this job is hard work,'' he adds. ``I am here at nine
o'clock every morning. And the longer the World Cup goes on the
more tire-kickers I get wasting my time.''
	   Scalpers say that ticket scandals that have dogged the World Cup
are encouraging more people to walk the streets in search of good
seats.
	   Among the official problems so far: Several travel agencies have
allegedly oversold tickets or failed to deliver them; executives at
the French arm of FIFA marketing partner ISL have been detained for
questioning over ticketing; the president of U.S. agency Prime
Sports International has been placed under judicial controls,
preventing him from leaving the country; and a volunteer for the
tournament's organizing committee was arrested in Lens last week
for selling tickets.
	   In addition to the controversies, the shortage of tickets for
foreign supporters also helped spur trade on the Champs Elysees. Of
the 2.6 million tickets, more than 962,000 were earmarked for
supporters in France, while FIFA's commercial partners snapped up
436,000.
	   Though illegal, the police turn a blind eye to the street trade
of tickets.
	   ``The police stopped me last week because they thought I was
dealing in drugs,'' said one scalper who identified himself only as
John, from Wilmslow, England. ``I had four grand (dlrs 6,400) on
me, but when they realized that I was selling tickets they let me
go. They've still got my money and I've hired a lawyer to get it
back.''
	   Whatever the risks, the scalping trade seems sure to continue
right up to July 12.
	   ``There are so many people in Paris who have come thousands of
miles without tickets, it is amazing,'' said scalper John. ``They
are desperate for tickets. Some of them will pay almost anything to
get their hands on them.''

Russia's highest court to rule on ``trophy art'' bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's highest court accepted President Boris
Yeltsin's request Wednesday to determine the constitutionality of a
law that would prevent the return of artwork looted by the Soviet
army at the end of World War II.
	   Yeltsin was forced to sign the law earlier this year, after his
veto was overridden by both houses of parliament, but he
immediately asked the Constitutional Court to determine its
validity.
	   Yeltsin argues that the ``trophy art'' law violates Russia's
constitution and international obligations, and does not
differentiate between art seized by the Soviet army and that seized
by the Nazis.
	   He also says that the procedure used for approving the bill in
parliament was incorrect, since many lawmakers voted for their
absent colleagues.
	   The court will decide on both issues, Judge Tamara Morshchakova
was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.
	   Germany and other countries have long demanded the return of
their art, and Yeltsin wants a free hand in negotiations.
	   Russian lawmakers fiercely oppose returning any of the art _ a
feeling shared by many Russians who see it as a rightful
compensation for the huge human, material and cultural losses
inflicted by the Nazis.
	   No date for a court hearing has been set.
	   In a separate case Wednesday, the court agreed to review an
inquiry by parliament's lower house into whether Yeltsin acted
legally earlier this year in renominating the same candidate for
prime minister three times, after his choice had been rejected by
parliament.
	   Yeltsin's repeated nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko was adamantly
protested by lawmakers. But under the threat of dissolution,
parliament caved in and approved him.

Muslim-Croat Federation Interior Ministry formally established
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix category code &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The multiethnic Ministry of
Interior in the Muslim-Croat half of Bosnia was inaugurated
Wednesday, in a blow to hard-liners wanting ethnically separate
police forces for different parts of the country.
	   First to receive certificates at the inauguration ceremonies
were Interior Minister Mehmed Zilic, a Muslim, and his Croat
deputy, Jozo Leutar.
	   The top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
called Wednesday's inauguration ``the laying of a foundation stone,
'' but suggested much needed to be done before a truly multi-ethnic
and professional force was operating at full efficiency.
	   ``Next will come the bricks and mortar, then the walls, the
floors and the ceiling,'' he said. ``And then, when the structure
is in place, the Ministry will open for business.''
	   The Dayton peace accords ending the Bosnian war called for a
multi-ethnic police force across the country, reflecting the
country's ethnic mix as recorded by the last pre-war census in
1991. By the war's end in late 1995, most parts of the country had
``ethnically pure'' Serb, Croat or Muslim police units, reflecting
who was controlling a particular area.
	   The agreement foresees a professional police force which will
serve the citizens regardless of their ethnicity. Such a force
would be a pre-requisite to guarantee the safety of returning
refugees.
	   Only two of 10 administrative regions of the Muslim-Croat half
of Bosnia _ both controlled by hard-line Croats _ remain
unintegrated. But in the Bosnian Serb half of the country, the
process is further behind schedule.

Egypt: Israel forces Palestinians to complain to Security Council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Palestinian-Jerusalem

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt said Wednesday that Israel's plan to
expand the boundaries of Jerusalem had forced Arabs to seek U.N.
Security Council condemnation.
	   ``This Israeli action was uncalled for and so the Arabs,
particularly the Palestinians, had to complain to the Security
Council,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
	   The Security Council began debating the Jerusalem plan Tuesday,
but shelved the issue without a vote.
	   Arab countries have strongly criticized Israel's plan, which was
introduced last month. They say it aims to change the city's status
quo before an agreement on its future can be reached.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sent a
message to President Clinton, asking him not to veto any Security
Council condemnation.

Uganda's rebel leader reportedly want a separate state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The leader of Uganda's main rebel group,
the Lord's Resistance Army, wants his own nation in the country's
north, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Joseph Kony's plan was contained in a letter delivered by one of
29 schoolgirls the rebels had abducted from Kitgum district, which
borders Sudan, the government-owned New Vision reported.
	   The letter, dated June 29, was reportedly addressed to Alphonse
Owiny Dollo, President Yoweri Museveni's Cabinet minister
responsible for northern Uganda's reconstruction and development.
	   The 29 girls were among 45 captives the rebels freed Sunday
following heavy fighting near the town of Kitgum, 335 kilometers
(210 miles) north of the capital, Kampala, military spokesman Gen.
Salim Saleh was quoted as saying by New Vision. Four LRA rebels
were killed.
	   New Vision said Kony's nation would be known as the Nile
Republic after the White Nile River, which originates from Lake
Victoria and flows through northern Uganda.
	   According to the letter, Kony asked four members of parliament
from northern Uganda to prepare for elections and the country's
split in November. None of the legislators support Kony.
	   New Vision said another Kony letter castigated religious leaders
for not caring enough about what he described as the suffering of
northern Ugandans. Many, however, accuse Kony of cruelties
committed against the Acholi people who live in the north.
	   Last Friday, religious leaders of all faiths in Uganda urged
Museveni to negotiate with the LRA and two other smaller
insurgences in the country's west and northwest. Museveni refuses
to negotiate with the rebels, whom he calls bandits.
	   Dollo described as a good gesture the release of the captives.
	   ``We appreciate this,'' New Vision quoted Dollo as saying
Thursday. ``We want it to be the beginning of a change of
direction.''
	   Dollo's hopes appeared premature.
	   The rebels abducted more than 30 people in Lira district south
of Kitgum on Tuesday and Wednesday, New Vision quoted district
police commander, Musa Echweru, as saying.
	   The LRA is a remnant of several insurgences that mushroomed in
Uganda after Museveni seized power in 1986 after a five-year bush
war.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nathan Minchey pitched a seven-hit shutout as the
Hiroshima Toyo Carp beat the Central League's front-running
Yokohama BayStars 11-0 at Yokohama Wednesday.
	   Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, is 7-6.
	   Carp pinch hitter Kojiro Machida hit a grand slam home run in
the seventh inning, his first homer of the season. Kenjiro Nomura
hit his seventh homer of the year in the eighth inning and Akira
Etoh hit No. 16 in the ninth, tying him for the league lead with
Hideki Matsui of the Yomiuri Giants.
	   The BayStars still are two games ahead of the Chunichi Dragons,
who moved into second place by beating the Hanshin Tigers 4-2 in 12
innings at Koshien Stadium.
	   In the top of the 12th, the Dragons' Takeshi Yamasaki doubled
home one run and So Tsutsui singled in another. Sun Dong-yol,
formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's professional
league, held the Tigers hitless in the bottom of the 12th for his
16th save.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Mitsuru Manaka stole home in the first
inning and hit a two-run home run in the four-run sixth inning as
the Yakult Swallows beat the Giants 7-2. Manaka has two homers.
	   In the Pacific League, Jerry Brooks slugged a home run in the
second inning and Satoru Kanemura pitched a two-hitter over seven
innings, leading the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters to a 3-0
victory over the second-place Kintetsu Buffaloes at Osaka Dome.
	   Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins, has 18 homers and
shares the league lead with teammate Yukio Tanaka.
	   The victory widened the Fighters' lead over the Buffaloes to
four games.
	   The Buffaloes' Tuffy Rhodes, formerly with Boston Red Sox, was
ejected in the ninth inning for using ``violent'' language over an
umpire's strike call.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Chihiro Hamana drove in the tie-breaking run in
the third inning with a grounder and Luis Lopez hit a home run in
the seventh as the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks beat the Orix BlueWave 6-2.
	   Lopez, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, has seven homers.
	   At Ishikawa, Tsutomu Itoh hit a three-run home run in the second
inning as the Seibu Lions beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 7-4 and
extended their winning streak to six. Itoh has three homers.
	   The Marines suffered their 13th straight defeat.

World Cup: Beckham blamed for England loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glenn Hoddle did not want to make David Beckham a
scapegoat for England's World Cup loss to Argentina _ but for many
fans, Beckham is a hero turned villain.
	   The 23-year-old midfielder was sent off in Tuesday night's
knock-out match for ``retaliating violently'' by kicking
Argentina's captain Diego Semeone.
	   England played the second half and 30 minutes of extra time with
10 players for a 2-2 draw. But the game was decided in a penalty
shoot-out and Argentina progressed to the quarterfinals.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper ran a front page headline reading:
``Moment of Lunacy that Cost Cup Hopes''.
	   The Sun said: ``Beck Home. David sent off _ then 10 heroes go
down fighting''. The Express used the banner: ``Heroes _ Hoddle's
10 men lose out as Beckham sees red''.
	   An editorial in the Express directed the blame for England's
loss at the Manchester United star.
	   ``David Beckham may moan and blame Argentine dirty tricks until
his dying day. But deep down he will know he let his country and
his team-mates down badly,'' the editorial said.
	   The Daily Mail said Beckham's ``petulant act of retaliation''
was not entirely out of character.
	   ``He fell foul of the referees in England last season after a
number of displays of dissent and indiscipline,'' the paper
reported.
	   Britain's domestic news agency said the England team was
magnificent but David Beckham was ``simply a disgrace''.
	   ``He should hang his head in shame after letting England down in
the biggest game of his life,'' the Press Association said.
	   ``He deserves to have the Three Lions stripped from his shirt
for an act of crass stupidity when he got himself sent off.''
	   England's first and most recent players to be sent off said
Beckham would live with his mistake forever.
	   Ray Wilkins, the last England player before Beckham to be sent
off in a World Cup game, told BBC Radio he had already spoken with
Beckham to console him.
	   Wilkins, sent off in Mexico in 1986, said he had to live with
his sending off for years.
	   ``Naturally he is very, very disappointed. I feel desperately
sorry for him,'' he said.
	   ``What he did was wrong but I thought it was a yellow card and
nothing more.''
	   Alan Mullery, the first player to be sent off for England, told
Beckham the send-off would live with him for life.
	   The former Fulham and Tottenham captain said he played 750 games
but people only remembered two _ in 1973 when he scored ``the goal
of the year'' and when he was sent off in 1968.
	   Mullery, who was capped 35 times for England including once as
skipper, said Beckham had been warned about this sort of behavior
in the past.
	   ``He did have this petulant attitude last year during Le Tournoi
and Glenn Hoddle mentioned to him that he had to curtail it or he
would be sent off, and consequently that has happened,'' he said.
	   ``I hope he can get over it, but he will be reminded of it by
all and sundry.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zvereva defeating Seles &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Monica Seles, failing to repeat her
inspiring run to the French Open final, lost in straight sets in
the Wimbledon quarterfinals Wednesday to Natasha Zvereva.
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, fell behind quickly and never recovered
as the unseeded Zvereva, known mainly as a doubles specialist,
moved her around the court and won 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
	   Zvereva, who ousted seven-time champion Steffi Graf last week,
beat Seles for the first time in five matches. She reached a Grand
Slam semifinal for the first time since her 6-0, 6-0 loss to Graf
in the 1988 French Open final.
	   Seles, whose father died in May after a long battle with stomach
cancer, reached the French Open final three weeks later, losing to
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   Seles won her first four Wimbledon matches in straight sets and
appeared to be a legitimate threat to win the only Grand Slam title
to elude her. But Zvereva, wearing red-tinted wrap-around sun
glasses, forced her into repeated errors and made her look
ordinary.
	   ``I just didn't feel anything was going well,'' Seles said. ``I
just couldn't put two points together today. ... I was missing my
backhand all over the place.''
	   Also advancing to the semifinals were defending champion Martina
Hingis and Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Hingis lost her first set of the tournament but outlasted French
Open champ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
	   The 1 hour, 46-minute match featured long baseline rallies and
seemed more appropriate to the clay of the French Open than the
grass of Wimbledon. Several times in the final set, Hingis appeared
tired and out of breath.
	   The fifth-seeded Spaniard, known for her tireless retrieving,
pushed Hingis to the brink as she saved nine consecutive break
points over the second and third sets.
	   Hingis finally converted on the 10th break point, ripping a
backhand pass that ended a long, corner-to-corner rally and gave
her a 4-2 lead in the third set. She raised her arms in triumph and
caught her breath by sitting on a linesman's chair at the back of
the court.
	   Although Sanchez Vicario broke back in the next game, Hingis won
the next two games to close out the match. She smiled with relief
and pumped both fists after hitting an inside-out forehand which
the Spaniard returned wide.
	   Hingis will face the winner of the quarterfinal between Venus
Williams and Jana Novotna.
	   Tauziat upset second-seeded Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 6-3 to reach
her first Grand Slam semifinal. The 16th-seeded Frenchwoman had
lost her last seven matches to the American.
	   ``That was, 9th graf

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's foremost opposition leader was
freed from internal exile Wednesday and returned to Kinshasa,
government officials said.
	   No reason was immediately given for Etienne Tshisekedi's
release, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Tshisekedi was arrested in February and banished to his home
village of Mupompa, about 700 kms (435 miles) west of the capital.

Palestinians divided over military attacks against Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians are divided over whether to
support armed attacks against Israel, according to a poll released
Wednesday.
	   The poll of 1,335 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
found that 50 percent of the respondents said they supported
military attacks on Israeli targets, while 45 percent said they
were opposed and 5 percent had no opinion. The question did not
specify military or civilian targets.
	   The level of support for violence was the highest since 1994,
according to the Center for Palestine Research and Studies, an
independent think tank in the West Bank city of Nablus that
conducted the poll.
	   In March 1996, following a series of suicide bombings by Islamic
militants that killed 53 Israelis, Palestinian support for attacks
on Israelis dropped to its lowest point _ 21 percent, according to
Khalil Shikaki, the center's director.
	   ``Two years of Netanyahu's rule have taken us back to 1994. He
destroyed the changes that took place in the Palestinian
psychological and political environment,'' Shikaki said.
	   About two-thirds of those polled said they did not believe a
permanent peace settlement with Israel could ever be reached. Less
than half of the respondents said they believed the seven-year-old
peace process would lead to a Palestinian state.
	   Despite the fact that half of those polled said their economic
situation had worsened since the peace process began, support for
the peace and for Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
remained high, 68 and 61 percent respectively, the center said.
	   The poll had a 3 percent margin of error.

Robinson urges Ethiopia to halt forced expulsions of Eritreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson on Wednesday
urged Ethiopia to stop expelling Eritrean nationals, saying it was
violating their human rights.
	   Robinson said she was particularly disturbed by the Ethiopian
practice of stamping the Eritreans' passports with the words
``expelled, never to return.''
	   ``These are serious violations of the rights and freedoms set
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' she said.
	   Robinson said Ethiopia's government should respect rights to
freedom of movement and non-discrimination enshrined in treaties it
had ratified.
	   Ethiopia has so far forced more than 2,520 of the 550,000
Eritreans living in the country to return to Eritrea, accusing some
of spying or raising funds for Eritrea's war chest.
	   In one expulsion exercise in late June, an Eritrean official
said Ethiopia forced 300 Eritreans across the border at Om Hajer,
in the country's southwest, and loaded 1,500 aboard northbound
buses for deportation.
	   Robinson urged the two countries' governments to restore
dialogue with each other to resolve their conflict over disputed
border territory.
	   Fighting which escalated on May 6 has claimed hundreds of lives.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says 60,000 Eritreans
have been displaced by the fighting.
	   The U.N. Security Council demanded last Friday that both sides
halt the conflict. It endorsed efforts by African leaders to end
the border conflict peacefully.
	   Ethiopia insists that Eritrea withdraw from disputed areas
before peace talks begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it is rightfully on land defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.

EU moves to tie African franc to euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union moved Wednesday to
ensure that the replacement of the French franc by the euro won't
undermine the financial stability of 15 African nations whose
currencies are linked to the franc.
	   Under proposals to be debated by EU finance ministers next
Monday, the French Treasury will defend a fixed parity between the
euro and the African nations' CFA franc in the same way as it now
backs the rate of 100 CFA francs to the French franc.
	   The exchange rate between the euro and the CFA franc will be
fixed when the EU's common currency is launched on Jan. 1. It will
be based on the rate at which the French franc is absorbed into the
euro.
	   The proposals, put forward Wednesday by the EU Commission, will
oblige France to keep EU institutions informed of any plans to
change the exchange rate between the euro and the CFA franc.
	   Despite assurances from France, the impending demise of the
franc has provoked fears in CFA nations that they could fall victim
to the kind of wild financial instability that often plagues
African countries without a peg to a strong Western currency.
	   The CFA franc is used by Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon,
Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Chad.
	   The proposed EU rules would also apply to the franc of the
Comoros islands off Africa's southeastern coast which is fixed at
75 to one French franc.

HBO offers Holyfield dlrs 20 million for unification fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix byline.
 &UR; BY JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Home Box Office television network has offered
Evander Holyfield dlrs 20 million to fight Lennox Lewis to unify
the world heavyweight boxing titles.
	   HBO spokesman Seth Abraham said Holyfield, IBF and WBA world
heavyweight title holder, had asked for dlrs 20 million for the
fight and now he had no reason not to take it.
	   ``The only reason this fight will not go ahead is if Evander
Holyfield does not want it,'' Abraham said when he announced the
offer in London on Wednesday.
	   The offer was sent to Holyfield in writing.
	   Abraham said Holyfield's contractual obligations with his
promoter Don King and the Showtime network did not prevent him from
fighting WBC champion Lennox Lewis.
	   ``I believe he wants this fight. It's what everyone
wants...except Don King. King is the only obstacle to this fight,''
he said.
	   ``What we want to see is the reunification - this would be the
only unified crown in world boxing.''
	   ``Evander's record of accomplishment would be spoiled without a
fight against the only man who is his true peer today _ his equal
in the heavyweight ranks,'' he added.
	   Abraham said the venue _ either of two venues on the US east
coast _ the date, either Dec. 5 or Dec. 12, and the purse can be
guaranteed.
	   ''We should agree that this Holyfield-Lewis match is an
important one to lift our sport. We should arrange it for this
purpose alone,'' he said.
	   ''We seek no options of any sort on future prizefights of
Holyfield. Ours is a one-fight proposition and offer.''
	   The promoters are billing the bout as the fight fans have been
waiting to see since 1992, when Riddick Bowe trashed the WBC title
belt after failing to fight Lewis _ then a challenger.
	   Lewis is expected to earn dlrs 10 million if Holyfield agrees to
put his WBA and IBF world title belts on the line for the
unification prize fight.
	   HBO also announced Wednesday it had completed a seven fight deal
with Lewis, commencing with his WBC defense against Croatia's
Zeljko Mavrovic on the Indian Reservation Foxoods, Connecticut, on
Sept. 26.
	   Lewis' second scheduled fight in the new deal is the proposed
unification fight in December. He will fight at least two fights on
the HBO network per year until 2000.
	   HBO senior vice president Lou DiBella said Lewis' contract was
the most lucrative HBO had signed with any current boxer, including
Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones Jr and Prince Naseem Hamed.
	   Lewis could earn up to dlrs 100 million under the seven-fight
agreement, the projected figure based on a successful record and
his cut of potential pay-per-view earnings.
	   Lewis' manager Frank Maloney said the seven-fight deal was a
lucrative contract for Lennox but also demonstrated the value HBO
placed in him.
	   However, he was not convinced the unification fight between
Holyfield and Lewis was a certainty.
	   Maloney told British cable television network L!VE TV the
chances of the fight going ahead were about as good as England
winning the soccer World Cup _ England bowed out of the World Cup
the previous night.

Hong Kong marks year of reversals in subdued handover anniversary

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong marked the end of its turbulent first
year under Chinese rule Wednesday with Beijing pledging anew not to
interfere in its affairs, but promising help through a period of
economic turmoil.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin told Hong Kong's 6.5 million people Beijing has honored
the ``one country, two systems'' pledge to allow the territory to
manage its own affairs.
	   And Tung, Beijing's choice to run Hong Kong, told a banquet that
China has become a source of stability while the territory is being
rattled by the region's financial crisis. In its effort to dig
itself out of Asia's recession, he said earlier, Hong Kong would
promote cooperation with the mainland, particularly its dynamic
southern regions.
	   Hong Kong people have come to realize ``the mutual dependence
and important relationship'' with Beijing, Tung said.
	   Just a year ago, most leaders would try to avoid linking the two
places together in public because most people feared that China
would limit political freedoms and control Hong Kong's affairs.
Martin Lee, the de facto opposition leader, was shut out of most
official handover festivities, and protested outside of the
legislature minutes after the change of sovereignty. About 3,000
people joined him in a rally on the first day of Chinese rule,
which they said was the first test of Hong Kong's tolerance of
dissenting voices.
	   However, illustrating the surprises that unfolded in the first
year after the handover, Lee and his allies _ some fresh from
protests against the Hong Kong and Beijing leaders _ attended the
banquet, and joined in a toast with Tung and Jiang.
	   The economy, which everyone considered to be rock-solid a year
ago, turned out to be Hong Kong's greatest worry.
	   Lee, writing in the English-language South China Morning Post,
said Hong Kong residents had fought efforts to limit their
freedoms.
	   ``In this historic first year as part of China, Hong Kong people
_ who many had long suggested were interested only in their wallets
_ shattered the myth they cared nothing for their rights and
freedoms,'' Lee wrote.
	   About 150 protesters marched through crowded downtown Hong Kong,
saying they had no reason to celebrate.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the populist Frontier movement, said
government officials have made no promises to speed up democratic
reforms, and they have ``no coherent policies'' to lift Hong Kong
out of its economic troubles. Unemployment is at a 15-year high,
and the stock market's key index is down by half.
	   Other groups appeared outside the convention center that juts
into the harbor, where Tung was host at the banquet.
	   One group called for Jiang's resignation and a reassessment by
the Beijing leadership of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The group
carried a traditional Chinese coffin to honor those who died at
Tiananmen. After several attempts to lift the coffin over a police
cordon, the group set the coffin on fire.
	   While officials celebrated the first anniversary of the handover
with ceremonies, including a morning flag-raising ceremony and a
march of People's Liberation Army troops after the banquet, the day
went by quietly for most residents.
	   ``The flag has changed, but everything else is the same. The
most important thing is to make enough money for a decent living,''
said 47-year-old C.F. Lau, a medicine salesman.
	   Hong Kong and Beijing leaders said they were confident of Hong
Kong's future. Jiang, fresh from his summit with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, said, ``The policy of one country, two systems is a
guarantee for the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong.''
	   He said it also could show the way for reunification with Taiwan
_ perhaps the most contentious issue of all. The island
categorically rejects reunification with China under terms similar
to those given Hong Kong.
	   Jiang will dedicate Hong Kong's new dlrs 20 billion
international airport before going home Thursday. Clinton is to
arrive at the airport just hours later for a brief visit ending his
tour of China.

EU moves against credit card crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission launched an
initiative Wednesday to tackle the growing problem of fraud
involving credit cards, checks, electronic banking and other
non-cash payment methods.
	   The European Union's executive body said it would seek agreement
among the 15 EU nations for a common front against such crime.
Almost dlrs 3 billion is lost each year through card crime, the
Commission estimated.
	   ``Crime involving cards and other new methods of payments are
becoming more and more international,'' said the EU's Internal
Affairs Commissioner Anita Gradin.
	   She said laws on electronic payment crimes varied greatly from
country to country within the EU and said the 15 nations should
harmonize their legislation by the end of 1999 to tighten action
against payment fraud.
	   ``The differences in national legislation make it very difficult
to investigate and prosecute cross-border crime,'' Gradin told a
news conference.
	   Measures should also be taken to increase cooperation between
law enforcement agencies on fighting payment fraud and to increase
public awareness of the problems, she said.

Photographers blame Mexico City workers for beating them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City newspapers whose photographers
were beaten while covering the eviction of squatters from a
downtown building said Wednesday that city workers were to blame.
	   Police arrested five men accused in the attack Tuesday. Daily
papers La Jornada, Novedades and El Universal said the men appeared
to be city employees who had been contracted to evict a family of
squatters.
	   However, officials of the Mexico City borough where the attack
occurred denied that city workers were at fault and said the only
employees at the scene were there taking care of a dangerous hive
of bees.
	   The reports said city workers hired by an actuary to evict the
family turned on the photographers when they began taking pictures,
injuring about six of them. A police patrol arrived and arrested
the men.
	   Photographer Carlos Ramirez of Novedades, was treated at a local
hospital for cuts; other photographers suffered less serious
injuries. La Jornada said damage to their cameras and equipment
totaled dlrs 6,700.

Swiss government deplores class-action suit against central bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's government Wednesday
called ``unacceptable'' a U.S. suit by Holocaust victims against
the country's central bank.
	   The class-action suit against the Swiss National Bank, which is
charged with maintaining the strength of Switzerland's currency,
was filed Monday in Washington, D.C.
	   Seeking damages for Switzerland's acceptance of Nazi gold stolen
from Holocaust victims, it was filed by two of the lawyers in a
similar multibillion dollar suit against the commercial banks.
	   The move is ``factually unjustified, politically unacceptable
and legally untenable,'' said Achille Casanova, spokesman for the
ruling coalition cabinet, the Federal Council.
	   Casanova said the government, which is uninvolved in the
lawsuit, supports the bank in its determination to fight the suit
vigorously and rejection of any negotiations with class-action
lawyers.
	   But the cabinet has taken no steps to support the bank in
opposing legal action as that would be ``rash,'' Casanova said.
	   Casanova's comments came as the largest commercial Swiss banks
were attending a sanctions meeting in New York.
	   Threats of sanctions on the banks by key U.S. cities and states
were suspended earlier this year after the banks agreed to
negotiate with Jewish organizations and class-action lawyers on a
settlement of claims by Holocaust victims.
	   But Jewish representatives in the negotiations reacted angrily
last month when the banks offered a settlement of dlrs 600 million.
	   Both the claimants' groups and the banks accused each other of
violating a confidentiality agreement on the two-month-old
negotiations, mediated by Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat.
	   A series of historical studies in recent months have said the
central bank should have known that much of the gold it accepted
from Nazi Germany during World War II had been looted from the
national treasuries of occupied countries.
	   An independent panel of historians reported in Switzerland last
May that the bank also had received 119.5 kilograms (263.4 pounds)
of gold melted down from the possessions of concentration camp
victims. But the historians said they had no evidence the bank knew
the source of that gold.

Child slain for pilfering apricots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The owner of an apricot orchard stabbed and killed
a 4-year-old girl after she began picking and eating fruit on his
property Wednesday, a news agency reported.
	   The girl and a 6-year-old companion were eating apricots in the
orchard of a 33-year-old man in the village of Krasnoye in the
Crimea, 650 kilometers (400 miles) south of the Ukrainian capital,
Kiev.
	   When the man saw what the girls were doing, he dragged the
younger one into the street and stabbed her to death, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The man has been arrested but may not go to jail because he
suffers from schizophrenia. Doctors will now decide if he is fit to
stand trial, ITAR-Tass said.

<TEXT>
	   LYON (AP) _ Thieves took off with the royal luggage while Prince
Albert of Monaco was enjoying the World Cup.
	   Three suitcases where stolen from the lobby of the hotel where
the prince was staying while he was in Lyon to watch France play
Denmark on June 24th.
	   The theft was reported to Lyon police. The contents of the
suitcases were not disclosed.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ What's the difference between winning the World Cup
and finishing second?
	   Absolutely nothing, at least in terms of prize money.
	   ``Every team gets a million Swiss francs _ about 658 thousand
dollars _ for every match they play,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said Wednesday. That translates into about dlrs 2 million for the
three first-round games that everyone gets to play.
	   Therefore, the World Cup champion and runner-up will each get 7
million Swiss francs (dlrs 4.6 million) because they both play 7
matches. There is no bonus for the team that wins the Cup.
	   When a team qualifies for the World Cup, its national
federations get a fee of 750,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 493,000) to
help with preparation costs.
	   FIFA also helps out with the hotel costs and the daily allowance
for the national delegations of up to 45 people. They get 375 Swiss
francs (dlrs 247) a day per person.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some French bar owners want compensation from
English authorities because they had to close early for fear of
hooligan violence.
	   Bars were forced to close at 11 p.m. in Saint-Etienne on Tuesday
night to deter potential riots by English fans after the
England-Argentina World Cup game, according to the French sports
daily L'Equipe.
	   ``If the our legal services confirm it, we will fight England
for damages,'' said Andre Daguin, president of a federation of
hotels and bar owners.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French and German soccer federations are
putting on a special match to raise money for French policeman
David Nivel.
	   Nivel has been in a coma since being attacked by German soccer
hooligans after the June 21 Germany-Yugoslavia game in Lens.
	   The German veterans will be coached by Franz Beckenbauer, while
the French side will be managed by Jean Tigana.
	   The match will be played in Paris on July 11, the day before the
World Cup final, and will feature former international players for
France and Germany, FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper announced
Wednesday.

Robinson urges Ethiopia to halt forced expulsions of Eritreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson on Wednesday
urged Ethiopia to stop expelling Eritrean nationals, saying it was
violating their human rights.
	   Robinson said she was particularly disturbed by the Ethiopian
practice of stamping the Eritreans' passports with the words
``expelled, never to return.''
	   ``These are serious violations of the rights and freedoms set
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' she said.
	   Robinson said Ethiopia's government should respect rights to
freedom of movement and non-discrimination enshrined in treaties it
had ratified.
	   Ethiopia has so far forced more than 2,500 of the 550,000
Eritreans living in the country to return to Eritrea, accusing some
of spying or raising funds for Eritrea's war chest.
	   In one expulsion exercise in late June, an Eritrean official
said Ethiopia forced 300 Eritreans across the border at Om Hajer,
in the country's southwest, and loaded 1,500 aboard northbound
buses for deportation.
	   Fighting which escalated on May 6 has claimed hundreds of lives.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says 60,000 Eritreans
have been displaced by the fighting.

EU bans fish products from dozens of countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union banned Wednesday the
import of fish and other sea-food from about 50 countries and
territories, saying they provide inadequate information on hygiene
standards.
	   Countries affected are mostly poor and not major fish exporters.
The move will affect only about one percent of total EU fish
imports, an EU official said.
	   The biggest fish exporters to the EU on the list were the Dutch
Antilles, Vanuatu, Ukraine and Belarus, which together shipped
about 12,700 tons of fish to the EU in 1996.
	   EU fish imports that year totalled three million tons of fish,
worth dlrs 8.8 billion.

Government present broadcast regulation plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's government on Wednesday presented
a new law it hopes will prevent monopolies from controlling
emerging broadcast media.
	   Press Minister Dimitris Reppas said his Socialist government
wants to establish a European standard for regulating new broadcast
markets, specifically digital television.
	   ``We believe we have a legal framework that conforms to our aims
to serve citizens with free and open access to a wide variety of
radio and television services with as low a cost as possible,''
Reppas said.
	   He added the government is seeking to avoid the time-consuming
and often difficult conflicts that have accompanied the emergence
of digital television in other European countries.
	   Most recently, the European Union in May blocked a subscriber
digital television joint venture between Kirch Group and
Bertelsmann AG in Germany.
	   Reppas announced that the state television network will own the
controlling share in the digital television platform, but that
private companies also will be allowed to own shares.
	   Licensing regulations will limit the number of broadcast
licenses a single company or shareholder can control.
	   ``We're making a very important step, placing ourselves in the
forefront of the European Union for establishing a structure to
deal with the problems that arise with the development of this new
field,'' Reppas said.
	   A media consortium that runs the nation's largest television
station has sought to begin a subscriber digital television
platform since the beginning of the year.
	   The consortium has in the past accused the government of
stifling free competition and threatened to sue in the European
Court. It had no comment on the proposed bill.
	   The bill will be debated in Parliament before it closes for the
summer July 14.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister beseeched parliament
Wednesday to approve the Kremlin's economic rescue plan, warning
that the economy has lost much of the little ground it gained and
is again on the skids.
	   But lawmakers in the opposition-dominated parliament made clear
they do not trust President Boris Yeltsin and would not
rubber-stamp his administration's proposals.
	   ``This government's course is bankrupt,'' said Communist Party
chief Gennady Zyuganov, head of parliament's largest faction. ``We
must either change it or the end is very close.''
	   In an address to lawmakers, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko laid
out the economy's troubles in stark terms. Gross domestic product
has declined 0.2 percent in the first five months of this year, he
said, eroding the modest 0.8 percent gain the economy posted last
year _ the first since the Soviet collapse.
	   He urged lawmakers to swiftly pass a package of 26 bills the
administration has compiled to trim spending, increase revenue and
win a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Kiriyenko warned that the economy is sinking too rapidly to
indulge in ideological debates.
	   ``The suggested measures are not political ones,'' he said.
``They are necessary for every political party. It is clear what we
need to do.''
	   But lawmakers from a variety of factions said they have no
confidence in the administration and will pick and choose among the
bills, amending those to which they object.
	   ``We won't accept the majority of rigid measures the government
insists on,'' said ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of
parliament's third-largest faction.
	   Communists and the other hard-liners who dominate parliament
have consistently opposed spending cuts, arguing that the
government should spend more to help struggling individuals and
industries. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
meant that millions of Russians get their wages months late.
	   Zyuganov said his party is likely to support only a portion of
the government's proposals _ those that lower tax rates and assist
industry. Even the pro-government Our Home is Russia block said
they were likely to pass the bills only with some amendments.
	   The parliament has a pattern of rhetorically opposing Yeltsin
but giving in to his pressures at the last minute. Moreover, many
of the measures have already been implemented by presidential
decree.
	   All the same, lawmakers' negative comments were unlikely to calm
Russia's skittish stock market, which has lost half its value since
the beginning of the year and has been dropping fairly steadily for
the past two months.
	   The pattern continued Wednesday, with the stock market closing
about 4 percent lower. Gary Kinsey, a trader at Brunswick Warburg
brokerage in Moscow, said the markets are convinced the key to a
Russian recovery will be a new IMF loan.
	   The government says they need at least dlrs 10 billion to shore
up the Central Bank's reserves, strained by the effort of
supporting the ruble. If the currency is devalued, the Kremlin
fears higher prices could cause social and political unrest.
	   Duma deputies are scheduled to leave town on Friday to begin
their summer recess. Some of the bills may get preliminary approval
before then, but others may wait until a special session set to
begin July 15.

KLA fighters regroup in western Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanian claim that KLA still holds mine, scene

 &UR; With BC-Kosovo-Determined Rebels
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo on Wednesday in an attempt to stave off
Serbian security forces in the secessionist province.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured a strategic coal mine region from the
Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday. Reporters at Belacevac and Hade,
the two towns just a few hundred meters (yards) from the coal mine
saw the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no signs of fighting or
a heightened state of alert.
	   But the Albanian side denied that fighters in the Kosovo
Liberation Army were forced to pull back.
	   ``The open-pit mine is still controlled by the KLA,'' said the
Kosovo Information Center, which is closed to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership. ``Claims from Serb sources are not correct
that Serb forces have established control over this mine.''
	   It listed casualties in the Belasevac region over the last two
days of fighting as three dead and two wounded fighters, and a
child and an adult dead and six other civilians wounded.
	   Albanian sources also claimed that the rebels have completely
surrounded Klina, a government-controlled town in the central
Drenica region, cutting off access to Pec to the southwest. That
report also could not be confirmed.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and small
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement.
	   U.S. diplomats have held several unpublicized meetings with
leaders of the KLA's political wing but have not been able to
persuade them to agree to halt their attacks on Serb civilians or
negotiate a settlement of their conflict.
	   In another sign that pacifist Albanian leaders may merge with
the militants, top Albanian politicians met Wednesday in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina in an attempt to plot a joint position toward
the KLA and win its cooperation.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the political groups would become
the KLA's political wing.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population, also participated in the meeting but refused comment
afterward. With support growing for the armed radicals, Rugova, who
is also backed by the United States and its allies, might be forced
to cooperate with the KLA.
	   Serb forces said they recaptured the Belacevac mine region
Tuesday after two days of nearly non-stop fighting in the village.
The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to the
nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most of
Kosovo.
	   Along with Belacevac, Serbian media have suggested the other
goal of this week's offensive was to break the 2-week-old standoff
at Kijevo.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, the crossroads village has been a flashpoint since the
KLA surrounded it earlier this month and cut off its Serb
inhabitants and police. The Albanian fighters themselves were
surrounded by Serb police checkpoints.
	   On Wednesday, no fighting was reported in the Kijevo area. The
KLA attacked the Serb village of Drsnik, killing a 26-year-old
villager, the Yugoslavia's Tanjug state news agency said. The
shooting lasted for several hours before the KLA withdrew, the
agency said.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serb rule.
	   In Germany on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
Kosovo Albanians shouldn't expect immediate NATO intervention. He
said no mandate was in sight from the U.N. Security Council for
such an intervention, because council members Russia and China
oppose the move.
	   Kinkel also said that if Western nations intervene in Kosovo
without at least securing the support of Russia, it would damage
Russia's efforts to mediate in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``Therefore, one shouldn't awake illusory expectations in the
Kosovo Albanians that NATO will intervene tomorrow,'' Kinkel said
on Deutschlandfunk radio. He didn't want to speculate about whether
an intervention was ``a question of weeks or months.''

Six ``spy mailbox'' satellites work fine in wrong orbit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six ``spy mailbox'' satellites that relay secret
messages to and from intelligence agents are fully operational even
though they were placed in the wrong orbit, a spokesman from the
Strategic Missile Service said Wednesday.
	   The satellites ``have attained an orbit that allows us to use
them in their full capacity,'' spokesman Alexander Buchin told The
Associated Press.
	   The six satellites were launched June 16 from the Plesetsk
cosmodrome in northwestern Russia, but a failure _ either a faulty
engine or tainted fuel _ put them in the wrong orbit.
	   After tinkering with the satellites' settings, the military was
able to adjust them to work in the lower, elliptical orbit.
	   The satellites are believed to be Strela-3s, commonly known as
``space mailboxes for Russian spies.''
	   Strela-3 satellites are used to record and relay radio messages
between Russian agents and intelligence headquarters in Moscow.

Smith rejects Sheffield Wednesday for Everton job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Walter Smith signed a three-year deal
to manage English Premier League team Everton on Wednesday _ the
day he was expected to agree to terms with a rival team.
	   The former Rangers boss replaces Howard Kendall at Goodison and
will take Archie Knox, his assistant at Ibrox, with him.
	   Smith was on the brink of signing with Sheffield Wednesday but
pulled out of the deal in favor of the job at Everton.
	   He is Everton's fourth manager in four years, following in the
footsteps of Mike Walker, Joe Royle and Kendall.
	   Smith, who left Rangers after nine successive championships, was
criticized by Sheffield Wednesday for backing out on his commitment
to take the post at Hillsborough.
	   But Smith said he had not let Wednesday down and had explained
his decision to the club's chairman.
	   ''(Sheffield Wednesday) made me a good offer but nothing had
been agreed and the fact that I've chosen Everton speaks volumes,''
he said.

World Cup: French top-scorer Henry doubtful for Italy game Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Preparing to face one of the
toughest defenses at the World Cup, France may have to do without
top marksman Thierry Henry.
	   Henry, who has scored three goals in the tournament, nursed a
sprained left ankle Wednesday and is uncertain to make Friday
afternoon's kickoff against Italy at the Stade de France in
Saint-Denis.
	   ``I don't know whether he can play,'' said French coach Aime
Jacquet of his 20-year-old forward, who has been the French
revelation of the tournament so far.
	   Henry sprained the ankle during the second-round victory over
Paraguay on Sunday.
	   ``If I can, I will play,'' Henry said. ``If not, we are not
going to take any risks.''
	   Jacquet, however, will be able to count on star playmaker
Zinedine Zidane, back after sitting out a two-game suspension for
kicking an opponent in France's opening match against Saudi Arabia.
	   Goalkeeper Fabien Barthez also put a scare into the team
Wednesday when he abruptly stopped training because of pain to his
right thigh. He was kicked during Sunday's game, but should be fine
by Friday.
	   Midfielder Emmanuel Petit, who left the Paraguay game with a
pain in his right hamstring, is recovering well and should be ready
to play alongside captain Didier Deschamps.
	   In what is widely expected to be an extremely close game with
little space available, the French hope Zidane will finally start
working his magic.
	   ``I have forgotten everything that has passed, and now I will do
the utmost to continue the French adventure,'' said Zidane. ``Now
that I am off the bench, I will try to give something back.''
	   After earning his red card against the Saudis, the Juventus
midfielder vowed it would not happen again, whatever the
provocations. There could be a few on Friday, when he is expected
to be man-marked by either Dino Baggio or Juventus teammate
Gianluca Pessotto.
	   ``Whoever, it will be really tough,'' Zidane said.
	   Jacquet is convinced Zidane will not have a second moment of
rash anger.
	   ``He faces provocations in each game,'' the coach said.
	   The whole of Italy's defensive strategy will be centered on
Zidane, who has had two sterling seasons in Serie A.
	   While Zidane is more than match-fit after a two-week forced
rest, the other French players are still recovering from the
114-minute ordeal against Paraguay. France won 1-0 with the World
Cup's first ``golden goal.''
	   ``Many suffered badly, but the recovery is going well now,''
said Jacquet.
	   Jacquet lamented the extra day of rest the Italians had at their
disposal. Italy beat Norway 1-0 on Saturday in just 90 minutes.

Germany's high-speed trains almost back on schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German high-speed trains have returned
to a nearly normal schedule, Deutsche Bahn announced Wednesday,
four weeks after an InterCity Express train derailment and crash
killed 100 people.
	   The German railway also said that 17 of the 59 first-generation
ICEs _ the model that crashed _ have been modified with new wheel
systems. A cracked wheel rim was blamed for the June 3 accident,
Germany's deadliest postwar rail disaster.
	   First-generation wheel rims are made of several components. The
railway is replacing them with the single-component wheel rims,
believed to be safer, used on the second-generation ICEs.
	   Trains needing new wheels have been temporarily replaced with
slower, InterCity trains. Passengers must expect some delays and
may have to switch trains on some routes, Deutsche Bahn said.
	   There are still limits on reservations for the high-speed train
network, which links Germany's major cities. The train that crashed
in the northern village of Eschede was on the line connecting
Hamburg to Hanover.

Witness: bridge collapse caused by engineering problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A footbridge that collapsed as
Australian athletes marched to the opening ceremony of the
Maccabiah Games, killing four team members, could hold less weight
than it was designed to carry, an engineering professor testified
Wednesday.
	   The bridge was designed to carry 250 kilograms per square meter,
Yitzhak Sheinman, a professor of engineering at the Technion
Institute, told the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court.
	   ``But what we found in practice was that it could carry only 157
kilograms per square meter, '' he said.
	   In fact, because of other design and construction flaws, the
bridge could not handle even that much weight. It buckled as about
100 Australian athletes crossed over it last July 14, plunging them
into the polluted Yarkon River below and injuring dozens.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   Rami Karagula, a lawyer for the bridge contractors, showed the
Sheinman computer-generated sketches from the engineer's plan in an
attempt to show that the planning _ especially of the bridge
support columns _ was at fault in the bridge collapse.
	   Sheinman said it was unclear from the sketches exactly what sort
of columns the engineer had intended, but that in principle, the
engineer, ``is responsible for all the instructions given to the
contractors.''
	   Sheinman also testified that his investigation had not been able
to determine whether a critical pipe was bent before or during the
bridge collapse.
	   However, he said, ``A tab at the end of the pipe was sheared
off, showing signs of advanced corrosion ... which one may assume
was caused before the bridge collapsed.''
	   The trial is set to resume next Monday. The prosecution is
scheduled to wind up its case in two weeks, and the defense will
begin presenting its case in September.

United Nations hits Angola's former rebels with new sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Angola's former rebels came under strong
new U.N. sanctions Wednesday after failing to abide by terms of the
1994 peace plan.
	   The sanctions freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts, ban its
diamond exports and prevent all air and water transport into and
out of rebel-held territories.
	   The Security Council approved the sanctions last month to punish
UNITA for failing to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government and take major steps to demilitarize its armed
forces.
	   UNITA agreed to do so as part of the 1994 peace agreement signed
with the government in Lusaka, Zambia, to end the two-decade civil
war. But U.N. officials have complained that UNITA has consistently
stalled in carrying out the pledge.
	   The latest deadline to comply was Wednesday and the triggering
of sanctions was automatic, U.N. spokesman Yasuhiro Ueki said.
	   ``Obviously, we always hope that they will see their way to
completing the Lusaka protocol and peace agreement, but all
evidence to date suggests that this is not what they intend to
do,'' said David Wimhurst, associate spokesman for the U.N.
observer mission in Angola.
	   The sanctions come as the United Nations tries to regroup its
mission following the death of the special U.N. envoy to Angola,
Mali-born Alioune Blondin Beye. He was one of eight people killed
in a plane crash Friday in Ivory Coast,
	   The U.N. envoy for Africa's Great Lakes region, Berhanu Dinka,
was travelling to Luanda this week to ensure a smooth transition,
Wimhurst said. Bernard Miyet, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
peacekeeping, was also going to be in the region.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace pact. He threatened to resign last
month, saying neither UNITA nor the Angolan government had the
``political will'' to fully comply with the accord, sources have
said.
	   After meeting with the rebels in the Angolan capital, Luanda,
Beye told the Security Council last week that UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi had ``expressed his willingness to cooperate'' in the
transfer of four designated localities by the new deadline.
	   However, UNITA made no progress in fulfilling its pledge,
Wimurst said.
	   The sanctions are the third set that the council has slapped on
UNITA for failing to abide by the peace plan. An embargo on weapons
and petroleum imports has been in place since 1993 and a ban on
travel for the UNITA leadership was imposed in October.
	   Wimhurst and other U.N. officials acknowledged that it would be
very difficult to enforce the new sanctions _ particularly the one
on diamond exports. The movement earns hundreds of millions of
dollars a year on its diamond trading.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought against the government for
nearly two decades following Angola's 1975 independence from
Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

center &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: SUB 5th graf to add Barshefsky predicting $60 billion deficit &QL; 
 &UR; BY LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Praising the ``ingenuity and energy'' of
China's cosmopolitan center of capitalism, President Bill Clinton
urged his communist hosts Wednesday to open markets, battle
corruption and clean up the environment.
	   ``For China, as for America, the promise for the future lies in
helping our citizens to master the challenges of the global
economy, not to deny them or run away from them,'' Clinton told
American business leaders before touring Shanghai's gleaming new
stock market.
	   Speaking in the sun-streaked atrium of a high-rise hotel,
Clinton called on China to open its markets. And he expressed
disappointment that he and President Jiang Zemin failed to reach
agreement on lowering trade barriers and other economic reforms,
conditions that must be met before China gains entry into the World
Trade Organization. ``But we'll keep working at it until we reach a
commercially viable agreement,'' he added.
	   While pushing Congress to renew normal trade relations with
China, Clinton said he wasn't ready to try to make those relations
permanent.
	   America buys one-third of China's exports and should, in turn,
get ``a fair shot at China's markets,'' he said.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with China is dlrs 50 billion, and U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday it could
climb to dlrs 60 billion this year.
	   Delivering a strong environmental message, Clinton said he
couldn't ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
anti-pollution measures. ``But as a citizen of the world and the
leader of my country, I have a responsibility to ask us all to work
together for a planet that our grandchildren can still enjoy living
on. And so do you.''
	   Afterward, Clinton toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange during a
lunchtime pause in trading. Instead of stock prices, the electronic
readout board glowed with a red and yellow presidential welcome.
	   Traders shook Clinton's hand and gave him a red trader vest with
the yellow number 1998 on its back. He didn't ring the opening bell
_ here a huge gong _ as Jiang did when he visited the New York
Stock Exchange last October during his U.S. visit.
	   While there, Chinese television interviewed the president for
nearly half an hour for a program to be broadcast during prime time
Thursday, the White House said. He was asked 19 questions, all
friendly.
	   Asked who had the tougher job _ Clinton or Jiang _ the president
said, ``Oh, I don't know,'' explaining that China faces enormous
challenges and the United States is dealing with a post-Cold War
world in which, he predicted, America would one day lose superpower
status.
	   ``America has this role which is temporary _ it won't last
forever _ as the only superpower in the world,'' Clinton said in a
transcript the White House provided. ``I have a lot of work to do
to deal with America's challenges and problems at home,'' he added,
``and then to try to get the American people to support our nation
doing what we should do as a force for peace and prosperity and
stability around the world.''
	   He also praised China for making ``a genuine movement toward
openness and freedom'' which, he said, ``I hope will continue and
increase.''
	   Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry noted it was the third time
Clinton had been featured on state-controlled Central Chinese
Television since his visit began, including during a live speech to
Peking University and at his joint news conference with Jiang.
	   In the evening, the president and his family took a leisurely
boat trip down the city's main river, the Huangpu. On one bank were
the European-style waterfront buildings from Shanghai's golden days
as a cosmopolitan city in the 1920s and 1930s.
	   On the other were the neon-lit skyscrapers of today. The trip
took him past the steel-girded stock exchange building and the
space-age Orient Pearl television tower that provides commanding
views of the city.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The presidents of Sierra Leone and Liberia
were heading for Nigeria on Wednesday for a mini summit with the
country's new military leader and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
	   The summit comes as Annan is meeting with a number of top
officials in the Nigerian government, and is also said to be
planning to meet with Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner,
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993 presidential elections.
	   Nigerian human rights and government officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, say the two men are expected to meet, but
could give no further details.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard had no comment on the possible
meeting.
	   However, Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku did meet
with Abiola for over an hour, the Commonwealth Secretariat in
London said in a statement. No further details were immediately
available.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, and the Nigerian-born Anyaoku are the
highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the
late ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by
executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995.
	   Presidents Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Charles Taylor
of Liberia, meanwhile, left their home countries Wednesday morning
for the meeting with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Annan, according
to government officials in each country.
	   A senior official at the Sierra Leonean foreign ministry,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said the meeting ``is
a worthwhile opportunity to discuss some regional issues bordering
on security and cooperation.''
	   Liberian officials said part of the focus will be on the
diplomatic row between that country and Sierra Leone.
	   Kabbah, who was deposed in a 1997 coup but was returned to power
earlier this year by a Nigerian-led West African intervention
force, has accused Liberia of supporting rebels who continue to
battle his government. Liberia, meanwhile, accuses of Sierra Leone
of harboring rebels that want to unseat Taylor.
	   Sierra Leone and Liberia have been exchanging delegations in
recent days to try to settle their disagreements.
	   Abubakar came to power last month after the death of Abacha, who
left his country an international pariah because of his regime's
abysmal human rights record.
	   The new leader, though, appears to be making a concerted effort
to move away from his predecessor's policies by freeing political
prisoners, meeting foreign delegations and reportedly even planning
to free Abiola.

EU Commission proposes 53 percent rise in wine subsidies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday to increase EU subsidies to wine producers by 53 percent
to support a reform aimed at making European vineyards more
competitive.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive branch, proposed increasing
EU wine sector spending to dlrs 1.42 billion in 2001 from this
year's level of dlrs 930 billion.
	   The proposal is part of a package of proposed wine sector
reforms designed to eventually reduce producers' dependence on
subsidies by improving the quality and marketing of European wines,
and cutting surplus production.
	   The 15-member Union accounts for 60 percent of the world's wine
production, and includes the world's three biggest producers Italy,
France and Spain.
	   The proposed reforms have to be approved by EU countries. The
reforms would include an end to most ``intervention'' sales, the
tool by which the EU buys up surplus farm products to keep prices
high.
	   Most of the increased spending would be on ``vineyard
reconversion'' to support changes to better quality wine varieties,
relocation of vineyards and the adoption of new production
techniques.
	   ``Assistance for restructuring is necessary,'' EU Farm
Commissioner Franz Fischler told a news conference.
	   ``With these proposals, the wine sector will be to a large
extent subject to normal market forces.''
	   The Commission proposed maintaining an existing ban on new
vineyard plantings and special ``grubbing-up'' measures which have
helped reduce the EU wine-growing areas to about 3.4 million
hectares (8.4 acres) in 1997 from 4 million hectares (9.9 acres) in
1987.
	   The reforms are meant to improve the competitiveness of EU wine
producers during the next round of international farm trade
liberalization talks.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo on Wednesday in an attempt to stave off
Serbian security forces in the secessionist province.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic coal
mine from the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday. Reporters at
Belacevac and Hade, the two towns just a few hundred meters (yards)
from the coal mine saw the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no
signs of fighting or a heightened state of alert.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which is closed to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the KLA still controls
the open-pit mine. The mine is strategically important because it
supplies coal to the Obilic power plant, which provides electricity
to most of Kosovo.
	   The center listed casualties among fighters in the Belasevac
region over the last two days of fighting as three dead and two
wounded. Among civilians, a child and an adult were killed and six
others wounded.
	   Albanian sources also claimed that rebels have completely
surrounded Klina, a government-controlled town in the central
Drenica region, cutting off access to Pec to the southwest. That
report also could not be confirmed.
	   Foreign officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
	   Heavy fighting in recent days has dimmed chances of a diplomatic
settlement.
	   U.S. diplomats have held several unpublicized meetings with
leaders of the KLA's political wing but have not been able to
persuade them to halt their attacks on Serb civilians or negotiate
a peaceful settlement.
	   In another sign that pacifist Albanian leaders may merge with
the militants, top Albanian politicians met Wednesday in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina in an attempt to plot a joint position toward
the KLA and win its cooperation.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the groups would become the KLA's
political wing.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population, also participated in the meeting but refused comment
afterward. With support growing for the armed radicals, Rugova, who
is also backed by the United States and its allies, might be forced
to cooperate with the KLA.

EU Commission declares illegal Spanish state aid for public

vehicles

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission declared illegal Wednesday funds handed out by the
Spanish government to the public sector in 1995 and 1996 to buy
vehicles.
	   ``A system of interest rate subsidies granted by the Spanish
authorities for the purchase of lorries, industrial vehicles,
coaches and buses distorts competition'' in the 15-nation EU, the
Commission said in a statement.
	   The Spanish government has two months to tell the Commission how
it plans to recover the money paid out on commercial vehicles as
part of the so-called Plan Renove Industrial which ran from August
1995 to December 1996.
	   During that period, the state paid out some 48.4 million
European currency units (dlrs 53 million) to public sector
organizations.
	   The Commission, which is empowered to veto state aid plans it
judges violate EU fair competition rules, opened an inquiry into
the Spanish state aid for transport in 1996.
	   At the time, Spain argued that the money was spent on replacing
old vehicles with safer, more environmental-friendly ones.
	   The Commission agreed to allow an exemption for trucks under 3.5
tons and for all public services such as school buses, ambulances
and garbage trucks.

Language sages fight leftist govt's move to feminize titles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's as simple as trading a ``la'' for a ``le.''
But saying ``Madame la Ministre'' has turned into a battle between
the reformist leftist government and old-guard defenders of the
French language.
	   The ministry of education announced this week it will require
the use of feminized titles, something the sages at the Academie
Francaise are fighting to block.
	   The Academie may go to the country's highest legal body to stop
them.
	   ``Socialist ideology is ruining France and the French language
at the same time,'' Academie head Maurice Druon, 80, told the
conservative daily Le Figaro, which ran a photo of him wearing a
black hat like the sheriff riding in for a showdown.
	   The 39-member Academie, which includes just two women, was to
discuss at its annual meeting Thursday whether to ask the Council
of State or the Constitutional Council to rule, said Laurent
Personne, a spokesman for Druon.
	   Druon, born during World War I when French was still the lingua
franca of diplomacy, leads the charge to stave off words like
``software,'' ``marketing'' and ``tour operator'' _ all no-nos in
the official French dictionary.
	   More than past battles against encroaching English, the latest
language fight boils down to France's struggle over how to
modernize.
	   ``Every opportunity must be taken to introduce the feminine form
of names of job occupations, so that the use of the latter imposes
itself little by little in our administration,'' said the
ministerial decree, to take effect July 9. One of the education
ministers is a woman, Segolene Royal.
	   New titles will include ``inspectrice'' along with
``inspecteur'' (inspector), ``doyenne'' with ``doyen'' (dean) and
the feminine articles ``la'' or ``une'' before neutrally spelled
terms like ``chef de service'' (service chief).
	   In strict French grammar, as Druon argues, all nouns are
masculine or feminine, without regard to the gender of the person
to whom they refer.
	   The ministry's decree actually implements a little-noticed
decision made 12 years ago by Socialist Prime Minister Laurent
Fabius. Druon told Le Figaro that the current Socialist prime
minister, Lionel Jospin, ``wanting to please his harem, relaunched
an old idea.''
	   ``He's an old fool,'' advertising executive Lilliane Hansen said
of Druon. ``This is why the country is in trouble. It's completely
stuck.''
	   The battle first flared in January, when the Academie sent a
letter to conservative President Jacques Chirac, asking him to
intervene with the government's plans to feminize titles.
	   Personne said Chirac responded, but he would not elaborate.
Chirac's Elysee Palace had no immediate comment.
	   ``The Academie is not ignored,'' Personne insisted. ``On the
contrary.''
	   But the body has no legal authority, so without official action
on its behalf, it may be a toothless tiger.

Some 184 Kurds caught in Italian southern coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with other arrivals

<TEXT>
	   RIACE, Italy (AP) _ The authorities on Wednesday detained 184
Kurds who reached the southern coast from Turkey and 160 North
Africans arriving in Sicily, news reports and officials said.
	   The Kurds, including 72 children, were of Turkish and Iraqi
nationality. They reached the coast of Calabria, the toe of the
boot-shaped Italian peninsula, after a week-long sea trip from
Turkey.
	   The North Africans who reached the shores of the tiny island of
Lampedusa, off Sicily, included Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians and
Somalians, the coast guard there said. Police also seized two boats
and arrested a Tunisian man for smuggling illegal immigrants.
	   With warm temperatures and calm waters, would-be immigrants have
been arriving nearly every day on Italy's long coastlines.
	   Hundreds of North Africans have tried to illegally enter Italian
territory through Sicily and the small islands of Lampedusa and
Pantelleria, which is located just 70 kilometers (45 miles) off of
Tunisia.
	   Wednesday's arrivals were kept in shelters in nearby towns until
authorities examine their cases. Under new laws most of them face
immediate expulsion.
	   Italy tried to tighten its frontiers after clandestine arrivals
by hundreds of Kurdish refugees from Turkey earlier this year led
to an outcry by Germany and other European Union members. Germany
claimed that Italy was a transit point for refugees seeking jobs
and to reach their families in northern Europe.
	   Illegal immigrants who are given expulsion orders are now
escorted to the border immediately.

Novotna beats angry Williams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Novotna beating Williams &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams' Wimbledon title bid
ended Wednesday in anger, tears and a quarterfinal loss to Jana
Novotna.
	   Screaming with fury and crying over disputed line calls,
Williams lost her composure and the match, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2).
	   The 18-year-old American played aggressive, serve-and-volley
tennis, trying to beat Novotna at her own game. But she failed to
win the key points as Novotna, a two-time Wimbledon finalist,
showed her experience on grass.
	   Novotna advanced to a semifinal meeting against defending
champion Martina Hingis, who overcame Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in
three sets to set up a rematch of last year's final.
	   Reaching the other semifinal were Nathalie Tauziat and Natsha
Zvereva. Tauziat upset No. 2 Lindsay Davenport while Zvereva ousted
Monica Seles, both in straight sets.
	   In men's play, Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic won their
quarterfinal matches in straight sets.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 champion, cruised to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 win over
65th-ranked Davide Sanguinetti of Italy. Ivanisevic, a former
two-time finalist, beat Jan Siemerink in three tiebreakers.
	   Defending champion Pete Sampras faced Mark Philippoussis, and
Petr Korda played Tim Henman in the two remaining matches.
	   Williams twice exploded at chair umpire Mike Morrissey after
shots by Novotna that landed near the line were not called out.
	   ``That was SO far out,'' she shouted in the first game of the
second set, then went up to the lineswoman and continued arguing.
	   Even more dramatic was her reaction to a non-call in the seventh
game.
	   ``I know it's out, she knows it's out, everyone knows it's out.
But you don't know it's out,'' Williams, her face contorted in
anger and tears, screamed at Morrissey.
	   After double faulting on the next point to go down 4-3, Williams
cried during the changeover.
	   Williams lost her temper again in the 11th game, standing
indignantly with her hands on her hips and complaining about a ball
that wasn't called long. When the next shot was called out,
Williams clapped her racket, mocking the lineswoman.
	   Williams seemed to regain control but, in the tiebreaker, she
played carelessly and made a series of unforced errors as Novotna
closed out the match.
	   Williams had raced to a 4-1 lead in the first set but lost three
straight games. Novotna broke for a 6-5 lead and served out the set
in the next game.
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, fell behind quickly and never recovered
as the unseeded Zvereva, known mainly as a doubles specialist,
moved her around the court and won 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
	   Zvereva, who ousted seven-time champion Steffi Graf last week,
beat Seles for the first time in five matches. She reached a Grand
Slam semifinal for the first time since her 6-0, 6-0 loss to Graf
in the 1988 French Open final.
	   Seles, whose father died in May after a long battle with stomach
cancer, reached the French Open final three weeks later, losing to
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   Seles won her first four Wimbledon matches in straight sets and
appeared to be a legitimate threat to win the only Grand Slam title
to elude her. But Zvereva, wearing red-tinted wrap-around sun
glasses, forced her into repeated errors and made her look
ordinary.
	   ``I just didn't feel anything was going well,'' Seles said. ``I
just couldn't put two points together today. ... I was missing my
backhand all over the place.''
	   Hingis lost her first set of the tournament but outlasted French
Open champ Sanchez Vicario 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
	   The 1 hour, 46-minute match featured long baseline rallies and
seemed more appropriate to the clay of the French Open than the
grass of Wimbledon. Several times in the final set, Hingis appeared
tired and out of breath.
	   The fifth-seeded Spaniard, known for her tireless retrieving,
pushed Hingis to the brink as she saved nine consecutive break
points over the second and third sets.
	   Hingis finally converted on the 10th break point, ripping a
backhand pass that ended a long, corner-to-corner rally and gave
her a 4-2 lead in the third set. She raised her arms in triumph and
caught her breath by sitting on a linesman's chair at the back of
the court.
	   Although Sanchez Vicario broke back in the next game, Hingis won
the next two games to close out the match. She smiled with relief
and pumped both fists after hitting an inside-out forehand which
the Spaniard returned wide.
	   Tauziat downed Davenport 6-3, 6-3 to reach her first Grand Slam
semifinal. The 16th-seeded Frenchwoman had lost her last seven
matches to the American.
	   ``That was by far the best she ever played against me,''
Davenport said. ``She just outplayed me completely today.''

EU countries must decide on safety of teething products
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greenpeace statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Wednesday it is up to the 15 EU countries to decide
whether to ban plastic teething products containing chemicals that
may pose a health risk.
	   The EU executive body said it lacks scientific evidence to
impose an EU-wide ban on toys that contain two widely-used
phthalates, a chemical substance used in plastic objects to make
them supple.
	   ``We are waiting for the result of tests being carried out in
the Netherlands ... before we can take any legal measure,'' said
Pietro Petrucci, EU consumer affairs spokesman.
	   These results will be confirmed around the end of August,
Petrucci told reporters.
	   The ecological group Greenpeace condemned the Commission's
decision not to impose EU-wide restrictions on toys containing
phthalates, saying the EU is giving in to ``US government and
chemical industry pressure.''
	   ``Not only does the European Commission accept that babies
ingest hazardous chemicals in spite of the wide availability of
non-hazardous alternatives, it also puts future action into the
hands of those who produce the hazard,'' Greenpeace spokesman Axel
Singhofen said in a statement.
	   The Commission opened an investigation into the use of
phthalates at the request of Spain and Denmark amid fears that a
chemical reaction between saliva and certain phthalates could cause
cancer.
	   Scientists must determine what level of phthalates leaking from
toy to mouth could pose a health risk and whether the substance
goes through the digestive system or remains in the body.
	   Meanwhile, the Commission recommended the 15 EU governments
monitor safety of ``child-care articles and toys made of soft PVC
containing phthalates, for children under three years of age, which
are to be put in to the mouth, such as teething rings.''
	   European toy manufacturers welcomed the decision not to impose
an EU-wide ban, calling the health concerns ``unfounded.''
	   ``There is absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest that
phthalates can harm young children,'' said Maurits Bruggink,
secretary general of Toys Industries of Europe.
	   In a statement Bruggink said manufacturers would support the
introduction of standardized EU-wide testing to restore public
confidence in the products.

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Caribbean democracy is on trial in
Guyana, where an opposition terror campaign of bombings and mob
violence threatens the government, Guyanese President Janet Jagan
told a regional summit.
	   Jagan told Caribbean Community leaders late Tuesday that former
President Desmond Hoyte's People's National Congress refuses to
accept its defeat in December elections, as well as an
international audit that certified that defeat.
	   ``In the capital city of Georgetown, the PNC has mobilized its
supporters to continue the terror, bombings, bomb scares, robbings
and beatings of innocent citizens. It is clear that the PNC has no
intention of accepting the will of the majority,'' said the
U.S.-born Jagan, whose People's Progressive Party won 55 percent of
the Dec. 15 vote.
	   ``Democracy is on trial in Guyana,'' she said. ``Caricom must
stand up for democracy and the rule of law.''
	   At Caricom's invitation, Hoyte was set Wednesday to present his
case _ that both the election and the audit were flawed.
	   The summit, which runs through Saturday, marks the 25th
anniversary of the 16-member Caribbean Community trade bloc,
encompassing more than 6 million people and a dlrs 30 billion
combined national product.
	   Caricom's chairman, Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell,
said he hoped to see two new members soon: Cuba and the Dominican
Republic.
	   ``Their presence in Caricom will certainly change the
geopolitical outlook and strategic importance of our region in a
most dramatic way,'' Mitchell said.
	   Caricom leaders have criticized the U.S. trade embargo against
communist Cuba and plan to establish a trade office in Havana.
Trade between Caricom and Cuba reached dlrs 35 million last year.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The last time Austria found itself
helping guide European affairs, Britain had just shipped Napoleon
to exile and czars and princes were amongst those charting Europe's
course.
	   Austria's assumption of the rotating European Union presidency
Wednesday is rich in symbolism both for the organization and the
Alpine nation, the first of the three 1995 newcomers to take the
helm.
	   The weighty decisions of the year _ monetary union and
structural reforms within the organization _ were made under
Britain's leadership from January to June. While Austria is
expected to play a role in promoting EU expansion eastward and
crucial agricultural reforms, these issues won't be settled until
Germany takes over the presidency next year.
	   Still, the country holding the presidency is responsible for
arranging and presiding over all meetings _ the bulk of which are
still held in Brussels _ and leading decision-making. This means
Austria will be a key player on the world stage for the first time
since its empire dissolved after World War I.
	   After 40 years of neutrality and relative obscurity wedged
between the East and the West, Austria's politicians, if not its
people, are eager to return to the world stage.
	   Marking the occasion will be a four-hour festival of music and
dance in the city's historic Heldenplatz, or Hero's Square.
Performers include the top names in Austrian classical music,
including the Vienna Boy's Choir and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.
	   Curious Austrians who wandered down to the square, in the heart
of the Imperial Palace, contemplated what the presidency might
affect in their lives.
	   ``We're not yet so completely in the EU,'' explained Johann
Wiemmer, a pensioner. Like many other Austrians, Wiemmer is still
unsure what his country has gained since joining the EU three years
ago.
	   ``They promised us everything would be cheaper when we joined in
1995, but so far only milk products are cheaper,'' said Wilhelm
Winter, a banker in Vienna.
	   Many Austrians worry that trading in their shillings for the
EU's common currency, the euro, or opening the EU's borders to
neighbors in Eastern Europe will be expensive or hurt Austrians and
generate nothing in return.
	   According to a survey published in Die Presse daily Wednesday,
74 percent of Austrians said the holding the presidency would cost
Austria more money, while only 35 percent said they thought they
economy would profit. No margin of error was given.
	   Ingrid Eigner, an organizer of Wednesday's festival, hopes
Austria's turn at the presidency will help cultivate a more
positive attitude toward the EU.
	   Unity is the theme for Wednesday's performance, including music
and performers from across Europe. The show also will be broadcast
live on Austrian state television and in 12 other European
countries.
	   ``The EU is like a big family, where everyone brings to it their
own character and their own faults,'' Eigner said. Learning to
accept both of these, she said, is the key to making the
organization work. ``Without that cooperation, it would just be a
farce,'' she said.

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ A group of retired army
officers who were involved in a failed 1995 military coup has given
the government a deadline of July 11 to implement a deal on
retirement conditions.
	   In a letter to Prime Minister Raul Braganca, made available
Wednesday, about 20 officers accused the government of reneging on
the deal which ended the coup attempt.
	   The letter made no mention of measures the officers might take
if the deadline is not met, but it drew a parallel with the current
situation in Guinea-Bissau where a break away military faction last
month launched a bid to topple the president.
	   ``The situation in Guinea-Bissau is not much different from Sao
Tome and Principe where the government has never relied on dialogue
to resolve internal problems,'' the letter said.
	   The two west African countries are former Portuguese colonies.
	   The veteran officers are regarded as influential figures in the
top ranks of the army which in recent months has been unsettled by
disputes over low pay.
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the government was studying the demands.
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The European Union has lifted a ban on
fresh fish imports imposed on four East African nations six months
ago, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Lutz Salzman, EU's representative in the East African region,
said Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique can export fresh fish
to the European market beginning July 1, the independent Daily
Nation reported.
	   The union imposed the ban Jan. 16, suspecting cholera
contamination due to an outbreak of the bacterial disease caused by
heavy rains attributed to El Nino phenomenon. Frozen fish was not
affected.
	   Salzman said a team of EU veterinarians from Brussels had
confirmed cholera was no longer a threat affecting fish.
	   Salzman cautioned East African countries they have until January
to meet additional health standards for fish exports set by the
union.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Members of a fundamentalist religious
said they will not let government veterinary officers vaccinate
their chickens against a current epidemic of Newcastle disease,
which is usually fatal to poultry.
	   James Garahari, spokesman for the ``Vapostori'' or apostles sect
in the Sanyati area of northern Zimbabwe said the epidemic was not
going to attack sect members' coops because they would pray for
their birds, the official Zimbabwe Information Service reported.
	   They would not allow their chickens to be subjected to ``the
authorities ungodly policies,'' he said.
	   The epidemic of Newcastle disease has threatened lucrative
exports of ostrich meat to Europe and North America.
	   Members of the sect, commonly seeing praying in their white
robes under wayside trees, recently resisted a Ministry of Health
campaign to inoculate children against measles, saying Western
medicine violated their religious principles.
	   Garahari said when sect members permitted inoculation of their
chickens in 1994, all the birds died soon afterward.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ President Bakili Muluzi has appointed a
new nine-member Electoral Commission headed by High Court judge
William Hanjahanja, state radio announced Wednesday.
	   The appointments, announced by Muluzi's office, came three weeks
after Muluzi dissolved the old commission headed by Judge Anastasia
Msosa.
	   Msosa, whose term of office was supposed to expire in September,
charged then that the constitution did not allow for the
commission's dissolution until its term expired.
	   He accused Muluzi of breaching the constitution.
	   Msosa's body oversaw the first democratic elections in 1994 that
brought Muluzi to power, ending three decades of dictatorship by
Kamuzu Banda, who died last year.
	   The new commission years will be sworn in on Saturday for a
four-year term, giving it time to start preparing for next year's
presidential and parliamentary elections.
	   Three of the country's main parties represented in parliament
have two members each on the nine-member commission.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The first municipal elections in 33
towns and cities were marked by low turnout at poorly-run voting
facilities, party officials and observers said.
	   In Maputo, about 20 percent of registered voters cast their
ballots Tuesday, while in the central city of Beira turnout was
estimated at around 5 percent.
	   Low voter turnout was reported in strongholds both of the ruling
FRELIMO party and of the former rebel movement RENAMO, which
boycotted the polls claiming irregularities in voting procedures.
	   In the capital, most polling stations opened at least two hours
late and some remained closed until mid-afternoon Tuesday.
	   Observers said trucks carrying ballot boxes, ballot papers and
other materials arrived late and in some places no voting took
place because materials were locked up and no keys were available.
	   The leader of the small opposition Mozambican Labour Party was
detained by police in the southern province of Gaza during voting.
	   Miguel Mabote was arrested in the provincial capital, Xai Xai,
where he was allegedly seen tearing up sample ballot papers and is
to appear in court soon.
	   Officials said results of polling will be released when counting
is completed over the coming days.
	   ------
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ China is to set up a dlrs 3 million
investment center in Zambia, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said
Wednesday.
	   Nawakwi said the Zambian government would provide land for the
investment center that would coordinate Chinese investment
activities.
	   China is one of several nations negotiating to buy copper mining
interests in the central Copperbelt province under the Zambian
government's economic reform and privatization program.
	   Donors have complained of delays in selling the state-owned
mines and warned of serious damage to the economy if the unbundling
and sale of the mines, the main hard currency earner, is not
hastened.

Report: Illegal logging, poaching may result in orangutan
</HEADLINE>
extinction &QL; 
 &UR; By JENNY E. HELLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Illegal exploitation of orangutans and destruction
of their habitats, often encouraged by Indonesian companies, could
make the small, furry creatures a species of the past, the
Environmental Investigation Agency reported Wednesday.
	   Of the 15,000 to 25,000 orangutans still surviving in the wild,
more than 80 percent live on the Indonesian islands of Borneo and
Sumatra, according to the London-based agency, an independent
environmental organization.
	   If illegal logging and poaching continue in the East Asian
nation, orangutans will be extinct by 2018, it said.
	   Forest fires, many of them started illegally, and the conversion
of forest to timber and oil palm plantations, much of which takes
place in supposedly protected areas, have destroyed more than 80
percent of the orangutan's habitat over the last 20 years, the
agency said.
	   ``Orangutan habitat is being deliberately destroyed by companies
clearing the land to get rich quick,'' the agency's campaigns
director, Steve Trent, said at the launch of an international drive
to protect orangutans.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' he said. ``Laws are routinely
flouted by major companies and bribery and corruption are the
norm.''
	   Trent said Indonesian law provides orangutans with protection
against poaching and forest destruction, but that the government
permits well-connected corporations and individuals to ignore
legislation in order to create large paper mills and plantations.
	   Trent said he hoped Indonesia's new government, led by President
B.J. Habibie, will crack down on illegal poaching and the
exploitation of Indonesia's 100 million hectares (247 million
acres) of forest, which represent 10 percent of the world's
tropical rain forests.
	   The agency's new program aims to encourage governments and
international organizations, such as the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, to pressure Habibie's government to
enforce Indonesia's laws.
	   Campaign leaders plan to meet with directors of large
corporations and international policy-makers to suggest, among
other initiatives, only giving aid to Indonesia in return for
promises of greater attention to the illegal actions of large paper
and palm oil companies.

In about turn, Blair to publish ``Diana'' land mine bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Diana's Grave &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Completing an about-turn on Princess Diana's
birthday, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday that a bill to
ratify an international treaty banning land mines will be published
next week.
	   ``If legislation is completed in July, as we wish it to be, then
we will be amongst the first 40 nations to ratify _ as we promised
to do,'' Blair told the House of Commons.
	   The government said mid-June there was no parliamentary time to
ratify the treaty in time for the Aug. 31 anniversary of Diana's
death in a Paris car crash. The treaty was signed in Ottawa in
December by 100 nations, including Britain, but not the United
States.
	   Several legislators attracted publicity by campaigning for
ratification by the anniversary as a tribute to Diana, who espoused
the cause of eradicating land mines and visited victims in Angola
and Bosnia.
	   The government then said it would get the treaty ratified before
the anniversary, if necessary with special sittings. Parliament
usually rises for a recess of about 10 weeks late July or early
August.
	   Blair was replying Wednesday _ which would have been Diana's
37th birthday _ to a lawmaker who raised the issue in the House of
Commons.
	   Earlier, Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, opened to the public a
Diana Museum at the family's ancestral home, Althorp.

Russian Constitutional Court will decide on Yeltsin's 3rd term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Constitutional Court will meet in
October to decide whether President Boris Yeltsin can legally run
for a third term, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had asked the
Constitutional Court for a ruling to settle the issue.
	   Russia's constitution sets a two-term limit for the president.
However, Yeltsin's aides have hinted that the 67-year old leader
may run again, arguing that his first term began during Soviet
times and should not count toward the two-term limit.
	   Yeltsin has said repeatedly that he won't run. But last week, he
seemed to soften his rejection of a third term by saying simply
that the constitution wouldn't allow it.

Ukraine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainians owe their government nearly 2.9
billion hryvna (dlrs 1.45 billion) for communal services, including
apartment fees and payments for gas, water and heating, the State
Statistics Committee said Wednesday.
	   Forty to 50 percent of debtors have not paid their bills for
more than two months, the committee said.
	   One-third of the sum is owed by regional authorities, it said.
	   Ukraine's cash-strapped government has moved against the largest
debtors, threatening to cut off enterprises that fail to pay their
electricity or gas bills, but it has been slow in cracking down on
private consumers.

Six Red Cross workers abducted in Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Six Red Cross workers were still missing
Tuesday, five days after they were abducted by gunmen and their
vehicles burned, a spokeswoman said.
	   ``We don't know of the aim of these abductors, and since last
Thursday we have no news whatsoever,'' said Nina Galbe, spokeswoman
for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Nairobi.
	   The Swiss man and five Ethiopians disappeared in the
southeastern region of Ogaden, which is largely populated by
Somalis who have long sought their own independent enclave.
	   Local witnesses said the six men were abducted by armed men in
Kolat, about 675 kilometers (415 miles) southeast of Addis Ababa,
Galbe said. Their three vehicles, clearly marked with the Red Cross
insignia, were burned.
	   ``The ICRC immediately met and has continued to meet with all
parties present in the area in order to gain more information about
the whereabouts of our team,'' Galbe said.
	   Although Ethiopia and Eritrea are engaged in a border conflict,
there is no fighting near the area.
	   Ten Red Cross Workers were held hostage in Somalia for 10 days
in April.
	   An Austrian student who was held hostage in Ogaden for more than
two months was freed in April. A splinter group of the
independence-seeking Ogaden National Front claimed responsibility
for taking her hostage, but its motives were unclear.

Mitchell says other countries meddling in Caribbean politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Caribbean-Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The newly re-elected prime minister
of St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Tuesday charged that
politicians in developed countries are trying to manipulate
elections in the Caribbean.
	   Mitchell, whose New Democratic Party won the June 15 election by
one seat, spoke at the opening of a Caribbean Community summit in
St. Lucia.
	   He said the opposition Unity Labor Party had been accompanied
during some campaign events by a British politician, a reference to
British Labor Party lawmaker David Lock.
	   Mitchell claimed that the Unity Labor Party had promised more
British economic aid if voters voted against him, and he urged
Caribbean leaders to reject such pressure.
	   ``External forces are ready to manipulate the will of Caribbean
people,'' Mitchell said. ``It is folly for anyone to think that
such `assistance' does not carry a heavy price.''

Experts, activists call for practical action against needle-spread
</HEADLINE>
HIV &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegates at the World AIDS Congress Wednesday
urged that the number of needle-exchange programs be increased
worldwide to halt the rising spread of the AIDS virus through drug
injection.
	   But poverty and a collapse in drug prices, along with an
increase in drug trafficking and harsh government attitudes in many
countries, stand in the way of curbing the problem, they said.
	   In some countries, infection through drug use accounts for more
HIV infections than sex.
	   ``The law-and-order approach has not been successful in
eliminating drug use,'' said Palani Narayan of Thailand-based group
Asian Harm Reduction Network.
	   A U.N. report last week said in Malaysia, Vietnam and other
countries, three-quarters of recorded HIV cases are among drug
addicts. In the last two years, four out of five new HIV infections
in Russia have been among the same group, it said.
	   Even encouraging people to buy clean needles is ``easier said
than done'' in Asian slums, Narayan said. ``There is a need to
recognize drug users as citizens.''
	   Gerry Stimson of Imperial College, London, and Moruf Adelekan of
Nigeria's University of Ilorin both noted the risk of increased HIV
infections as heroin and cocaine use spread to poorer parts of
society in developing countries.
	   In Nigeria, injection is still generally confined to a few
middle-class people who have no problem obtaining clean needles,
Adelekan said.
	   He warned that a depressed economic climate and a collapse in
drug prices could help spread the practice of injecting drugs.
	   ``It's a good opportunity to catch it at this level,'' he said.
	   Several speakers agreed that far too few needle-exchange
programs were in place.
	   ``We have been hitting our heads against a brick wall for
several years (in Asia)'' Narayan said, stoppingto praise programs
in Vietnam and India.
	   In 1997, 116 countries reported cases of intravenous drug use
and 96 of those reported HIV cases connected to drug injection,
according to the World Health Organization.
	   In April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
pushed through legislation that would permanently ban federal
funding of needle exchanges, saying those programs jeopardize the
battle against drugs.

Israel demolishes two houses in West Bank village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel demolished two partially built
Palestinian homes in the tiny West Bank village of Rojeeb on
Wednesday because they were being built without permits.
	   Bulldozers leveled the houses, which were being built by
Mohammed Abu Saud and his son Bassam in the village southeast of
Nablus, the elder Abu Saud said.
	   The United states has appealed to Israel to refrain from
unilateral steps such as house demolitions, but the pace of
demolitions has accelerated in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One fan took it out on the TV set, and several
hundred others in dozens of towns and cities across England took to
the streets, smashing shop windows and fighting after England's
World Cup soccer dream collapsed.
	   Newspapers hailed England's team as heroes, battling with one
player short most of the time to hold Argentina to a draw _ only to
lose Tuesday night in St. Etienne, France, in a nail-biting 4-3
penalty shoot-out.
	   Police reported 45 arrests, mainly in southern England towns, as
shocked fans poured out of pubs.
	   England coach Glen Hoddle commented that ``it's a football match
at the end of the day _ it's not a matter of life and death.'' But
that's not how many saw England's World Cup defeat on penalties, a
replay of its elimination from the 1990 finals.

Austria takes over the EU presidency with fanfare

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The last time Austria found itself
helping guide European affairs, Britain had just shipped Napoleon
to exile and czars and princes were among those charting Europe's
course.
	   Austria's assumption of the rotating European Union presidency
Wednesday is rich in symbolism both for the organization and the
Alpine nation, the first of the three 1995 newcomers to take the
helm.
	   The weighty decisions of the year _ monetary union and
structural reforms within the organization _ were made under
Britain's leadership from January to June. While Austria is
expected to play a role in promoting EU expansion eastward and
crucial agricultural reforms, these issues won't be settled until
Germany takes over the presidency next year.
	   Still, the country holding the presidency is responsible for
arranging and presiding over all meetings _ the bulk of which are
still held in Brussels _ and leading decision-making. This means
Austria will be a key player on the world stage for the first time
since its empire dissolved after World War I.
	   After 40 years of neutrality and relative obscurity wedged
between the East and the West, Austria's politicians, if not its
people, are eager to return to the world stage.
	   Marking the occasion will be a four-hour festival of music and
dance in the city's historic Heldenplatz, or Hero's Square.
Performers include the top names in Austrian classical music,
including the Vienna Boy's Choir and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.
	   A freak accident marred the opening of the fest, after a crane
keeping a car suspended high in the air for advertising purposes
tipped, bringing the vehicle crashing to the ground.
	   Still, the accident did not keep Austrians away from the square,
in the heart of the Imperial Palace. Some contemplated what the
presidency might affect in their lives.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The last time Austria found itself
helping guide European affairs, Britain had just shipped Napoleon
to exile and czars and princes were amongst those charting Europe's
course.
	   Austria's assumption of the rotating European Union presidency
Wednesday is rich in symbolism both for the organization and the
Alpine nation, the first of the three 1995 newcomers to take the
helm.
	   The weighty decisions of the year _ monetary union and
structural reforms within the organization _ were made under
Britain's leadership from January to June. While Austria is
expected to play a role in promoting EU expansion eastward and
crucial agricultural reforms, these issues won't be settled until
Germany takes over the presidency next year.
	   Still, the country holding the presidency is responsible for
arranging and presiding over all meetings _ the bulk of which are
still held in Brussels _ and leading decision-making. This means
Austria will be a key player on the world stage for the first time
since its empire dissolved after World War I.
	   After 40 years of neutrality and relative obscurity wedged
between the East and the West, Austria's politicians, if not its
people, are eager to return to the world stage.
	   Marking the occasion will be a four-hour festival of music and
dance in the city's historic Heldenplatz, or Hero's Square.
Performers include the top names in Austrian classical music,
including the Vienna Boy's Choir and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.
	   Curious Austrians who wandered down to the square, in the heart
of the Imperial Palace, contemplated what the presidency might
affect in their lives.
	   ``We're not yet so completely in the EU,'' explained Johann
Wiemmer, a pensioner. Like many other Austrians, Wiemmer is still
unsure what his country has gained since joining the EU three years
ago.
	   ``They promised us everything would be cheaper when we joined in
1995, but so far only milk products are cheaper,'' said Wilhelm
Winter, a banker in Vienna.
	   Many Austrians worry that trading in their shillings for the
EU's common currency, the euro, or opening the EU's borders to
neighbors in Eastern Europe will be expensive or hurt Austrians and
generate nothing in return.
	   According to a survey published in Die Presse daily Wednesday,
74 percent of Austrians said the presidency would cost Austria more
money, while only 35 percent said they thought their economy would
profit. No margin of error was given.

Armenia ready for talks on Nagorno-Karabakh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Armenia wants to resume unconditional talks with
Azerbaijan over the violence-scarred region of Nagorno-Karabakh,
and thinks Azerbaijan should be prepared to do the same, a news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   Armenia wants a peace settlement in the region, but both sides
must understand ``the realities that have emerged as the result of
the war imposed on us by Azerbaijan,'' the Interfax news agency
said, citing Aram Sarkisian, a foreign policy adviser to Armenia's
president.
	   Interfax did not elaborate.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in 1988 and
drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Sarkisian also voiced concern about political and economic
cooperation between Azerbaijan and Turkey. A new relationship
between those two countries would force Armenia to foster stronger
ties with Russia, Europe, the United States, and possibly even
Iran, Sarkisian said, according to Interfax.

World Cup: Close, but not that close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ If only.
	   The handballs missed by the referee in the penalty area. David
Beckham's decision to kick back at an opponent who fouled him. The
decision to let David Batty take his first ever penalty kick.
	   All these conspired to knock England out of the World Cup as
Argentina triumphed 4-3 in a penalty shootout after a 2-2 tie
Tuesday night.
	   That's according to the England team.
	   ``There was such a strange emotion, a feeling among us about how
well we'd done and what we should have achieved,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said.
	   ``That's the saddest thing. It wasn't that we'd lost to
Argentina or that we had been knocked out, but that we'll never
know what we could have achieved.
	   ``I felt we would have gone from strength to strength and
perhaps gone all the way and won it.
	   ``If we'd kept 11-against-11 we would have won the game. The
confidence we'd have had from there would have worked in our favor.
That's how thin the dividing line is.''
	   The loss meant that three times out the last four major
championships England has played in, the team has been eliminated
in a penalty shootout.
	   It happened against Germany at both the 1990 World Cup and the
1998 European Championship and now against Argentina at France 98.
	   Yet, while England displayed all its typical fighting spirit
against Argentina and an impressively imaginative strikeforce
against Colombia, it still fell short of being a true candidate for
a World Cup title.
	   The English defenders are still slow to turn against speedy
forwards and too many midfielders are quick to go flying in with
needless foul tackles when they lose their tempers.
	   Beckham's expulsion for petulantly kicking back at Diego
Simeone, even when the English player was lying face down on the
ground, was inevitable and England paid the price.
	   Hoddle said his team should have had a penalty for at least one
Argentina handball. But decisions like that have a habit of evening
themselves out and other coaches would say he has little to
complain about.
	   Although Batty volunteered to take what was his first penalty
kick in a competitive game, Hoddle could have had more experienced
penalty takers on the field when he knew a shootout was imminent.
Even defender Tony Adams, who was on the field, has scored for
England from the spot and he wasn't called upon this time.
	   Hoddle has plenty of good things to work on as his team looks
ahead to qualifying for the 2000 European Championship and the next
World Cup in 2002.
	   In 18-year-old Liverpool striker Michael Owen, England has a
rare goalscoring talent who appears to have the experience of a
seasoned pro even though he has been at the top of the game for
barely 18 months. His solo goal against Argentina was one of the
best of any World Cup.
	   Beckham, despite his expulsion, showed that he is a supremely
gifted playmaker and looks extremely confident on the ball. His
30-meter free kick against Colombia was another of the best goals
of France 98.
	   Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Sol Campbell are young players
quickly building experience at the highest level, Paul Ince remains
a combative influence and David Seaman provided more proof he is
one of the best goalkeepers around.
	   The performance of the midfield showed that Hoddle was right to
leave behind fading star Paul Gascoigne. Although center-back Tony
Adams had an inspired game against Argentina when England was down
to 10 players for 75 minutes, the team needs defenders with far
more mobility and skill on the ball.
	   In terms of tactics and imaginative play, England has made big
improvements in the past four years under Terry Venables and Hoddle
but is still far from the finished article.
	   Even if fate wasn't on his side this time, Hoddle and his team
still made far too many mistakes.
	   Otherwise they wouldn't be out of the World Cup.

Mitchell says other countries meddling in Caribbean politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Caribbean-Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The newly re-elected prime minister
of St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Tuesday charged that
politicians in developed countries are trying to manipulate
elections in the Caribbean.
	   Mitchell, whose New Democratic Party won the June 15 election by
one seat, spoke at the opening of a Caribbean Community summit in
St. Lucia.
	   He said the opposition Unity Labor Party had been accompanied
during some campaign events by a British politician, a reference to
British Labor Party lawmaker David Lock.
	   Mitchell claimed that the Unity Labor Party had promised more
British economic aid if voters voted against him, and he urged
Caribbean leaders to reject such pressure.
	   ``External forces are ready to manipulate the will of Caribbean
people,'' Mitchell said. ``It is folly for anyone to think that
such `assistance' does not carry a heavy price.''

Most, but not all, ships comply with new world safety code
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thirteen percent of the world's big ships are
flunking new standards for safety and pollution control, a United
Nations maritime agency said Wednesday as the tighter rules took
effect.
	   The International Maritime Organization said it was pleased that
87 percent of the ships weighing at least 500 gross tons are
meeting the regulations. But secretary-general William A. O'Neil
acknowledged there was no good way to identify all the cheaters.
	   ``We are not in position to go out and produce white lists and
black lists,'' O'Neil said. O'Neil added he could not completely
vouch for his compliance figures, supplied by the governments of
various shipping nations, but he called them the best numbers
available.
	   The maritime organization had been in touch with key Asian and
European port officials early Wednesday but thus far had not heard
of any ships being detained for breaking the new code on safety and
pollution control, he said.
	   But ship owners who fail to comply will run into problems doing
business, O'Neil predicted in a news conference. It could be harder
for them to get insurance coverage, many port authorities won't let
them stop or could even detain them, and customers might stop using
them.
	   About 12,700 ships _ including tankers, bulk carriers, passenger
ships and high-speed cargo craft _ are covered by the so-called
International Safety Management Code. About 1,650 are out of
compliance, the maritime organization said.
	   The code was written as a result of concerns about poor
standards in the shipping industry that intensified after a number
of major accidents in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Shipping
companies have had four years to get their fleets into compliance,
and officials say there was a last-minute rush among many operators
to clean up their act.
	   Smaller ships must meet the new rules by 2002.
	   O'Neil was asked about the possibility that some ports would
turn a blind eye to ships not in compliance, giving unscrupulous
ship owners a competitive advantage.
	   He played down the possibility, pointing out that major trading
nations, including the United States, western European countries,
Canada and Australia, all plan to enforce the rules tightly.
	   That would leave few markets for cheaters to exploit, he said,
because the larger economies are involved in most global trade.
	   The maritime experts were unable to provide any estimates for
how many lives might be saved as the seas become safer.
	   ``It's impossible to say what that impact will be,'' O'Neil
said.
	   The new code requires that ship owners or operators maintain
clear safety and environmental policies, with specified procedures
for reporting accidents, responding to emergencies and providing
for internal audits.

<TEXT>
	   CHANIA, Greece (AP) _ An out-of-control missile self-destructed
Wednesday over a firing range near this resort on the island of
Crete, the Greek air force said.
	   Air Force Col. Cosmas Vouris denied earlier Greek media reports
that the missile, a high-altitude Nike Hercules anti-aircraft
weapon, was headed for a crowded beach when a self-destruct
mechanism blew it apart.
	   He also disputed local media reports that fragments of the
missile started a forest fire.
	   ``The missile launched normally but the computer saw it wasn't
working with the radar and four seconds later it auto-destructed
exactly over the range,'' Vouris told The Associated Press.
	   Vouris said the missile destroyed itself 4,000 feet (1,219
meters) over the NATO weapons range and flew ``over no heads.''
	   Earlier media reports had said the missile was detonated shortly
before it overflew a crowded tourist beach and that hot fragments
had started a forest fire on a nearby mountain.
	   Vouris said he did not think the missile caused the fire but
that ``an investigation was under way.''
	   The Nike Hercules, a two-stage missile, was originally designed
to shoot down aircraft flying as high as 100,000 feet (30.4
kilometers).
	   Vouris said the missile was fired with just one of its stages
and that the test was part of an annual readiness exercise by the
Greek air force. Two other missiles were successfully launched from
the range on Wednesday.

Novotna beats angry Williams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras victory, Williams quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Screaming with fury and crying over
disputed line calls, Venus Williams' bid for the Wimbledon title
ended Wednesday with a quarterfinal loss to Jana Novotna.
	   The 18-year-old American lost her composure and the match, 7-5,
7-6 (7-2).
	   ``I had a firm belief that those balls were out and the
linespeople should have called them out,'' she said. ``Of course,
you have to get over those things.''
	   Williams said her tantrums made the match more entertaining.
	   ``The crowd probably enjoyed my emotional outburst,'' she said.
``It brightened up someone's day.''
	   Williams played aggressive, serve-and-volley tennis, trying to
beat Novotna at her own game. But she failed to win the key points
as Novotna, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, showed her experience on
grass.
	   Novotna advanced to a semifinal meeting against defending
champion Martina Hingis, who overcame Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in
three sets to set up a rematch of last year's final.
	   Reaching the other semifinal were Nathalie Tauziat and Natsha
Zvereva. Tauziat upset No. 2 Lindsay Davenport while Zvereva ousted
Monica Seles, both in straight sets.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras, closing in on
his fifth title in six years, swept Mark Philippoussis in straight
sets, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set in five matches, was out-aced
14-10 in a contest between two of the fastest servers in the game.
But he never lost serve, saving three break points against him
while breaking the Australian twice.
	   Sampras will play either Tim Henman or Jana Novotna in the
semifinals.
	   Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic advanced to the other
semifinal with straight-set wins.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 champion, cruised to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 win over
65th-ranked Davide Sanguinetti of Italy. Ivanisevic, a former
two-time finalist, beat Jan Siemerink in three tiebreakers.
	   Williams twice exploded at chair umpire Mike Morrissey after
shots by Novotna that landed near the line were not called out.
	   ``That was SO far out,'' she shouted in the first game of the
second set, then went up to the lineswoman and continued arguing.
	   Even more dramatic was her reaction to a non-call in the seventh
game.
	   ``I know it's out, she knows it's out, everyone knows it's out.
But you don't know it's out,'' Williams, her face contorted in
anger and tears, screamed at Morrissey.
	   After double faulting on the next point to go down 4-3, Williams
cried during the changeover.
	   Williams lost her temper again in the 11th game, standing
indignantly with her hands on her hips and complaining about a ball
that wasn't called long. When the next shot was called out,
Williams clapped her racket, mocking the lineswoman.
	   Williams said she didn't regret her outbursts and that she
played better afterwards.
	   ``I feel I needed to do that probably because I really wanted to
win those points,'' she said. ``The ball was really out and
sometimes you need to make sure you can go onto the next point.''
	   Williams seemed to regain control but, in the tiebreaker, she
played carelessly and made a series of unforced errors as Novotna
closed out the match.
	   Williams had raced to a 4-1 lead in the first set but lost three
straight games. Novotna broke for a 6-5 lead and served out the set
in the next game.
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, fell behind quickly and never recovered
as the unseeded Zvereva, known mainly as a doubles specialist,
moved her around the court and won 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
	   Zvereva, who ousted seven-time champion Steffi Graf last week,
beat Seles for the first time in five matches. She reached a Grand
Slam semifinal for the first time since her 6-0, 6-0 loss to Graf
in the 1988 French Open final.
	   Seles, whose father died in May after a long battle with stomach
cancer, reached the French Open final three weeks later, losing to
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   Seles won her first four Wimbledon matches in straight sets and
appeared to be a legitimate threat to win the only Grand Slam title
to elude her. But Zvereva, wearing red-tinted wrap-around sun
glasses, forced her into repeated errors and made her look
ordinary.
	   ``I just didn't feel anything was going well,'' Seles said. ``I
just couldn't put two points together today. ... I was missing my
backhand all over the place.''
	   Hingis lost her first set of the tournament but outlasted French
Open champ Sanchez Vicario 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
	   The 1 hour, 46-minute match featured long baseline rallies and
seemed more appropriate to the clay of the French Open than the
grass of Wimbledon. Several times in the final set, Hingis appeared
tired and out of breath.
	   The fifth-seeded Spaniard, known for her tireless retrieving,
pushed Hingis to the brink as she saved nine consecutive break
points over the second and third sets.
	   Hingis finally converted on the 10th break point, ripping a
backhand pass that ended a long, corner-to-corner rally and gave
her a 4-2 lead in the third set. She raised her arms in triumph and
caught her breath by sitting on a linesman's chair at the back of
the court.
	   Although Sanchez Vicario broke back in the next game, Hingis won
the next two games to close out the match. She smiled with relief
and pumped both fists after hitting an inside-out forehand which
the Spaniard returned wide.
	   Tauziat downed Davenport 6-3, 6-3 to reach her first Grand Slam
semifinal. The 16th-seeded Frenchwoman had lost her last seven
matches to the American.
	   ``That was by far the best she ever played against me,''
Davenport said. ``She just outplayed me completely today.''

Faldo aiming to get back on course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Nick Faldo faces many obstacles as he
starts day one of the dlrs 1.66 million Irish Open on Thursday
aiming for his first tournament win in 16 months.
	   Colin Montgomerie is one of those obstacles.
	   While Faldo has dropped to his lowest ever world ranking this
year, Montgomerie has been in winning form and is highly rated to
claim his third successive Irish Open.
	   A win for the Scotsman would emulate the performance last
achieved on the European tour by Faldo, who won the Irish Open for
three consecutive years from 1991.
	   Montgomerie, who recently became the first European golfer to
take his career earnings past 7 million pounds (dlrs 11.62
million), blitzed the Druids Glen course last year.
	   He won the 1997 Irish Open with a closing course-record 62,
finishing seven strokes clear of Lee Westwood and nine ahead of
third-placed Faldo.
	   Faldo, a three-times British Open winner, said Wednesday he
still has the will to win.
	   ``My desire's always there. If I didn't have any I wouldn't have
been out there on the practice range all day,'' he said.
	   Faldo, who turns 41 during the British Open at Birkdale in two
weeks, is outside the top 100 on the American money list this
season and has failed to make the cut in his last three majors.
	   But the Englishman said a return to form is ``just around the
corner''.
	   South Africa's Ernie Els has recovered from the back injury
which forced him out of the US Open and will join a strong field in
the Irish Open.

Oil company promises to pay taxes after losing access to pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of five oil companies denied access to an
export pipeline has agreed to pay its overdue taxes in two days,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday.
	   The government on Wednesday blocked five oil companies from
using the pipeline until they pay their taxes.
	   Russia's chronic tax collection problem is partly to blame for
the country's current financial crisis, and oil companies are the
biggest debtors.
	   The Tyumen Oil Co. agreed to pay its bill within two days, said
Vice Premier Viktor Khristenko. He said it will then regain access
to the pipeline.
	   The other companies blocked from using the pipeline are
Bashneft, SIDANCO, Tatneft and ONACO.

EU says manufacturers still receive too much state aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's competition chief
Karel Van Miert welcomed Wednesday a downward trend in the amount
of subsidies EU governments hand out to state companies, but said
it was still too high.
	   Between 1994 and 1996 governments paid out dlrs 42.3 billion to
manufacturing industry.
	   Germany and Italy registered the highest per capita levels of
state aid. The lowest levels were found in Britain and Portugal.
	   State aid to manufacturers in the 15-nation bloc was 10 percent
lower between 1994 and 1996 than in the previous two-year period,
the EU executive Commission said in a statement. The figures are
still much too high, Van Miert said in a statement.
	   In its statement, the EU executive body said it will implement
stricter rules to ensure state funding is targeted to the poorest
regions where it has a real impact.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter crashed and caught fire in
Siberia shortly after takeoff Wednesday morning, killing three
people, including one Canadian and one Lebanese, officials said.
	   The Mi-8 helicopter was carrying 16 people, including two
employees of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
bank spokesman Ben Atkins said in a telephone interview from
London.
	   The helicopter crashed as it was taking off near the city of
Ulan-Ude in southern Siberia, not far from the border with
Mongolia, Atkins said. It was scheduled to fly to a gold mine
operated by the Buryatzoloto company.
	   The head of the local aircraft factory, Anatoly Abashev, told
the ITAR-Tass news agency that the pilot reported losing control of
the helicopter during takeoff. Witnesses saw the craft shaking
violently after it lifted only a few meters (yards) from the
ground, the report added.
	   One of the dead was a Randa Smine, a Lebanese employee with the
EBRD, Atkins said. The second EBRD employee was injured, he said.
	   Also killed was Canadian Colin Chapman and a Russian citizen,
Yevgeny Nefedov, an employee of Buryatzoloto, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The 13 survivors suffered injuries and were receiving treatment,
ITAR-Tass said. Those seriously hurt included Canadians David
Mojeur, 52, and Elizabeth Martin, 42, the report said.

Scientologists file discrimination suit against Berlin government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The Church of Scientology said Wednesday it had
filed a lawsuit against Berlin officials demanding they stop
calling a high-ranking police official a Scientologist, saying it
means a ``social death sentence'' in Germany.
	   Police chief Otto D. was accused in an anonymous letter to his
superiors in March of being a leading Scientologist in Berlin and
of preventing an underling in the department from leaving the
church.
	   He denied being a Scientologist, a stance supported by the
church.
	   Prosecutors called off their investigation after finding no
evidence, church lawyers said. But the Berlin branch of Germany's
domestic intelligence agency began its own investigation and,
according to the Scientologists, sought to bribe a part-time church
employee to provide them with a church member list.
	   The agency then reported it had determined Otto D. was a
Scientologist.
	   The church says he has suffered discrimination in his job
because of the untrue charge.
	   Its lawsuit demands city officials stop calling him a
Scientologist and pay the court costs.
	   While it is recognized as a religion in the United States, Los
Angeles-based Scientology is viewed by the German government as an
economic enterprise out to bilk its members.
	   It was placed under government surveillance a year ago as a
threat to democracy _ a step toward a possible ban of the
organization.
	   The U.S. government has been critical of Germany's stance, which
Scientologists say has resulted in persecution and job
discrimination.

Israeli archaeologists protest religious interference

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several hundred archaeologists and their
supporters smashed pottery urns in front of Israel's parliament
building on Wednesday, protesting a reported plan to give religious
Jews authority over archaeological digs.
	   The protesters carried signs proclaiming ``Don't let archaeology
die,'' and ``You're burying archaeology.''
	   There were reports this week that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had reached a deal with ultra-Orthodox parties in his
coalition to fire the current head of Israel's Antiquities
Authority and replace him with a religious choice. The prime
minister's office refused comment Wednesday on the reports.
	   The ultra-Orthodox parties typically oppose excavation of sites
at which tombs or burial caves are found because they fear Jewish
graves will be damaged.
	   Protester Larry Steiger, a Harvard University archaeology
professor heading a Canaanite excavation in the southern town of
Ashkelon, said it would be a ``total disaster'' if the
ultra-Orthodox gained control over archaeology in Israel.
	   Lawmaker Rafi Abrul, from the opposition Labor Party, assured
the crowd of archaeologists, dig volunteers and students that most
members of parliament were behind them.
	   The protesters brought 15 large pottery urns _ not antiques _ to
the rally in wheelbarrows, and smashed them on the ground to
symbolize the danger to archaeology if the religious are allowed to
take over.

U.S. peace envoy says Kosovo observers could be in place this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke said
Wednesday that international observers could begin making symbolic
patrols of the tense Kosovo province of Yugoslavia as early as this
week.
	   ``The goal of the observer missions is to demonstrate an
international presence fast in the area, which may help calm things
down,'' Holbrooke said at the end of a two-day visit to the
Norwegian capital of Oslo.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels and Serb security forces have been
battling in the Kosovo province in a conflict Holbrooke described
as a crisis on the verge of being an emergency that could threaten
peace throughout the Balkans.
	   Holbrooke, recently nominated to become U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, left Yugoslavia on Friday after four days of
shuttle diplomacy between Yugoslavs and ethnic Albanians without
finding a way to end the fighting in Kosovo.
	   The international community wants to send unarmed diplomatic
observers to the region in hopes avoiding escalation in a conflict
that has left at least 300 people dead since late February.
	   Holbrooke said Richard Miles, U.S. charge d'affaires in
Yugoslavia, told him by telephone on Wednesday that international
observers were preparing for their first patrols of Kosovo.
	   ``He wants to have the first symbolic patrols out by the end of
the week or the beginning of next week. He planned to make one of
the first ones himself with the Russian and British ambassadors,''
Holbrooke said.
	   Norway, a NATO member of 4.4 million people, has also agreed to
provide observers, he said.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic recently agreed to allow
foreign observers, and Western diplomats have said some have
already begun to trickle in to the area.
	   At a news conference, Holbrooke said he was in constant touch
with U.S. diplomats in Yugoslavia, and that shuttle diplomacy was
continuing. Chris Hill, the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, meeting Albania Prime Minister Fatos Nano in Tirana,
Albania on Wednesday, he said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo _ part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's larger republic _ since Serb
security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28. The forces are
trying to halt growing resistance by Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population.

Field hockey federation bans metal in sticks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Field hockey's governing body on
Wednesday banned the use of metal in sticks for international
matches and insisted on the use of sticks with traditional wooden
heads.
	   In a statement, the International Hockey Federation said the new
rules were ``to maintain the characteristics of the game and limit
risk to players.''
	   Outside international matches, national hockey federations are
free to decide when modifications can be introduced in their
territory.

Croat police make Europe's biggest marijuana bust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Customs officers discovered over 16 tons
of top-quality marijuana hidden in two ship containers, a police
chief said Wednesday, describing the seizure as Europe's biggest
drug bust this year.
	   A 40 year-old man, who reportedly imported the 16.4 ton cargo in
the name of a textiles company, was arrested, the state-run news
agency HINA quoted police chief Ivan Nad saying. The man was not
fully identified
	   Nad said that the drugs, which were traced to the Malaysian port
of Penanga, were destined for the Western European markets.
	   The marijuana was found hidden under piles of bed linen during a
routine customs check in Zagreb Tuesday.
	   Croatia and its Central and Eastern European neighbors lie on a
traditional drug-smuggling route. The number of native drug-users
is also on the rise.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several hundred archaeologists and their
supporters smashed pottery urns in front of Israel's parliament
building on Wednesday, protesting a reported plan to give religious
Jews authority over archaeological digs.
	   The protesters carried signs proclaiming ``Don't let archaeology
die,'' and ``You're burying archaeology.''
	   There were reports this week that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had reached a deal with ultra-Orthodox parties in his
coalition to fire the current head of Israel's Antiquities
Authority and replace him with a religious choice. The prime
minister's office refused comment Wednesday on the reports.
	   The ultra-Orthodox parties typically oppose excavation of sites
at which tombs or burial caves are found because they fear Jewish
graves will be damaged.
	   Protester Larry Steiger, a Harvard University archaeology
professor heading a Canaanite excavation in the southern town of
Ashkelon, said it would be a ``total disaster'' if the
ultra-Orthodox gained control over archaeology in Israel.
	   Lawmaker Rafi Abrul, from the opposition Labor Party, assured

	   PARIS (AP) _ French and Mexican officials were holding a
ceremony Wednesday to re-light the eternal flame after two Mexican
tourists extinguished it in what authorities called an
``unspeakable act.''
	   Officials would give no precise description of the act. A
statement by the Defense Ministry said the flame, which lies under
the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and commemorates the nation's war
dead, was ``soiled'' Tuesday night and that two Mexicans were
questioned by police.
	   ``This has been an attack on the memory of those who died for
France, and their honor,'' the statement said.
	   A re-lighting ceremony, attended by war veterans, was planned
for later Wednesday.
	   Genevieve Senechal, spokeswoman for France's Anciens Combattants
war veterans association, described it as ``terrible vandalism and
profanation.''
	   ``I just hope they were drunk. That wouldn't excuse them, but at
least then it might not have been premeditated.''
	   A spokeswoman for the Mexican Embassy in Paris confirmed that a
man and woman had been detained and later released. She said the
affair was ``an accident.
	   ``I don't think French-Mexican bilateral ties will be too
affected,'' said the spokeswoman, Anne Morales. ``After all, the
Mexican ambassador has been invited to the re-igniting ceremony.''

Novotna beats angry Williams

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Screaming with fury and crying over
disputed line calls, Venus Williams' bid for the Wimbledon title
ended Wednesday with a quarterfinal loss to Jana Novotna.
	   The 18-year-old American lost her composure and the match, 7-5,
7-6 (7-2).
	   ``I had a firm belief that those balls were out and the
linespeople should have called them out,'' she said. ``Of course,
you have to get over those things.''
	   Williams said her tantrums made the match more entertaining.
	   ``The crowd probably enjoyed my emotional outburst,'' she said.
``It brightened up someone's day.''
	   Williams played aggressive, serve-and-volley tennis, trying to
beat Novotna at her own game. But she failed to win the key points
as Novotna, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, showed her experience on
grass.
	   Novotna advanced to a semifinal meeting against defending
champion Martina Hingis, who overcame Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in
three sets to set up a rematch of last year's final.
	   Reaching the other semifinal were Nathalie Tauziat and Natsha
Zvereva. Tauziat upset No. 2 Lindsay Davenport while Zvereva ousted
Monica Seles, both in straight sets.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras, closing in on
his fifth title in six years, swept Mark Philippoussis in straight
sets, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set in five matches, was out-aced
14-10 in a contest between two of the fastest servers in the game.
But he never lost serve, saving three break points against him
while breaking the Australian twice.
	   Sampras will play either Tim Henman or Petr Korda in the
semifinals.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister beseeched parliament
Wednesday to approve the Kremlin's economic rescue plan, warning
that the economy has lost much of the little ground it gained and
is again on the skids.
	   But lawmakers in the opposition-dominated parliament made clear
they do not trust President Boris Yeltsin and would not
rubber-stamp his administration's proposals.
	   ``This government's course is bankrupt,'' said Communist Party
chief Gennady Zyuganov, head of parliament's largest faction. ``We
must either change it or the end is very close.''
	   In an address to lawmakers, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko laid
out the economy's troubles in stark terms. Gross domestic product
has declined 0.2 percent in the first five months of this year, he
said, eroding the modest 0.8 percent gain the economy posted last
year _ the first since the Soviet collapse.
	   He urged lawmakers to swiftly pass a package of 26 bills the
administration has compiled to trim spending, increase revenue and
win a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Kiriyenko warned that the economy is sinking too rapidly to
indulge in ideological debates.
	   ``The suggested measures are not political ones,'' he said.
``They are necessary for every political party. It is clear what we
need to do.''
	   But lawmakers from a variety of factions said they have no
confidence in the administration and will pick and choose among the
bills, amending those to which they object.
	   ``We won't accept the majority of rigid measures the government
insists on,'' said ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of
parliament's third-largest faction.
	   Communists and the other hard-liners who dominate parliament
have consistently opposed spending cuts, arguing that the
government should spend more to help struggling individuals and
industries. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
meant that millions of Russians get their wages months late.
	   Zyuganov said his party is likely to support only a portion of
the government's proposals _ those that lower tax rates and assist
industry. Even the pro-government Our Home is Russia block said
they were likely to pass the bills only with some amendments.
	   The parliament has a pattern of rhetorically opposing Yeltsin
but giving in to his pressures at the last minute. Moreover, many
of the measures have already been implemented by presidential
decree.
	   All the same, lawmakers' negative comments were unlikely to calm
Russia's skittish stock market, which has lost half its value since
the beginning of the year and has been dropping fairly steadily for
the past two months.
	   The pattern continued Wednesday, with the stock market closing
about 4 percent lower. The ruble also dropped to 6.24 to the
dollar, down from 6.23 on Tuesday.
	   Gary Kinsey, a trader at Brunswick Warburg brokerage in Moscow,
said the markets are convinced the key to a Russian recovery will
be a new IMF loan.
	   The government says they need at least dlrs 10 billion to shore
up the Central Bank's reserves, strained by the effort of
supporting the ruble. If the currency is devalued, the Kremlin
fears higher prices could cause social and political unrest.
	   Duma deputies are scheduled to leave town on Friday to begin
their summer recess. Some of the bills may get preliminary approval
before then, but others may wait until a special session set to
begin July 15.

Oil company promises to pay taxes after losing access to pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with companies' position, report
government only threatening to limit access to pipeline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government threatened Wednesday to
limit tax-dodging oil companies access to export pipelines, but
some of the companies denied they owed any money.
	   The oil companies said the government will only hurt itself if
it tries to use force to collect taxes.
	   Russia's chronic tax collection problem is partly to blame for
the country's current financial crisis, and oil companies are the
biggest debtors.
	   Boosting tax collection is a key condition for obtaining a new
International Monetary Fund loan. About 40 percent of Russia's tax
revenues come from the oil and gas industries.
	   ``If somebody gets cut off from exports, the government denies
itself a stable source of income, and the question of tax
collections will become irrelevant because there won't be anywhere
to collect them from,'' said Denis Davydov, spokesman for AO
Sidanko, one of the targeted companies.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the government had already denied
access to the export pipeline to Sidanko and four other companies,
the Tyumen Oil Co., Bashneft, Tatneft and ONACO.
	   It quoted Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko as saying
Tyumen had agreed to pay its bill within two days.
	   Davydov said Sidanko's debts have been run up by one of its
subsidiaries, Siberian-based AO Varyoganeft, and that government
agencies owe an equal amount to Sidanko for fuel oil and petrol
deliveries.

World Cup: Close, but not that close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Beckham apology &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ If only.
	   The handballs missed by the referee in the penalty area. David
Beckham's decision to kick back at an opponent who fouled him. The
decision to let David Batty take his first ever penalty kick.
	   All these conspired to knock England out of the World Cup as
Argentina triumphed 4-3 in a penalty shootout after a 2-2 tie
Tuesday night.
	   That's according to the England team.
	   ``There was such a strange emotion, a feeling among us about how
well we'd done and what we should have achieved,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said.
	   ``That's the saddest thing. It wasn't that we'd lost to
Argentina or that we had been knocked out, but that we'll never
know what we could have achieved.
	   ``I felt we would have gone from strength to strength and
perhaps gone all the way and won it.
	   ``If we'd kept 11-against-11 we would have won the game. The
confidence we'd have had from there would have worked in our favor.
That's how thin the dividing line is.''
	   The loss meant that three times out the last four major
championships England has played in, the team has been eliminated
in a penalty shootout.
	   It happened against Germany at both the 1990 World Cup and the
1998 European Championship and now against Argentina at France 98.
	   Yet, while England displayed all its typical fighting spirit
against Argentina and an impressively imaginative strikeforce
against Colombia, it still fell short of being a true candidate for
a World Cup title.
	   The English defenders are still slow to turn against speedy
forwards and too many midfielders are quick to go flying in with
needless foul tackles when they lose their tempers.
	   Beckham's expulsion for petulantly kicking back at Diego
Simeone, even when the English player was lying face down on the
ground, was inevitable and England paid the price.
	   ``This is without doubt the worst moment of my career,'' Beckham
said Wednesday as the British media and returning fans scolded him
for his blunder. ``I will always regret my actions during last
night's game.
	   ``I have apologized to the England players and management and I
want every England supporter to know how deeply sorry I am.''
	   Hoddle said his team should have had a penalty for at least one
Argentina handball. But decisions like that have a habit of evening
themselves out and other coaches would say he has little to
complain about.
	   Although Batty volunteered to take what was his first penalty
kick in a competitive game, Hoddle could have had more experienced
penalty takers on the field when he knew a shootout was imminent.
Even defender Tony Adams, who was on the field, has scored for
England from the spot and he wasn't called upon this time.
	   Hoddle has plenty of good things to work on as his team looks
ahead to qualifying for the 2000 European Championship and the next
World Cup in 2002.
	   In 18-year-old Liverpool striker Michael Owen, England has a
rare goalscoring talent who appears to have the experience of a
seasoned pro even though he has been at the top of the game for
barely 18 months. His solo goal against Argentina was one of the
best of any World Cup.
	   Beckham, despite his expulsion, showed that he is a supremely
gifted playmaker and looks extremely confident on the ball. His
30-meter free kick against Colombia was another of the best goals
of France 98.
	   Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Sol Campbell are young players
quickly building experience at the highest level, Paul Ince remains
a combative influence and David Seaman provided more proof he is
one of the best goalkeepers around.
	   The performance of the midfield showed that Hoddle was right to
leave behind fading star Paul Gascoigne. Although center-back Tony
Adams had an inspired game against Argentina when England was down
to 10 players for 75 minutes, the team needs defenders with far
more mobility and skill on the ball.
	   In terms of tactics and imaginative play, England has made big
improvements in the past four years under Terry Venables and Hoddle
but is still far from the finished article.
	   Even if fate wasn't on his side this time, Hoddle and his team
still made far too many mistakes.
	   Otherwise they wouldn't be out of the World Cup.

Fighting tears at Bissau and Mansoa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with reports of peace talks. EDITS and TRIMS
throughout. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Machine-gun fire and
rocket-propelled grenades tore through the capital of Bissau and
the nearby town of Mansoa on Wednesday, one day after peace talks
were canceled amid fierce fighting between government soldiers and
renegade troops.
	   Hundreds of people were fleeing the fighting in Mansoa, filling
the roads toward Bafata, about 110 kilometers (66 miles) to the
east.
	   ``We're running because its so hard there now,'' said Aliu Mane,
a refugee on the road just outside Mansoa. `I don't know where I'm
going to find food. I don't know where I'm going.''
	   At least three civilians had been killed in the town since
Wednesday night, all apparently by shrapnel, and twelve injured.
	   Intense gunfire continued to rock the town into the afternoon,
though with soldiers from each side in various areas it was unclear
who controlled it.
	   ``This is an injustice to the people,'' said Father Maurice
Fioravanti, a Catholic missionary in Mansoa. ``We lack food and
medicine but all they do is fight.''
	   In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, meanwhile, chiefs of defense staff of
the Economic Community of West African States were meeting
Wednesday to discuss whether to send peacekeepers to help bring an
end to the fighting. The decision of the defense staff officials
wilhe group's peacekeeping wing, known
as ECOMOG.
	   Largely made up of Nigerians, ECOMOG has stepped into trouble
spots before in West Africa. Most recently, they forced out a coup
leader in Sierra Leone, replacing the elected government.
	   On Tuesday, hours before a government delegation was to meet
with renegade leaders to discuss a cease-fire in this former
Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip, artillery and rocket
fire slammed into the capital of Bissau and its outlying areas.
	   The talks were canceled as both sides accused the other of
launching the attack.
	   Rebel leaders had earlier demanded that Senegal and Republic of
Guinea, which support Vieira, withdraw their troops before peace
negotiations continue.
	   The renegade soldiers are also calling for a cease-fire and the
intervention of Portuguese soldiers.
	   Portugal's ambassador in Bissau, Francisco Henriques da Silva,
was following up on mediation efforts launched over the weekend by
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, a foreign ministry
spokeswoman said in Lisbon.
	   Unconfirmed reports in Portugal said the rebels and loyalists
were meeting on a Portuguese ship anchored offshore. However,
Lisbon radio TSF said only the rebels were present, meeting with da
Silva.
	   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the
reports.
	   Former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane tried to topple
Vieira earlier this month. The coup attempt degenerated into near
civil war in and around the capital and some nearby towns.
Guinea-Bissau's military is split between allegiances to Vieira and
Mane.
	   The government has offered a pardon to rebel soldiers who lay
down their arms and a life in exile to officers who masterminded
the uprising.
	   A growing number of people support rebel claims that Vieira's
government was riddled with corruption.
	   Aid agencies warn that Bissau's displaced population _ many of
whom have moved to Mansoa and the other central towns of Bafata and
Canchungo _ are putting increasing pressure on dwindling food
supplies.
	   Fernando Nobre, a doctor from the Portuguese relief group AMI
said some 50,000 refugees were in urgent need of help just in Gabu,
200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Bissau.
	   AMI arrived in Gabu 10 days after the conflict started and found
refugees starving to death.

Hermitage Museum opens new computer center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   St. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The Hermitage Museum, housing one
of the world's greatest art collections, opened an IBM-designed
computer center Wednesday to make its art more accessible to young
people.
	   Six computers available to all museum visitors contain
point-and-click images designed to teach viewers about the museum's
collection.
	   One, containing images of art in the Hermitage with a biblical
theme, is aimed at people 15 years and older. The other, whose
theme is the legendary stories of antiquity, is aimed at children
ages 10 to 13.
	   ``The opening of this center is a unique opportunity to show the
uses of technology in the sphere of art and culture,'' said Mikhail
Piotrovsky, the museum's director.
	   The opening of the center is the second stage of a three-stage
project in which IBM is helping the cash-strapped Hermitage
incorporate technology into its collection. The company estimates
it will spend $1.5 million on the project.

World Bank: Asian crisis will not greatly hurt Latin American
</HEADLINE>
growth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The growth of Latin American
economies this year will be greater than last year thanks to
prudent measures which are limiting the impact of Asia's financial
crisis, the World Bank said at the close of a regional conference.
	   Latin American nations can expect growth of between 3 percent
and 4 percent in 1998, compared to the 2 percent to 5 percent they
saw last year, the organization said.
	   Guillermo Perry, the bank's chief economist for Latin America
and the Caribbean, said the region's governments had not only
cautiously managed their financial systems, but they skillfully
applied macroeconomic principles which kept the Asian crisis from
spreading.
	   However, Latin American countries _ Central America in
particular _ must still do more to manage the risk taken by banks,
Perry said.
	   The World Bank concluded its fourth annual regional conference
Tuesday night in El Salvador. The session on financial crises and
the solidity of the region's financial systems was attended by 450
bankers, economists and central bank governors from Europe, Latin
America and the United States.
	   The 1999 conference, scheduled for Chile, will center on the
development of Latin American governments and decentralization,
World Bank vice president Shaid Burki said.
	   ``We hope to speak of development and not of financial crises,''
Burki said.
	   The conference in 2000 will be held in Spain.

World Cup: Adidas halts Chinese soccer ball production, but denies
</HEADLINE>
link to labor camp &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Adidas denial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Adidas said Wednesday it is cancelling all existing
orders for the production of soccer balls in China, but denied that
the decision was made in response to a newspaper report alleging
the involvement of prisoners.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe reported Tuesday that Adidas, one
of the World Cup's official suppliers, made the decision because it
had found that soccer ball manufacturing was firmly linked to
prison labor.
	   The German company denied the report, saying its own
investigation had not yet reached conclusions. Adidas began an
investigation into the possible use of Chinese prison labor to
produce balls as soon as the allegations were first made in early
June.
	   The newspaper cited an official at the Dazhong Agricultural
Machinery Factory, which is attached to a labor camp near Shanghai,
as saying that the enterprise has made balls for Shanghai Union
Ball Enterprise Corp.
	   Shanghai Union makes Adidas-branded balls for Japan's Molten
Corp., and an Adidas subsidiary through a production deal with
Shanghai-based Mortex Ltd.
	   Adidas is now stopping all production by Mortex and Molten.
	   The balls concerned are not those used in the World Cup but are
cheaper copies for general sale.
	   In a statement released at the World Cup, Adidas said that no
third parties or other entities would produce balls and that
production would be centralized at Adidas Asia-Pacific in Hong
Kong.
	   ``Our aim is to have the utmost control over the Adidas brand.
Sourcing our products plays an important role in the perception of
our brand by our consumers,'' said Robert Louis-Dreyfus, president
of Adidas-Solomon AG. ``We are determined to directly control the
whole value-chain.''

Employee of self-proclaimed government of Kosovo shot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An employee of the self-proclaimed ``government''
of Kosovo was shot and wounded by armed gunmen who burst into the
organization's Geneva office Wednesday, its officials and city
police said.
	   The man was shot in the stomach as he tried to prevent the two
masked men entering the office located in the city's Rive district,
said a statement from the ``Republic of Kosovo'' organization,
which is run by independence-seeking Kosovo Albanian activists.
	   City police said in a statement that they had been informed
about the incident after it took place. They had no further details
about the attackers or their motives, the statement said.
	   The victim, a Kosovo national aged in his thirties, was taken by
ambulance to the cantonal (state) hospital, police said. His life
isn't in danger, the statement said.
	   The Geneva office is an information center of the
self-proclaimed government, which is campaigning for independence
from the Serb-ruled Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Xafar Shatri, the ``government's minister of information,'' is
based at the center.
	   The statement released by center officials claimed Serb
authorities and armed forces were targeting Kosovo Albanians abroad
as part of an ``ethnic purification operation'' being carried out
in the province.

 &UR; Eds: SUB 5th graf to add Barshefsky predicting dlrs 60 billion
deficit &QL; 
 &UR; BY LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Praising the ``ingenuity and energy'' of
China's cosmopolitan center of capitalism, President Bill Clinton
urged his communist hosts Wednesday to open markets, battle
corruption and clean up the environment.
	   ``For China, as for America, the promise for the future lies in
helping our citizens to master the challenges of the global
economy, not to deny them or run away from them,'' Clinton told
American business leaders before touring Shanghai's gleaming new
stock market.
	   Speaking in the sun-streaked atrium of a high-rise hotel,
Clinton called on China to open its markets. And he expressed
disappointment that he and President Jiang Zemin failed to reach
agreement on lowering trade barriers and other economic reforms,
conditions that must be met before China gains entry into the World
Trade Organization. ``But we'll keep working at it until we reach a
commercially viable agreement,'' he added.
	   While pushing Congress to renew normal trade relations with
China, Clinton said he wasn't ready to try to make those relations
permanent.
	   America buys one-third of China's exports and should, in turn,
get ``a fair shot at China's markets,'' he said.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with China is dlrs 50 billion, and U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday it could
climb to dlrs 60 billion this year.
	   Delivering a strong environmental message, Clinton said he
couldn't ask China to slow its economic growth with tough
anti-pollution measures. ``But as a citizen of the world and the
leader of my country, I have a responsibility to ask us all to work
together for a planet that our grandchildren can still enjoy living
on. And so do you.''
	   Afterward, Clinton toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange during a
lunchtime pause in trading. Instead of stock prices, the electronic
readout board glowed with a red and yellow presidential welcome.
	   Traders shook Clinton's hand and gave him a red trader vest with
the yellow number 1998 on its back. He didn't ring the opening bell
_ here a huge gong _ as Jiang did when he visited the New York
Stock Exchange last October during his U.S. visit.
	   While there, Chinese television interviewed the president for
nearly half an hour for a program to be broadcast during prime time
Thursday, the White House said. He was asked 19 questions, all
friendly.
	   Asked who had the tougher job _ Clinton or Jiang _ the president
said, ``Oh, I don't know,'' explaining that China faces enormous
challenges and the United States is dealing with a post-Cold War
world in which, he predicted, America would one day lose superpower
status.
	   ``America has this role which is temporary _ it won't last
forever _ as the only superpower in the world,'' Clinton said in a
transcript the White House provided. ``I have a lot of work to do
to deal with America's challenges and problems at home,'' he added,
``and then to try to get the American people to support our nation
doing what we should do as a force for peace and prosperity and
stability around the world.''
	   He also praised China for making ``a genuine movement toward
openness and freedom'' which, he said, ``I hope will continue and
increase.''
	   Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry noted it was the third time
Clinton had been featured on state-controlled Central Chinese
Television since his visit began, including during a live speech to
Peking University and at his joint news conference with Jiang.
	   In the evening, the president and his family took a leisurely
boat trip down the city's main river, the Huangpu. On one bank were
the European-style waterfront buildings from Shanghai's golden days
as a cosmopolitan city in the 1920s and 1930s.
	   On the other were the neon-lit skyscrapers of today. The trip
took him past the steel-girded stock exchange building and the
space-age Orient Pearl television tower that provides commanding
views of the city.

	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ In a school report, a math
teacher writes, ``I fear numbers mean little to Diana.'' Nearby
stands a school trunk labeled D. Spencer and a pair of small,
well-worn tap shoes _ mementoes of a little girl who grew up to be
Princess Diana.
	   Some 2,500 people queued for more than an hour to see such
relics Wednesday, what would have been Diana's 37th birthday and
the opening day of a 3 million pound (dlrs 5 million) memorial
museum at her ancestral home, Althorp House.
	   For many, the only place to be was the small, ornamental lake
where Diana lies buried on an island, a bucolic, tree-ringed spot.
Mourners laid armfuls of her favorite lilies and white roses at a
small temple at one end of the lake, the nearest they could get to
her gravesite.
	   But some visitors worried that the world's most photographed
woman, killed in an Aug. 31 car crash fleeing the paparazzi in
Paris, continues to be exploited.
	   ``Even in death, she has not got peace,'' said Isabel Don,
crying quietly as she surveyed the stream of passing visitors and
helicopters overhead carrying TV crews. ``People will always want
more of her.''
	   Demand was heavy for the limited number of tickets, called
``invitations to visit.'' Soon after the gates opened at 10 a.m.
(0900 GMT), lines began to form outside the 1730s former stable
block where many of Diana's belongings are housed.

cash in on his sister's memory, spent much of the day mingling with
visitors, listening to endless stories about ``the day I met
Diana'' and posing for photographs. Every so often, he murmured to
a visitor, ``I hope you find this appropriate.''
	   Many in the crowd were members of the press, who had to buy
tickets the normal way, through a telephone sales line. Among them
was Arthur Edwards, a photographer for Britain's mass-selling Sun
tabloid, who photographed Diana throughout her royal life.
	   Even such hardened veterans were moved by the display of
personal items and the serene lake.
	   ``I miss her,'' Edwards said as he paused to study the giant
stone urn the earl erected on the island. ``She was so lively, so
down to earth. I have photographed her on so many birthdays, and
this year we are here. ... I still can't believe it.''
	   Diana's sons planned no public appearances on her birthday, and
it was unclear how they marked it. Prince William, 16, was on
holiday from Eton College and Prince Harry, 13, was still at
Ludgrove School. Diana's former husband, Prince Charles, had a full
schedule of official engagements, but made no public comments.
	   Earl Spencer has also opened Althorp House, with its collection
of family portraits and valuable paintings, through Aug. 30.
	   Nearly 150,000 tickets have been sold at prices ranging from 5
pounds (dlrs 8.30) for children to 7.50 pounds (dlrs 12.45) for
senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15.75) for adults.
	   Items on display include Diana's frothy silk wedding dress by
David and Elizabeth Emanuel, and the thousands of condolence books
signed around the world after her death.
	   Jewelry on hand includes Diana's necklaces, tiaras and a crown.
In one room, mannequins are dressed in some of the outfits she wore
at public functions, together with pictures of her wearing them.
	   Visitors also see Diana's school uniform and touching home movie
footage of her with her brother and two sisters at Althorp. It
includes shots of Diana on a camel at a birthday party and dancing
coquettishly as she waves a bright red scarf.
	   Other video exhibits illustrate her humanitarian work and the
public reaction to her death. The first draft of Earl Spencer's
funeral speech is also displayed.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associated with Diana, including mugs,
pens and key rings with excerpts from the earl's speech. Prices
range from 5 pounds (dlrs 8.30) for an address book bearing an
image of a white rose to 70 pounds (dlrs 115) for a crystal tumbler
with the Spencer crest.
	   The earl has said the profits from the museum will go to Diana's
favorite charities, but has not said what share of the revenues he
will use to defray his expenses. He also has said he expects to
open the estate to visitors every summer.
	   Some ticket-holders came Wednesday not knowing what to expect,
only to find the sight of Diana's personal effects almost too much
to bear.
	   ``I was sobbing at the end,'' said Nancy Emeny, who drove about
two hours from Solihull with her husband. ``I had doubts about her
being buried on the island, but it had a very peaceful feeling. The
earl has done a great job.''

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
said Wednesday he will take part in an international conference
this fall on the restoration of the ancient Silk Road between
Europe and Central Asia.
	   The announcement was made at the close of Constantinescu's visit
to Azerbaijan, which is eager to restore the legendary road that
for centuries facilitated trade and brought power and prosperity to
many cities.
	   The conference is to take place on Sept. 7-8 in Azerbaijan's
capital Baku, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Constantinescu later traveled to Georgia, where he met with
President Eduard Shevardnadze, who he called his ``great friend.''
Georgia and Romania agreed to open embassies in one another's
countries.

Field hockey federation bans metal in sticks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Field hockey's governing body on
Wednesday banned the use of metal in sticks for international
matches, insisting on the use of sticks with traditional wooden
heads.
	   In a statement, the International Hockey Federation said the new
rules were ``to maintain the characteristics of the game and limit
risk to players.''
	   Outside international matches, national hockey federations are
free to decide when modifications can be introduced.

Tom Ford and Calvin Klein pack a good bag
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Leave it to two Americans to pack a man's
perfect warm weather suitcase.
	   Tom Ford for Gucci and Calvin Klein combine classic with cool,
sport with sophistication, business with beach.
	   Italian know-how in fabrics and workmanship do the rest.
	   For spring-summer 1999, the Texan whiz kid, who turned Gucci's
sagging clubhouse chic into hip haberdashery in less than three
years, has another ace up his sleeve.
	   From his luxurious slick city suit in navy or gray, worn with a
matching unbuttoned silk shirt, he moves on to a loose and
sparkling fashion. The new Gucci look was presented Tuesday night,
during the five-day Italian menswear preview showings.
	   Sequined shirts, suits with classic jacket and loose track
pants, cheerful prints and dashes of color everywhere combine to
reflect Ford's upbeat mood as well as his sharp fashion sense.
	   ``It's time to be happy,'' Ford said after the show. ``I'm tired
of black, black, black.''
	   While a wide-screen video of wavy waters, a highway traveled at
top speed and the flashing lights of Las Vegas provided the runway
backdrop, the models showed off Ford's latest styles based on
motorcycle and scuba diving attire.
	   As models marched down the runway in red leather bike suits,
brightly printed diving pants and glittering silk trousers and
shirts, a rapper repeated the refrain, ``I want Gucci, you want
that, too.''
	   Tom Ford has avoided any comment on Prada's purchase of 9.5
percent of Gucci, but the clothes told a story very different from
the minimalist look favored by the rival company.
	   Calvin Klein showed his version Wednesday of the last menswear
styles of the century. The loose sophisticated look, also heavily
based on sports themes, completed the story of contemporary class.
	   There are some great suits here in ultra-light fabrics and
free-fitting rather than baggy cuts.
	   More often than not the wide trousers have draw strings and
elastic waistband, making them wearable both for town and country.
	   Tops include the omnipresent T-shirt with new rolled collar, the
crisp short-sleeved shirt and the airy punched leather pullovers.
Blousons and shirt jackets are the favorite spring breeze
solutions.
	   If Ford is bursting out in color, Calvin opts for calming
shades: white, sand, camel, soft blue and pale green. Black makes
an occasional appearance.
	   But whether for office duty or resort relaxation the styles are
sculpted around the body with as few seams as possible, in fabrics
as light as a mosquito net.
	   The marriage of American casual elegance and Italian workmanship
has already put the Calvin Klein label in the top echelons of U.S.
design.

 &UR; Kinkel says NATO intervention in Kosovo wouldn't be immediate &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kinkel's five-point proposal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Wednesday that Kosovo Albanians shouldn't expect immediate
NATO intervention in their separatist province.
	   In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio, Kinkel also said he
will push a five-point plan to ease tensions in Kosovo when the
international Contact Group on Yugoslavia meets July 8 in Bonn.
	   -- An immediate cease fire as a prerequisite for restarting
negotiations.
	   -- Enforcement of sanctions thus far decided on by western
nations and the results of meetings in London and Moscow with a
U.N. Security Council resolution.
	   -- Develop basic elements for autonomy regulations since the
parties involved in the Kosovo conflict are unable to develop a
dialogue.
	   -- A massive presence of international observers in Kosovo.
	   -- A regional refugee program so that Germany is not flooded
with more refugees.
	   The five-nation Contact Group on Yugoslavia includes France,
Germany, Britain, Russia and the United States.
	   Kinkel said no mandate was in sight from the U.N. Security
Council for a military intervention, because council members Russia
and China oppose the move.
	   He also said that if Western nations intervene in Kosovo without
at least securing the support of Russia, it would damage Russia's
efforts to mediate in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``Therefore, one shouldn't awake illusory expectations in the
Kosovo Albanians that NATO will intervene tomorrow,'' Kinkel said.
He didn't want to speculate about whether an intervention was ``a
question of weeks or months.''
	   The Kosovo Albanians have appealed for NATO intervention to end
attacks by Serb forces in their separatist province.
	   Key NATO members, including the United States, have said the
Security Council's blessing is not needed for NATO intervention,
but other allies, including Russia, disagree.
	   Germany has not spoken with one voice on the issue: Kinkel says
he supports a U.N. mandate before any intervention, but Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe has said that consensus among NATO nations
would be enough for an intervention.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance to Serb rule. Ethnic Albanians make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.

Russian president urges India to sign anti-nuclear treaties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin appealed to India
on Wednesday to sign international treaties limiting the spread and
development of nuclear weapons.
	   ``The whole world would welcome the accession of your country to
the Non-Proliferation Treaty,'' Yeltsin said in a message to Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, according to the presidential
press service. ``This problem must be solved.''
	   Yeltsin also urged India to find a solution to the conflict with
Pakistan over the province of Kashmir, and said he was looking
forward to his planned trip to New Delhi in December.
	   Although India is a longtime military partner with Russia, the
Kremlin has denounced India's recent nuclear tests.
	   However, Russia is proceeding with its military cooperation with
India. In fact, Russia has offered them its S-300V air defense
system, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing Maj. Gen.
Alexander Luzan, a top official at Rosvooruzheniye, the state arms
exporter.
	   The system, similar to the U.S. Patriot missile system, would
counteract Pakistan's Ghori ballistic missiles, ITAR-Tass said.

Williams leaves Wimbledon screaming and seething

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Henman victory, Sampras quote in grafs 11-15 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Screaming with fury and crying over
disputed line calls, Venus Williams' bid for the Wimbledon title
ended Wednesday with a quarterfinal loss to Jana Novotna.
	   The 18-year-old American lost her composure and the match, 7-5,
7-6 (7-2).
	   ``I had a firm belief that those balls were out and the
linespeople should have called them out,'' she said. ``Of course,
you have to get over those things.''
	   Williams said her tantrums no doubt made the match more
entertaining.
	   ``The crowd probably enjoyed my emotional outburst,'' she said.
``It brightened up someone's day.''
	   Williams played aggressive, serve-and-volley tennis, trying to
beat Novotna at her own game. But she failed to win the key points
as Novotna, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, showed her experience on
grass.
	   Novotna advanced to a semifinal against defending champion
Martina Hingis, who overcame Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in three sets
to set up a rematch of last year's final.
	   Reaching the other semifinal were Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha
Zvereva. Tauziat upset No. 2 Lindsay Davenport while Zvereva ousted
Monica Seles, both in straight sets.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras, closing in on
his fifth title in six years, swept Mark Philippoussis 7-6 (7-5),
6-4, 6-4.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set in five matches, was out-aced
14-10 in a contest between two of the fastest servers in the game.
But he never lost serve, saving three break points against him
while breaking the Australian twice.
	   Sampras will next face Tim Henman, who beat Petr Korda 6-3, 6-4,
6-2 to become the first British player to reach the men's semis
since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   Korda, who strained his left Achilles tendon two days ago, was
limping noticeably and received treatment during the first set.
	   Henman got a standing ovation from the Centre Court crowd, his
victory providing a lift for Britain following England's World Cup
defeat to Argentina in a penalty shootout Tuesday night.
	   Sampras said Henman, bidding to become the first British men's
champion since 1936, will have enormous crowd support Friday.
	   ``It's going to be tough,'' he said. ``But you still have to
play well. It's still one-on-one.''

Iran seeks Western investment in oil sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iran is trying to revitalize its oil industry by
seeking funds from an outside source that once would have been
unthinkable _ the West.
	   The Iranians are stopping far short of privatizing any
state-owned oil fields, but they are offering outsiders the chance
to invest in more than two dozen production projects worth some
dlrs 7 billion, Farah Rahimi, Iran's minister of international
affairs, said Wednesday.
	   Some of the projects will involve exploring for new oil wells,
while others will involve finding ways to pump more oil out of
existing fields, Rahimi said. The first deal will be put up for
grabs on Aug. 3 in Tehran, he said.
	   The Iranians are courting the outside investment at a conference
this week in London, with some Western executives encouraged by the
recent indications that the United States will not attempt to
impose sanctions on European Union-based companies who invest in
Iran.
	   The U.S. government will not let American companies invest in
Iran's oil sector and it had threatened sanctions against other
outside companies that did business with the Iranians.
	   One British oil executive said Wednesday that the U.S. sanctions
will ultimately prove unsustainable.
	   ``We are a U.K. company and we do not accept that a foreign
government can tell us what to do,'' said Tim Eggar, a former
British energy minister who now is chief executive of Monument Oil
and Gas PLC.
	   The idea of outside oil companies investing in Iran may seem
unlikely, after all the tensions that have separated the West from
Iran after its Islamic revolution, but the Iranians have recognized
that they need outside help to make the most of their vast oil
resources.
	   Some other OPEC nations that previously kicked out the Western
oil companies also have been slowly reopening the door.
	   But Iran's deputy oil minister, S.M. Husseini, told delegates to
the oil conference that there was no chance of Big Oil taking over
his nation's oil fields, which all are held by the Iranian
government.
	   ``Giving our oil reserves to the private sector would require a
change in the 1997 oil law. This isn't currently a consideration,''
he said.
	   But Husseini said Iran has sold off four petrochemical plants
and it plans to sell two more.

World Cup: England's Beckham gets two-game ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ David Beckham, ejected for kicking an opponent in
England's penalty shootout loss to Argentina, was banned for two
games Wednesday by FIFA.
	   The suspension means Beckham will miss England's next two
competitive matches _ the first two qualifying games for the 2000
European Championships.
	   The 23-year-old England midfielder was sent off for violent
conduct for kicking Diego Simeone in retaliation at the start of
the second half of Tuesday night's game. FIFA also fined him 5,000
Swiss francs (dlrs 833).

Belfast's new Assembly elects Protestant, Catholic leaders

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Against the odds of history,
Northern Ireland's new Assembly elected a Protestant leader and
Catholic deputy Wednesday in its first step down the slow road of
governing this divided country together.
	   On a joint 61-27 vote after three hours of sometimes bitter and
abusive debate, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble became
the Assembly's first minister and Social Democratic and Labor Party
deputy leader Seamus Mallon became its deputy first minister.
	   Seventeen members of the 108-member body abstained, and three
were absent.
	   Among the politicians who gathered around a vast U-shaped table
were convicted IRA bombers and gun-runners, slayers of Catholic
civilians, retired cops and British soldiers _ and a camp of
Protestant hard-liners determined to scuttle the whole project.
	   Minutes before the Assembly convened in a sign of changing
times, Mitchel McLaughlin, the Catholic chairman of the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party, sat side by side chatting with Billy Hutchinson,
who spent 16 years in prison for shooting two Catholics to death.
	   But the Rev. Ian Paisley and other members of a 28-strong bloc
of Protestants opposed to the agreement railed angrily at length,
both at the Sinn Fein members and at Trimble.
	   ``We acknowledge the fact that people can change,'' Trimble said
in his speech immediately before the vote, which he delivered
calmly despite a barrage of heckling from Paisley's benches 30 feet
(10 meters) away.
	   Trimble emphasized, with a nod in Paisley's direction, that for
peace to take hold it was essential ``that all the people with
terrible pasts here do change.''
	   April's peace agreement struck around the same table by eight
parties specified that the Assembly's members should make decisions
with the support of majorities of both its Catholic and Protestant
members.
	   The most fundamental compromise in the months ahead will be
agreeing which parties should hold which posts in a 12-member
administration called the Executive, which Trimble and Mallon will
jointly lead. It is expected to take over six departments from the
British government next year, including education, economic
development and health.
	   It may take months of haggling to appoint most of the Executive,
chiefly because most Protestant politicians refuse to let Sinn Fein
hold any posts unless the Irish Republican Army starts to disarm.
	   The peace agreement specifies that the IRA and truce-observing
paramilitary groups on the Protestant side should disarm by
mid-2000, something they all refuse to do.
	   Mallon's selection over the SDLP's leader, John Hume, surprised
some observers. Hume, a prime architect of the peace process, is
already a member of the British and European parliaments, while
Mallon has spent the past three years directing the SDLP
negotiating team.
	   The Ulster Unionists' deputy leader, John Taylor, who was shot
17 times by an IRA gunman in 1972 but somehow survived, formally
nominated both his party leader and Mallon, of whom he said:
``Although we disagree strongly on our political objectives, I have
always found him to be a good friend.''
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and his 17 Assembly colleagues
abstained from casting ballots for or against Trimble and Mallon.
	   ``We wouldn't have been doing Mr. Trimble any favors if we had
voted for him,'' Adams said in an interview. ``In fact, we would
have been giving his opponents a stick to beat him with.''
	   Under the Assembly's double-majority rules, the votes of Sinn
Fein aren't essential to pass decisions because the moderate SDLP
holds 24 seats in the two-party Catholic bloc.
	   The Sinn Fein benches included Adams and Martin McGuinness, whom
the history books credit as architects of the modern IRA; Gerry
Kelly, convicted of bombing London's Old Bailey courthouse in 1973;
and John Kelly, who helped arm the IRA at the start of its campaign
to abolish Northern Ireland in 1970.

Study confirms safety of morning-after birth control pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Women can safely use at-home emergency supplies of
morning-after pills to prevent pregnancy, a British study
concludes.
	   The research, conducted in England, gave women packets of the
hormone pills to use in case they wanted to protect themselves from
pregnancy after having sex without birth control.
	   The study found these women used the pills correctly and had no
ill effects when compared with another group who had to see their
doctors for the pills.
	   Although pills prepared specifically for morning-after use are
available by prescription in England and some other countries, they
are essentially the same as ordinary birth control pills.
	   The pills prevent fertilized eggs from becoming implanted in the
uterus. Abortion opponents are against this use of birth control
pills.
	   Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said six brands
of birth control pills are safe and effective as morning-after
pills. That allows makers to package the pills for use in case of
an emergency, but none have done so yet.
	   The latest study, directed by Dr. Anna Glasier of the University
of Edinburgh, was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
	   The women were instructed to take two tablets within 72 hours of
intercourse and two more 12 hours later.
	   The study was too small to show whether having the pills on hand
actually leads to fewer unwanted pregnancies. There were 18
unintended pregnancies among 553 women who had the pills at home
and 25 among the 530 in the comparison group who did not. The
difference could have occurred by chance.
	   An editorial by Dr. Phillip Stubblefield of Boston University
Medical Center recommended making these pills available without
prescription. Until then, he said, doctors should prescribe women
birth control pills to keep at home for this use.

Study: Exercise a necessary part of a cholesterol-lowering diet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2100 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ People with high cholesterol need to exercise to
get the full benefits of a healthy diet, a study concludes.
	   The study looked at men and women who had moderately high LDL
cholesterol and low HDL. LDL increases the risk of heart attacks,
while HDL lowers it.
	   The 377 volunteers were already following healthy diets when
they were placed on the National Cholesterol Education Program's
Step 2 diet, the stricter of its recommended low-fat diets. Some
were also assigned to an aerobics program.
	   After one year, they managed to cut their dietary fat intake by
about 8 percent. But without exercise, there was little change in
their LDL levels. However, when exercise was added, the women's LDL
fell by 15 percent and the men's by 20 percent.
	   ``These findings demonstrate the importance of an exercise
program when diet alone has not adequately reduced LDL cholesterol
levels,'' the researchers wrote.
	   The program had no significant effect on their HDL levels nor on
their ratios of total to HDL cholesterol, which many experts
believe is an important measure of heart disease risk.
	   The study was conducted by Dr. Marcia L. Stefanick of Stanford
University. It was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.

Employee of self-proclaimed government of Kosovo shot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An employee of the self-proclaimed government of
Kosovo was shot and wounded by armed gunmen who burst into the
organization's Geneva office Wednesday, its officials and city
police said.
	   The man was shot in the stomach as he tried to prevent the two
masked men from entering the office located in the city's Rive
district, said a statement from the ``Republic of Kosovo''
organization, which is run by independence-seeking Kosovo Albanian
activists.
	   City police said in a statement that they had been informed, but
had no further details about the attackers or their motives, the
statement said.
	   The victim, originally from Kosovo, was taken by ambulance to
the hospital, police said. His life isn't in danger, the statement
said.
	   The Geneva office is an information center for the
self-proclaimed government, which is campaigning for independence
from Yugoslavia.
	   The statement released by center officials claimed Serb
authorities and armed forces were targeting Kosovo Albanians abroad
as part of an ``ethnic purification operation'' being carried out
in the province.

World Cup: Underdog role is familiar but just fine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULON, France (AP) _ They were underdogs against Nigeria.
They'll be the underdogs again in the quarterfinals and that's just
fine with little Denmark.
	   ``Nobody expected us to beat Nigeria and all people expect
Brazil, the top favorite in the world, to win easily against us,''
said forward Brian Laudrup before Wednesday's practice in this
Mediterranean port city.
	   ``Nobody expects Denmark to do anything. We like to be in that
role. If we were to lose, people would say the we have done
magnificently. If we win, it would even be a bigger sensation.''
	   The underdog role is familiar for Denmark. Six years ago, the
Danes failed to qualify for the European Championship finals in
Sweden. But they were called up 10 days before the start as
replacement for Yugoslavia, which had been expelled by
international sanctions.
	   Badly prepared, the Danish underdogs surprised France and
England to join unbeaten Sweden from one of the two groups into the
semis. Denmark then beat the Netherlands on penalties in the final
four before upsetting Germany 2-0 in the final.
	   So Laudrup doesn't mind playing Brazil in Friday's quarterfinals
in Nantes.
	   ``Of all the teams that are left in the competition I prefer
Brazil,'' he said. ``Definitely. I think it's going to be a
cracking and very interesting game.''
	   While his older brother Michael played Brazil once _ he scored
two goals in a 4-0 win in the 1989 Danish soccer's Centennial
tournament in Copenhagen _ the younger Laudrup has never faced the
South Americans.
	   ``We couldn't dream of this and get to the quarterfinals against
Brazil,'' said Brian Laudrup, who scored one goal as Denmark beat
Nigeria 4-1 Sunday and reached the quarterfinal for the first time.
	   ``They're so strong offensively and defensively as well, but
obviously every football fan loves Brazil because they've got so
many attacking players. They've got so many players to choose from.
If you look at the bench, they've got Denilson, Edmundo etc. not
playing. That's what makes Brazil something special.''
	   Michael Laudrup, 34, the only player left from the 1986 World
Cup team in Mexico that beat Scotland, Uruguay and eventual
finalist Germany before crashing out 5-1 to Spain, feels no
pressure at all going into the quarters.
	   ``From outside there is no pressure at all,'' said the Ajax
forward, whose brilliant passes set up two goals against Nigeria.
''I think the only thing people want from us in Denmark is that we
at least try to play as good as we did the other day. We have the
same opinion.''
	   The Danes were criticized for their first-round performances,
scraping past past Saudi Arabia, only drawing South Africa and
rounding off their group with a loss to France.
	   ``We didn't play fantastic football,'' said Laudrup, who's
retiring after the World Cup. ``I agree totally with that. But I
could mention some bigger countries who certainly didn't play much
better than we did.
	   ``Some of them are still here. So it's a little unfair to talk
about us and in the same moment about other teams like, Germany or
Italy, because you're talking about two different worlds.''
	   Denmark and Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel,
who'll play a record 105th international for Denmark on Friday,
believes a ``pretty lucky build-up'' has been the key to Denmark's
success in France.
	   ``I won't say our group was easy, but we qualified with four
points,'' he said. ``It didn't take the best of playing for us to
qualify. Once you're into the cup competition you have to to play
up to your best and we were able to do that. That's been a key
factor.''
	   Denmark's squad leaves for Nantes on Thursday with no players on
the injury list.
	   ``There are some minor problems, but it's nothing to worry
about,'' said Bo Johansson, Denmark's Swedish coach. ``I expect all
players to be fit and play against Brazil.''

Scientists find fossil remains of `Creature From the Black Lagoon'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fossil-hunters have found remains of the
Creature From the Black Lagoon.
	   Not the fish-human hybrid from the 1954 horror flick. No, this
one was a lot smaller and looked like a salamander with a big head
and feet when it lived by a lake near what is now Edinburgh,
Scotland, some 333 million years ago.
	   In Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, Jennifer Clack of
Cambridge University in England revealed the creature and her name
for it: ``Eucritta melanolimnetes.'' Loosely translated from the
Greek and a bit of American slang, that's ``creature from the black
lagoon.'' (``Eucritta'' combines ``eu,'' which is an ancient Greek
word for ``truth'' or ``goodness,'' and the all-American
``critter.'')
	   The find includes a nearly complete skeleton measuring about 8
inches (20 centimeters) from nose to pelvis; it's missing the tail.
Clack said the creature apparently grew longer, judging by another
recovered skull, but she doesn't know how long.
	   The finding sheds light on the evolution of tetrapods, backboned
animals that have four limbs with fingers and toes or are descended
from such creatures.
	   Two groups of tetrapods are alive today. One includes mammals,
turtles, birds and lizards. The other includes frogs and
salamanders.
	   The newfound creature combines traits from both living groups,
indicating it lived around the time the two groups split in
evolutionary history, Clack said. Scientists have disagreed on when
that split happened. The new finding suggests it occurred maybe 340
million years ago, which falls between the dates suggested before,
she said.
	   As for what her fellow scientists think of the name, Clack said:
``Some of them really like it. Some of them are a bit sniffy.''

Russian coal miners resume railway blockade

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 4 grafs with government saying it has paid back
wages. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners demanding payment of back wages have
launched a new protest and were camping out along the
Trans-Siberian Railway, news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   Miners gathered near railroads and highways in three towns in
the Kemerovo region in central Siberia, the news agencies said. The
region's governor, Aman Tuleyev, met with miners on Tuesday and
expressed sympathy with their complaints, but opposed blocking the
rails, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Miners say the federal government has paid only two-thirds of a
1 billion ruble (dlrs 160 million) sum that was promised after they
blocked rails for two weeks in May, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   But Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the government has
paid all the back wages it owes, which he put at 200 million rubles
(dlrs 32.8 million). He said coal companies owe miners 8.6 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion).
	   The miners are demanding that authorities pay wage arrears,
create more mining jobs, and dismiss a criminal case under review
against the organizers of the May rail blockade. They also
continued to call for the government's resignation.
	   The protest will last for two days, miners said. Union leaders
will meet on Friday to plan their next move, and miners across
Kemerovo may block the rails again, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the government owed
miners throughout Russia 3.7 billion rubles (dlrs 600 million).
	   But he also said that coal consumers must take some blame for
the wage crisis. They owe mines 8.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.4
billion) for coal, he said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Meanwhile, about 200 striking miners from four Russian mining
regions, including Kemerovo, were still camped at the government
building in Moscow known as the White House, promising to stay
until President Boris Yeltsin is impeached or resigns. They have
been there for three weeks.
	   However, coal miners near the city of Orenburg, 1,400 kilometers
(860 miles) east of Moscow, lifted a rail and road blockade in the
region on Wednesday, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Regional administrators agreed to pay wage arrears totaling 7.5
million rubles (dlrs 1.2 million) by Aug. 1.
	   Thousands of Russian coal miners staged scattered strikes in
May, complaining that they hadn't been paid for months. The
protests disrupted rail traffic, but the miners agreed to return to
their jobs after being promised they would receive some of their
overdue wages.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An employee of the self-proclaimed ``government''
of Kosovo was shot and wounded by gunmen who burst into the
organization's Geneva office Wednesday, its officials and city
police said.
	   The man was shot in the stomach as he tried to prevent the two
masked men entering the office located in the city's Rive district,
said a statement from the ``Republic of Kosovo'' organization,
which is run by independence-seeking Kosovo Albanian activists.
	   City police said in a statement that they had been informed
about the incident after it took place. They had no further details
about the attackers or their motives, the statement said.
	   The victim, aged 31 and from Kosovo, was taken by ambulance to
the cantonal (state) hospital, police said. His life isn't in
danger, the statement said.
	   The Geneva office is an information center of the
self-proclaimed government, which is campaigning for independence
from the Serb-ruled Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Xafar Shatri, the government's ``minister of information,'' is
based at the center.
	   The statement released by center officials claimed Serb
authorities and armed forces were targeting Kosovo Albanians abroad
as part of an ``ethnic purification operation'' being carried out
in the province.

U.N. panel okays dlrs 187 million for construction companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. panel assessing compensation for loss and
damage caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Wednesday awarded
four construction companies a total of some dlrs 187 million.
	   The panel of the U.N. Compensation Commission decided that
claims for debts dating back to contracts completed before May 2,
1990, three months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, did not
fall under its jurisdiction, said commission Secretary Mojtaba
Kazazi.
	   The award fell far short of the claims for a total of nearly
dlrs 2 billion lodged by the companies _ Continental Construction
Ltd. of India, Gulf Cable and Electrical Company of Kuwait, Hyundai
Construction of South Korea and Technopromexport of Russia.
	   Hyundai Construction, which had claimed more than dlrs 1
billion, was awarded dlrs 34 million.
	   Also Wednesday, the commission approved some dlrs 740 million in
compensation for the latest group of individual claimants to be
considered. The money will go to some 64,000 claimants.
	   The 15-nation commission has approved more than dlrs 6 billion
in compensation, to be paid using Iraqi oil sales approved by the
U.N. Security Council.
	   Priority has until now been given to individuals who suffered
personal losses and who have filed for less than dlrs 100,000 in
damages.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from
individuals, governments and corporations.
	   Processing the claims is expected to take several more years.
	   The panel's latest three-day session, which ended Wednesday, was
under the chairmanship of Portuguese ambassador Goncalo de Santa
Clara Gomes. It meets again in September.

 &UR; With BC-Kosovo-Determined Rebels

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders in
Pristina edged closer to working with Kosovo fighters on Wednesday
but failed to agree on how to enlist them in a unified struggle for
independence.
	   Amid a lull in fighting, members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian
political parties met in Pristina to discuss drawing the Kosovo
Liberation Army into their political fight against Serbia. But they
adjourned to Sunday after failing to agree on how to meld the
guerrillas struggle with their non-violent independence campaign.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   The KLA is rapidly gaining popularity at the expense of
politicians espousing a peaceful independence struggle.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population, also participated in the meeting but refused comment
afterward.
	   Wednesday's meeting by the politicians was recognition that _
with support for them growing inside and outside Kosovo _ the
guerrillas cannot be ignored.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the political groups would become
the KLA's political wing.
	   American diplomats have held several meetings with leaders of
the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and there will be
more shortly, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday in Washington.
	   In Belgrade, Zivorad Igic, an aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, blasted the U.S. contacts with the guerrillas
as American ``legalization of terrorism.''
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured a strategic coal mine region from the
Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday. Reporters at Belacevac and Hade,
the two towns just a few hundred meters (yards) from the coal mine
saw the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no signs of fighting or
a heightened state of alert.
	   But the Albanian side denied that fighters in the Kosovo
Liberation Army were forced to pull back.
	   ``The open-pit mine is still controlled by the KLA,'' said the
Kosovo Information Center, which is closed to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership. ``Claims from Serb sources are not correct
that Serb forces have established control over this mine.''
	   It listed casualties in the Belacevac region over the last two
days of fighting as three dead and two wounded fighters, and a
child and an adult dead and six other civilians wounded. But
sources in Belacevac said the KLA death toll was higher.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo.
	   Albanian sources also claimed that the rebels have completely
surrounded Klina, a government-controlled town in the central
Drenica region, cutting off access to Pec to the southwest. That
report also could not be confirmed.
	   In violence Wednesday, KLA guerrillas attacked the Serb village
of Drsnik, killing a 26-year-old villager, the Yugoslavia's Tanjug
state news agency said. The shooting lasted for several hours
before the KLA withdrew, the agency said.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and small
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said in Oslo, Norway on Wednesday that
international observers could start symbolic patrols of the
Serbian-ruled province as early as this week.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serbian rule.

Stewart not happy to come second
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ England cricket captain Alec Stewart
says his team can't be content with second best.
	   The team interrupted preparations for the third test against
South Africa starting Thursday at Old Trafford to watch England
play Argentina in the World Cup on Tuesday.
	   Stewart said his team, still reeling from a humiliating loss to
South Africa in the second test at Lord's, could draw inspiration
from the pride shown by England's soccer team in defeat.
	   But finishing second could not be an option for his cricketers.
	   ``We seem to be very good at praising people for coming
second,'' he said Wednesday. ``We saw how the country reacted when
we beat Australia at the start of last summer's Test series.
	   ``If we do well people will get behind us. The soccer World Cup
defeat certainly gives us an opportunity to brighten things up.''
	   England is desperate to regain some face in the third test and
could resort to using a two-pronged spin attack at Old Trafford to
add some potency to its bowling.
	   Stewart will assess the pitch Thursday before deciding on his
starting 11 but indications Wednesday were that left-arm spinner
Ashley Giles would make his test debut.
	   The return of stike bowler Darren Gough should also bolster
England's bowling attack, giving Stewart another pace alternative
to Dominic Cork and Angus Fraser.
	   South Africa will name its side Thursday. The only player in
doubt is opening batsman Adam Bacher, who is still troubled by a
shoulder injury he sustained in the second test at Lord's.

Oil company promises to pay taxes after losing access to pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government giving four other companies deadline
to pay taxes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government threatened Wednesday to
limit tax-dodging oil companies access to export pipelines, but
some of the companies denied they owed any money.
	   It also gave four other companies until Aug. 1 to pay their
taxes _ the Vostsibugol coal company, Severonikel nickel smelter,
Chepetsk Mechanical Works and Rosenergoatom nuclear energy company.
	   The oil companies said the government will only hurt itself if
it tries to use force to collect taxes.
	   Russia's chronic tax collection problem is partly to blame for
the country's current financial crisis, and oil companies are the
biggest debtors.
	   Boosting tax collection is a key condition for obtaining a new
International Monetary Fund loan. About 40 percent of Russia's tax
revenues come from the oil and gas industries.
	   ``If somebody gets cut off from exports, the government denies
itself a stable source of income, and the question of tax
collections will become irrelevant because there won't be anywhere
to collect them from,'' said Denis Davydov, spokesman for AO
Sidanko, one of the targeted companies.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the government had already denied
access to the export pipeline to Sidanko and four other companies,
the Tyumen Oil Co., Bashneft, Tatneft and ONACO.
	   It quoted Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko as saying
Tyumen had agreed to pay its bill within two days.
	   Davydov said Sidanko's debts have been run up by one of its
subsidiaries, Siberian-based AO Varyoganeft, and that government
agencies owe an equal amount to Sidanko for fuel oil and petrol
deliveries.
	   The Interfax news agency said that if the coal, nickel,
mechanical and nuclear energy companies do not pay their taxes by
Aug. 1, the government will seize their property.
	   It said Vostsibugol owes 400 million rubles (dlrs 65 million),
Chepetsk 175 million rubles (dlrs 28.6 million) and Rosenergoatom
329 million rubles (dlrs 53.9 million).

Government slaps dlrs 2.5 million fine on German Pharmaceutical
</HEADLINE>
Company &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Embroiled in a phony birth control pill
scandal, the Brazilian subsidiary of German pharmaceutical giant
Schering AG was slapped with a 2.9 million real (dlrs 2.5 million)
fine, the Justice Ministry said Wednesday.
	   At least 10 women in the state of Sao Paulo have said they
became pregnant after taking the fake Microvlar contraceptives
manufactured by Schering, which said they were intended solely to
test out new packaging equipment.
	   The placebo pills, made of lactose and sugar, were supposed to
have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen and sold
illegally.
	   After visiting the company's Sao Paulo installations, police
chief Sergio Abdalla said he was convinced the phony contraceptives
were stolen while they were being transported to the incinerator.
	   The president of Schering's Brazilian subsidiary, Rainer Bitzer
told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that 650,000 packages,
containing 21 pills each were used to test the new packaging
equipment.
	   It is still unclear exactly how many packages were stolen and
distributed.
	   An anonymous letter sent together with a package of the fake
pills notified Schering in May that it had a problem, but the
company took almost a month to notify health authorities.
	   Blitzer explained the delay, saying the company first conducted
its own investigation and found no placebos on the market.
	   ``Only after the first pregnant woman called to complain did we
realize the problem was bigger than we had imagined,'' Blitzer
said. ``We made a mistake in not notifying authorities
immediately.''
	   Asked if Schering will compensate the women who got pregnant
after taking the phony contraceptives, Blitzer said ``we will
contact each one of them and study the situation case-by-case. We
will assume our responsibility.''
	   While Blitzer said the packages of fake pills were easily
identifiable because they had no production or expiration date
stamped on them, the government feels that was not enough to
protect the consumer.
	   ``There was no reason for the consumer to reject a product with
no clear warning stamped on its packaging,'' reads a report
prepared by Nelson Faria Lins D'Albuquerque Junior, head of the
Justice Ministry's Consumer Protection Department.
	   Besides the fine, which Schering must pay within 30 days, the
company will be investigated to see if it is guilty of violating
consumer protection laws.
	   ``My life is hanging by a thread,'' Roseni dos Santos Nunes, one
of the women who took the placebo and got pregnant told the Folha
de Sao Paulo.
	   The mother of three, who has a heart disorder, said the doctor
had warned her that another pregnancy could endanger her life.
	   ``In February he (the doctor) prescribed Microvlar, and now I
don't know what I'm going to do,'' Nunes said.
	   Depending on the outcome of the investigation, expected to be
completed within a month, Schering could have its license to
produce Microvlar suspended and may even be shut down.
	   Schering was not immediately available to comment on the fine or
the investigation.

FA headquarters ablaze as English team heads home from World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fire broke out at the headquarters of the English
Football Association on Wednesday as the England team flew back
from France after bowing out of the World Cup.
	   The fire started on the first floor of the FA's offices in
Lancaster Gate, central London, Wednesday afternoon as the national
team was returning to Heathrow after its loss to Argentina on
Tuesday.
	   About 50 people were evacuated from the five-storey building as
six fire trucks and an ambulance raced to the scene.
	   Initial fears for the safety of England's most prized trophies,
including a replica of the 1966 World Cup, were erased when
officials revealed the trophies were protected in a basement vault.
	   FA press officer Mark Sudbury said fire alarms went off about
1200 GMT.
	   ``It appears to have happened where some workmen were carrying
out refurbishments on the first floor,'' he said.
	   Smoke was still billowing out of the building five hours later
but the London Fire Brigade reported the fire had been contained on
the first floor.
	   An investigation was underway into the cause of the fire.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ David Beckham, ejected for kicking an opponent in
England's penalty shootout loss to Argentina, was banned for two
games Wednesday by FIFA.
	   The suspension means Beckham will miss England's next two
competitive matches _ the first two qualifying games for the 2000
European Championships.
	   The 23-year-old England midfielder was sent off for violent
conduct for kicking Diego Simeone in retaliation at the start of
the second half of Tuesday night's game. FIFA also fined him 5,000
Swiss francs (dlrs 3,300), the minimum amount the rules allow for a
red card foul.

Greek, Turkish Cypriots pledge to work together after Oslo meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Turkish and Greek Cypriots ended a meeting in
Oslo Wednesday with a pledge to seek closer ties across their
divided island even if their governments remain deadlocked in the
24-year conflict.

<TEXT>
	   Businessmen from both sides of divided Cyprus, as well as from
Greece and Turkey, met under the guidance of U.S. peace envoy
Richard Holbrooke in an effort to build trust.
	   ```What I want to stress is that the most important thing about
this day and a half in Oslo is that people from all sides came
here,'' said Holbrooke at a news conference that followed the
closed meeting.
	   ``They don't speak for their governments,'' he said. Holbrooke
said these were influential private people who believe that such
personal contact reduces misunderstanding and increases mutual
trust.
	   Tensions over Cyprus have increased in recent weeks as both
Greece and Turkey, both NATO-members, briefly sent warplanes to the
island as shows of strength.
	   Cyprus was divided after Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974. Greek and Turkish Cypriots
now live separated by a U.N.-patrolled line running across the
island. International efforts to reunite the island, now led by
Holbrooke, have remained deadlocked.
	   The roughly 50 Cypriots, Greeks and Turks gathered for the
meeting, issued a joint statement, which Holbrooke said in itself
was an accomplishment considering the deep divisions between the
groups.
	   ``It's not a very controversial statement,'' said Holbrooke.
``But the delegates wanted to issue a statement, and managed to
hammer one out.''
	   In the 26-line statement, delegates agreed to work together on
joint projects for historic restorations, telecommunications,
economic ventures, culture and sports. They urged their governments
to permit and support such projects.
	   ``We believe that contacts and projects of the sort outlined
above ... can progress independently (of a political settlement)
and are of the utmost importance in reducing tensions and
increasing mutual understanding,'' the statement said.
	   The delegates agreed to meet again in Istanbul, Turkey in
November. Organizers said possible Turkish objections to Greek
Cypriots visiting the country might have to be overcome.
	   The meeting called by the Peace Research Institute in Oslo and
Columbia University of New York.

U.N. panel okays dlrs 187 million for construction companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. panel assessing compensation for loss and
damage caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Wednesday awarded
four construction companies a total of some dlrs 187 million.
	   The panel of the U.N. Compensation Commission decided that
claims for debts dating back to contracts completed before May 2,
1990, three months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, did not
fall under its jurisdiction, said commission Secretary Mojtaba
Kazazi.
	   The award fell far short of the nearly dlrs 2 billion in claims
lodged by the companies _ Continental Construction Ltd. of India,
Gulf Cable and Electrical Company of Kuwait, Hyundai Construction
of South Korea and Technopromexport of Russia.
	   Hyundai Construction, which had claimed more than dlrs 1
billion, was awarded dlrs 34 million.
	   Also Wednesday, the commission approved some dlrs 740 million in
compensation for the latest group of individual claimants to be
considered. The money will go to some 64,000 claimants.
	   The 15-nation commission has approved more than dlrs 6 billion
in compensation, to be paid using Iraqi oil sales approved by the
U.N. Security Council.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from
individuals, governments and corporations.
	   Processing the claims is expected to take several more years.

Thousands march in an anti-government protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Nearly 25,000 opposition activists
marched through central Dhaka Wednesday to demand that Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina step down and order midterm elections.
	   ``This government has failed. We want fresh elections as early
as possible,'' Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's main opposition leader,
told the protesters from her Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
	   She called for a nationwide general strike on July 16 to press
her party's demand.
	   Hasina was elected Prime Minister for a five-year term in 1996
and the next general elections are not due until 2001.
	   ``The opposition must wait until our five-year term expires,''
Hasina said in recent public remarks.
	   The opposition has accused Hasina's government of incompetence
in dealing with law and order, power and drinking water supply.
	   Mrs. Zia, who preceded Hasina as the prime minister, referred to
the country's power shortage in support of her criticism of the
government.
	   In Bangladesh, the daily power deficit runs at more than 500
mega watts.
	   Watched by riot police, the demonstrators snaked through the
main streets creating traffic jams in parts of the city. ``Down
with the government, Hasina must go,'' they chanted.

Moldovan president says Trans-Dniester can have autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moldova is prepared to give the separatist region
of Trans-Dniester a high degree of autonomy, but not independence,
Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi said Wednesday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Lucinschi made the remarks during a conference in the Moldovan
capital, Kishinev, sponsored by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. The organization is one of several trying to
broker a settlement to the country's conflict with ethnic Russian
separatists in Trans-Dniester.
	   The region, mostly Russian-speaking, wants independence out of
fear that Moldova, a former Soviet republic, would unite with
Romania, with which it shares a language and a border.
	   A 1992 war killed 700 people in Trans-Dniester before Russian
forces intervened, but efforts to reach a settlement have failed.
	   Representatives of the separatists declined to attend the
conference, Interfax said.
	   Lucinschi said he is prepared to offer Trans-Dniester a high
degree of autonomy as part of a larger plan to decentralize
Moldova's government and give more power to provinces.

Netanyahu, Weizman say they'll stop fighting in public
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, INCORPORATES Palestinian-Jerusalem
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The president said the prime minister was cut
off from reality. The prime minister accused the president of
siding with the Arabs.
	   On Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held a strained meeting and announced that ``for the good
of the country,'' they would do their quarreling in private from
now on.
	   There was no sign, however, that the two leaders actually
resolved any differences in the 70-minute meeting at Weizman's
house. They declined to appear in public afterward, issuing a brief
statement saying they had explained their positions to each other
and that ``For the good of the country, it is necessary that every
issue be examined and discussed privately and not in public.''
	   The high-profile confrontation began earlier this week when
Weizman blamed Netanyahu for the deadlock in the peace talks with
the Palestinians and said the prime minister should call early
elections.
	   Netanyahu shot back, saying ``The president, to my sorrow, took
a stand with the left to actually get rid of the current elected
government.''
	   ``Bibi lives in a state of euphoria, in his own world. Cut off
from reality,'' Weizman was quoted as saying Tuesday in the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, accused Weizman of ``a gross intervention
into politics'' and siding with the Arabs and Israel's dovish
opposition.
	   The president's role is largely ceremonial, and Weizman's
comments _ unusually harsh even for the famously outspoken former
fighter pilot _ set off a furious debate in the Israeli press over
whether he had gone too far.
	   Some analysts suggested that Weizman's call for early elections
may have provided the impetus for the centrist Third Way Party to
bolt the government and topple Netanyahu if the prime minister does
not agree soon to withdraw Israeli troops in the West Bank.
	   In a leaked transcript of Wednesday's meeting aired on Israel's
Channel Two television, Weizman accused Netanyahu of using him when
he sent him to reassure Arab leaders that the government was
serious about peacemaking. ``You have made me look like a liar,''
he said.
	   The United States is waiting for a long-overdue Israeli answer
on a U.S. proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan, first
introduced in January, but Netanyahu has said he does not have
sufficient assurances from the Palestinians that they will carry
out promises to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   Speaking in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Wednesday,
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat warned that his
patience is running out and that Israel's new plan for tightening
its hold over disputed Jerusalem could dash the last hopes for
Mideast peace.
	   The Palestinians will use all means to defend the city, Arafat
told the Palestinian legislature. ``The battle for Jerusalem is a
battle of life and death for the Palestinian people,'' he said.
	   The Israeli plan, introduced last month, would expand the city's
boundaries westward, into Israel proper, to increase Jerusalem's
Jewish population and economic base. It would also extend
Jerusalem's municipal authority to nearby Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   On Tuesday, the Israeli army caused a furor in parliament when
it presented a map of Israel's security interests in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip that left out 59 of 159 Jewish settlements.
Opposition legislators said the map undermined Netanyahu's argument
that Israel cannot safely hand 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Embroiled in a phony birth control pill
scandal, the Brazilian subsidiary of German pharmaceutical giant
Schering AG was slapped with a 2.9 million real (dlrs 2.5 million)
fine, the Justice Ministry said Wednesday.
	   At least 10 women in the state of Sao Paulo have said they
became pregnant after taking the fake Microvlar contraceptives
manufactured by Schering, which said they were intended solely to
test out new packaging equipment.
	   The placebo pills, made of lactose and sugar, were supposed to
have been incinerated after the tests, but were stolen and sold
illegally.
	   After visiting the company's Sao Paulo installations, police
chief Sergio Abdalla said he was convinced the phony contraceptives
were stolen while they were being transported to the incinerator.
	   The president of Schering's Brazilian subsidiary, Rainer Bitzer
told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that 650,000 packages,
containing 21 pills each were used to test the new packaging
equipment.
	   It is still unclear exactly how many packages were stolen and
distributed.
	   An anonymous letter sent together with a package of the fake
pills notified Schering in May that it had a problem, but the
company took almost a month to notify health authorities.
	   Bitzer explained the delay, saying the company first conducted
its own investigation and found no placebos on the market.
	   ``Only after the first pregnant woman called to complain did we
realize the problem was bigger than we had imagined,'' Bitzer said.
``We made a mistake in not notifying authorities immediately.''
	   Asked if Schering will compensate the women who got pregnant
after taking the phony contraceptives, Bitzer said ``we will
contact each one of them and study the situation case-by-case. We
will assume our responsibility.''
	   While Bitzer said the packages of fake pills were easily
identifiable because they had no production or expiration date
stamped on them, the government feels that was not enough to
protect the consumer.

 &UR; Eds: AMS; updates with team returning, Beckham statement; ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham used to be one of the most envied
men in England: an 8 million pound-a-year (dlrs 13 million) soccer
star engaged to a Spice Girl, a key man in a team hitting its
stride in the World Cup finals.
	   Late Tuesday night, he became the national goat, the
hot-tempered kid who killed England's hopes of beating Argentina by
getting ousted for kicking an opponent right in front of the
referee.
	   ``10 Heroic Lions One Stupid Boy,'' said the tabloid Mirror
newspaper.
	   ``Outcha,'' said The Daily Star, playing on the notorious Sun
headline ``Gotcha'' when Britain sank an Argentine warship when the
countries went to war for real over the Falkland Islands colony in
1982.
	   As if to underline the nationwide gloom, the London offices of
the Football Association _ where England coach Glenn Hoddle has an
office _ caught fire Wednesday afternoon.
	   Beckham's abrupt exit forced England to play the second half
with one less man than Argentina, to abandon the attacking flair
that produced a 2-2 halftime score and eventually to lose in a
heart-stopping penalty shoot-out.
	   The match was a national occasion, watched by 23.7 million of
Britain's 58 million people. Electric power companies said the
demand surge at halftime _ presumably from fans switching on tea
kettles _ was the biggest since the shooting of J.R. Ewing on the
TV show ``Dallas'' in 1985.
	   Police reported 45 arrests, mainly in southern England towns, as
shocked fans poured out of pubs.
	   In Poole, on the south England coast, a 29-year-old man smashed
the TV set in his pub, The Tatnum, after England missed the final
penalty shot.
	   And even Prince Charles weighed in, albeit with royal restraint.
``It was very sad, wasn't it?'' he told disappointed fan Nazmul
Shidkar, 11, during a visit to a housing project in London.
	   But there was pride in the team's courageous and skillful
performance in a spellbinding match, and British Airways dispatched
a supersonic Concorde to France to bring the fallen heroes home.
	   About 400 airport workers cheered as the team left the plane,
though apprentice engineer Paul Dempsey brought along a cardboard
cutout of ``Posh Spice'' Victoria Adams, Beckham's girlfriend, in a
sarcastic welcome home gesture ``after his cracking performance
last night.''
	   Hope bloomed amid the hangovers, especially because of the
brilliant play of 18-year-old Michael Owen, who scored one of
England's two goals.
	   But most of the talk _ and all the venom _ was directed at the
23-year-old Beckham.
	   ``This is without doubt the worst moment of my career,'' he said
in a statement issued Wednesday, adding that he was ``deeply
sorry.''
	   Forgiveness will come slowly.
	   ``Beckham should never play for England again,'' said fan Ian
Hawkins, who returned from France by train on Wednesday.
	   And some 3,000 people dialed a phone-in poll at Talk Radio in
London to say the same thing, though about 2,000 other callers
thought mercy might be shown.
	   Journalists surrounded the home of Beckham's parents, who
emerged in early afternoon to accept their ritual humiliation.
	   ``He hasn't let us down. We are very proud of him,'' said his
mum, Sandra. Ted Beckham affirmed that he was proud of his boy, who
``was so choked last night he couldn't speak.''
	   Alan Mullery, a former captain of England's soccer team,
predicted that Beckham's life was permanently blighted. Like
Mullery's.
	   ``I was sent off one minute before the end of the match and I
still have to live with the guilt and the blame _ and that was 30
years ago,'' Mullery said on Talk Radio, recalling the European
Championships.
	   Defeat in the World Cup is customary but especially galling for
the English, who invented the game.
	   Still, life went on. The stock market was up Wednesday, and
Thomson, the big English travel agency, said inquiries increased 20
percent now that husbands could be pried away from television sets.
	   Simon Bentley, whose company runs the First Sport shops, said he
was ``too sad to even talk about the game.'' But he won't be stuck
with a lot of unsold England merchandise.
	   ``We did not take a big risk stocking up on England shirts,''
Bentley said, ``on the assumption that they might not make it
through the first round.''

Britain keeps entry ban on black leader Farrakhan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government plans to keep ban; changes throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Wednesday it plans to keep a 12-year
ban on Louis Farrakhan entering the country, but gave the militant
U.S. black leader a last chance to appeal despite his ``clearly
offensive'' views.
	   A government announcement said Home Secretary Jack Straw has
told Farrakhan that ``he is minded to maintain'' the ban.
	   ``Mr. Farrakhan now has the opportunity to make further
representations before the Home Secretary takes a final decision,''
the statement added.
	   Straw, in charge of immigration, had considered lifting the ban
after Farrakhan last month signed a pledge not to make attacks on
whites, Jews and homosexuals while in Britain. He also said he
recognized that under Britain's Race Relations Act it is an offense
to stir up racial antagonism.
	   However, Farrakhan's chance of an entry visa was apparently
dashed when 20 supporters of his Nation of Islam movement on Monday
disrupted an inquiry into the racially motivated murder of a black
teenager in London, Stephen Lawrence. They burst into the inquiry
room when five white suspects started testifying.
	   Lawrence's parents appealed to the militants not to disrupt the
inquiry.
	   The Home Office said Straw reached his decision after reviewing
the ban and ``recent events at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.''
	   Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said Farrakhan ``has clearly
offensive views.''
	   The Board of Deputies of British Jews also lobbied the
government to keep the ban, imposed when Farrakhan planned to visit
in 1986.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup took its first deep breath Wednesday.
It was much-needed, given the late-hour excitement of the night
before.
	   After 56 matches in 21 days of virtual non-stop soccer, this was
the first of back-to-back game-free days ahead of the quarterfinals
Friday and Saturday. The eight remaining teams practiced, rested
and otherwise looked ahead to some very enticing matchups.
	   And everyone, it seems, talked about Match No. 56 _ Argentina's
penalty shootout victory over England that ended near midnight
Tuesday.
	   ``I'm very proud of our performance,'' England coach Glenn
Hoddle said before his team curiously boarded the world's fastest
passenger plane, the Concorde, for the short hop home across the
English Channel. ``We didn't deserve to lose.''
	   Argentina won 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw that included a
three goals in the first 15 minutes, including an electrifying run
by 18-year-old Michael Owen.
	   But in a devastated England, where one pub owner broke his
television set in disgust after Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa
made the final shootout save, there was a need to designate a
national goat: David Beckham.
	   Beckham was widely derided on television, radio and in
newspapers for the retaliatory kick that earned him a red card at
the start of the second half. His ejection forced the English to
play with 10 men for 75 minutes, and Hoddle surely didn't make
Beckham feel any better when the coach said that England would have
won the game had it remained 11-on-11.
	   So, Beckham _ whose other claim to fame is his engagement to
singer Posh Spice _ did what he felt he had to do. He issued an
apology, albeit in the form of a fax sent by his agent.
	   ``This is without doubt the worst moment of my career,'' the
statement said. ``I will always regret my actions during last
night's game. I have apologized to the England players and
management and I want every England supporter to know how deeply
sorry I am.''
	   Piling on the misery for the 23-year-old midfielder, FIFA
announced Wednesday that Beckham would be banned for England's next
two competitive matches _ its first two qualifying games for the
2000 European Championships. FIFA also fined him 5,000 Swiss francs
(dlrs 3,300).
	   Beckham's folly caught the attention of Argentina's next
opponent, the Netherlands, whose coach said he would talk to his
players about coping with frustration in preparation for Sunday's
match in Marseille.
	   ``Frustration toleration is the name of the game,'' Guus Hiddink
said, specifically referring to Beckham's retaliation. ``We know
what (Argentina's) norms are, and that they are very good at
inciting irritation.''
	   The Dutch are susceptible to such tactics. Striker Patrick
Kluivert was sent off and suspended for two games after elbowing
Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' World Cup opener.
Kluivert said he was provoked when Staelens called him a rapist.
	   Hiddink urged FIFA and the match referee to be on the lookout
for such ploys.
	   ``I think in this match they will have to be very careful,'' he
said.
	   France has a worry ahead of its Friday match against Italy at
Saint-Denis. Preparing to face one of the toughest defenses at the
World Cup, it may have to do without top marksman Thierry Henry.
	   Henry, who has scored three goals in the tournament, is nursing
a sprained left ankle suffered in France's second-round victory
over Paraguay.
	   `ith all due respect to Croatia, it's really up to us,''
German captain Juergen Klinsmann said. ``And I am very
optimistic.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister beseeched parliament
Wednesday to approve the Kremlin's economic rescue plan, warning
that the economy has lost much of the little ground it gained and
is again on the skids.
	   But lawmakers in the opposition-dominated parliament made clear
they do not trust President Boris Yeltsin and would not
rubber-stamp his administration's proposals.
	   ``This government's course is bankrupt,'' said Communist Party
chief Gennady Zyuganov, head of parliament's largest faction. ``We
must either change it or the end is very close.''
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko laid out the economy's troubles
in stark terms. Gross domestic product has declined 0.2 percent in
the first five months of this year, he said, eroding the modest 0.8
percent gain the economy posted last year _ the first since the
Soviet collapse.
	   He urged lawmakers to swiftly pass 26 bills the administration
has compiled to trim spending, increase revenue and win a new loan
of at least dlrs 10 billion from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kiriyenko warned that the economy is sinking too rapidly to
indulge in ideological debates.
	   ``The suggested measures are not political ones,'' he said.
``They are necessary for every political party. It is clear what we
need to do.''
	   The lower house, the State Duma, set to work on several of the
proposals, giving preliminary approval to a measure to simplify tax
rates for small businesses.
	   But lawmakers from a range of factions said they have no
confidence in the administration and will pick and choose among the
bills, amending those to which they object.
	   ``We won't accept the majority of rigid measures the government
insists on,'' said ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of
parliament's third-largest faction.
	   Communists and the other hard-liners who dominate parliament
have consistently opposed spending cuts, arguing that the
government should spend more to help struggling individuals and
industries. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
meant that millions of Russians get their wages months late.
	   The government threatened Wednesday to cut oil companies' access
to export pipelines and set deadlines for a number of other fuel
and metal firms to pay their overdue taxes.
	   The parliament has a pattern of rhetorically opposing Yeltsin
but giving in to his pressures at the last minute. Many of the
measures have already been implemented by presidential decree.
	   All the same, lawmakers' negative comments were unlikely to calm
Russia's skittish stock market, which has lost half its value since
the beginning of the year and has been dropping fairly steadily for
the past two months.
	   On Wednesday the stock market closed about 4 percent lower and
the ruble dropped to 6.24 to the dollar, down from 6.23 on Tuesday,
despite heavy Central Bank intervention.
	   The government says it needs a new International Monetary Fund
loan of at least dlrs 10 billion to shore up the Central Bank's
reserves, strained by the effort of supporting the ruble. If the
currency is devalued, the Kremlin fears higher prices could cause
social and political unrest.
	   Duma deputies are scheduled to leave town on Friday to begin
their summer recess, but a special session to approve the rescue
plan is set to begin July 15.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders in
Pristina edged closer to working with Kosovo fighters on Wednesday
but failed to agree on how to enlist them in a unified struggle for
independence.
	   Amid a lull in fighting, members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian
political parties met in Pristina to discuss drawing the Kosovo
Liberation Army into their political fight against Serbia. But they
adjourned until Sunday after failing to agree on how to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their non-violent independence campaign.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   The KLA is rapidly gaining popularity at the expense of
politicians espousing a peaceful independence struggle.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population, also participated in the meeting but refused comment
afterward.
	   Wednesday's meeting by the politicians was recognition that _
with support for them growing inside and outside Kosovo _ the
guerrillas cannot be ignored.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the political groups would become
the KLA's political wing.
	   American diplomats have held several meetings with leaders of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, and there will be more shortly, a
senior U.S. official said Tuesday in Washington.
	   In Belgrade, Zivorad Igic, an aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, blasted the U.S. contacts with the guerrillas
as American ``legalization of terrorism.''
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic coal
mine from the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday. Reporters at
Belacevac and Hade, the two towns just a few hundred meters (yards)
from the coal mine saw the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no
signs of fighting or a heightened state of alert.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which is closed to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the KLA still controls
the open-pit mine. The mine is strategically important because it
supplies coal to the Obilic power plant, which provides electricity
to most of Kosovo.
	   The center listed casualties among fighters in the Belasevac
region over the last two days of fighting as three dead and two
wounded. Among civilians, a child and an adult were killed and six
others wounded.
	   Albanian sources also claimed that rebels have completely
surrounded Klina, a government-controlled town in the central
Drenica region, cutting off access to Pec to the southwest. That
report also could not be confirmed.
	   In violence Wednesday, KLA guerrillas attacked the Serb village
of Drsnik, killing a 26-year-old villager, the Yugoslavia's Tanjug
state news agency said. The shooting lasted for several hours
before the KLA withdrew, the agency said.
	   International officials fear the ethnic Albanians' fight for
independence from Yugoslavia, made up of dominant Serbia and small
Montenegro, could erupt into major bloodshed throughout the region.
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said in Oslo, Norway on Wednesday that
international observers could start symbolic patrols of the
Serbian-ruled province as early as this week.
	   Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in Kosovo
since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to try to
halt growing resistance to Serbian rule.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders in
Pristina edged closer to working with Kosovo fighters on Wednesday
but failed to agree on how to enlist them in a unified struggle for
independence.
	   Amid a lull in fighting, members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian
political parties met in Pristina to discuss drawing the Kosovo
Liberation Army into their political fight against Serbia. But they
adjourned to Sunday, deadlocked on how to meld the guerrilla
struggle with their non-violent independence campaign.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   The KLA is rapidly gaining popularity at the expense of
politicians espousing a peaceful independence struggle.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population, also participated in the meeting but refused comment
afterward.
	   Wednesday's meeting by the politicians was recognition that _
with support for them growing inside and outside Kosovo _ the
guerrillas cannot be ignored.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the political groups would become
the KLA's political wing.
	   American diplomats have held several meetings with leaders of
the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and there will be
more shortly, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday in Washington.
	   But in a clear sign that the United States continued to support
Rugova, State Department spokesman James Rubin described him as
``central and indispensable.''
	   Rubin, speaking in Washington, said Rugova speaks ``for the
interests of the Kosovar Albanian people.''
	   In Belgrade, Zivorad Igic, an aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, blasted the U.S. contacts with the guerrillas
as ``legalization of terrorism.''
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured a strategic coal mine region from the
Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday. Reporters at Belacevac and Hade,
the two towns just a few hundred meters (yards) from the coal mine
saw the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no signs of fighting or
a heightened state of alert.
	   But the Albanian side denied that fighters in the Kosovo
Liberation Army were forced to pull back.
	   ``The open-pit mine is still controlled by the KLA,'' said the
Kosovo Information Center, which is closed to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership. ``Claims from Serb sources are not correct
that Serb forces have established control over this mine.''
	   It listed casualties in the Belacevac region over the last two
days of fighting as three dead and two wounded fighters, and a
child and an adult dead and six other civilians wounded. But
sources in Belacevac said the KLA death toll was higher.
	   The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal to
the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for most
of Kosovo.
	   Albanian sources also claimed that the rebels have completely
surrounded Klina, a government-controlled town in the central
Drenica region, cutting off access to Pec to the southwest. That
report also could not be confirmed.
	   In violence Wednesday, KLA guerrillas attacked the Serb village
of Drsnik, killing a 26-year-old villager, the Yugoslavia's Tanjug
state news agency said. The shooting lasted for several hours
before the KLA withdrew, the agency said.
	   Military jets _ apparently from the Yugoslav air force _ flew
low over Pristina in roughly five-minute intervals for more than an
hour before the flights stopped.

AIDS treatment often fails because pills are too hard to take
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Stands for story slugged AIDS-Pill Burden on digest &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Imagine. You have a deadly infection and your life
depends entirely on how faithfully you swallow 15 to 20 pills every
day and night, no matter where you are or what else you are doing.
Forever.
	   With one, you must gulp a quart (liter) of water. Others require
you have a full stomach. For still others, you wait until your
stomach is empty.
	   All on a precise schedule every eight hours. Without fail. Miss
just a few, and you may sicken and die.
	   The AIDS ``cocktail'' of protease inhibitors was initially
hailed as a miraculous breakthrough that gave years of life to
people who'd previously had no hope. Now doctors refer to ``the
pill burden'' and say the near impossibility of sticking
unfailingly to the complicated medical regimen is emerging as the
single biggest problem in treating AIDS.
	   When doctors last gathered for an international AIDS meeting in
Vancouver in 1996, the news about AIDS drugs was good: They had a
treatment at last _ an incredibly powerful combination of pills
that could rescue AIDS patients from the brink of death.
	   The enthusiasm was well-placed. Deaths from the disease have
fallen by 50 percent in each of the two years since.
	   But at this week's 12th World AIDS Conference in Switzerland,
the euphoria has been deflated by another realization: Many are
failing therapy because their medicines are just too hard to take
without an occasional lapse.
	   ``How can you expect people to take all those pills, day after
day, for years?'' asked Dr. Bernard Hirschel of the Geneva Cantonal
University Hospital, the conference chairman. ``As a practicing
physician, I can tell you it's a serious problem.''
	   A study presented at the conference by Dr. Allyn Nakashima of
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed 1,274
patients in 12 states. Two-thirds said they ``always'' take their
medicines as prescribed. But this fell off over time. After two
years of treatment, just over half were still taking them as
ordered.
	   In another study of 248 patients in five U.S. cities, only 21
percent had not missed a dose.
	   ``Treatment adherence has been described _ aptly _ as the
Achilles heel'' of AIDS treatment, said Bill Whittaker of the group
People Living With AIDS in New South Wales, Australia.
	   Dr. Julio Montaner, who runs the AIDS treatment program in
British Columbia, Canada, put it even more strongly.
``Compliance,'' he said, ``is the most important threat to the
long-term efficacy of the treatments we now have.''
	   The consequences of missing pills are grave. Skipping even a few
doses allows the virus to mutate into forms that are resistant to
protease inhibitors, the key ingredient of the combinations.
	   When that happens, the medicines are worthless and can do
nothing to stop AIDS.
	   Montaner estimates that 30 percent to 50 percent of people who
initially respond to treatment are considered drug failures after a
year. Their virus levels rise slowly, and even though they still
feel well, doctors worry their virus will eventually resume its
inexorable destruction.
	   ``Over 90 percent of these cases are explained by adherence
issues,'' he said.
	   The easy emergence of resistant viruses may have consequences
for others, as well. Doctors fear the viruses will pass from person
to person, creating an outbreak of untreatable AIDS. A team from
University of California, San Francisco reported the first case of
this at the meeting Wednesday.
	   But the conference also brought reports of the successful
testing of two AIDS drugs that would reduce the total number of
pills people must take.
	   These medicines _ DuPont Pharmaceuticals' Sustiva and Glaxo
Wellcome's Ziagen _ would require a total of five or six pills
taken twice a day. Neither is approved yet for sale.
	   Drug companies are also working to make medicines less sensitive
to eating habits and to reduce the frequency of doses.
	   Most people miss their doses for the obvious reason, the CDC
survey found. They forget to take them. Other common excuses were
difficulty working them into daily schedules and unpleasant side
effects.
	   Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr of Harlem Hospital Center in New York City
told of a 36-year-old patient named Rochelle, a once homeless drug
addict.
	   ``She calls often, just to renew her determination to take these
many medications,'' El-Sadr said. ``As she says, `Battle fatigue
sets in.'''
	   Doctors say educating patients about their pill-taking schedule
is now an important part of their jobs.
	   Some urge patients to practice with jelly beans for a few days
before starting the pills. Some patients have computerized pill
bottles that beep when it's time for a new dose. Others use the
buddy system: Friends call and remind each other.
	   Because the regimen is so difficult, doctors are often reluctant
to prescribe the drugs to people who seem poor risks, such as drug
addicts and the homeless. However, busy middle-class patients, such
as business executives and even doctors, have trouble sticking to
schedules, too.
	   ``We must make it simpler,'' Montaner said.

Ford to raise stake in Indian joint venture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAL101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ American auto maker Ford Motor Co. said
Wednesday it would raise its stake in an Indian joint venture to 92
percent from existing 50 percent.
	   The Indian government last week cleared its proposal on a dlrs
404 million joint venture with Mahindra and Mahindra, India's
largest manufacturer of utility and farm vehicles, said a company
official.
	   On Wednesday, Jim Jonston, vice president for marketing and
sales with the Indian joint venture, launched Orion, a medium-sized
luxury model.
	   ``We would like to be a long player in the medium car segment
and despite competition, Fiesta will corner at least 6-7 percent
share,'' Jonston told reporters in Calcutta, the capital of West
Bengal state.
	   Ford will pump in rupees 16 billion (dlrs 380 million) in the
joint venture in the coming years to manufacture Fiesta subcompacts
from its plant in the southern Indian city of Madras, he said.
	   The car maker aims at grabbing 10 percent of the Asian market by
the year 2005 from the present one percent. It has sold 11,000 cars
in India since it entered the Indian market in 1996, company
officials said.

World Cup: Beckham apologizes for red card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham apologized Wednesday to his team,
his manager and England fans for being sent off during England's
World Cup loss to Argentina.
	   Beckham was sent off early in the second half for kicking
Argentina's captain Diego Simeone, leaving his team one player
short for 70 minutes.
	   Beckham, who arrived back in England with the team on Wednesday,
released a statement saying he was deeply sorry and the incident
was ``without doubt the worst moment of my career.''
	   ``I will always regret my actions,'' the 23-year-old midfielder
said. ``I have apologized to the England players and management and
I want every England supporter to know how deeply sorry I am.''
	   His apology was released as his team, which was tied 2-2 with
Argentina at the end of extra time but lost in a penalty shootout,
returned from France.
	   Beckham was the center of a huge campaign from supporters to
have him reinstated when he was left out of Glenn Hoddle's starting
team for the first two World Cup games.
	   Beckham, who was banned from England's next two international
matches by world soccer authorites, said his international career
was not over.
	   ``I only hope that I will have the opportunity in the future to
be part of a successful England team,'' he said.
	   Beckham's father, Ted Beckham, defended his son, saying he did
not deserve to be sent off.
	   ``It didn't warrant a red card. It warranted a yellow card,'' he
said. ``David was so choked last night he couldn't speak.''
	   Beckham's mother Sandra was in tears as she stood up for her son
on Wednesday.
	   ``He hasn't let us down, we are very proud of him,'' she said.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle made it clear that Beckham's
sending-off had an impact on the game but he did not think Beckham
should be made a scapegoat.
	   Government ministers and Beckham's sponsor, German sportswear
giant Adidas, also rallied behind the Manchester United star.
	   Adidas issued a statement saying the company did not condone
Beckham's action but he would regret it and he was a player of the
future.
	   ``Beckham is an outstanding player. We believe he will learn and
grow from (the) experience and we will continue to support him at
club and international level,'' the statement said.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said Beckham had made a valuable
contribution earlier in the tournament.
	   ``I should think no one feels worse about it than David Beckham
does. He is obviously going to have to learn from that,'' Blair
said.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks dismissed demands from some
soccer fans for Beckham to be banned from representing England.
	   He described the requests as absurd, ``absolute rubbish'' and a
``load of tosh.''.
	   ``I do not think David Beckham needs to be reminded of what
happened,'' Banks said.
	   Beckham was expected to fly to New York on Wednesday night to
meet his fiancee Victoria Adams, member of the pop group The Spice
Girls, who are on a U.S. tour.

Jane's: Five Pakistani nuclear scientists defect to West
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Five Pakistani nuclear scientists have defected to
the West because of their belief that Pakistan will develop nuclear
weapons for a first strike against India, Jane's Defense Weekly
quoted one of the scientists as saying Wednesday.
	   Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, an assistant research officer at the
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission in Khusab, was quoted as saying
he and four colleagues decided to leave Pakistan after attending a
meeting in May on future nuclear strategy.
	   India set off five underground nuclear explosions in early May
that provoked six Pakistani tests, heightening tensions between the
south Asian neighbors who have fought three wars in the last 50
years.
	   Chaudhary Khan defected to the United States and asked for
asylum in New York on May 22, said Jane's spokesman Paul Beaver,
author of the article, which will appear in the July 8 issue of the
respected military magazine. Jane's issued a preview report
Wednesday.
	   The four other scientists, who were not identified, are thought
to have sought asylum in Britain, Beaver said.
	   ``The defections of the five scientists are not symptomatic of a
wide split in Pakistan's nuclear program,'' he said.
	   Since India and Pakistan carried out their tests, one of the
most sensitive issues has been the question of ``first use.''
	   India has proposed a no-first-use agreement with Pakistan. The
Pakistani government has said repeatedly it won't be the first to
use nuclear weapons.
	   But Chaudhary Khan and his colleagues apparently believed
otherwise and sent ``a letter of complaint'' to the head of
Pakistan's nuclear program, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, according to the
Jane's report.
	   It said a key complaint of the defecting scientists was the
attitude of Qadeer Khan, an expert in past Islamic victories over
India.
	   ``The indication that Pakistan had considered `first use'
indicates a much higher level of tension between India and Pakistan
than we had previously thought. In fact, the world was closer to
nuclear war in May than at any time since the Cold War,'' Beaver
told The Associated Press.
	   The Observer newspaper, in a report Sunday by Beaver and Peter
Beaumont, said five unidentified Pakistani nuclear scientists had
defected to protest Pakistan's adoption of a ``first-use'' policy.
	   One of the scientists was quoted as saying technicians had been
asked to prepare the ground for a possible ``first-use'' nuclear
strike by providing data on the explosive yields of the warheads
necessary to attack a variety of Indian military targets.
	   After India's tests, Pakistan became gravely concerned that New
Delhi intended to destroy its nuclear facilities before it could
carry out its own tests.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders in
Pristina edged closer to working with Kosovo fighters on Wednesday
but failed to agree on how to enlist them in a unified struggle for
independence.
	   Amid a lull in fighting, members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian
political parties met in Pristina to discuss drawing the Kosovo
Liberation Army into their political fight against Serbia. But they
adjourned until Sunday after failing to agree on how to meld the
guerrilla struggle with their non-violent independence campaign.
	   ``We all agree that the KLA have become an important factor on
the Kosovo political scene,'' said Luleta Pula-Bequiri, a political
leader. ``An effort must be made so that the political factor takes
over control over the situation in Kosovo.''
	   The KLA is rapidly gaining popularity at the expense of
politicians espousing a peaceful independence struggle.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population, also participated in the meeting but refused comment
afterward.
	   Wednesday's meeting by the politicians was recognition that _
with support for them growing inside and outside Kosovo _ the
guerrillas cannot be ignored.
	   Under one proposal discussed, the political groups would become
the KLA's political wing.
	   American diplomats have held several meetings with leaders of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, and there will be more shortly, a
senior U.S. official said Tuesday in Washington.
	   But in a clear sign that the United States continued to support
Rugova, State Department spokesman James Rubin described him as
``central and indispensable.''
	   Rubin, speaking in Washington, said Rugova speaks ``for the
interests of the Kosovar Albanian people.''
	   In Belgrade, Zivorad Igic, an aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, blasted the U.S. contacts with the guerrillas
as American ``legalization of terrorism.''
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic coal
mine from the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday. Reporters at
Belacevac and Hade, the two towns just a few hundred meters (yards)
from the coal mine saw the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no
signs of fighting or a heightened state of alert.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which is closed to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said the KLA still controls
the open-pit mine. The mine is strategically important because it
supplies coal to the Obilic power plant, which provides electricity
to most of Kosovo.
	   The center listed casualties among fighters in the Belasevac
region over the last two days of fighting as three dead and two
wounded. Among civilians, a child and an adult were killed and six
others wounded.
	   Albanian sources also claimed that rebels have completely
surrounded Klina, a government-controlled town in the central
Drenica region, cutting off access to Pec to the southwest. That
report also could not be confirmed.
	   In violence Wednesday, KLA guerrillas attacked the Serb village
of Drsnik, killing a 26-year-old villager, the Yugoslavia's Tanjug
state news agency said. The shooting lasted for several hours
before the KLA withdrew, the agency said.
	   Military jets _ apparently from the Yugoslav air force _ flew
low over Pristina in roughly five-minute intervals for more than an
hour before the flights stopped.

Plan involving Becker for new tour fails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A plan by Boris Becker and a Swiss
company to create a new men's tennis tour has been rejected, and
the ATP Tour instead announced more modest changes Wednesday.
	   The marketing company Prisma sought to create a circuit that
would replace the men's ATP Tour. Becker represented Prisma at a
clandestine meeting with chairmen of the four Grand Slams, but they
rejected the proposal, the Evening Standard of London reported.
	   The meeting took place this spring after the ATP rejected a
three-year television package proposed by Prisma.
	   ``Have Becker and Prisma been around making inquiries?
Absolutely,'' said Mark Miles, chief executive officer of the ATP
Tour. ``Do I think it has any chance of getting anywhere? No.
Period.''
	   The ATP announced four-year marketing agreements Wednesday with
ISL, a Swiss company that handles World Cup marketing, and Octagon,
a London business involved in sports marketing. The deals will
increase revenue for men's tennis by about 30 percent, the ATP
said, though the agreements are less lucrative than Prisma's
proposal.
	   The ATP also said plans have been finalized to change the men's
ranking system in 2000. A new points race will begin each January,
and the system that counts results from the previous 52 weeks will
be abandoned.
	   Under the new system, top-ranked Pete Sampras would instead be
No. 12 this week, more accurately reflecting his slump in the first
six months of 1998.
	   Sampras said he favored the change because it makes the rankings
easier to follow.
	   ``To have a race, and whoever has the most points at the end of
the year is No. 1, I think that's the simplest way for everyone to
understand it,'' Sampras said.
	   The tour's nine top-tier events will remain unchanged. Top
players will be required to play in all top-tier tournaments as
well as the Grand Slams, and those events will weigh more heavily
in the rankings.
	   The ATP is continuing to pursue a proposal for combined
tournaments with the women's tour in Hamburg, Rome and Canada. Bart
McGuire, chief executive officer of the WTA Tour, said last week
the women are interested in the idea.
	   The ATP also announced plans to discontinue up to 10 small
tournaments, which will streamline the men's calendar and create
more flexibility in the schedule. Tournaments to be affected
weren't disclosed.
	   Miles said he had discussed possible changes in the tour with
Becker, the winner of six Grand Slams.
	   ``We have talked over the months about the plans we announced
today, and he was very supportive _ right up until we parted
company with Prisma,'' Miles said.
	   Miles said Prisma's TV package was rejected in part because the
company proposed pay-per-view telecasts.
	   ``We believe in the best possible broadest exposure,'' Miles
said, ``especially for our best tennis in our top tournaments.''
	   Prisma's plan also would have diminished the importance of
dozens of small tournaments, the ATP said.
	   A Wimbledon spokesman had no comment Wednesday on the proposal
made by Prisma and Becker to the Grand Slam chairmen.

Defeat produces a goat, and hope amid the hangovers, for English

 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham used to be one of the most envied
men in England: an 8 million pound-a-year (dlrs 13 million) soccer
star engaged to a Spice Girl, a key man in a team hitting its
stride in the World Cup finals.
	   Late Tuesday night, he became the national goat, the
hot-tempered kid who killed England's hopes of beating Argentina by
getting ousted for kicking an opponent right in front of the
referee.
	   ``10 Heroic Lions One Stupid Boy,'' said the tabloid Mirror
newspaper.
	   ``Outcha,'' said The Daily Star, playing on the notorious Sun
headline ``Gotcha'' when Britain sank an Argentine warship when the
countries went to war for real over the Falkland Islands colony in
1982.
	   As if to underline the nationwide gloom, the London offices of
the Football Association _ where England coach Glenn Hoddle has an
office _ caught fire Wednesday afternoon.
	   Beckham's abrupt exit forced England to play the second half
with one less man than Argentina, to abandon the attacking flair
that produced a 2-2 halftime score and eventually to lose in a
heart-stopping penalty shoot-out.
	   The match was a national occasion, watched by 23.7 million
people. Electric power companies said the demand surge at halftime
_ presumably from fans switching on tea kettles _ was the biggest
since the shooting of J.R. Ewing on the TV show ``Dallas'' in 1985.
	   Police reported 45 arrests, mainly in southern England towns, as
shocked fans poured out of pubs.
	   And even Prince Charles weighed in, albeit with royal restraint.
``It was very sad, wasn't it?'' he told disappointed fan Nazmul
Shidkar, 11, during a visit to a housing project in London.
	   But there was pride in the team's courageous and skillful
performance in a spellbinding match, and British Airways dispatched
a supersonic Concorde to France to bring the fallen heroes home.
	   About 400 airport workers cheered as the team left the plane,
though apprentice engineer Paul Dempsey brought along a cardboard
cutout of ``Posh Spice'' Victoria Adams, Beckham's girlfriend, in a
sarcastic welcome home gesture ``after his cracking performance
last night.''
	   Hope bloomed amid the hangovers, especially because of the
brilliant play of 18-year-old Michael Owen, who scored one of
England's two goals.
	   But most of the talk _ and all the venom _ was directed at the
23-year-old Beckham.
	   ``This is without doubt the worst moment of my career,'' he said
in a statement issued Wednesday, adding that he was ``deeply
sorry.''
	   Forgiveness will come slowly.
	   ``Beckham should never play for England again,'' said fan Ian
Hawkins, after stepping off the Eurostar train from France on
Wednesday.
	   And some 3,000 people dialed a phone-in poll at Talk Radio in
London to say the same thing, though about 2,000 other callers
thought mercy might be shown.
	   Alan Mullery, a former captain of England's soccer team,
predicted that Beckham's life was permanently blighted. Like
Mullery's.
	   ``I was sent off one minute before the end of the match and I
still have to live with the guilt and the blame _ and that was 30
years ago,'' Mullery said on Talk Radio, recalling the European
Championships.
	   Defeat in the World Cup is customary but especially galling for
the English, who invented the game.

Police to get tough after Buenos Aires violence spoils World Cup
</HEADLINE>
victory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with police tightening security for next
game &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Police on Wednesday promised to
tighten security for Argentina's next World Cup match, a day after
rock-throwing clashes injured dozens celebrating a victory over
England.
	   A federal police official, Luis Fernandez, said police would
seek a ban on big outdoor TV screens, which drew large crowds to
downtown Buenos Aires for Tuesday's match, which Argentina won 4-3
on penalties after a 2-2 tie.
	   Authorities, who had used tear gas and a water cannon to
disperse the throng the night before, put the toll Wednesday at 78
injured. Twenty-six police officers were hospitalized.
	   Fernandez told reporters that 127 people were arrested and would
face such charges such as destruction of property and theft.
	   He blamed the Buenos Aires violence on a group of about 300
people, many of them drunk, who lingered after a much larger and
peaceful celebration by thousands of chanting, cheering Argentines.
	   ``It transformed into a huge group of hooligans,'' Fernandez
told reporters, hours after sanitation workers picked up the rocks,
bricks and broken glass littering a downtown plaza.
	   Fernandez would not discuss specifics of security changes, nor
did he mention how many officers would be patrolling when Argentina
and the Netherlands meet on Saturday.
	   Argentina's post-game chaos showed even countries outside France
are not immune to the violence that has marred World Cup venues.
	   Since the tournament began June 10, French police have arrested
more than 700 people and tallied at least 3,200 injuries, most of
them slight. To combat violence, authorities have closed down bars,
sent hooligan spotters into crowds, and put hundreds of police at
potential flashpoints.
	   Argentina's celebrations began peacefully with thousands pouring
into the streets, waving flags and chanting ``Ar-gen-tina!'' But
the mood turned ugly as night fell and thousands gathered at the
Obelisk, a downtown monument resembling the Washington Monument.
	   Rowdy youths began throwing rocks and bottles, ripping up street
signs and taunting police.
	   These ``people didn't come to celebrate. They came to rob and
steal on a day that Argentina should be happy,'' said Gustavo Lopez
Gil, a candy store owner who ducked the violence.
	   For some, the victory was bittersweet. It was ``a terrible way
to end a fantastic day,'' said 59-year-old Marcelo Vargas.

<TEXT>
	   RIACE, Italy (AP) _ More than 300 Kurds and North Africans
landed Wednesday in Italy in the latest wave of would-be immigrants
trying to reach Europe.
	   A young Tunisian man drowned off the coast of Sicily, apparently
after falling off a small boat, state television reported.
	   With warm temperatures and calm waters, would-be immigrants have
been arriving nearly every day on Italy's long coastlines. But most
of them are swiftly expelled under tough immigration laws passed
under pressure from Italy's European allies.
	   Clandestine arrivals by hundreds of Kurdish refugees from Turkey
earlier this year led to an outcry by Germany, which claimed that
Italy was a transit point for refugees seeking jobs and to reach
their families in northern Europe.
	   The authorities said Wednesday they detained 184 Kurds who
reached Riace and other towns on the southern coast from Turkey and
160 North Africans arriving in Sicily.

Despite China's gains, Clinton delivers environmental warning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material;environmental meeting at 0250GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton is delivering an
environmental warning as he leaves the gleaming skyscrapers of
Shanghai for the fabled limestone mountains of Guilin: China soon
will have the ``unfortunate distinction'' of replacing the United
States as the world's No. 1 producer of greenhouse gases.
	   But while the problems are enormous, attitudes are changing, and
Clinton pledged U.S. support for China's efforts to clean up its
environment.
	   He said Wednesday that a major legacy of his visit will be
U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the environment _ something that ``ten
years from now people will look back and say that's one of the
biggest things they did.''
	   In a speech to American business leaders, Clinton urged China to
clean up corruption, open trade markets and combat the
environmental catastrophe hanging over the world's most populous
country. He said it was wrong to believe _ as many do _ ``that
there is an iron, unbreakable link between economic growth and
industrial-age energy practices. ... It is simply not true.''
	   The president was accorded a third opportunity of national media
exposure in a taped interview with state television CCTV. He was
asked friendly questions and sidestepped on whether he or President
Jiang Zemin has a tougher job.
	   With the end of the Cold War, Clinton said, ``America has this
role which is temporary _ it won't last forever _ as the only
superpower in the world.'' He said the world ``needs a leader but
not in the sense of one country telling everyone else what to do.''
	   Clinton's stop on Thursday in Guilin puts him amid the splendor
of cloud-shrouded mountains and winding rivers that have inspired
artists for thousands of years, a contrast to the high-rise modern
structures of Shanghai.
	   After floods along the Li River, the government sent in 5,000
soldiers to clean up the mud-coated banks. The troops hauled away
20 tons of drift and sludge to improve things for Clinton.
	   After a river boat ride, the president will fly to Hong Kong,
the last stop on his nine-day visit, to demonstrate U.S. interest
in preserving the autonomy of the former British colony. It was
returned to China on July 1, 1997, after 156 years of British rule.
	   Jiang will wrap up a visit to Hong Kong _ marking the first
anniversary of the handover _ just hours before Clinton arrives.
	   There will be Clinton photo opportunities with Tung Chee-hwa,
the conservative shipping magnate who runs the territory, and Ansin
Chan, the senior civil servant.
	   But Clinton's meeting with Martin Lee, Hong Kong's leading
proponent of democracy, will be private _ a decision seen by some
as an attempt not to offend the Chinese government. Presidential
spokesman Mike McCurry said photo ops are reserved for heads of
state and government.

Murder defendant told to wait while court hears appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A Bermuda man charged with killing a
Canadian teen-ager was told Wednesday his case would have to wait
until appeals are heard in the case of another man involved in the
slaying.
	   Chief Justice Austin Ward set an Aug. 3 appearance for Justis
Smith, charged with killing 17-year-old Rebecca Middleton, of
Belleville, Ontario, in July 1996. Smith has pleaded innocent.
	   Ward said Smith's case would have to wait until Britain's Privy
Council hears an appeal in the case of Kirk Mundy, a Jamaican who
is serving a five-year sentence for being an accessory to
Middleton's murder.
	   Prosecutors are appealing a ruling by Bermuda's Court of Appeals
that Mundy cannot be tried for premeditated murder. Prosecutors,
who say they've turned up new evidence against Mundy, want to try
Mundy and Smith together.
	   A charge of premeditated murder carries a mandatory death
penalty in Bermuda, although the sentence is usually commuted to
life in prison.
	   Mundy pleaded guilty in October 1996 to the lesser charge in
return for testimony against his former friend, Smith.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The presidents of Sierra Leone were in
Nigeria on Wednesday for a mini summit with the country's new
military leader and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The summit comes as Annan is meeting with top officials in the
government and opposition, well-known business leaders and is also
said to be planning to meet with Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993 presidential
elections.
	   Nigerian human rights and government officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, say the two men are expected to meet, but
could give no further details.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard had no comment on the possible
meeting.
	   However, Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku did meet
with Abiola for over an hour, the Commonwealth Secretariat in
London said in a statement. No further details were immediately
available.
	   Annan met for about an hour Wednesday with representatives of
Nigeria's opposition movement, including labor leaders, journalists
and professors.
	   ``We heard the messages clear from all of them,'' Annan said
afterwards. ``Every one would want to see a return to civil rule
... (all) want to live under the rule of law with respect for human
rights, freedom of expression and freedom of association.''
	   One well-known group of government critics, known as the G-34,
suggested the junta either set up a transitional government lasting
about one year headed by a six-man presidential council or organize
fresh elections for Nov. 5.
	   Annan and Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar were to meet again Wednesday
night, when the secretary-general was expected to pass on the
suggestions he'd been given.
	   Annan, who is from Ghana, and the Nigerian-born Anyaoku are the
highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the
late ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by
executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995.
	   Presidents Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Charles Taylor
of Liberia, meanwhile, left their home countries Wednesday morning
for the meeting with Abubakar and Annan, according to government
officials in each country.
	   No statements were expected to be immediately issued about the
summit.

World Cup takes breather, Beckham takes blame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Argentine violence &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup took its first deep breath Wednesday.
It was much-needed, given the late-hour excitement of the night
before.
	   After 56 matches in 21 days of virtual non-stop soccer, this was
the first of back-to-back game-free days ahead of the quarterfinals
Friday and Saturday. The eight remaining teams practiced, rested
and otherwise looked ahead to some very enticing matchups.
	   And everyone, it seems, talked about Match No. 56 _ Argentina's
penalty shootout victory over England that ended near midnight
Tuesday.
	   ``I'm very proud of our performance,'' England coach Glenn
Hoddle said before his team curiously boarded the world's fastest
passenger plane, the Concorde, for the short hop home across the
English Channel. ``We didn't deserve to lose.''
	   Argentina won 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw that included a
three goals in the first 15 minutes, including an electrifying run
by 18-year-old Michael Owen.
	   The victory set off wild celebrations that turned into ugly
alcohol-fed violence in Buenos Aires, where 78 people were injured,
including 26 hospitalized police officers, and 127 arrests were
made.
	   ``It transformed into a huge group of hooligans,'' said federal
police official Luis Fernandez, who said he would seek a ban on
games being shown on big outdoor TV screens before Argentina's
quarterfinal game against the Netherlands on Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, in a devastated England, where one pub owner broke
his television set in disgust after Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa
made the final shootout save, there was a need to designate a
national goat: David Beckham.
	   Beckham was widely derided on television, radio and in
newspapers for the retaliatory kick that earned him a red card at
the start of the second half. His ejection forced the English to
play with 10 men for 75 minutes, and Hoddle surely didn't make
Beckham feel any better when the coach said that England would have
won the game had it remained 11-on-11.
	   So, Beckham _ whose other claim to fame is his engagement to
singer Posh Spice _ did what he felt he had to do. He issued an
apology, albeit in the form of a fax sent by his agent.
	   ``This is without doubt the worst moment of my career,'' the
statement said. ``I will always regret my actions during last
night's game. I have apologized to the England players and
management and I want every England supporter to know how deeply
sorry I am.''
	   Piling on the misery for the 23-year-old midfielder, FIFA
announced Wednesday that Beckham would be banned for England's next
two competitive matches _ its first two qualifying games for the
2000 European Championships. FIFA also fined him 5,000 Swiss francs
(dlrs 3,300).
	   Beckham's folly caught the attention of the Argentines' next
opponents, the Dutch, whose coach said Wednesday he would talk to
his players about coping with frustration in preparation for
Sunday's match in Marseille.
	   ``Frustration toleration is the name of the game,'' Guus Hiddink
said, specifically referring to Beckham's retaliation. ``We know
what (Argentina's) norms are, and that they are very good at
inciting irritation.''
	   The Dutch are susceptible to such tactics. Striker Patrick
Kluivert was sent off and suspended for two games after elbowing
Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' World Cup opener.
Kluivert said he was provoked when Staelens called him a rapist.
	   Hiddink urged FIFA and the match referee to be on the lookout
for such ploys.
	   ``I think in this match they will have to be very careful,'' he
said.
	   France has a worry ahead of its Friday match against Italy at
Saint-Denis. Preparing to face one of the toughest defenses at the
World Cup, it may have to do without top marksman Thierry Henry.
	   Henry, who has scored three goals in the tournament, is nursing
a sprained left ankle suffered in France's second-round victory
over Paraguay.
	   ``If I can, I will play,'' Henry said. ``If not, we are not
going to take any risks.''
	   Friday's other quarterfinal matches defending champion Brazil
against Denmark at Nantes, while a confident German team meets
Croatia on Saturday in Lyon.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, it's really up to us,''
German captain Juergen Klinsmann said. ``And I am very
optimistic.''

Zvereva: Best hands in tennis and head to go with them
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Natasha Zvereva probably has the best
hands in women's tennis. And now she may have the head to go with
them.
	   Better known for her off-court antics _ and 18 Grand Slam
doubles titles none in singles _ the unabashed Belarussian reached
her first singles Grand Slam semifinal in 10 years Wednesday, and
her first at Wimbledon, with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 victory over former
No. 1 Monica Seles.
	   Seles joined another ex-No. 1 Steffi Graf, who was beaten by
Zvereva earlier in the week.
	   ``Big time. I am absolutely thrilled,'' said the 26-year-old
Zvereva, variously described as goofy, fun-loving, outspoken and
unpredictable. ``It's completely unexpected. It makes it a double
pleasure.''
	   That's how she is.
	   In the 1995 Australian Open, she shocked the crowd by pulling
her tennis shirt halfway over her head, joking that the men swapped
theirs in open air between sets.
	   Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, she complained openly
that the Soviet state was taking her prize money.
	   ``This could be only one tournament, making it into the
semifinals,'' Zvereva said, who was thrashed 6-0, 6-0 by Graf in
her only Grand Slam singles final in 1988 in the French Open.
	   ``Then again, it might not be. So I'll take it slowly, one match
at a time has worked here.''
	   Zvereva said she played ``the best match'' of her life in
beating Graf this week. And the Seles performance was almost as
good.
	   ``They were very, very close for the style of the game I played
and my level of concentration,'' said Zvereva, who kept her shots
low against Seles and kept changing pace.
	   Seles, who called Zvereva's hands ``the best in tennis'' just a
few days ago, gave her a good chance of winning the title Saturday
if she gets by her Thursday semifinal with France's Nathalie
Tauziat.
	   In the other semifinal, defending champion Martina Hingis plays
Jana Novotna, a rematch of last year's final.
	   ``Geez, she beat Steffi and me, I'm sure she has a chance,''
Seles said.
	   At a party, Zvereva is the first on the dance floor and the last
off. In Wednesday's semifinal, she wore red wrap-around sunglasses
with her unruly hair pinned down haphazardly.
	   The inside cover of the WTA Tour guide shows her hair knotted on
top of her head like a pineapple. It also lists her career ambition
as becoming ``the best farmer in Minsk province.''
	   ``It's just something in my dreams,'' she said, leaving it
unclear whether she was entirely serious. ``I hope to pursue it
after I'm done with my tennis career.''
	   ``Now I'm just absolutely excited about playing another match
here.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Uzbek President Islam Karimov and Israeli Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky discussed possible cooperation in farming,
telecommunications, energy and environmental protection, a news
agency said Wednesday.
	   Sharansky said they also discussed terrorism and Islamic
fundamentalism during a two-hour meeting in the Uzbek capital of
Tashkent.
	   ``We suffer from it and Uzbekistan, an Islamic country, is doing
its utmost to prevent such an extremity,'' Sharansky said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident, was in the Central Asian
country to drum up business opportunities.

Tourists extinguish France's eternal flame in `unspeakable' act

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French and Mexican officials held a ceremony
Wednesday to re-light the eternal flame under the Arc de Triomphe
after two Mexican tourists extinguished it by urinating on it.
	   Mexico's ambassador to France, Sandra Fuentes, laid a wreath by
the flame during the ceremony, which was attended by about 20 war
veterans. The flame commemorates the nation's war dead.
	   A statement by the Defense Ministry said the flame, which
commemorates the nation's war dead, was ``soiled'' in an
``unspeakable act.''
	   It did not elaborate, but a member of the Committe for the
Flame, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two drunken
Mexicans were caught by police late Tuesday night after urinating
on the flame.
	   The two Mexicans, a man and a woman, were questioned by police
and later released, their embassy said.
	   ``This has been an attack on the memory of those who died for
France, and their honor,'' the Defense Ministry statement said.
	   Genevieve Senechal, spokeswoman for France's Anciens Combattants
war veterans association, described it as ``terrible vandalism and
profanation.
	   ``I just hope they were drunk,'' she said. ``That wouldn't
excuse them, but at least then it might not have been
premeditated.''
	   The Mexican national anthem was supposed to have been played
during the ceremony, but was canceled at the last moment after
protests from French military officials, members of the Committe
for the Flame said.
	   Committee members and police stand guard day and night by the
flame.
	   The Mexican ambassador said she attended the ceremony ``to
express her regrets.''
	   One veteran attending the ceremony, Robert Combres, said that
although he was shocked, the incident should not distract attention
from France's war heroes.
	   ``This place of remembrance is very important to us since it
represents all our colleagues who lost their lives,'' Combres said.
``Whatever happened, nothing can take away from that.''
	   A spokeswoman for the Mexican Embassy in Paris called the affair
``an accident.
	   ``I don't think French-Mexican bilateral ties will be too
affected,'' said the spokeswoman, Anne Morales.

Tim Henman lifts World Cup gloom by reaching semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just hours after the nation cried over
England's loss to Argentina in the World Cup, Tim Henman boosted
morale Wednesday by becoming the first British man to reach the
Wimbledon semifinals since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   ``He's lifted all our spirits here today,'' said Colin
Bloomfield from London, who witnessed England's penalty shootout
defeat in France Tuesday night and flew straight to Wimbledon.
	   ``I'm sure that if we get behind him he can go all the way,'' he
said. ``We needed a new figure-head. Ten years ago if you asked
anyone who their tennis hero was they'd say Bjorn Borg or John
McEnroe. Now it's Tim Henman.''
	   Henman's 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 upset of third-seeded Czech Petr Korda
earned him a Centre Court showdown Friday with defending champion
Pete Sampras. Not only are they rivals for a place in the final,
where no British player has gone since Henry Austin in 1938,
they're friends, too.
	   ``I've got to know Tim pretty well over the past couple of
years,'' said Sampras, who teams up with Henman for doubles
occassionally. ``I practice with him a bunch, but I don't think
we'll be too close on Friday. That's what it's all about. You have
friends on the tour and you obviously don't take these matches
personally. You just go out and play the match and leave it on the
court.''
	   The last British triumph at Wimbledon was in 1977 when Virginia
Wade beat Betty Stove in front of a wildly cheering crowd. The last
victory by a British male was in 1936 when Fred Perry won his third
title in a row.
	   Henman plays down the significance of his achievement, insisting
he is playing for himself rather than his nation.
	   ``The football was a huge disappointment for everyone,'' said
Henman. ``I didn't want to continue the trend and was keen to win,
but having said that I've always said I'm out there playing for
myself. That's the way it will always be.''
	   Claiming he keeps his head clear and feet on the ground during
Wimbledon by not reading the newspaper reports of his triumphs,
Henman insists he will not be overcome by nerves or the
expectations of the millions of supporters willing him on.
	   ``I was aware in the last couple of matches that being so calm
and relaxed is when I'm playing my best tennis, and I'm not putting
any extra pressure on myself,'' said Henman. ``The semifinals is
the perfect opportunity to have the same attitude. I'm playing the
world No. 1, a guy that's won four out of the last five years, so
there won't be any added pressure on myself.
	   ``I think that if I play the tennis that I've played and the
tennis I'm capable of, I have a good chance.''

Despite China's gains, Clinton delivers environmental warning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material;environmental meeting at 0250GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton is delivering an
environmental warning as he leaves the gleaming skyscrapers of
Shanghai for the fabled limestone mountains of Guilin: China soon
will have the ``unfortunate distinction'' of replacing the United
States as the world's No. 1 producer of greenhouse gases.
	   But while the problems are enormous, attitudes are changing, and
Clinton pledged U.S. support for China's efforts to clean up its
environment.
	   He said Wednesday that a major legacy of his visit will be
U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the environment _ something that ``ten
years from now people will look back and say that's one of the
biggest things they did.''
	   In a speech to American business leaders, Clinton urged China to
clean up corruption, open trade markets and combat the
environmental catastrophe hanging over the world's most populous
country. He said it was wrong to believe _ as many do _ ``that
there is an iron, unbreakable link between economic growth and
industrial-age energy practices. ... It is simply not true.''
	   The president was accorded a third opportunity of national media
exposure in a taped interview with state television CCTV. He was
asked friendly questions and sidestepped on whether he or President
Jiang Zemin has a tougher job.
	   With the end of the Cold War, Clinton said, ``America has this
role which is temporary _ it won't last forever _ as the only
superpower in the world.'' He said the world ``needs a leader but
not in the sense of one country telling everyone else what to do.''
	   Clinton's stop on Thursday in Guilin puts him amid the splendor
of cloud-shrouded mountains and winding rivers that have inspired
artists for thousands of years, a contrast to the high-rise modern
structures of Shanghai.
	   After floods along the Li River, the government sent in 5,000
soldiers to clean up the mud-coated banks. The troops hauled away
20 tons of drift and sludge to improve things for Clinton.
	   After a river boat ride, the president will fly to Hong Kong,
the last stop on his nine-day visit, to demonstrate U.S. interest
in preserving the autonomy of the former British colony. It was
returned to China on July 1, 1997, after 156 years of British rule.
	   Jiang will wrap up a visit to Hong Kong _ marking the first
anniversary of the handover _ just hours before Clinton arrives.
	   There will be Clinton photo opportunities with Tung Chee-hwa,
the conservative shipping magnate who runs the territory, and Anson
Chan, who heads the civil service.
	   But Clinton's meeting with Martin Lee, Hong Kong's leading
proponent of democracy, will be private _ a decision seen by some
as an attempt not to offend the Chinese government. Presidential
spokesman Mike McCurry said photo ops are reserved for heads of
state and government.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Wednesday praised U.S. President Bill
Clinton's trip to China and said it was a sign of improving
relations between the two countries.
	   Better relations between the two countries will lead to
stability and security in the Pacific, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin.
	   ``Moreover, we believe that development of close cooperation
between Moscow and Beijing, Beijing and Washington, and Moscow and
Tokyo ... will play a stabilizing role in the future of the Pacific
region and contribute to prosperity in this important region of the

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fire broke out at the headquarters of the English
Football Association on Wednesday as the England team flew back
from France after bowing out of the World Cup.
	   The fire started on the first floor of the FA's offices in
Lancaster Gate, central London, Wednesday afternoon as the national
team was returning to Heathrow after its loss to Argentina on
Tuesday.
	   About 50 people were evacuated from the five-storey building as
six fire trucks and an ambulance raced to the scene.
	   Initial fears for the safety of England's most prized trophies,
including a replica of the 1966 World Cup, were erased when
officials revealed the trophies were protected in a basement vault.
	   FA press officer Mark Sudbury said fire alarms went off about
1200 GMT.
	   ``It appears to have happened where some workmen were carrying
out refurbishments on the first floor,'' he said.
	   A London Fire Brigade spokesman said the blaze was contained to
the first floor and was extinguished about 1500GMT.
	   An investigation was underway into the cause of the fire.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ In a story about the 50th anniversary of the
Berlin airlift, The Associated Press erroneously reported on June
26 that a U.S. commemorative airlift stamp was the first U.S. stamp
unveiled outside the United States.
	   In 1996, a U.S. stamp edition featuring prehistoric animals
debuted at a stamp show in Canada.
	   The United States also has released stamps jointly with other
countries, such as the Cinco de Mayo stamp released April 16 in

WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Clinton focused on trip, not Tripp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton's spokesman, at a
briefing for reporters in Shanghai, dismissed with a quip the
question of whether Linda Tripp's testimony in Washington before a
federal grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky case was
worrisome to the White House.
	   ``The president has been concentrated on one trip, and it's
China, not Linda,'' Mike McCurry said at a briefing Wednesday.
	    &UR; ___
	   One thing about home ownership _ no need to worry about losing
housing benefits when you change jobs. President Clinton was
speaking, although he might have been listening.
	   He does not own a home, but he'll have to find one before Jan.
20, 2001, because that's the day a new occupant takes over the
White House.
	   Clinton spoke about the importance of ownership Wednesday at a
housing complex where Chinese families are buying apartments a long
commute from downtown Shanghai.
	   He visited one, the apartment of Yu Jianyuan and her family. The
complex, Jin Hui Gardens, features four- and six-story apartment
buildings built and bought, she said, through the planning of the
government and the developer and the diligence of the people who
now live there.
	   He told them he bought his first small house 23 years ago
because his girlfriend liked it so much, then told her she'd have
to marry him, and she did.
	   ``So I hope that your homes bring you as much joy as mine did 23
years ago,'' Clinton said.
	   He said home ownership in America ``has made our country
stronger, and I know greater home ownership will also strengthen
China.'' Clinton said the United States will try to help with a
cooperative effort to promote new technologies and materials for
home-building and with advice on a stronger system of financing
homes.
	   Actually, on that score, the Chinese might advise the Americans.
The mortgage rate for home loans at the complex was said to be just
over 4 percent, far lower than U.S. rates.
	   ``And, of course, when people own their own homes, they are free
to take new jobs without worrying about losing housing benefits,''
Clinton said.
	    &UR; ___
	   President Clinton went to the vast floor of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange and came away with a Chinese trader's vest, bright red
with yellow numerals 1998 on the back. He didn't put a halt to
trading: The market always takes a lunch break.
	   The exchange, opened late in 1990, is a glistening
steel-and-glass building with the broad amphitheater trading floor
at its heart.
	   Young traders, many of them women, sit in hundreds of cubicles,
with computer screens and telephones. All wear red vests with their
trading numbers emblazoned on the back.
	   They applauded when Clinton appeared on the catwalk overlooking
the floor and again when he took the glass elevator down to walk
the aisles among their posts. He shook traders' hands and at one
point, sitting at a terminal, nodded as the trading process was
explained to him.

Pope blesses American doctor and Indian woman

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ When Dr. Jeffrey Meilman performed
reconstructive surgery on a young Indian woman disfigured by fire,
he kept a promise to the late Mother Teresa.
	   To show his thanks, Pope John Paul II received the Buffalo, New
York, plastic surgeon Wednesday, together with 18-year-old Meera
Pardeshi, and gave them both his blessing.
	   ``It's a nice ending to a tragedy,'' said Brian Rusk, spokesman
for the Hope for Tomorrow Foundation, which brought Ms. Pardeshi to
Buffalo in March.
	   A kitchen grease fire charred Ms. Pardeshi's face and upper body
two years ago at her home in Hyderabad, India. The doctor learned
of the case while doing humanitarian work in Calcutta on a trip
arranged with Mother Teresa.

Legendary Brazilian sees good, bad in rule change
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA's rule to punish the reviled tackle from
behind with red cards has opened up the game, but it also has
caused defenders to be tentative and given forwards incentive to
take dives at the World Cup, so says the legendary Pele.
	   ``No doubt the rule has opened the game,'' said Pele, a member
of Brazil's World Cup winning squads in 1958, '62 and '70. ``It has
changed things in the minds of players, and it is good for the
game.
	   ``But sometimes players do not act correctly because they are
afraid. This is a weakness. And it has led players to make dramatic
fakes. All you have to do is a touch a player and he goes down.''
	   Eighteen penalty kicks have been awarded in France 98, well
above the average of 8 1-2 per tournament in the first 15 World
Cups.
	   Fear of being expelled for a tackle from behind has resulted in
some players backing off when not clearly challenging a player from
the front. Argentina defender Jose Chamot could be seen slowing
down and pulling his hands back as England's Michael Owen sprinted
past en route to a first-half goal during Tuesday night's
second-round match.
	   ``The referees have mad a lot of mistakes because they are
confused with the change,'' Pele said. ``Some have acted
differently than others. It was a mistake for eject (David)
Beckham.''
	   English midfielder Beckham was ejected in the second minute of
the second half of Tuesday night's game, forcing England to play
the final 73 minutes a man down. Argentina eventually won the game
on penalty kicks after 2-2 draw.
	   As for the rest of the tournament, Brazil's former minister of
sport is guarded about his prediction, but admits he likes France
and the Netherlands.
	   ``They play open. They're not afraid to lose. They don't play
defensively,'' Pele said. ``Even Argentina plays with a libero. And
Brazil has not played well yet.

<TEXT>
	   RIACE, Italy (AP) _ More than 300 Kurds and North Africans
landed Wednesday in Italy in the latest wave of would-be immigrants
trying to reach Europe.
	   A young Tunisian man drowned off the coast of Sicily, apparently
after falling off a small boat, state television reported.
	   With warm temperatures and calm waters, would-be immigrants have
been arriving nearly every day on Italy's long coastlines. But most
of them are swiftly expelled under tough immigration laws passed
under pressure from Italy's European allies.
	   The Italian Foreign Ministry said it called in the ambassadors
of Tunisia and Morocco to express the government's concern over the
landings and asked that the two countries tighten their borders.
	   Clandestine arrivals by hundreds of Kurdish refugees from Turkey
earlier this year led to an outcry by Germany, which claimed that
Italy was a transit point for refugees seeking jobs and to reach
their families in northern Europe.
	   The authorities said Wednesday they detained 184 Kurds who
reached Riace and other towns on the southern coast from Turkey and
160 North Africans arriving in Sicily.

Guyana police chief apologizes for crowd shootings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with police commissioner issuing apology,
other details from Wednesday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana's police commissioner
apologized Wednesday to government workers who were hurt when
police fired shotguns at antigovernment protesters in downtown
Georgetown.
	   Twelve people were injured by steel pellets Tuesday.
	   Commissioner Laurie Lewis said police were trying to disperse
protesters who were blocking traffic in front of the Supreme Court.
Demonstrators had mingled with court employees who were in the
street because of a bomb threat.
	   Lewis called the injuries ``an unfortunate set of
circumstances'' and said he had called leaders of the employees'
Public Service Union to apologize.
	   Officers were under pressure to stop assaults by protesters on
bystanders and news reporters, Lewis said.
	   ``I would wish for people to recognize that these are obvious
breaches of the peace,'' Lewis said.
	   ``We can't stand idly by and allow protesters to hold this
country to ransom,'' he said.
	   In two weeks of demonstrations, protesters have thrown stones
and firebombs at police, firebombed the finance and labor
ministries, and smashed store windows in Georgetown's commercial
district. Police have countered with buckshot and tear gas and
arrested dozens of people.
	   Supporters of the opposition People's National Congress are
protesting December elections won by President Janet Jagan's
People's Progressive Party. The opposition party claims Jagan's
party rigged the vote and reneged on promises to revamp the
constitution.
	   The conflict has ethnic overtones. Most supporters of the
People's National Congress are Guyanese of African descent, while
Jagan's party is backed by ethnic East Indians.

Private businessmen blaze trails for China of tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Yan Zheng and his team of financial analysts are
pioneers of Chinese capitalism, blazing trails for future
entrepreneurs.
	   Yan's 4-year-old firm sells advice to clients _ both companies
and private individuals _ who have taken the plunge and invested in
China's fledgling stock and commodities markets.
	   In a gloomy Chinese economy, with state-run companies mired in
debt and firing workers by the thousands, private business is a
bright spot.
	   In a gesture of support for private enterprise, President Bill
Clinton met Wednesday with several of China's young entrepreneurs
at Shanghai's new Stock Exchange building.
	   ``As these state-owned enterprises get closed, it will get
harder and harder to go through unless people like you are
providing jobs for these people,'' he told the group over lunch.
	   The president talked bowling with Chen Rong, chairman and
general manager of a bowling manufacturing company, Shanghai
Zhonglu Industry Co., and chickens with Liu Ding Zhao, chairman of
a chicken company, who said he wanted to open a store in the United
States so Clinton ``could get a taste of Chinese chicken.''
	   ``Sounds good to me,'' Clinton responded.
	   Entrepreneurs are finding niches neglected during decades of
central planning. As China becomes more integrated into the world
economy, building financial markets and information networks,
creative, flexible small businesses are moving ahead much faster
than stodgy state-run firms.
	   The environment for private business has improved in recent
years, reflecting a recognition by Chinese leaders that the sector
is an important engine of economic growth that can provide jobs for
workers laid off by state firms. Private businesses are listed on
Shanghai's Stock Exchange, the first and largest of China's two
exchanges.
	   Armed with a degree in international finance, Yan, 33, began his
career as a floor trader on the Shanghai Metals Exchange, which was
set up in 1992 as part of China's experiments with capitalist
markets.
	   In 1994, he and another floor trader formed Colub Consultants
Co.
	   Like many private companies, they were turned away when they
tried to borrow from state banks, which even today do most of their
lending to state firms.
	   ``Policies toward private enterprise were not that favorable,''
said Shen Haihua, a deputy director in the firm. ``There was no
encouragement.''
	   So like most Chinese entrepreneurs, Yan and his associates
borrowed from friends and family. They invested in the markets and
used the profits to finance their company.
	   The firm operates out of four rented rooms in a grimy hotel,
television screens constantly flashing market information. It
employs 10 people, plus an outside research team of economic
analysts and has 50 clients, including a few large state concerns.
The firm is looking for office space in Pudong, Shanghai's new
skyscraper-studded financial district.
	   Comfortably occupying a niche in a new industry, Yan is
satisfied that he can compete with state firms.
	   Many private businesses complain, however, that they suffer
discrimination at the hands of banks, courts and the bureaucracy.
They are lobbying the Chinese legislature to amend the constitution
to guarantee equal treatment and protect private property.
	   The manager of a Beijing discount mart, for example, said local
officials refused to approve imports of cosmetics and other popular
items, to prevent his store from competing against struggling state
retailers.
	   When China first began allowing private business, loosening the
rigid controls that wiped out thriving private enterprise after the
Communists took over in 1949, only a few dared to strike out on
their own.
	   Even now, the largest number of private businessmen are
self-employed taxi drivers, hairdressers, restaurateurs, bike
repairmen and so on _ providing services that people lived without
during the days of central planning.

Police: cache of firebomb-making equipment found in Briton's car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORFU, Greece (AP) _ A cache of material capable of making more
than two dozen firebombs was discovered Wednesday in the trunk of a
British man's car after he threatened to burn down a kiosk, police
said.
	   The full name of the suspect, a 36-year-old Dutch-born Briton,
was not immediately clear. But police said he had most recently
lived on the Greek island of Zakinthos, about 240 kilometers (145
miles) west of Athens.
	   The material, believed sufficient to make 26 petrol-fueled
firebombs, was found after the man became enraged when a kiosk
owner refused to accept American currency, police said. The man
allegedly brandished a petrol bomb and threatened to torch the
kiosk in the village of Dassia on the northwestern Ionian island of
Corfu, a popular tourist destination.
	   Authorities did not disclose the full contents of the man's car,
but said it included canisters and other equipment related to
firebombs.
	   A rash of firebombings in the Athens area has targeted
government offices, cars and other sites. Various leftist groups
have claimed responsibility for the attacks, but it was not
immediately clear whether the British suspect is under
investigation for possible connections to Greek terrorists.
	   No terrorist-linked bombings have occurred recently on Corfu.

Seles goes down as Wimbledon fairy tale ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Monica Seles recognizes a fairy tale
when she hears one.
	   A favorite one _ with her in the lead role _ goes like this:
Following the death of her father just over a month ago and her
well-publicized stabbing in April 1993, she comes back to win
Wimbledon and regains her No. 1 ranking.
	   But Seles knows fairytales don't come true, as her 7-6 (7-4),
6-2 defeat to Natasha Zvereva in Wednesday's quarterfinals will
attest.
	   ``I think it's totally separate,'' she said. ``I don't think God
is going to favor a tennis match or a tennis player to win it. I
just don't agree with that outlook. Life really doesn't work like
that, does it.
	   ``Some people should get a lot. They for sure suffered so much
more than I ever did in my life. And they still don't get it.
Unfortunately, it's not like that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WHAT TENNIS: &LR;  It was tough to find tennis coverage Wednesday in
the British press. The papers were saturated with news of England's
penalty-shootout loss to Argentina Tuesday in the World Cup as
soccer pages out-numbered tennis 6 to 1. ``The End of Our World,''
said a Daily Mail headline, summing it up.
	   Unlike England, Croatia is still alive in the World Cup, having
reached the final eight. Goran Ivanisevic _ in the Wimbledon
semifinals for the first time since '95 _ described what might
happen if his young country won the World Cup.
	   ``The whole country will be drunk for the rest of the year,'' he
said. ``Including me and the rest of the team.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BYE, BYE LINDSAY: &LR;  Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport _ one of the
hardest hitters in women's tennis _ was beaten at her game own game
in Wednesday's quarterfinal loss to Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``That's by far the best she (Tauziat) has ever played against
me,'' said the American, who had won seven of eight previous
head-to-heads. ``I expected her to come in all the time and to
volley great, but she was really out-hitting me from the
baseline.''
	   ``This is by far the best I've ever played at Wimbledon,'' she
added. ``I didn't think I could play this well on grass.''
	   Tauziat, reaching her first Grand Slam semifinal on what is her
best surface, echoed Davenport. ``I hit like her, strong like
her... I mixed it up and it was good today.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JOLLY GOOD, PETE: &LR;  Pete Sampras, using his best British English,
described watching England lose to Argentina on penalties Wednesday
in the World Cup.
	   ``I don't know football that well,'' he said, avoiding the use
of the word soccer. ``Losing on penalties is a tough way to lose.''
	   He cracked up the English reporters when he joked about
Canadian-born Briton Greg Rusedski, whose North American accent is
spiced with expressions like ``mate, bloke and brilliant.''
	   ``I played a couple of years ago against Rusedski _ before he
all of a sudden turned English,'' Sampras said. ``Is that good for
you guys?'' Sampras asked the British press. ``I'm trying to
help.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Ken Rosewall, four-time Wimbledon runner-up,
is playing at Wimbledon at 63. Rosewall is playing in the over-45
doubles with Fred Stolle, 47 years after his first appearance at
Wimbledon.
	   He said he still hits the ball well _ ``when I reach it.''
	   Former U.S. Open runner-up Tom Okker, 54, was taken off the
court in a wheelchair after a calf injury in one of his matches.
	   Mark Philippoussis on the changes announced Wednesday in the ATP
Tour ranking system: ``I think it's the best thing, but I can't
really say. To be honest, I don't really care.''
	   Despite the passion for betting in Britain, there are no
bookmakers allowed on the All England Club grounds during the
fortnight. ``We have been pushing for it, but the ball's in their
court now,'' said Graham Sharpe of bookies William Hill.
	   Goran Ivanisevic has won eight straight matches over Richard
Krajicek dating back to 1992.

	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham used to be one of the most envied
men in England: an 8 million pound-a-year (dlrs 13 million) soccer
star engaged to a Spice Girl, a key man in a team hitting its
stride in the World Cup finals.
	   Late Tuesday night, he became the national goat, the
hot-tempered kid who killed England's hopes of beating Argentina by
getting ousted for kicking an opponent right in front of the
referee.
	   ``10 Heroic Lions One Stupid Boy,'' said the tabloid Mirror
newspaper.
	   ``Outcha,'' said The Daily Star, playing on the notorious Sun
headline ``Gotcha'' when Britain sank an Argentine warship when the
countries went to war for real over the Falkland Islands colony in
1982.
	   As if to underline the nationwide gloom, the London offices of
the Football Association _ where England coach Glenn Hoddle has an
office _ caught fire Wednesday afternoon, though it didn't appear
to be the work of a disgruntled fan.

without rain.
	   Attendance - 33,019. Last year on the ninth day it was 35,101.
	   Results:
	   Men's quarterfinals winners _ No. 1 Pete Sampras, No. 9 Richard
Krajicek, No. 12 Tim Henman, No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic.

I think everybody enjoyed watching him go at it.''

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The Barbados High Court has
overturned the vandalism conviction of a 73-year-old former cabinet
minister who removed a sign commemorating the country's only female
head of state.
	   Peter Morgan, a former tourism minister and high commissioner to
Canada, said he took down the 4-foot-high (1.2-meter-high) steel
sign in May 1997 because it referred to Nita Barrow Roundabout
without using her honorary title of dame.
	   The sign, which had stood at a traffic circle near the governor
general's official residence, commemorated Dame Nita Barrow, the
first woman to be appointed governor general to Barbados. The
governor general represents the queen of England in former British
colonies.
	   The court said Tuesday he was not guilty because he had caused
no damage to the sign or the columns holding it.
	   Morgan claimed the sign was not a fitting tribute and called its
removal a political protest.
	   ``They turned this into a criminal matter and I had to object,
because it was a civil protest,'' he said Tuesday. ``This matter
should never have reached this far.''
	   Barrow died in December 1995. Morgan served as tourism minister
under Barrow's brother, Errol Barrow.

An American makes a quiet climb to the top
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Foreigners have dominated the first
half of the LPGA season.
	   There's Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, Australia's Karrie Webb and
England's Laura Davies.
	   There's also the reigning champ, Alison Nicholas of England, and
Se Ri Pak, a 20-year-old rookie from South Korea who won the
McDonald's LPGA Championship in May.
	   All figure to contend at the U.S. Women's Open, which begins
Thursday at Blackwolf Run Golf Course.
	   What about the Americans? Quietly, one of them has earned more
money than any other player.
	   ``I don't think anybody has noticed yet,'' said Donna Andrews,
31, of Pinehurst, North Carolina, who tops the money list at dlrs
559,407, about dlrs 22,000 more than Sorenstam.
	   ``I sort of snuck up there and nobody was really paying
attention. It has sort of been nice because I didn't get a lot of
media coverage,'' Andrews said. ``I have quietly snuck my way up
there and have played good golf and the other girls are playing
great.''
	   In 15 events this year, Andrews has 11 top-10 finishes. She won
the Longs Drugs Challenge in April and has finished second four
times. Since the Welch's tournament March 15, Andrews has been in
the top six in 10 of 11 starts.
	   But that track record doesn't mean anything this week.
	   ``I've finished second the last four, five weeks and played
probably the best golf I could have played,'' she said. ``And even
at the Oldsmobile Classic, I shot 17-under and lost by six. So just
because you're at the top of your game doesn't mean that somebody
else might not have a better week than you.''
	   So far, nobody's having a better year financially, though.
	   Andrews is first on the tour in player of the year points, first
in percentage of rounds under par (73.1) and third in scoring
(69.94).
	   But she still doesn't draw huge galleries.
	   ``I haven't yet. I am sure I will this week,'' she said. ``The
other tournaments I had my normal fan support out there. The last
couple of weeks I have had probably a few more people. But being
here at the U.S. Open, I am sure there will be a lot more Americans
out there with me.''
	   And winning the Open _ and the dlrs 267,000 paycheck that goes
with it _ would go a long way toward making her a household name.
	   ``Well, I think the Open has always been special,'' Andrews
said. ``It is `our' tournament. As an American player, this to us
is sort of our tournament that I think we all dream about winning.
It is what you talk about as a kid growing up.
	   ``And it means a lot to the Europeans to win it, but I think it
means even more to an American player to go out and win this
tournament.''
	   Sorenstam, who won the Open in 1995 and '96, said the Open's
prestige knows no borders.
	   ``It is the U.S. Open and I am sure it means a lot to the
American players,'' Sorenstam said. ``But this tournament also has
a reputation in Europe and all around the world. This is the
championship that everybody wants to win. I think all the best
players in the world are here, so I think overall for everybody it
means a lot.''

Economic stabilization plan completes fourth year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANY CABRERA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's economic stabilization plan
Wednesday completed its fourth year with rising unemployment and a
stubborn current account deficit overshadowing its success in
controlling inflation and stabilizing the country's currency.
	   ``It is the only plan I know of that has spurred economic growth
and at the same time reduced poverty,'' President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso said at a ceremony commemorating the fourth anniversary of
the Real Plan.
	   The plan was introduced on July 1, 1994 when Cardoso was finance
minister It is widely credited with curbing high inflation and
stabilizing Brazil's currency, but criticized for generating high
unemployment.
	   Central Bank president Gustavo Franco said at the ceremony that
inflation in 1998 should be between 3 percent and 4 percent,
roughly equivalent to two days of inflation before the Real Plan
was introduced.
	   But Jose Dirceu, president of the leftist Workers Party, said
inflation was reduced at an high cost to society.
	   ``Unemployment grew, investments in health, education and public
safety were slashed, crime rose and the country stopped growing,''
Dirceu said.
	   According to official figures, unemployment has risen from 5.5
percent in 1994 to 8.2 percent in May, the second highest figure on
record. Independent organizations, however, place the joblessness
rate at 18 percent.
	   Cardoso, who will seek reelection in October, has admitted that
unemployment is one of the most serious problems facing the country
and pledged to lower it with higher economic growth rates.
	   Also speaking at the ceremony, Finance Minister Pedro Malan said
that growth in 1998 will be lower than the average 4 percent posted
over the previous five years.
	   Malan, who recently said Gross Domestic Product would grow 2
percent in 1998, attributed the reduction to the austerity measures
adopted last year to protect the real in the wake of the financial
turmoil that shook Asia.
	   ``All key economic indicators, except inflation, have
deteriorated in the four years since the Real Pan was introduced,''
said economist Aloizio Oliveira of the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro.
	   He mentioned the current account deficit that went from dlrs 700
million in 1993 to its current level of dlrs 33 billion, and the
balance of trade, which from a 1993 surplus of dlrs 13.3 billion
went to a deficit of dlrs 8.5 billion in 1997.

Mexican bank loans up 4.8 percent in first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Loan portfolios at Mexican commercial banks
grew 4.8 percent during the first quarter of 1998 in nominal terms,
the National Banking and Securities Commission said.
	   In its monthly report released late Tuesday, the commission,
known as the CNBV, said the growth in loans was slightly below the
rate of inflation for the period.
	   ``Several banking institutions registered real growth in
consumer credit and loans to productive activities of small and
medium-sized companies,'' the commission said.
	   By the end of March 1998, the total amount of past-due loans
totaled 88.44 billion pesos, or dlrs 9.94 billion, which was
equivalent to 11.3 percent of total loans. The percentage was
unchanged from the fourth quarter of 1997, the commission said.
	   Loan loss provisions amounted to 54.74 billion pesos, or dlrs
6.2 billion, at the end of the first quarter, equal to coverage of
61.9 percent of total past-due loans, the report said. The minimum
level required since January 1997 is 45 percent.
	   Capitalization levels to cover credit risk totaled 17.6 percent,
it said. Capitalization levels including market risk amounted to
14.1 percent.
	   The commission said the report didn't include data from 13 banks
which are either under government supervision or undergoing
recapitalization.

Russia to build toll roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia plans to build a network of toll roads and
will use the money collected from drivers to develop and modernize
other transportation systems, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Wednesday.
	   The first toll roads will open in 1999, said Vitaly Artyukhov,
head of the Federal Road Service.
	   One road will go between Mineralnye Vody to Kabardinka in
southern Russia, ITAR-Tass said. It did not give the other routes
or say what the toll would be.

Grains, soybeans retreat on moderating weather
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as conflicting Midwestern weather
forecasts played a tug of war with market sentiment on crop
prospects.
	   Sustained hot, dry weather in the key Midwest growing states of
Illinois, Indiana and Iowa could be devastating to the crops as
they undergo the crucial pollination and flowering periods. Texas
and parts of the Southeast have been suffering for weeks under
drought conditions, but Midwestern crops have been largely spared.
	   Continued mild weather, or brief bursts of heat, could prove
beneficial following a spring of excessive rain and allow farmers
to meet government expectations for bumper corn and soybean
harvests.
	   With government and private forecasters changing their views
almost daily, prices have been extremely volatile. The National
Weather Service reported after trading had ended that temperatures
will be warmer than usual next week, a prediction again likely to
cause wide price swings.
	   The clear skies also was aiding active harvesting of the winter
wheat crop in the Plains states.
	   Wheat for December delivery retreated 3 cents to dlrs 3.00 1-4 a
bushel; December corn fell 7 cents to dlrs 2.52 1-2 a bushel;
December oats fell 4 cents to dlrs 1.34 1-4 a bushel; November
soybeans fell 9 1-4 cents to dlrs 6.07 1-2 a bushel.

Five American crews get off to good start at Henley Regatta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HENLEY ON THAMES, England (AP) _ Five American crews got off to
a good start Wednesday on the opening day of the five-day Henley
Royal Regatta.
	   The B crew from the New Hampshire-based Dresden Club _ the first
Americans in action at this year's regatta _ had a comfortable
four-length victory over English club Bradford-on-Avon in the
Wyfolds Cup for coxless fours.
	   The Americans established an early lead _ almost a length up in
the first minute _ and gradually drew away for a straightforward
win.
	   The victory was particularly pleasing for Dresden, having been
forced to take part in races last week to qualify for Henley.
	   The Dresden A crew looked set to join them in the second round
of the Wyfolds until poor steering caused them to hit the booms
that mark the limits of the course in their race against the
Tideway Scullers School from London
	   The Americans led the race until that point but could not
recover and were eliminated in a not-rowed out verdict.
	   St. Paul's School from Concord, New Hampshire, went ahead early
in their first-round race in the Princess Elizabeth Cup for
schoolboy eights against the Oundle School of England and cruised
home for an easy win.
	   In another American victory in this cup, St. Mary's Preparatory
School of Michigan beat Holy Cross School of Canada.
	   In the Temple Cup for student eights, Wesleyan University of
Massachusetts went down by 1 1/2 lengths to the University of Natal
from South Africa.
	   Also in the Temple Cup, Williams College beat Loughborough of
England and Dartmouth lost in the first round of Glasgow
University.
	   In the Britannia Challenge Cup for club coxed fours, Syracuse
University found the Irish crew from University College-Galway too
strong, going down by 1/2 length in a tight race. The Syracuse A
crew also lost to Sheffield United.
	   The only American winner in Britannia Cup was Jacksonville
(Florida) Episcopal, which beat Oratory School of London.

Williams loses temper, match against Novotna
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams staged her best
impression of John McEnroe, though McEnroe never cried on Centre
Court.
	   Venting her anger at calls in a vain effort to fight off defeat
against Jana Novotna at Wimbledon on Wednesday, Williams screamed
at the umpire, got into the face of one lineswoman and mocked
another with disingenuous applause.
	   ``I know it's out, SHE knows it's out, EVERYONE knows it's out.
But YOU don't know it's out,'' Williams raged at chair umpire Mike
Morrisey at one point.
	   The crowd roared in support of Williams, many fans shouting,
``OUT, OUT,'' and Williams stood on the sideline staring at the
expressionless lineswoman.
	   The tantrums led to tears twice, but Williams harnessed her
emotions each time to rally back from a break down and push Novotna
to a tiebreaker before succumbing, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``The crowd probably enjoyed my emotional outbursts,'' said
Williams, composed and unapologetic afterward. ``I guess someone
would turn the channel and suddenly see some girl screaming and
keep it there, I know I would. It probably brightened up someone's
day.''
	   It was the first time Williams, 18, had lost her temper so badly
in a match, and she doubted she would let it happen as often as
McEnroe did.
	   ``I don't think I would get that out of control,'' she said.
``But I think everybody enjoyed watching him go at it. They just
waited to see when he would go off. I don't think that's going to
be me. He would play through it and play great tennis. Not
everyone's able to do that.''
	   Williams did play better when she let loose her fury, though she
looked spent by the time she reached the tiebreaker and lost a
chance to renew her budding rivalry with defending champion Martina
Hingis in the semifinals.
	   Instead, it will be Novotna, a two-time finalist, going Thursday
against Hingis, a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 winner over French Open champion
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Hingis beat Novotna, her doubles partner,
in the final last year.
	   The other semifinal will pit Nathalie Tauziat _ a 6-3, 6-3
victor over No. 2 Lindsay Davenport _ against unseeded Natasha
Zvereva, who followed up her triumph over Steffi Graf with a 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 upset of No. 6 Monica Seles.
	   In the men's semifinals Friday, defending champion Pete Sampras,
who beat Mark Philippoussis 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, will go against
Tim Henman, who downed Australian Open champ Petr Korda, 6-3, 6-4,
6-2.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon titlist, overcame a swollen
knee to beat Davide Sanguinetti 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 and go to the
semifinals against two-time finalist Goran Ivanisevic, who beat Jan
Siemerink 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).
	   None of the quarterfinal matches on this chilly, breezy
afternoon packed the drama and turbulence of the Williams-Novotna
duel.
	   Williams came into this Wimbledon, only her second visit,
utterly convinced she could go from first-round loser last year to
champion this year. That conviction stayed with her throughout the
encounter against Novotna, and when she saw the match slipping away
with the aid of calls she felt were unfair, Williams reacted with
anger and tears.
	   ``You really have to be focused from the beginning to the end,
and I think she lost it a little bit there for a while,'' Novotna
said.
	   Williams led the first set 4-1 before Novotna charged back and
put pressure on at the net in a textbook example of how to play
grasscourt tennis. Williams' forays to the net produced mixed
results _ spectacular volleys on occasion, wild whacks other times.
	   In the second set, after being broken in the opening game,
Williams switched strategies and attacked on every opportunity,
even on second serves. That change revved up the tempo of the
match, put more pressure on Novotna, and created rapid-fire
exchanges with acrobatic leaps by both players.
	   But it was a series of calls that went against Williams that
most fired up her and the crowd. First there was Morrisey's
overrule of a set-point called wide on a forehand by Novotna at
40-30 on her serve at 6-5 in the first set. Williams let that go
without an argument, won the next point, but wound up losing the
game and set.
	   With Williams serving to start the second set, a lineswoman
signaled good on a groundstroke by Novotna that appeared long and
wide. Though Williams stayed with the ball and eventually won the
rally, she furiously charged over afterward to shout at Morrisey:
``That was SO far out.''
	   Getting no satisfaction there, Williams marched over to the
lineswoman, stood over her, inches from her face, and screamed at
her. When that confrontation ended, Williams went back to serve and
lost the game immediately on a Novotna volley.
	   The outburst and loss of game, followed by a hold by Novotna to
2-0, led Williams to launch herself fully into a serve-and-volley
style. She held at love with the help of two aces, broke Novotna by
scrambling madly all over the court, and held with a huge overhead
at 40-15 for a 3-2 lead. Then after Novotna held, Williams erupted
again when another shot by Novotna that appeared out was let go by
a lineswoman.
	   That's when Williams screamed at Morrisey and the lineswoman,
berating them for missing a call she claimed was obvious to
everyone. Television replays confirmed that Williams was right,
though that hardly justified her behavior.
	   After double faulting on the next point to go down 4-3, Williams
sank into her chair on the changeover and wept.
	   Once more the episode seemed to fire up Williams, who broke back
in the next game to tie the set 4-4.
	   Williams lost her temper again in the 11th game, standing
indignantly with her hands on her hips and complaining about a ball
that wasn't called long. When the next shot was called out,
Williams clapped her racket over her head, mocking the lineswoman.
	   All the histrionics, and the fierce pace of the match,
eventually took their toll on Williams, who played a weak
tiebreaker that included five unforced errors and cost her the
match.
	   Yet Williams had no regrets about the way she acted.
	   ``I have a firm belief that those balls were out and that those
linespeople should have called them out,'' she said. ``Of course,
you have to get through those things. ... I tried. I think it just
helped me play better.''

Private entrepreneurs blaze trails for China of tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CLARIFIES that some businesses run by women
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Yan Zheng and his team of financial analysts are
pioneers of Chinese capitalism, blazing trails for future
entrepreneurs.
	   Yan's 4-year-old firm sells advice to clients _ both companies
and private individuals _ who have taken the plunge and invested in
China's fledgling stock and commodities markets.
	   In a gloomy Chinese economy, with state-run companies mired in
debt and firing workers by the thousands, private business is a
bright spot.
	   In a gesture of support for private enterprise, President Bill
Clinton met Wednesday with several of China's young entrepreneurs
at Shanghai's new Stock Exchange building.
	   ``As these state-owned enterprises get closed, it will get
harder and harder to go through unless people like you are
providing jobs for these people,'' he told the group over lunch.
	   The president talked bowling with Chen Rong, chairman and
general manager of a bowling manufacturing company, Shanghai
Zhonglu Industry Co., and chickens with Liu Ding Zhao, chairman of
a chicken company, who said he wanted to open a store in the United
States so Clinton ``could get a taste of Chinese chicken.''
	   ``Sounds good to me,'' Clinton responded.
	   Entrepreneurs are finding niches neglected during decades of
central planning. As China becomes more integrated into the world
economy, building financial markets and information networks,
creative, flexible small businesses are moving ahead much faster
than stodgy state-run firms.
	   The environment for private business has improved in recent
years, reflecting a recognition by Chinese leaders that the sector
is an important engine of economic growth that can provide jobs for
workers laid off by state firms. Private businesses are listed on
Shanghai's Stock Exchange, the first and largest of China's two
exchanges.
	   Armed with a degree in international finance, Yan, 33, began his
career as a floor trader on the Shanghai Metals Exchange, which was
set up in 1992 as part of China's experiments with capitalist
markets.
	   In 1994, he and another floor trader formed Colub Consultants
Co.
	   Like many private companies, they were turned away when they
tried to borrow from state banks, which even today do most of their
lending to state firms.
	   ``Policies toward private enterprise were not that favorable,''
said Shen Haihua, a deputy director in the firm. ``There was no
encouragement.''
	   So like most Chinese entrepreneurs, Yan and his associates
borrowed from friends and family. They invested in the markets and
used the profits to finance their company.
	   The firm operates out of four rented rooms in a grimy hotel,
television screens constantly flashing market information. It
employs 10 people, plus an outside research team of economic
analysts and has 50 clients, including a few large state concerns.
The firm is looking for office space in Pudong, Shanghai's new
skyscraper-studded financial district.
	   Comfortably occupying a niche in a new industry, Yan is
satisfied that he can compete with state firms.
	   Many private businesses complain, however, that they suffer
discrimination at the hands of banks, courts and the bureaucracy.
They are lobbying the Chinese legislature to amend the constitution
to guarantee equal treatment and protect private property.
	   The manager of a Beijing discount mart, for example, said local
officials refused to approve imports of cosmetics and other popular
items, to prevent his store from competing against struggling state
retailers.
	   When China first began allowing private business, loosening the
rigid controls that wiped out thriving private enterprise after the
Communists took over in 1949, only a few dared to strike out on
their own.
	   Even now, the largest number of private entrepreneurs are
self-employed taxi drivers, hairdressers, restaurateurs, bike
menders and so on _ providing services that people lived without
during the days of central planning.

Belfast Assembly elects Protestant, Catholic leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW for AMs
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's embryonic
government elected a Protestant leader and Catholic deputy
Wednesday after decades-old enemies debated across the table for
the first time in history.
	   Belfast's new 108-member Assembly convened with a confrontation
looming between Protestant marchers and Catholic protesters. That
annual tribal showdown in the staunchly Protestant town of
Portadown threatens to tear apart Northern Ireland for the third
straight summer.
	   But after being jointly elected to the Assembly's top two posts
on a 61-27 vote, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble and
Social Democratic and Labor Party deputy leader Seamus Mallon
pledged to help try to defuse the crisis before Sunday's march.
	   Trimble, a champion of the right of Protestant Orangemen to
march past Catholic homes on Portadown's Garvaghy Road, and Mallon,
a veteran Catholic civil rights activist, shook hands to
enthusiastic applause from Assembly members _ except the bitter
camp of Protestants opposed to making the peace agreement work.
	   ``I know there'll be problems, but we can overcome them,'' said
Trimble, who during the preceding debate endured sustained heckling
from his Protestant critics led by Ian Paisley.
	   They accuse Trimble of promoting a peace agreement that will
include leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in government and
lead to Northern Ireland's eventual absorption into the Irish
Republic. Trimble insists that the April agreement will secure
Northern Ireland's union with Britain by making the state more
acceptable for its strong Catholic minority.
	   Paisley supporter Sammy Wilson accused Trimble, sitting about 20
yards (meters) away on the same massive U-shaped table, of telling
so many lies ``that had he been Pinocchio, he probably could have
poked me with his nose from where he's sitting.''
	   The chain-smoking, silver-haired Mallon, who led the SDLP
negotiating team, said the task of promoting harmonious government
in Northern Ireland ``frightens the life out of me but also gives
me hope for the future.''
	   Mallon said he sympathized with Trimble. ``He's got it rough,
very tough _ being hatcheted from every direction,'' he said.
	   ``We're going to try our almighty best to make sure that there
is no confrontation on the Garvaghy Road this year,'' he said
before going into his first private meeting with Trimble.
	   Sinn Fein abstained from the vote.
	   Party leader Gerry Adams explained that Sinn Fein ``would not be
doing Mr. Trimble any favors by voting for him, because others
within the unionist camp I'm sure would be only too pleased to beat
up on him on that issue.''
	   The debating featured the first-ever direct exchanges between
Adams and Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which withdrew from
the negotiations in 1997 once Sinn Fein gained admission.
	   Adams began speaking in Gaelic, a language virtually no
Protestants and few Catholics speak fluently. Grumbling and joking
among Paisley's followers swelled.
	   ``Can I have order for the speaker please?'' asked Lord
Alderdice, the Assembly's moderator.
	   ``If we could understand, we might have order!'' countered the
bombastic Paisley, who beamed at Adams. The Sinn Fein leader
responded _ in Gaelic _ that ``someone needs to put manners on Mr.
Paisley.''
	   Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, relished his
chance to poke fun at the anti-agreement Protestants, accusing them
of wanting ``to drag us back into the Dark Ages.'' They in turn
said ``IRA'' every time he said ``Sinn Fein.''
	   When McGuinness told one, top lawyer Bob McCartney, to ``be
smart,'' his target retorted: ``Well then don't be a gunman!''
	   The signs in Portadown, meanwhile, pointed to rising tensions.
British army helicopters conducted reconnaissance runs along
Garvaghy Road and the pastures surrounding Drumcree Anglican
church, the nearby focal point for the Orange march.
	   Convoys of troops poured into Portadown's Mahon barracks _
possible forces to deploy if Orangemen try to outflank police and
march through the Catholic area. That same threat fueled week-long
rioting across Northern Ireland in 1996.
	   A government-appointed commission on Monday banned the march
from Garvaghy Road, but Orange leaders have vowed to stand their
ground at police lines indefinitely until they get their way.

Popovic traded to Rangers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The Montreal Canadiens have traded defenseman
Peter Popovic to the New York Rangers for Sylvain Blouin and a
sixth-round pick in the 1999 entry draft.
	   The Canadiens may have been looking to make room in their salary
budget when they traded the 6-foot-6 (1.95-meter), 240-pound
(108-kilogram) Popovic, a stay-at-home defenseman who would likely
have cost them about dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Blouin, 24, had eight goals and 286 penalty minutes with
Hartford of the AHL last season. He played one game for the Rangers
and drew a major penalty.
	   The Montreal native has a chance to replace tough guy Mick
Vukota, who became an unrestricted free agent on Wednesday.
	   Popovic, 30, who had one goal and 13 assists last season, was
left unprotected in the expansion draft last week but was not
claimed by the Nashville Predators.
	   The Swedish blueliner, known as the Gentle Giant because of his
unaggressive nature, became redundant when the Canadiens acquired
Igor Ulanov from the Tampa Bay Lightning last season.
	   Popovic, who played for Sweden at the World Cup of Hockey in
1996, spent four seasons with the Canadiens, getting five goals and
42 assists.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has met
with Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's best-known political prisoner and
the presumed winner of presidential elections in 1993, diplomats
said Wednesday.
	   The meeting took place late Tuesday or Wednesday, said the
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   United Nations officials declined to comment on the meeting.
U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said only that Annan ``is doing his
utmost to persuade the government to release all political
detainees, including Chief Abiola.''
	   Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku also met with
Abiola on Wednesday for over an hour, the Commonwealth Secretariat
in London said in a statement. No further details were immediately
available.
	   The meetings came as the presidents of Sierra Leone and Liberia
were in Nigeria for a mini summit with Annan and the country's new
military leader.
	   It also came as Annan met with top officials in the government
and opposition and well-known business leaders.

 &UR; Williams loses temper, match against Novotna &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams staged her best
impression of John McEnroe, though McEnroe never cried on Centre
Court.
	   Venting her anger at calls in a vain effort to fight off defeat
against Jana Novotna at Wimbledon on Wednesday, Williams screamed
at the umpire, got into the face of one lineswoman and mocked
another with disingenuous applause.
	   ``I know it's out, SHE knows it's out, EVERYONE knows it's out.
But YOU don't know it's out,'' Williams raged at chair umpire Mike
Morrisey at one point.
	   The crowd roared in support of Williams, many fans shouting,
``OUT, OUT,'' and Williams stood on the sideline staring at the
expressionless lineswoman.
	   The tantrums led to tears twice, but Williams harnessed her
emotions each time to rally back from a break down and push Novotna
to a tiebreaker before succumbing, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``The crowd probably enjoyed my emotional outbursts,'' said
Williams, composed and unapologetic afterward. ``I guess someone
would turn the channel and suddenly see some girl screaming and
keep it there, I know I would. It probably brightened up someone's
day.''
	   It was the first time Williams, 18, had lost her temper so badly
in a match, and she doubted she would let it happen as often as
McEnroe did.
	   ``I don't think I would get that out of control,'' she said.
``But I think everybody enjoyed watching him go at it. They just
waited to see when he would go off. I don't think that's going to
be me. He would play through it and play great tennis. Not
everyone's able to do that.''
	   Williams did play better when she let loose her fury, though she
looked spent by the time she reached the tiebreaker and lost a
chance to renew her budding rivalry with defending champion Martina
Hingis in the semifinals.
	   Instead, it will be Novotna, a two-time finalist, going Thursday
against Hingis, a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 winner over French Open champion
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Hingis beat Novotna, her doubles partner,
in the final last year.
	   The other semifinal will pit Nathalie Tauziat _ a 6-3, 6-3
victor over No. 2 Lindsay Davenport _ against unseeded Natasha
Zvereva, who followed up her triumph over Steffi Graf with a 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 upset of No. 6 Monica Seles.
	   In the men's semifinals Friday, defending champion Pete Sampras,
who beat Mark Philippoussis 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, will go against
Tim Henman, who downed Australian Open champ Petr Korda, 6-3, 6-4,
6-2.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon titlist, overcame a swollen
knee to beat Davide Sanguinetti 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 and go to the
semifinals against two-time finalist Goran Ivanisevic, who beat Jan
Siemerink 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).
	   None of the quarterfinal matches on this chilly, breezy
afternoon packed the drama and turbulence of the Williams-Novotna
duel.
	   Williams came into this Wimbledon, only her second visit,
utterly convinced she could go from first-round loser last year to
champion this year. That conviction stayed with her throughout the
encounter against Novotna, and when she saw the match slipping away
with the aid of calls she felt were unfair, Williams reacted with
anger and tears.
	   ``You really have to be focused from the beginning to the end,
and I think she lost it a little bit there for a while,'' Novotna
said.
	   Williams led the first set 4-1 before Novotna charged back and
put pressure on at the net in a textbook example of how to play
grasscourt tennis. Williams' forays to the net produced mixed
results _ spectacular volleys on occasion, wild whacks other times.
	   In the second set, after being broken in the opening game,
Williams switched strategies and attacked on every opportunity,
even on second serves. That change revved up the tempo of the
match, put more pressure on Novotna, and created rapid-fire
exchanges with acrobatic leaps by both players.
	   But it was a series of calls that went against Williams that
most fired up her and the crowd. First there was Morrisey's
overrule of a set-point called wide on a forehand by Novotna at
40-30 on her serve at 6-5 in the first set. Williams let that go
without an argument, won the next point, but wound up losing the
game and set.
	   With Williams serving to start the second set, a lineswoman
signaled good on a groundstroke by Novotna that appeared long and
wide. Though Williams stayed with the ball and eventually won the
rally, she furiously charged over afterward to shout at Morrisey:
``That was SO far out.''
	   Getting no satisfaction there, Williams marched over to the
lineswoman, stood over her, inches from her face, and screamed at
her. When that confrontation ended, Williams went back to serve and
lost the game immediately on a Novotna volley.
	   The outburst and loss of game, followed by a hold by Novotna to
2-0, led Williams to launch herself fully into a serve-and-volley
style. She held at love with the help of two aces, broke Novotna by
scrambling madly all over the court, and held with a huge overhead
at 40-15 for a 3-2 lead. Then after Novotna held, Williams erupted
again when another shot by Novotna that appeared out was let go by
a lineswoman.
	   That's when Williams screamed at Morrisey and the lineswoman,
berating them for missing a call she claimed was obvious to
everyone. Television replays confirmed that Williams was right,
though that hardly justified her behavior.
	   After double faulting on the next point to go down 4-3, Williams
sank into her chair on the changeover and wept.
	   Once more the episode seemed to fire up Williams, who broke back
in the next game to tie the set 4-4.
	   Williams lost her temper again in the 11th game, standing
indignantly with her hands on her hips and complaining about a ball
that wasn't called long. When the next shot was called out,
Williams clapped her racket over her head, mocking the lineswoman.
	   All the histrionics, and the fierce pace of the match,
eventually took their toll on Williams, who played a weak
tiebreaker that included five unforced errors and cost her the
match.
	   Yet Williams had no regrets about the way she acted.
	   ``I have a firm belief that those balls were out and that those
linespeople should have called them out,'' she said. ``Of course,
you have to get through those things. ... I tried. I think it just
helped me play better.''

French journalist detained for reporting of politician's slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In a very rare case, a French journalist has been
placed in custody for his reporting of the February slaying of
France's top official on the island of Corsica, judicial officials
said Wednesday.
	   Gilles Millet, who works for France's left-leaning weekly
magazine L'Evenement du jeudi was detained by police on Tuesday
morning at his Paris home.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he would
spend Wednesday night in custody and be questioned on Thursday.
	   Millet was taken into custody at the request of French
anti-terrorism judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere.
	   He is being held for allegedly violating the secrecy of the
judicial investigation into the slaying of Claude Erignac, France's
top prefect on the Mediterranean island.
	   After detaining Millet, police seized documents relating to the
investigation.
	   Millet's lawyer, Francois Stefanaggi, on Wednesday called his
client's detention ``inappropriate and excessive,'' pointing out
that it was ``extraordinary'' for a reporter to be taken into
custody for work-related matters.
	   Erignac was shot in the head Feb. 6 while walking through a
crowded street in the city of Ajaccio.
	   A splinter group of Corsican nationalists has claimed
responsibility for the killing, but the assailants have not yet
been caught.

Pete nearly perfect in hard-hitting duel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The ball hung briefly above Pete
Sampras' head, and then he took one last swing and whacked another
ace: the perfect shot to cap a near-perfect performance.
	   The game's best server was in dominant form Wednesday,
overpowering hard-hitting Mark Philippoussis 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4 to
reach the semifinals at Wimbledon.
	   Sampras, seeking his fifth title in six years, won a remarkable
29 consecutive points when serving before a double-fault ended the
streak. He lost one point on his first serve in the entire match.
	   ``I don't think anyone will beat him,'' Philippoussis said.
``He's just too solid. He's dedicated out there, and he wants to
prove a point. When someone serves like that, they want to say
something.''
	   What Sampras wants to prove is that he's still the world's best
player, and his recent shotmaking suggests a long slump is over.
Friday's semifinal match will be his first in a Grand Slam since
winning Wimbledon last year.
	   He'll face Tim Henman, who is two victories away from becoming
the first Englishman to win Wimbledon since 1936. A partisan crowd
on Centre Court gave Henman a standing ovation after he swept aside
Petr Korda 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
	   ``It's probably the greatest result so far of my career,'' said
Henman, the first Briton to reach the men's semifinals since Roger
Taylor in 1973. ``But, you know, I don't want to stop now.''
	   In the other quarterfinals, two-time Wimbledon runnerup Goran
Ivanisevic won three tiebreakers to edge Jan Siemerink 7-6 (12-10),
7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6), and 1996 champion Richard Krajicek swept
Davide Sanguinetti 6-2, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Ivanisevic will be favored Friday because he has beaten Krajicek
eight consecutive times dating back to 1992.
	   Sampras has a streak going, too: He has yet to lose a set during
the fortnight, primarily because his serve has been broken just
twice in 76 games.
	   He dodged three break points early in the second set against
Philippoussis and then went on a roll, winning every serve at love
for six consecutive games.
	   Philippoussis struggled just to get his return in play. And even
when he managed that modest feat, Sampras was waiting at the net,
where he rarely flubbed a chance.
	   Toward the finish, Sampras delighted the Court 1 crowd with a
couple of leaping overhead slams, the only shot where he allows
himself to showboat.
	   ``I have no complaints about the way I'm playing,'' he said.
	   Philippoussis had an edge in aces, 14-10, but there's more to
serving than that, and Sampras deftly mixed pace and location
despite a swirling wind that hampered his service toss. Discounting
seven double faults, he won 72 of 80 points on his serve, including
39 of 40 on his first serve.
	   He won all of the most important points, too, hitting a pair of
clutch volleys and two service winners in the tiebreaker.
Philippoussis lost his serve twice, double-faulting on break point
each time.
	   ``He goes for the big second serves, and at times you're going
to pay the price,'' Sampras said.
	   ``At this level, as hard as we're hitting the ball on a court
that quick, it's going to come down to a couple of points. And I
got those today.''
	   Philippoussis shook a slump himself during the fortnight,
upsetting No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the first round and advancing
to his first quarterfinal since February. It was the best Grand
Slam showing yet by the 21-year-old Australian.
	   But against Sampras, the player nicknamed Scud was a dud.
	   ``If I gave him some advice, I would tell him to tone it down a
little bit,'' Sampras said. ``To be consistent and have good
results week in and week out, it's got to be really controlled
aggression.''
	   That makes sense. Philippoussis hits the ball hard enough to
break it, but he couldn't break Sampras.

Congolese opposition leader freed

restricted, comment from aide, no-comment from Tshisekedi, raises

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's foremost opposition leader was
freed from internal exile Wednesday and returned to Kinshasa,
government officials said.
	   No reason was immediately given for Etienne Tshisekedi's
release. However, Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji, who confirmed
the move, said restrictions on political activity remained in
place.
	   Tshisekedi _ who both served and opposed longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko at various times during Mobutu's rule _ will
continue his work in seeking a ``just system'' for Congo, said one
of his aides, Valentin Mubake. Tshisekedi has declined to comment
since his release.
	   Tshisekedi was arrested in February and banished to his home
village of Mupompa, about 700 kms (435 miles) west of the capital.
	   The arrest was to stop Tshisekedi's ``irresponsible and
dangerous'' activities, Kakudji said during a state television
broadcast shortly after the exile was ordered.
	   It was Tshisekedi's second arrest since President Larent Kabila
came to power in May 1997 following an eight-month rebellion in the
country formerly known as Zaire.
	   The opposition leader was also accused of defying Kabila's
decree that barred opposition political activities in Congo.
	   Tshisekedi met shortly before his arrest with Jesse Jackson, the
civil-rights leader and special U.S. envoy for Africa. The meeting
angered Kabila, who refused to meet with Jackson.
	   Tshisekedi's latest arrest also came not long after his party
distributed pamphlets calling for the release of imprisoned
colleagues.

the jet's other crew members _ Capt. William L. Raney, 26, of
Englewood, Colorado, and Capt. Chandler P. Seagraves, 28, of
Nineveh, Indiana _ to determine whether they should face
courts-martial. Last month, he held a second hearing for the pilot,
Capt. Richard Ashby, 30, of Mission Viejo, California, and the

Turkish contractors arrested in wake of buildings' collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Four contractors have been arrested on
charges relating to the collapse of five buildings during last
weekend's deadly earthquake, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Also, search teams found more bodies under the debris, bringing
to 144 the number of dead found after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake
rocked southern Turkey on Saturday, Anatolia reported.
	   State aid and private donations poured in for the reconstruction
of the several thousand buildings damaged in the quake. Turkish
immigrants in Germany gathered 8,600 German marks (about dlrs
4,800).
	   The total damage caused to the region has not been assessed yet.
	   In Ceyhan, most of the casualties came in the collapse of five
multi-story buildings.
	   The Anatolia said four contractors were arrested Wednesday on
charges of causing deaths with poor construction in relation to the
buildings' collapse. Each of them could receive a maximum five-year
prison term if tried and convicted.

U.S. missile struck near water treatment plant, Iraq says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UMM QASR, Iraq (AP) - The missile that a U.S. fighter shot at an
Iraqi radar site smashed into the the ground just a few meters
(yards) from the storage tanks of a water purification plant, Iraqi
officials said Wednesday.
	   At the water treatment plant outside the port city of Umm Qasr,
a long gray cylinder with black scorch marks and a burned-out motor
were the only remains of the missile.
	   Shards of glass from nearby buildings littered the area, but
there was no apparent damage to the plant's huge water tanks or the
nearby mesh of pipelines.
	   U.N. officers confirmed that a missile struck the area Tuesday,
but could not say if it was fired by a U.S. warplane. The area is
within the demilitarized zone with Kuwait that is monitored by U.N.
forces.
	   On the side of the cylinder were safety instructions in English
and a date of manufacture _ Oct. 13, 1996. There were, however, no
markings that identified the debris as a U.S. missile.
	   Iraqi and U.N. officers had, however, removed some of the debris
before reporters were brought to the site some five kilometers (3
miles) outside of Umm Qasr, an Iraqi port near the Kuwaiti border.
	   A crater about half-a-meter-deep (half-a-yard-deep) and
2-meters-long (2-yards-long) was cut into the surface about 15
meters (yards) from the tanks, which are large enough to hold tens
of thousands of gallons (liters) of water.
	   A U.S. F-16 fired a HARM anti-radiation missile at an Iraqi
anti-aircraft site on Tuesday after Iraqi radar targeted British
warplanes patrolling a no-fly zone in southern Iraq, U.S. officials
said.
	   Iraq has denied that its forces threatened the British
warplanes. The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zone
in 1991 to protect Shiite Muslims from reprisals by the Iraqi
government.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party called the
air attack ``a new blatant American aggression on Iraq's
sovereignty and territory.''
	   The nearest Iraqi anti-aircraft missile battery that reporters
saw was at least 18 kilometers (12 miles) away from the water
treatment plant.
	   Col. Riyadh Nasser, an Iraqi liaison officer to the U.N. force,
said the missile was fired by a U.S. aircraft.
	   ``This area is under U.N. mandate and America and its allies are
flouting U.N. rules,'' he said.
	   U.N. observers said that the firing of the missile was a
violation of the demilitarized zone.
	   Military aircraft are barred from flying over the zone, but the
missile may have been fired from outside the area.
	   The plant is about 8 kilometers (5 miles) inside the
Iraqi-Kuwait demilitarized zone, which is 15 kilometers wide.

Consumer group seeks stronger safety warning for Viagra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Many men may be taking Viagra to treat
impotence that was caused by other pills such as antidepressants
and blood pressure drugs, raising the question of whether some
could be cured simply by adjusting their prescriptions.
	   The U.S. consumer group making that point Wednesday also cited
174 reports of Viagra users suffering side effects, including 31
deaths, in petitioning the government to strengthen Viagra's safety
warnings.
	   The Food and Drug Administration remains convinced that Viagra
is safe when used by the right men, but said it will consider
Public Citizen's concerns.
	   The drug's label already warns doctors not to prescribe Viagra
to men who take nitrate-containing drugs such as the heart medicine
nitroglycerin, because the mix can kill _ and apparently has killed
a few men. The FDA also warns that the sudden sexual exertion may
be too risky for some heart patients.
	   Pfizer spokeswoman Mariann Caprino said, ``There are no new
trends that have emerged that would warrant a change in the
product's label.''
	   But Public Citizen discovered that manufacturer Pfizer Inc. had
refused to admit into clinical trials of Viagra any men with
certain heart-related conditions. Yet men with those same
conditions are allowed to take the drug today, and some have
suffered heart attacks or strokes.
	   That's a dangerous double-standard, the advocacy group charged.
It urged the FDA to immediately forbid Viagra's use by men with
those risk factors.
	   ``They designed studies to minimize the chance this drug would
have adverse events, and then they threw these people with high
risks back in the pool when the drug was approved,'' said Public
Citizen's Dr. Sidney Wolfe. ``FDA needs to get a significant amount
of blame for allowing'' that.
	   In addition, the FDA should warn doctors to check whether a
man's impotence is a side effect of one of more than 60 other drugs
known to cause sexual dysfunction before they prescribe Viagra, a
$10-a-pill therapy that can cause its own side effects, Wolfe said.
	   ``Most doctors are not even remotely aware of this long list of
drugs that can cause or worsen impotence,'' he said. ``It may be
possible to lower the dose or switch to something else. ... Those
things are worth trying with these stakes.''
	   But diagnosing drug-induced impotence can be difficult, and not
every man who does suffer it can switch medicines, warned FDA drug
chief Dr. Robert Temple.
	   As for Wolfe's other complaint, the FDA does not routinely
forbid people from using a new drug just because they have health
risks considered troublesome when the drug was undergoing testing,
Temple said.
	   However, some men with heart-related problems may not be good
candidates for Viagra, the FDA official cautioned. The FDA already
warns that for some men, having sex could be just as big a risk for
a heart attack as, say, shoveling snow because they're not up to
the exertion. The doctor must make an individual evaluation.
	   ``That's the question that's always been: Are these adverse
events really related to the drug or to a higher rate of activity
than the person's used to?'' Temple said.
	   Wolfe cited risk factors including: a heart attack or stroke in
the last six months, heart failure, unstable angina, an abnormal
electrocardiogram, certain arrhythmias or low blood pressure. Wolfe
also said Viagra can inhibit blood clotting and so men taking blood
thinners or who have ulcers or bleeding disorders should not take
it _ they, too, were considered too risky to participate in
Viagra's testing.
	   Wolfe analyzed 174 reports of side effects, including 31 deaths,
filed with the FDA since Viagra began selling three months ago.
There is no way to prove Viagra is to blame for the individual
cases, and the FDA says it sees no unexpected problems from the
drug so far.

Belfast Assembly elects Protestant, Catholic leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS first name for Lord Alderdice in graf 15
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's embryonic
government elected a Protestant leader and Catholic deputy
Wednesday after decades-old enemies debated across the table for
the first time in history.
	   Belfast's new 108-member Assembly convened with a confrontation
looming between Protestant marchers and Catholic protesters. That
annual tribal showdown in the staunchly Protestant town of
Portadown threatens to tear apart Northern Ireland for the third
straight summer.
	   But after being jointly elected to the Assembly's top two posts
on a 61-27 vote, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble and
Social Democratic and Labor Party deputy leader Seamus Mallon
pledged to help try to defuse the crisis before Sunday's march.
	   Trimble, a champion of the right of Protestant Orangemen to
march past Catholic homes on Portadown's Garvaghy Road, and Mallon,
a veteran Catholic civil rights activist, shook hands to
enthusiastic applause from Assembly members _ except the bitter
camp of Protestants opposed to making the peace agreement work.
	   ``I know there'll be problems, but we can overcome them,'' said
Trimble, who during the preceding debate endured sustained heckling
from his Protestant critics led by Ian Paisley.
	   They accuse Trimble of promoting a peace agreement that will
include leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in government and
lead to Northern Ireland's eventual absorption into the Irish
Republic. Trimble insists that the April agreement will secure
Northern Ireland's union with Britain by making the state more
acceptable for its strong Catholic minority.
	   Paisley supporter Sammy Wilson accused Trimble, sitting about 20
yards (meters) away on the same massive U-shaped table, of telling
so many lies ``that had he been Pinocchio, he probably could have
poked me with his nose from where he's sitting.''
	   The chain-smoking, silver-haired Mallon, who led the SDLP
negotiating team, said the task of promoting harmonious government
in Northern Ireland ``frightens the life out of me but also gives
me hope for the future.''
	   Mallon said he sympathized with Trimble. ``He's got it rough,
very tough _ being hatcheted from every direction,'' he said.
	   ``We're going to try our almighty best to make sure that there
is no confrontation on the Garvaghy Road this year,'' he said
before going into his first private meeting with Trimble.
	   Sinn Fein abstained from the vote.
	   Party leader Gerry Adams explained that Sinn Fein ``would not be
doing Mr. Trimble any favors by voting for him, because others
within the unionist camp I'm sure would be only too pleased to beat
up on him on that issue.''
	   The debating featured the first-ever direct exchanges between
Adams and Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which withdrew from
the negotiations in 1997 once Sinn Fein gained admission.
	   Adams began speaking in Gaelic, a language virtually no
Protestants and few Catholics speak fluently. Grumbling and joking
among Paisley's followers swelled.
	   ``Can I have order for the speaker please?'' asked John
Alderdice, the Assembly's moderator, who was made a member of
Britain's House of Lords in 1996.

	   Labor Party deputy leader Jerry Romain said he and two other
party leaders met June 8 with agriculture minister Michael Baptiste
to discuss a deal. Baptiste is a former Labor Party lawmaker who
switched to the New National Party.
	   Prime minister Keith Mitchell has hinted he might call early
elections before 2000, but he has denied any talks with the Labor
Party to strengthen his party's slim 8-7 majority in Parliament.
	   ``If Mitchell denies having discussions with the GULP, either he
does not know what's going on in his party or he is a liar,''
Romain said Monday. He said Baptiste had warned him to deny any
meetings to the press.
	   He said an alliance between the two parties looked unlikely.

Paradise can't escape China's environmental threat

	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ The flooding that wiped out farmer Xiong's
eggplants and melons last week was bad enough. But during a break
from replanting his ravaged field beside the Li River, he points to
exhaust spewing from a nearby power plant.
	   ``That's a really terrible problem,'' says Xiong, who blames the
smoke for the milky film on his irrigation ditch. It stunts his
crop, he says.
	   Even remote Guilin, whose main industry is showing tourists the
famed limestone buttes that have inspired Chinese painters for
centuries, is paying a price for years of official indifference to
the environment in pursuit of economic growth.
	   Now, Chinese leaders have begun to acknowledge the high cost of
pollution and to attack its causes. U.S. President Bill Clinton was
expected to highlight the fledgling efforts and possible U.S.
co-operation during a visit Thursday to this scenic corner of
Guangxi province.
	   China has 10 of the world's most-polluted cities, Smog is blamed
for tens of thousands of premature deaths a year. Acid rain has
damaged forests in areas stretching from the province of Yunnan in
the southwest to Heilongjiang in the northeast to as far away as
Japan.
	   Untreated sewage and factory waste taint the Yangtze, Pearl,
Huai and Yalu rivers. Pesticides are seeping into underground water
sources.
	   The grasslands of Inner Mongolia are depleted by overgrazing,
while the soils of the northwestern loess plateau are eroding.
	   In southern China, excessive farming and tree-cutting have left
hillsides unable to catch rain, turning annual summer showers into
deadly, expensive flooding.
	   China has begun ambitious programs to plant trees in vast green
belts to stop the expansion of deserts. But officials acknowledge
that even if the effort succeeds, it will be the middle of the next
century before the problem can be brought under control.
	   The sale of leaded gasoline has been banned in major cities.
	   In Guilin, home to some 600,000 people, the government has tried
to turn the tide by cleaning up the polluted Li River and
replanting hillsides, restoring a landscape that for many
foreigners is the main image of China.
	   Clinton may visit a nearby village that began last year to make
natural gas out of pig dung and rice husks in an attempt to
conserve firewood.
	   But Guilin also illustrates the challenges of environmental
protection in a densely populated country where many people are
still very poor.
	   Tax breaks and other incentives meant to develop the area are
attracting foreign investors. While most are in relatively clean
high-tech industries such as medical equipment and electronics,
prosperity could swell Guilin's population and increase pollution
from automobiles and power plants.
	   Rising incomes are driving a building boom, replacing mud-brick
houses with sprawling, multistory apartment complexes built on what
was farmland or forest. Trash chokes canals that feed into the Li
River.
	   Nature has set back some efforts.
	   After two weeks of nearly continuous rain, floodwaters of the Li
peaked some 15 feet (4.5 meters) above normal levels June 20,
ripping out stands of bamboo planted to anchor the river's banks.
Surviving stalks lean precariously at the edge of gaps left when
the river gouged out huge slabs of soil.
	   In preparation for Clinton's visit, the Chinese government says
it sent 5,000 soldiers to remove some 20,000 tons of mud and debris
from the streets of Guilin. There are few signs that a little more
than a week ago floodwaters lapped at the front doors of riverfront
luxury hotels.
	   Other problems promise to be more difficult.

Bomb attack smashes windows of Turkish military hotel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A concussion bomb shattered windows of a
military hotel in downtown Istanbul, the Anatolia news agency said
early Thursday. No injuries were reported.
	   The bomb, which was planted at the door of the hotel in Maltepe
district, went off late Wednesday.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   There have been similar attacks on military installations
recently. Leftist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, a
violent urban guerrilla group, had claimed responsibility for one
of those assaults.
	   Outlawed Kurdish and radical Islamic groups are also active in
the city.
	   The military has been fighting against Kurdish rebels in the
southeast for 14 years.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Security Council members worked Wednesday

Jury unlikely to receive Don King case until Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Closing arguments continued for a third day in
the insurance fraud trial of boxing promoter Don King on Wednesday,
with each side accusing the other of misinterpreting the evidence.
	   The slow pace of the arguments in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan increased likelihood that the jury would not receive the
case until Monday.
	   King has been on trial with his company, Don King Productions
Inc., for the last 10 weeks on charges that he cheated Lloyd's of
London out of dlrs 350,000 by submitting a fake contract for a 1991
bout that was canceled.
	   A 1995 trial on the same nine wire fraud charges ended in a hung
jury.
	   If convicted, King could face up to 45 years in prison.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A group whose aim is to slay young
gang members in Honduras has surfaced north of the capital, the
attorney general's office said Wednesday.
	   A group calling itself Comando Papa appeared in June in San
Pedro Sula, 130 miles (210 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa, the
capital. Prosecutors said in a statement the group was ``armed to
the teeth'' so it could ``eliminate all the criminals in Honduran
gangs.''
	   Since then, at least 10 teen-agers have been killed in isolated
parts of the city, all tortured, handcuffed and shot in the
forehead.
	   Death squads linked to the Honduran army were active in the
1980s as the military tried to prevent leftist movements in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala from spreading into the
country. Human rights groups have claimed that death squads
continue to exist, but are now targeting common criminals instead
of political activists.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The former head of a Mexican state
anti-kidnapping unit who was caught dumping the body of a tortured
prisoner in January faces new charges of kidnapping and torturing
another man.
	   The arrest of Armando Martinez Salgado, head of the
anti-kidnapping unit in the central state of Morelos, led to
revelations linking law enforcement officials to criminal gangs and
eventually forced the resignation of Morelos Gov. Jorge Carrillo
Olea.
	   Prosecutors announced Tuesday that Martinez Salgado, two former
agents of the anti-kidnapping squad, and a current agent have been
charged with kidnapping, robbery and criminal association charges
stemming from a 1996 abduction, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   They are accused of forcing Francisco Javier Alvarez Vargas from
his car, torturing him and trying to force him to confess to a
kidnapping, Notimex said.
	   On Wednesday, a top prosecutor accused Martinez Salgado of
having links to Daniel Arizmendi, the fugitive leader of a
kidnapping gang known for slashing the ears of its victims.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President Rafael Caldera has appointed
his son-in-law head of Venezuela's Army.
	   Gen. Ruben Rojas Perez assumed his post Wednesday during a
ceremony at the Defense Ministry headquarters. Rojas, 48, who
previously was head of Caldera's personal security team, is married
to one of the president's six children, Cecilia.
	   The promotion was approved by Congress on Tuesday.
	   Army officials had no public comment on the appointment, but
privately some called it favoritism.
	   Caldera, 82, previously appointed one of his sons, Andres, as
his chief of staff.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexican drug lord already imprisoned for
the torture-slaying of a U.S. drug agent has been ordered to serve
an additional 11+1/2 years, a report said Wednesday.
	   The 1st District Court in Mexico City ordered Ernesto Fonseca
Carrillo, 68, to serve the additional term for crimes against
health, a charge typically levied in drug cases, the daily El
Universal reported.
	   The new sentence brings Fonseca Carrillo's total term to more
than 30 years, it said.
	   Fonseca Carrillo, jailed in the maximum-security Almoloya de
Juarez prison in Mexico state, was found guilty of harvesting,
transporting and selling marijuana destined for the United States.
	   The drug lord was arrested in 1985 in the Pacific resort of
Puerto Vallarta, accused in the kidnapping, torture and killing of
Enrique Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alex Gonzalez hit a go-ahead, three-run homer in
an eight-run eighth inning as the Toronto Blue Jays had their
biggest offensive day of the season, beating the New York Mets
15-10 Wednesday on Canada Day.
	   Toronto, which won for the eighth time in 10 games, scored its
most runs since July 13, 1996, when it beat Milwaukee 15-7. The
eight-run inning tied the club record set at Minnesota in a 14-8
win on May 28, 1986.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo homered twice for the Mets.
	   Toronto wore special uniforms (vests with the word ``Canada'' on
the back and red T-shirts underneath) and red caps to commemorate
the holiday, and the Blue Jays continued their hot play.
	   With Toronto trailing 8-7 in the eighth, Felipe Crespo and Ed
Sprague hit consecutive singles off Mel Rojas (3-2) and Gonzalez
hit a three-run homer for a 10-8 lead.
	   Dan Plesac (3-2) got two outs for the win. Blue Jays starter
Woody Williams tied a career high with nine strikeouts, but gave up
six runs and eight hits in five innings.
 &UR; Padres 8, Athletics 4
	   In Oakland, California, Greg Vaughn hit his 28th homer, a
controversial three-run shot, and Kevin Brown got his 10th win.
	   Quilvio Veras added a two-run single and Tony Gwynn, Ken
Caminiti and Jim Leyritz all had RBI singles for the Padres.
	   Vaughn, named an NL All-Star reserve before the game, only got
credit for his fourth-inning homer after an appeal to the umpires _
who first ruled the ball had hit the center-field wall and was in
play.
	   Vaughn, who ended up at third, and the Padres argued it had
bounced off a camera booth beyond the wall, and the umpires
eventually agreed.
	   Brown (10-3) allowed one run on four hits in seven innings for
his fifth straight win.
	   A's starter Blake Stein (3-5) took the loss.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Diamondbacks 4
	   In Chicago, rookie Kerry Wood, left off the National League
All-Star team, struck out 13 in eight innings to lead the Cubs over
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Wood (8-3), backed by fans who hung ``K's'' around Wrigley Field
for each strikeout, improved to 6-0 in eight starts at home. He
gave up a one-out single in the third, a leadoff single in the
fourth and a leadoff triple in the seventh.
	   Wood, who turned 21 on June 16, now has 139 strikeouts in 93 1-3
innings. Despite tying a record with 20 strikeouts in a nine-inning
game this season, Wood was not among the reserves named Wednesday
by Florida manager Jim Leyland.
	   Sammy Sosa, who hit a record 20 home runs in June and made his
second All-Star team as a reserve, began July with a pair of RBI
doubles for the Cubs.
	   Mark Grace also drove in two runs and Mickey Morandini had three
hits and scored three runs for Chicago, which won for only the
second time in its last 10 games.
	   Two Chicago errors helped Arizona close to 6-4 in the ninth. But
Rod Beck got rookie Travis Lee to ground out with the bases loaded
for his 19th save.

A happy homecoming for Nause
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Martha Nause took the long way home.
	   Nause, 43, grew up in Sheboygan, just a few miles away from
Blackwolf Run Golf Course, site of the 53rd U.S. Women's Open which
begins Thursday.
	   But she didn't qualify for her homecoming the way she wanted.
After shoulder surgery in October, Nause's game was off. A month
ago, she was ranked 189th _ dead last _ on the LPGA money list with
dlrs 528.
	   Instead of earning a spot in the Open by playing her way into
the top 35, Nause had to fly to Portland, Oregon for an 18-hole
sectional qualifier on June 15.
	   Thirty-four players were vying for two spots, and Nause's 72 was
good enough to earn one of them.
	   ``I had been looking forward to this week for three, four years.
So, to put it all on one day was extremely nerve-wracking,'' Nause
said Wednesday. ``And it was one of the hardest rounds I have ever
played.
	   ``I was told there was probably only one spot available at that
qualifying spot and I was playing with somebody who was beating
me,'' Nause said. ``I was already behind the 8-ball. Turns out
there was two spots available, but I didn't realize that until I
was done.
	   ``I used every bit of my 20 years of experience to get through
it.''
	   With a homecoming secure, Nause finally could relax. Or could
she?
	   ``I am exhausted, actually,'' she said. ``I think I have been
running on adrenaline all week. I have not been sleeping well,
mostly because of a cold.''
	   Nause, who lives in Minneapolis, still considers Sheboygan home.
She learned to play golf at Pine Hills Country Club, where she
returns every August to play host to the Martha Nause Pro-Am
Charities Classic.
	   She's enjoying her status as a local favorite.
	   ``It has been overwhelming to me, really, the number of people
that have on every hole all around the golf course wished me well
and asked for autographs and said they were pulling for me and how
excited they were that I was here,'' Nause said. ``It is really
more overwhelming than I have dreamed it would be.''

Cuban swimmers missing in Puerto Rico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Two Cuban athletes took their
clothes, a few belongings and dlrs 100 from their coach's wallet,
then disappeared into the night while on a training trip in Puerto
Rico, an official said Wednesday.
	   Nubis Rosales and Daimara Munoz, both gold-medal winners in
swimming in the 1993 Central American and Caribbean Games,
disappeared from a Vega Baja home Tuesday night, said Jose Aviles,
vice president of the Puerto Rican Swimming Federation. Forty-three
Cubans defected during that 1993 competition.
	   Vega Baja is about 20 miles west of San Juan on the north coast
of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.
	   Police and immigration officials were looking for the athletes,
Aviles said.
	   He said the two women, both in their early 20s, were
participating in an exchange program for athletes and were training
for the Central American and Caribbean Games to be held in August
in Venezuela.
	   Their coach, Jose Vazquez, reported them missing.
	   ``He's very upset, not because they had gone, but because
there's a certain trust, and he feels that trust was broken,''
Aviles said.

Martin set to drive at Greater Hartford Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CROMWELL, Connecticut (AP) _ Casey Martin likes this course so
much he's using a sponsor's exemption for the first time to play in
a PGA Tour event.
	   Competing in his first tournament since the U.S. Open, Martin
will drive his cart around the wide fairways of TPC at River
Highlands.
	   ``It's not like a 2-iron-off-the-tee kind of course,'' Martin
said as he prepared for Thursday's start of the Canon Greater
Hartford Open. ``You just take your driver every hole and hit it as
far as you can. And not that I'm the greatest at that, but that's
the way I enjoy playing.''
	   At every PGA Tour event, players with tour cards are entitled to
enter. There are standards by which other players qualify. In
addition, the tournament sponsor can extend invitations. In this
case, Martin received one of five sponsor exemptions.
	   Martin, who has a birth defect that weakens his right leg, is
ranked 17th on the Nike Tour money list, with a victory in his
first event. He earned an additional dlrs 34,043 when he tied for
23rd at the U.S. Open two weeks ago.
	   But as much as Martin will enjoy driving on the par-70 course,
the spotlight will be on his other driving.
	   A magistrate ruled in February that Martin can use his cart on
PGA Tour events. The ruling thrust him onto a stage that has little
to do with his game.
	   ``In a sense I'd love to just kind of curtail this (attention)
and just go play golf and be one of the guys,'' Martin said. ``But
I understand why it's not happening. Ideally, over time, this would
fade and I'm sure it will.''
	   Stewart Cink, the defending champion, is back at the site of his
only tour victory.
	   Cink, who won dlrs 809,000 on the tour last year, is a former
Nike player of the year. He was a rookie when he rallied last year
to win this event, tying the GHO record at 13-under.
	   This year, he ranks 34th in earnings with nearly dlrs 500,000,
but he has yet to win. His best finish was a tie for fourth at the
Doral-Ryder Open.
	   ``I've made most cuts, but haven't really putted the way I want
to,'' he said Wednesday.
	   This time his challengers range from the tour's top money
winner, David Duval, to Martin, whose major victory this year came
in a courtroom.
	   But Martin is the showpiece. And even on vacation the spotlight
follows him.
	   While on a family outing at Disneyland after the U.S. Open,
Martin caught the attention of a few characters, including Mary
Poppins. His family figured at that point he had arrived.
	   ``My brother said you know you're somebody when the Disneyland
characters recognize you,'' he said.

Childish letters, a quiet lake: Diana museum opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ In a school report, a math
teacher writes, ``I fear numbers mean little to Diana.'' Nearby
stands a school trunk labeled D. Spencer and a pair of small,
well-worn tap shoes _ mementoes of a little girl who grew up to be
Princess Diana.
	   Some 2,500 people queued for more than an hour to see such
relics Wednesday, what would have been Diana's 37th birthday and
the opening day of a 3 million pound (dlrs 5 million) memorial
museum at her ancestral home, Althorp House.
	   For many, the only place to be was the small, ornamental lake
where Diana lies buried on an island, a bucolic, tree-ringed spot.
Mourners laid armfuls of her favorite lilies and white roses at a
small temple at one end of the lake, the nearest they could get to
her gravesite.
	   But some visitors worried that the world's most photographed
woman, killed in an Aug. 31 car crash fleeing the paparazzi in
Paris, continues to be exploited.
	   ``Even in death, she has not got peace,'' said Isabel Don,
crying quietly as she surveyed the stream of passing visitors and
helicopters overhead carrying TV crews. ``People will always want
more of her.''
	   Demand was heavy for the limited number of tickets, called
``invitations to visit.'' Soon after the gates opened at 10 a.m.
(0900 GMT), lines began to form outside the 1730s former stable
block where many of Diana's belongings are housed.
	   Charles, the 9th Earl Spencer, who has been accused of trying to
cash in on his sister's memory, spent much of the day mingling with
visitors, listening to endless stories about ``the day I met
Diana'' and posing for photographs. Every so often, he murmured to
a visitor, ``I hope you find this appropriate.''
	   Many in the crowd were members of the press, who had to buy
tickets the normal way, through a telephone sales line. Among them
was Arthur Edwards, a photographer for Britain's mass-selling Sun
tabloid, who photographed Diana throughout her royal life.
	   Even such hardened veterans were moved by the display of
personal items and the serene lake.
	   ``I miss her,'' Edwards said as he paused to study the giant
stone urn the earl erected on the island. ``She was so lively, so
down to earth. I have photographed her on so many birthdays, and
this year we are here. ... I still can't believe it.''
	   Diana's sons planned no public appearances on her birthday, and
it was unclear how they marked it. Prince William, 16, was on
holiday from Eton College and Prince Harry, 13, was still at
Ludgrove School. Diana's former husband, Prince Charles, had a full
schedule of official engagements, but made no public comments.
	   Earl Spencer has also opened Althorp House, with its collection
of family portraits and valuable paintings, through Aug. 30.
	   Nearly 150,000 tickets have been sold at prices ranging from 5
pounds (dlrs 8.30) for children to 7.50 pounds (dlrs 12.45) for
senior citizens and 9.50 pounds (dlrs 15.75) for adults.
	   Items on display include Diana's frothy silk wedding dress by
David and Elizabeth Emanuel, and the thousands of condolence books
signed around the world after her death.
	   Jewelry on hand includes Diana's necklaces, tiaras and a crown.
In one room, mannequins are dressed in some of the outfits she wore
at public functions, together with pictures of her wearing them.
	   Visitors also see Diana's school uniform and touching home movie
footage of her with her brother and two sisters at Althorp. It
includes shots of Diana on a camel at a birthday party and dancing
coquettishly as she waves a bright red scarf.
	   Other video exhibits illustrate her humanitarian work and the
public reaction to her death. The first draft of Earl Spencer's
funeral speech is also displayed.
	   Visitor facilities at Althorp include a restaurant and a shop
selling a range of souvenirs associated with Diana, including mugs,
pens and key rings with excerpts from the earl's speech. Prices
range from 5 pounds (dlrs 8.30) for an address book bearing an
image of a white rose to 70 pounds (dlrs 115) for a crystal tumbler
with the Spencer crest.
	   The earl has said the profits from the museum will go to Diana's
favorite charities, but has not said what share of the revenues he
will use to defray his expenses. He also has said he expects to
open the estate to visitors every summer.
	   He has said he does not expect the venture to make a profit
immediately because of the start-up costs involved, but that he
will give a minimum of 10 percent of ticket sales this year to
charity out of his own pocket.
	   ``We hope that we will be making a profit for the memorial fund
in the second year and the third year an on. I am producing audited
accounts at the end of this year to show exactly how much has been
spent and where it has gone,'' he said in a recent television
interview. ``I will never profit from Diana's death.''
	   Some ticket-holders came Wednesday not knowing what to expect,
only to find the sight of Diana's personal effects almost too much
to bear.
	   ``I was sobbing at the end,'' said Nancy Emeny, who drove about
two hours from Solihull with her husband. ``I had doubts about her
being buried on the island, but it had a very peaceful feeling. The
earl has done a great job.''

Prime minister wins support for Aboriginal land rights deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Aborigines now condemning deal &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard struck a
deal with a key senator Wednesday to adopt a long-delayed
Aboriginal land rights law, winning tempered praise from farmers
and miners but the ire of Aborigines.
	   By reaching the compromise, Howard avoids having to dissolve
Parliament and call an early election to resolve the problem while
the polls show his popularity at an all-time low, at 34 percent.
	   The bill limits claims by Aborigines on access to the vast
tracts of lands that the government leases to ranchers, farmers and
miners _ some 42 percent of Australia's land mass.
	   Aboriginal access mainly consists of the right to cross the land
to hunt or seek water, to visit sacred sites, or to hold clan
gatherings.
	   The ranchers, farmers and miners say they can't manage their
businesses properly if the land is subject to Aboriginal access
claims.
	   Howard reached a final compromise Wednesday with independent
Sen. Brian Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the
narrowly divided Senate.
	   The key element of the compromise was that Aborigines lost a
federal right to negotiate land claims, but gained an equivalent
right under state laws that already gave farmers, ranchers and
miners a similar right.
	   After initially accepting the change, Aboriginal representatives
said Aborigines' rights under the deal were less than farmers,
ranchers and miners and called the deal a national tragedy.
	   ``The only losers in this compromise are indigenous people,''
said Aboriginal activist Geoff Clark.
	   The government also dropped its demand that land claims be
phased out after six years.
	   Under the compromise, Aboriginal land holders and claimants will
have the right to be notified of proposed mining on their land and
to object to it.
	   Mining companies also would be required to consult with
Aborigines about ways of minimizing the impact of their operations.
	   There will be provision for mediation in case of disputes, and
matters can be arbitrated, where mediation fails.
	   Harradine was jubilant about the result: ``This outcome avoids a
race-based ... election which, I believe, would have posed a
serious threat to the fabric of Australian society.''
	   Australia's ranchers called the outcome the best they could hope
for.
	   ``Australia's farmers have accepted that the agreement on native
title reached between the federal government and Sen. Harradine is
the option of least risk for pastoral leaseholders,'' said the
acting president of the National Farmers Federation, Wayne Cornish.
	   Minerals Council of Australia executive director Dick Wells
said, ``The amended act will allow the industry to get on with its
business in a way which respects the rights of others and continues
to generate wealth and jobs for all Australians.''
	   Western Australia and the Northern Territory had threatened to
oppose the deal, but were brought into line when guaranteed that
the federal government would compensate them for 75 percent of the
value of any lands they lose in the future under the new law.
	   Howard had been threatening to call an election on the issue
since Harradine blocked passage of the legislation in April, and
set July 4 as a deadline for the law to be passed.
	   The next election must be held by May 1999, but some analysts
said an August poll was likely if it was called early.
	   Compromise talks between Harradine and Howard were reopened
after the surprising success of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
in Queensland state elections June 13.
	   One Nation, which opposes special welfare payments to Aborigines
and Asian immigration, took 11 seats in the 89-member state
Parliament.
	   One Nation wants to abolish native title.
	   The government introduced the so-called 10-point native title
plan to spell out the exact extent of a 1996 High Court ruling
recognizing Aborigines' right to lay non-exclusive claim to
government-held land leased to farmers and miners.

Marlins to reunite at All-Star game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Marlins and their manager are getting back
together at the All-Star game.
	   Five members of Florida's 1997 World Series championship team,
all traded away in an off-season payroll purge, were picked as
National League reserves Wednesday for next week's game at Coors
Field in Denver.
	   Florida manager Jim Leyland picked Moises Alou (Astros), Kevin
Brown (Padres), Robb Nen (Giants), Gary Sheffield (Dodgers) and
Devon White (Diamondbacks). They'll join Edgar Renteria, the lone
representative from this year's club.
	   Meanwhile, the New York Yankees, snubbed by fans in the
starter's vote, had five players picked as AL reserves by Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove. However, 11-game winner David Cone and
Hideki Irabu, the AL's ERA leader, were both left off as were
Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, Chicago's Frank Thomas and Texas' Rick
Helling (11 wins).
	   Leyland overlooked Cubs rookie phenom Kerry Wood, who tied a
record this season with 20 strikeouts in a nine-inning game and had
13 in eight innings during Wednesday's 6-4 win over Arizona.
	   Among other notable names missing from the National League
roster are Philadelphia's Scott Rolen and Brian Jordan of St.
Louis.
	   The Cubs will be represented by Sammy Sosa, who finished sixth
among NL outfielders in the fan vote despite having 33 homers.
	   David Wells, whose perfect game on May 17 is this season's top
moment, was among the Yankees chosen to represent the team with
baseball's best record. Shortstop Derek Jeter, third baseman Scott
Brosius and outfielders Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill were also
selected.
	   Hargrove also has five of his players with pitcher Bartolo
Colon, catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. and shortstop Omar Vizquel joining
first baseman Jim Thome and outfielder Kenny Lofton, both were
elected as starters.
	   Vizquel, who has won five straight Gold Gloves, is one of 14 AL
players who'll play in their first All-Star game.
	   Four Atlanta Braves were picked as reserves, giving them the
most All-Stars with six. Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux were selected
for the pitching staff, Javy Lopez will be a backup catcher and
Andres Galarraga will be a backup first baseman. Walt Weiss was
elected to start at shortstop and Chipper Jones was voted the
starter at third.
	   San Diego will have five players on the team, including pitchers
Andy Ashby, Kevin Brown and Trevor Hoffman. Greg Vaughn was
selected as a backup outfielder and Tony Gwynn was voted to start.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ While officials toasted and congratulated one
another on Hong Kong's first year under Chinese rule, a small group
of protesters marked the anniversary with a colorful rally through
Hong Kong's downtown streets.
	   Wearing yellow arm bands which they said symbolized peace, the
activists said there was no reason to celebrate.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the populist Frontier movement, who will
take her place in a new legislature Thursday, said, ``Both the
political and economic situations are looking quite dismal.''
	   Most people in Hong Kong give China high marks for keeping its
hands off the former British colony since it regained sovereignty a
year ago. But Lau said government officials have made no promises
to speed up democratic reforms, and they have ``no coherent
policies'' to lift Hong Kong out of its economic troubles.
	   The 150 protesters included students, politicians, and labor and
women's rights activists. Some wore T-shirts with sayings such as:
``To resist is to win.''
	   ``Everyone has the right to work. I have the right to protest,''
they chanted in the 5-kilometer (three-mile) march. Some beat
tribal drums and sang songs declaring their rights.
	   Another small protest outside an official banquet in the evening
ended with scuffles with police.
	   A government statement said a police officer was slightly
injured in the incident, and that a protester was briefly detained
by police for trying to break through a police cordon.
	   The protesters, including members of the radical April 5 Action
Group and the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's main opposition party,
called for the resignation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and a
reassessment of the 1989 Chinese military crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
	   The protesters carried a dummy coffin to honor those killed by
Chinese soldiers on June 4, 1989. A banner on it said: ``People's
heroes shall be immortal.''
	   They set the coffin on fire after several unsuccessful attempts
to lift it over a police cordon.
	   Last year, nearly 3,000 people rallied hours after the change of
sovereignty, which activists said was the first test of the
government's tolerance of dissenting views. Despite some
restrictions on protests, civil liberties generally are intact a
year later.
	   ``There haven't been any major changes'' in civil rights, said
36-year-old Winnie Lai, dressed in military-style pants and smoking
a rolled cigarette under the scorching sun.
	   ``But it's important for us to stand up and declare our rights''
before authorities take them away, said Lai, a translator.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's embryonic
government elected a Protestant leader and Catholic deputy
Wednesday after decades-old enemies debated across the table for
the first time in history. Belfast's new 108-member Assembly
convened with a confrontation looming between Protestant marchers
and Catholic protesters. That annual tribal showdown in the
staunchly Protestant town of Portadown threatens to tear apart
Northern Ireland for the third straight summer. But after being
jointly elected to the Assembly's top two posts on a 61-27 vote,
Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble and Social Democratic
and Labor Party deputy leader Seamus Mallon pledged to try to
defuse the crisis before Sunday's march. (NORTHERN IRELAND).
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton is delivering an
environmental warning as he leaves the gleaming skyscrapers of
Shanghai for the fabled limestone mountains of Guilin: China soon
will have the ``unfortunate distinction'' of replacing the United
States as the world's No. 1 producer of greenhouse gases. But
Clinton also pledged U.S. support for China's efforts to clean up
its environment. He said Wednesday that a major legacy of his visit
will be U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the environment _ something
that ``ten years from now people will look back and say that's one
of the biggest things they did.'' In a speech to American business
leaders, Clinton urged China to clean up corruption, open trade
markets and combat the environmental catastrophe hanging over the
world's most populous country. (CLINTON-CHINA).
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Machine-gun fire and
rocket-propelled grenades tore through Guinea-Bissau's capital on
Wednesday, one day after peace talks were canceled amid fierce
fighting between government soldiers and renegade troops. Intense
gunfire also continued in nearby Mansoa, where soldiers were
fighting for control of the strategic town. At least three
civilians have been killed since Wednesday night, all apparently by
shrapnel, and twelve injured. Hundreds of people were fleeing the
fighting. In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, military officials from the
Economic Community of West African States met Wednesday to discuss
whether to send peacekeepers to help bring an end to the fighting
in this former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip. Besieged
President Joao Bernardo Vieira has said he will accept help from
the group's peacekeeping wing. (GUINEA-BISSAU).
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Pakistani nuclear scientist said Wednesday
that he fled to the United States and agreed to detail his
country's nuclear program because he is concerned Pakistan might be
considering a strike against rival India. Iftikhar Chaudhry Khan,
29, is prepared to describe Pakistan's nuclear program to U.S.
officials, including assistance it allegedly has received from
China and Iran. In an Associated Press interview, Khan said he
fears for his life and for the potential victims of any nuclear
war. ``The whole Islamic world will oppose me. They believe
Pakistan has made a tremendous development,'' said Khan. ``I want
the U.S. government to use its sources to stop these type of
activities.'' Khan arrived in New York on May 22, saying he feared
for his life and requesting protection. He is applying for
political asylum. (US-PAKISTANI DEFECTOR).
	   RIACE, Italy (AP) _ More than 300 Kurds and North Africans
landed Wednesday in Italy in the latest wave of would-be immigrants
trying to reach Europe. A young Tunisian man drowned off the coast
of Sicily, apparently after falling off a small boat, state
television reported. With warm temperatures and calm waters,
would-be immigrants have been arriving nearly every day on Italy's
long coastlines. But most of them are swiftly expelled under tough
immigration laws passed under pressure from Italy's European
allies. The Italian Foreign Ministry said it called in the
ambassadors of Tunisia and Morocco to express the government's
concern over the landings and asked that the two countries tighten
their borders. (ITALY-IMMIGRANTS).

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rallied into the close Wednesday, pushing
the Dow Jones industrial average to its first finish above 9,000 in
three weeks. The Dow rose 96.65 points to 9,048.67 after nearly
faltering for the fifth straight session in a bid to hold above
9,000. The barometer of 30 big companies has risen in six of the
past seven sessions, gaining 337 points, and now sits just 163
points from May 13's record close of 9,211.84. The Dow's last
finish above 9,000 was on June 9. Broad-market indicators also
rallied over the final hour after posting modest gains for most of
the day. The Standard -and- Poor's 500 closed at a new high for the
fourth time in six sessions, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq
closed in on its first record in more than two months. The market
opened strong amid news reports saying Japan's leaders are set to
propose sweeping tax cuts to stimulate the sputtering Japanese
economy. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With signs emerging that U.S. economic growth
finally is slowing down, the Federal Reserve left short-term
interest rates unchanged on Wednesday. The Fed's monetary policy
panel _ the Federal Open Market Committee _ concluded a two-day
private meeting, signaling it had left the benchmark rate on
overnight loans between banks unchanged at 5.5 percent. It's been
at that level since a quarter of a percentage point increase in
March 1997. The decision was widely anticipated and financial
markets showed little reaction. Raising U.S. rates would have
risked destabilizing already-rocky Asian financial markets by
giving investors another reason to transfer their money to the
United States. Plus, the American economy appears to be slowing on
its own from growth rates that could generate inflation pressures
if they persisted. And consumer price inflation, running at a 1.5
percent annual rate during the first five months of the year,
appears well-contained. (US-FED-INTEREST RATES)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister beseeched parliament
Wednesday to approve the Kremlin's economic rescue plan, warning
that the economy has lost much of the little ground it gained and
is again on the skids. But lawmakers in the opposition-dominated
parliament made clear they do not trust President Boris Yeltsin and
would not rubber-stamp his administration's proposals. ``This
government's course is bankrupt,'' said Communist Party chief
Gennady Zyuganov, head of parliament's largest faction. ``We must
either change it or the end is very close.'' Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko laid out the economy's troubles in stark terms. Gross
domestic product has declined 0.2 percent in the first five months
of this year, he said, eroding the modest 0.8 percent gain the
economy posted last year _ the first since the Soviet collapse. He
urged lawmakers to swiftly pass 26 bills the administration has
compiled to trim spending, increase revenue and win a new loan of
at least dlrs 10 billion from the International Monetary Fund.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. is paying dearly for a
longstanding culture of distrust between company managers and
leaders of the United Auto Workers union. Two UAW strikes _ the
latest of 13 walkouts since 1996 _ have slowed GM's North American
production to a trickle and idled nearly 172,000 workers. The cost
of lost production: dlrs 1.18 billion and growing. Talks continued
Wednesday at two parts plants in Flint with no sign of a
settlement. Some analysts expect the strikes to continue into
August or September. Once a deal is reached, the UAW may strike
again elsewhere if GM fails to resolve several local contract
disputes. Labor experts and industry observers say that for GM to
reach its goal of becoming leaner and more globally competitive, it
needs to make fundamental changes to the way it deals with the UAW
_ soon. (US-GM STRIKE)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma ordered
his Cabinet to swiftly prepare and approve measures to stop the
country's economic decline and avert a looming financial crisis,
his spokesman said Wednesday. The orders are part of Kuchma's
campaign to stabilize the economic situation in Ukraine, said the
spokesman, Oleksandr Maydannyk. Ukraine's economy has deteriorated
recently due to the government's inability to collect planned
budget revenues and the need to repay billions of dollars in
redemption for domestic bonds. Investors have stayed away from
Ukraine because of its stalled reforms and the recent crisis in
other developing markets. Maydannyk said Kuchma's measures were
mainly aimed at reducing tax rates, introducing tax breaks for
large foreign investors, decreasing the amount of foreign borrowing
and attracting more investments from abroad. (UKRAINE-ECONOMY)

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ Novelist Fay Weldon says a magazine misinterpreted
her comment that rape ``isn't the worst thing that can happen to a
woman.''
	   ``I did say those words,'' Weldon said Tuesday. ``But what I
said next wasn't quoted: That rape's not the worst thing that can
happen to a woman _ death is.''
	   Radio Times reported in this week's issue that the author of
``The Lives and Loves of a She Devil'' and ``The Hearts and Lives
of Men'' called for the criminal charge of rape to be changed to
aggravated assault and asked society to stop ``glamorizing'' rape.
	   In the magazine, Ms. Weldon said she was drawing her conclusions
from firsthand experience when a male friend tried to rape her in
the back of a taxi.
	   ``It was nasty, but didn't shatter my view of men. ... Now, it's
unfashionable to say this, but rape isn't the worst thing that can
happen to a woman if you're safe, alive and unmarked afterwards,''
she was quoted as saying.
	   Radio Times said Ms. Weldon ``confirmed in writing the words
that were reported.''

	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ A former employee and friend of Joanne
Lawrence Hearst, the granddaughter of American newspaper publisher
William Randolph Hearst, was sentenced Wednesday to two years in
prison and ordered to return money she stole from Hearst's
thoroughbred horse ranch.
	   The Andalusia provincial court in this southern Spanish city
ruled that Julia Cantillana stole dlrs 100,000 when she oversaw
Hearst's farm between 1988 and 1993, the news agency Europa Press
reported.
	   Cantillana said Hearst brought the charges because she's jealous
one of her ex-boyfriends is living with Cantillana.

	   MORGANTOWN, West Virginia (AP) _ It was a long, damp evening for
actor Harrison Ford.
	   The star of the new American movie ``Six Days, Seven Nights''
was stranded Tuesday night in Morgantown, about 50 miles (80 kms)
south of Pittsburgh, when thunderstorms forced his pilot to land
their helicopter at Hart Field.
	   Ford was on his way home to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. His family
was flying separately in a private jet and continued through the
storm.
	   ``It's a real pretty part of the country,'' Ford said.
``Everybody's been pretty nice to us.''
	   Ford and the pilot left Wednesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rapper ODB from The Wu-Tang Clan ignored doctors
and walked out of a hospital Wednesday after being shot during an
apartment robbery.
	   The rapper, whose real name is Russell Jones, left Interfaith
Medical Center just after midnight. His back and arm wounds from
the robbery were superficial, but doctors wanted to keep him
overnight for observation.
	   Jones, 29, was shot once Tuesday when two armed intruders
entered the Brooklyn apartment where he was staying, police said.
Jewelry was stolen, investigators said.
	   Jones' family took him to the emergency room.
	   In February, Jones crashed the stage at the Grammys and hijacked
a microphone from Shawn Colvin, complaining that he didn't win for
best rap album. He later apologized.

 &UR; GUYANA: Police chief apologizes for crowd shootings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana's police commissioner
apologized Wednesday to government workers who were hurt when
police fired shotguns at anti-government protesters in downtown
Georgetown.
	   Twelve people were injured by steel pellets Tuesday.
	   Commissioner Laurie Lewis said police were trying to disperse
protesters who were blocking traffic in front of the Supreme Court.
Demonstrators had mingled with court employees who were in the
street because of a bomb threat.
	   Lewis called the injuries ``an unfortunate set of
circumstances'' and said he had called leaders of the employees'
Public Service Union to apologize.
	   Officers were under pressure to stop assaults by protesters on
bystanders and news reporters, Lewis said.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: No progress on Guyana at Caricom summit
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Caribbean leaders spent the first day
of a summit Wednesday trying, with little apparent success, to
resolve a violent political crisis that has paralyzed Guyana.
	   Guyana's president, Janet Jagan, and opposition leader Desmond
Hoyte blamed each other for the crisis, marked by almost-daily
demonstrations and clashes with police in a dispute over elections.
	   Jagan told Caribbean Community leaders late Tuesday that former
president Hoyte's People's National Congress refuses to accept its
defeat in the Dec. 15 elections, as well as a Caricom audit that
certified that defeat.
	   ``It is clear that the PNC has no intention of accepting the
will of the majority,'' said the U.S.-born Jagan, whose People's
Progressive Party won 55 percent of the vote.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Cuban swimmers missing in Puerto Rico
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Two Cuban athletes took their
clothes, a few belongings and dlrs 100 from their coach's wallet,
then disappeared into the night while on a training trip in Puerto
Rico, an official said Wednesday.
	   Nubis Rosales and Daimara Munoz, both gold-medal winners in
swimming at the 1993 Central American and Caribbean Games,
disappeared from a Vega Baja home Tuesday night, said Jose Aviles,
vice president of the Puerto Rican Swimming Federation.
	   Vega Baja is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of San Juan on
the north coast of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.
	   Police and immigration officials were looking for the athletes,
Aviles said.
	   He said the two women, both in their early 20s, were
participating in an exchange program for athletes and were training
for the Central American and Caribbean Games to be held in August
in Venezuela.
 &UR; SURINAME: Former dictator gets country's highest award
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ The former military dictator of
Suriname, still wanted in the Netherlands on cocaine smuggling
charges, was awarded the country's highest decoration on Wednesday.
	   President Jules Wijdenbosch awarded Desire Delano Bouterse the
Grand Ribbon in the Honor Order of the Yellow Star during
ceremonies celebrating the 1863 abolition of slavery.
	   Wijdenbosch said Bouterse helped establish democracy in the
South American country and strengthened its independence from the
Netherlands, its colonial master.
	   Bouterse was an army officer when he led a military coup in
1980, five years after Suriname won independence.
	   He ruled until stepping down after elections in 1987, but
remained a power broker and helped orchestrate a second, bloodless
military coup in 1991.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: St. Vincent leader says outsiders meddling in Caribbean
politics
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The newly re-elected prime minister
of St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Tuesday charged that
politicians in developed countries are trying to manipulate
elections in the Caribbean.
	   Mitchell, whose New Democratic Party won the June 15 election by
one seat, spoke at the opening of a Caribbean Community summit in
St. Lucia.
	   He said the opposition Unity Labor Party had been accompanied
during some campaign events by a British politician, a reference to
British Labor Party lawmaker David Lock.
	   Mitchell claimed that the Unity Labor Party had promised more
British economic aid if voters voted against him, and he urged
Caribbean leaders to reject such pressure.
	   ``External forces are ready to manipulate the will of Caribbean
people,'' Mitchell said. ``It is folly for anyone to think that
such `assistance' does not carry a heavy price.''
 &UR; JAMAICA: Labor party wins second re-election
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Andrew Holness of the opposition
Jamaica Labor Party regained his seat in Parliament in a second
re-election Tuesday night after a court discovered irregularities
in the first two votes.
	   Holness, 25, is the youngest person ever elected to Parliament.
	   He beat Warren Blake of the ruling People's National Party in
the Dec. 18 elections with 8,649 votes to Blake's 8,496, but was
forced to give up the seat after the Election Court found tampered
ballot boxes.
	   Blake won the second election on March 26 with 5,505 votes to
Holness' 5,317, but the court reported irregularities at 17 polling
stations and ordered a third vote in those areas on June 13.
	   Only 717 people voted in the 17 polling stations Tuesday. Blake
needed to win 735 more votes to win but only managed 688. Holness
won 16 votes, which gave him the win when combined with his lead in
other districts.
 &UR; BERMUDA: Murder defendant told to wait while court hears appeal
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A Bermuda man charged with killing a
Canadian teen-ager was told Wednesday his case would have to wait
until appeals are heard in the case of another man involved in the
slaying.
	   Chief Justice Austin Ward set an Aug. 3 appearance for Justis
Smith, charged with killing 17-year-old Rebecca Middleton, of
Belleville, Ontario, in July 1996. Smith has pleaded innocent.
	   Ward said Smith's case would have to wait until Britain's Privy
Council hears an appeal in the case of Kirk Mundy, a Jamaican who
is serving a five-year sentence for being an accessory to
Middleton's murder.
	   Prosecutors are appealing a ruling by Bermuda's Court of Appeals
that Mundy cannot be tried for premeditated murder. Prosecutors,
who say they've turned up new evidence against Mundy, want to try
Mundy and Smith together.
	   A charge of premeditated murder carries a mandatory death
penalty in Bermuda, although the sentence is usually commuted to
life in prison.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Court overturns conviction of man who removed sign
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The Barbados High Court has
overturned the vandalism conviction of a 73-year-old former cabinet
minister who removed a sign commemorating the country's only female
head of state.
	   Peter Morgan, a former tourism minister and high commissioner to
Canada, said he felled the 4-foot-high (1.2-meter-high) steel sign
in May 1997 because it did not include her honorary title of dame _
the female equivalent of sir.
	   The court said Tuesday he was not guilty because he had caused
no damage to the sign or the columns holding it.
	   The sign had said ``Nita Barrow Roundabout'' and stood at a
traffic circle near the governor general's official residence.
	   It commemorated Dame Nita Barrow, the first woman to be
appointed governor general to Barbados. The governor general
represents the queen of England in former British colonies.
 &UR; GRENADA: Opposition party confirms talks with ruling party
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ An officer of the opposition
Grenada United Labor Party confirmed this week his party discussed
an alliance with the ruling New National Party.
	   Labor Party deputy leader Jerry Romain said he and two other
party leaders met June 8 with agriculture minister Michael Baptiste
to discuss a deal. Baptiste is a former Labor Party lawmaker who
switched to the New National Party.
	   Prime minister Keith Mitchell has hinted he might call early
elections before 2000, but he has denied any talks with the Labor
Party to strengthen his party's slim 8-7 majority in Parliament.
	   ``If Mitchell denies having discussions with the GULP, either he
does not know what's going on in his party or he is a liar,''
Romain said Monday. He said Baptiste had warned him to deny any
meetings to the press.
	   He said an alliance between the two parties looked unlikely.
 &UR; GRENADA: Duncan says no talk of her return to cabinet
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ As lawmakers prepare for possible
early elections, sacked Grenada health minister Grace Duncan says
no one has offered her her position back in return for support in a
key voting district.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell stripped Duncan of her cabinet
post and her position as deputy prime minister in 1996 after she
said he was acting ``like a little boy'' for not allowing her to
use the prime minister's car or office when he was off the island.
	   She is know to have the support of at least three government
ministers for a return to the cabinet. On Monday she denied rumors
that she met with Mitchell to discuss a truce.
	   ``I have been hearing and seeing things in the news just as you
have _ I have not seen the Prime Minister,'' Duncan said.

Caribbean leaders confront Guyana political crisis

 &UR; By GUY ELLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Caribbean leaders spent the first day
of a summit trying, with little apparent success, to resolve a
violent political crisis that has paralyzed Guyana.
	   Guyana's president, Janet Jagan, and opposition leader Desmond
Hoyte blamed each other for the crisis, marked by almost-daily
demonstrations and clashes with police in a dispute over elections.
	   Jagan told Caribbean Community leaders late Tuesday that former
President Hoyte's People's National Congress refuses to accept its
defeat in the Dec. 15 elections, as well as a Caricom audit that
certified that defeat.
	   ``Democracy is on trial in Guyana,'' she said. ``Caricom must
stand up for democracy and the rule of law.''
	   Hoyte, who contends that both the election and the audit were
flawed, accused Jagan's administration of refusing to enter talks
to resolve the crisis and of discriminating against opposition
supporters in government.
	   ``I'm hoping (for) nothing,'' Hoyte said during a break
Wednesday in discussions with Caricom heads of state that continued
well into the night.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain and the Organization of
American States recognized Jagan's victory. But weeks of riots
unraveled a Caricom-brokered truce between Jagan and Hoyte's
followers that called for constitutional reforms to promote a
greater opposition say in government.
	   ``The fear is whether or not the political structure in place is
a structure that will prevent Mr. Hoyte and his party from ever
winning an election in Guyana again,'' said the Bahamas' prime
minister, Hubert Ingraham.
	   The summit, which runs through Saturday, marks the 25th
anniversary of the 16-member Caribbean Community trade bloc,
encompassing more than 6 million people and a dlrs 30 billion
combined national product.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Andrew Holness of the opposition
Jamaica Labor Party regained his seat in Parliament in a third
election Tuesday night after a court discovered irregularities in
the first two votes.
	   Holness, 25, is the youngest person ever elected to Parliament.

Sampras to come face to face with `Henmania'

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras says he feels at ``home''
playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon. It won't be that way in
Friday's semifinals.
	   Centre Court will reverberate with ``Henmania'' as Britain,
still mourning over England's loss to Argentina in the World Cup,
pulls for Tim Henman to go where no homegrown male player has
ventured in 60 years.
	   ``It's safe to say it's my favorite court,'' Henman said. ``When
you've got 15,000 people cheering you on and willing you on, it
gives you a buzz.''
	   Sampras knows he won't have many supporters.
	   ``Playing Tim here in England, it will be tough,'' he said.
	   But Sampras said he has faced similar situations, namely playing
Boris Becker in Germany, and knows how to cope.
	   ``Hopefully, you can put the crowd out of the match,'' he said.
``You've still got to play. It's still one on one. Tim is going to
have some emotional support behind him, but you have to play and I
feel like I'm playing well.''
	   Henman is playing more than just the No. 1 player in the world,
the man who has won Wimbledon four of the last five years and who
hasn't dropped a set so far this tournament.
	   Henman is also playing the burden of history. By beating Petr
Korda in Wednesday's quarters, he became the first British man to
make the semifinals since Roger Taylor in 1973.
	   Now he's aiming to become the first Brit to reach the final
since Henry Austin in 1938 and the first to win the title since
Fred Perry in 1936.
	   ``I wasn't born when Taylor got to the semis,'' the 23-year-old
Henman said. ``I don't want to stop at the semis now.''
	   The other men's semifinal will feature two of the game's biggest
servers _ Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Despite a swollen knee, Krajicek is playing as well as when he
won the title in 1996. The big surprise is Ivanisevic, a former
two-time finalist who had won only one match in his last five Grand
Slam tournaments and had been written off by many people.
	   ``It's my 11th Wimbledon,'' he said. ``I'm having fun. I don't
know how it's going to finish, but maybe this year is the year for
me.''
	   Ivanisevic will be favored Friday because he has beaten Krajicek
eight consecutive times dating back to 1992.
	   The men had a day off Thursday, which was set aside for the
women's semifinals.
	   Scheduled first was Nathalie Tauziat, the lowest seed at No. 16,
against unseeded Natasha Zvereva. Next up was what many considered
the real final _ defending champion Martina Hingis vs. her doubles
partner, Jana Novotna, in a replay of last year's championship
match.
	   Henman has enjoyed relatively restrained media coverage this
tournament because of the focus on the World Cup. But with England
out of the Cup following Tuesday's penalty shootout defeat to
Argentina, the hopes of a nation are now turned on Henman.
	   ``What I'm doing is far more important to me than the World
Cup,'' he said. ``They (England soccer players) are out there
representing their country, but when I'm on the court, I'm playing
solely for myself.''
	   Henman said he's never player better than in his win over Korda
and has no reason to believe he can't beat Sampras.
	   ``The way I'm playing, I definitely feel I've got a good
chance,'' he said.
	   Don't count on it, says Mark Philippoussis, who was swept away
by Sampras in straight sets in the quarterfinals and doesn't seen
anybody who can stop the defending champion.
	   ``I think he's too solid,'' Philippoussis said. ``He's dedicated
out there and he wants to prove a point. When somebody serves like
that, they want to say something. So I think he's ready. I don't
think anybody will beat him.''
	   Hingis, 17, was the only one of the women teen-age stars to
reach the semifinals. By contrast, Tauziat is 30, Novotna, 29, and
Zvereva, 27.
	   Anna Kournikova, 17, missed Wimbledon with a thumb injury,
16-year-old Serena Williams went out in the third round and her
18-year-old sister Venus lost to Novotna in the quarters.
	   The Williams sisters certainly made a lot of noise with their
brash talk and rattling beads but failed to live up to their
title-winning expectations.
	   ``I really did think I was going to win,'' Venus said. ``I think
next year I'm going to get much better. This time last year, I
improved a lot, and from this point last year to now, I've improved
much more. So next year, I don't think there's anything that should
be stopping me, except for me.''

Venus loses control and loses in quarterfinals

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams screamed at the umpire
over disputed calls, cried on Centre Court when they weren't
reversed, and repeatedly lost her cool.
	   She also lost 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) Wednesday in the quarterfinals
against two-time Wimbledon runner-up Jana Novotna and _ like her
sister, Serena, before her _ left the All England Club without the
singles title after bragging she'd win it.
	   ``It's too late now, I'll have to wait until next year,'' she
said.
	   At least it was good theater.
	   And for a time, Williams' tennis was just as good.
	   Playing in only her second Wimbledon after losing last year in
the first round, she took a 4-1 lead in the first set before
Novotna began rallying her serve-and-volley game to take the set.
	   The outbursts came in the second set when the 6-foot-2 (1.88
meters) Williams twice shouted at chair umpire Mike Morrissey after
shots that landed near the line weren't called out.
	   ``That was SO far out,'' she shouted in the first game of the
second set. But the high-drama came in the seventh game on another
non-call.
	   ``I know it's OUT, she knows it's OUT, everyone knows it's OUT.
But you don't know it's OUT,'' Williams shouted, as she screamed at
Morrissey and then whirled around playing to the crowd.
	   The Centre Court crowd applauded in support.
	   Television replays showed the balls might have been long, but
both were close.
	   ``The crowd probably enjoyed my emotional outbursts,'' she said,
soft-spoken afterward. ``I guess someone would turn the channel and
suddenly see some girl screaming and keep it there, I know I would.
It probably brightened up someone's day.''
	   The next John McEnroe, perhaps?
	   ``I don't think I would get that out of control,'' she said.
``But I think everybody enjoyed watching him (McEnroe) go at it.
They just waited to see when he would go off. I don't think that's
going to be me. He would play through it and play great tennis. Not
everyone's able to do that.''
	   Novotna, who was to face Martina Hingis Thursday at Centre Court
in one semifinal, with Natasha Zvereva against Nathalie Tauziat in
the other, said the outbursts hurt Williams.
	   ``You really have to be focused from the beginning to the end,
and I think she lost it a little bit there for a while,'' Novotna
said.
	   Williams, much better on grass now than a year ago, again came
close to promising a Wimbledon title next year.
	   ``I think definitely next year I'm going to get much better,''
she said. ``So next year, I don't think there's anything that
should be stopping me except for me.''

Report: Japanese `bridge bank' system to come in two stages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese ruling party proposal to take over
failed domestic financial institutions calls for government
involvement in two-stages over a maximum period of five years, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   An outline of the plan, expected to be formally announced later
Thursday, was published in the morning edition of the Nihon Keizai
financial daily.
	   According to the newspaper, the first stage would involve
establishing ``government-managed bridge banks,'' while the second
would entail ``public, or government-owned, bridge banks.''
	   Under the system, government officials would be sent to manage a
failed institution until a buyer was found or its assets were sold.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party has been studying various proposals for a so-called bridge
bank system to clean up mountains of bad loans in the nation's
banking system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   The bridge bank concept was first used by the U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in the late 1980s to deal with a spate of
bank failures following the savings and loan debacle.
	   The goal is to restore health to the financial system and pull
Japan out of its deepest economic recession since the end of World
War II.
	   Japan's financial institutions are saddled with 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse in the early
1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and real estate
speculation.
	   Hashimoto's government has been scrambling to put the plan
together since it pledged aggressive action to clean up ailing
banks at a meeting of international finance officials last month.
	   The Cabinet and LDP are scheduled to make formal announcements
at separate news conferences Thursday evening.

Ivanisevic still a favorite
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Briton Tim Henman is the local
favorite. Pete Sampras is the sentimental choice as he goes for a
Borg-equaling five titles.
	   But Goran Ivanisevic is the people's choice _ particularly among
reporters looking for a good line.
	   The two-time Wimbledon runnerup Goran Ivanisevic won three
tiebreakers Wednesday to edge Jan Siemerink 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-5),
7-6 (8-6) to make the semifinals for the first time since 1995. He
joins Sampras, Henman and Richard Krajicek
	   He meets '96 champion Krajicek on Friday, favored since he's
beaten the Dutchman eight straight times.
	   ``It's my 11th Wimbledon,'' he said. ``I'm having fun. I don't
know how it's going to finish, but maybe this year is the year for
me.''
	   Ivanisevic said he changes nothing when he's winning. He's grown
a beard and won't shave until after.
	   ``I have two songs I listen to every day before I leave the
house. ``We have six showers in the the locker room, and each day I
pick the same one.''
	   If it's occupied? ``I wait.
	   The songs? ``Their Croatian.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO FAIRY TALE: &LR;  Monica Seles recognizes a fairy tale when she
hears one.
	   A favorite one _ with her in the lead role _ goes like this:
Following the death of her father just over a month ago and her
well-publicized stabbing in April 1993, she comes back to win
Wimbledon and regains her No. 1 ranking.
	   But Seles knows fairytales don't come true, as her 7-6 (7-4),
6-2 defeat to Natasha Zvereva in Wednesday's quarterfinals will
attest.
	   ``I think it's totally separate,'' she said. ``I don't think God
is going to favor a tennis match or a tennis player to win it. I
just don't agree with that outlook. Life really doesn't work like
that, does it.
	   ``Some people should get a lot. They for sure suffered so much
more than I ever did in my life. And they still don't get it.
Unfortunately, it's not like that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ATP CHANGES: &LR;  A plan by Boris Becker and a Swiss company to
create a new men's tennis tour has been rejected, and the ATP Tour
instead announced more modest changes Wednesday.
	   The marketing company Prisma sought to create a circuit that
would replace the men's ATP Tour. Becker represented Prisma at a
clandestine meeting with chairmen of the four Grand Slams, but they
rejected the proposal, the Evening Standard of London reported.
	   The meeting took place this spring after the ATP rejected a
three-year television package proposed by Prisma.
	   ``Have Becker and Prisma been around making inquiries?
Absolutely,'' said Mark Miles, chief executive officer of the ATP
Tour. ``Do I think it has any chance of getting anywhere? No.
Period.''
	   The ATP announced four-year marketing agreements Wednesday with
ISL, a Swiss company that handles World Cup marketing, and Octagon,
a London business involved in sports marketing. The deals will
increase revenue for men's tennis by about 30 percent, the ATP
said, though the agreements are less lucrative than Prisma's
proposal.
	   The ATP also said plans have been finalized to change the men's
ranking system in 2000. A new points race will begin each January,
and the system that counts results from the previous 52 weeks will
be abandoned.
	   Under the new system, top-ranked Pete Sampras would instead be
No. 12 this week, more accurately reflecting his slump in the first
six months of 1998.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BYE, BYE LINDSAY: &LR;  Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport _ one of the
hardest hitters in women's tennis _ was beaten at her game own game
in Wednesday's quarterfinal loss to Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``That's by far the best she (Tauziat) has ever played against
me,'' said the American, who had won seven of eight previous
head-to-heads. ``I expected her to come in all the time and to
volley great, but she was really out-hitting me from the
baseline.''
	   ``This is by far the best I've ever played at Wimbledon,'' she
added. ``I didn't think I could play this well on grass.''
	   Tauziat, reaching her first Grand Slam semifinal on what is her
best surface, echoed Davenport. ``I hit like her, strong like
her... I mixed it up and it was good today.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JOLLY GOOD, PETE: &LR;  Pete Sampras, using his best British English,
described watching England lose to Argentina on penalties Wednesday
in the World Cup.
	   ``I don't know football that well,'' he said, avoiding the use
of the word soccer. ``Losing on penalties is a tough way to lose.''
	   He cracked up the English reporters when he joked about
Canadian-born Briton Greg Rusedski, whose North American accent is
spiced with expressions like ``mate, bloke and brilliant.''
	   ``I played a couple of years ago against Rusedski _ before he
all of a sudden turned English,'' Sampras said. ``Is that good for
you guys?'' Sampras asked the British press. ``I'm trying to
help.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Ken Rosewall, four-time Wimbledon runner-up,
is playing at Wimbledon at 63. Rosewall is playing in the over-45
doubles with Fred Stolle, 47 years after his first appearance at
Wimbledon.
	   He said he still hits the ball well _ ``when I reach it.''
	   Mark Philippoussis on the changes announced Wednesday in the ATP
Tour ranking system: ``I think it's the best thing, but I can't
really say. To be honest, I don't really care.''

Beckham and Owen get contrasting reviews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Spice Girls splitting up?
	   England has a solution: Stupid Spice and Baby Spice.
	   David Beckham, the soccer star engaged to marry Posh Spice of
the famous singing foursome, was public enemy No. 1 back home
Wednesday when fans and the media blamed England's elimination from
the World Cup on his needless expulsion.
	   Floored by an Argentina midfielder, Beckham kicked back with his
right leg and was inevitably shown the red card in the first
minutes of the second half.
	   The expulsion meant England wound up playing against the tough
Argentine team with only 10 players for the remainder of the game _
75 minutes. The second round match wound up 2-2 after extra time
and England lost 4-3 on a penalty shootout.
	   The resulting frustrations of many English fans were expressed
by one headline in London's Daily Mirror newspaper: ``10 Heroic
Lions, One Stupid Boy.''
	   The defeat means that England's name will be missing when the
quarterfinals come round on Friday and Saturday.
	   Defending titlist Brazil faces Denmark at Nantes and host France
takes on three-time champion Italy at the Stade de France on
Friday. The next day Argentina meets Netherlands in Marseille and
Germany, which has also won the World Cup three times, meets
debutant Croatia at Lyon.
	   As England trooped home in defeat Wednesday, Beckham issued an
apology for his blunder through his agent.
	   ``This is without doubt the worst moment of my career,'' he said
in the faxed message. ``I will always regret my actions during last
night's game.
	   ``I have apologized to the England players and management and I
want every England supporter to know how deeply sorry I am.''
	   Beckham also discovered that FIFA had banned him for two games
because of his petulance. He will miss England's first two
qualifying games for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Michael Owen, meanwhile, had nothing to be sorry for. The
teen-ager left France having spiced up the tournament in his own
special way.
	   The 18-year-old Liverpool striker, who stands 1.70 meters
(5-feet-7) tall, scored one the best ever World Cup goals, a
40-meter run past two Argentine defenders before shooting into the
roof of the net from level with the penalty spot.
	   Despite England's failure to reach the quarterfinals, Owen has
plenty to smile about after his instant World Cup impact.
	   ``I think I was the first to point him out eight months ago,''
Pele, the World Cup's greatest player, said Wednesday.
	   ``The (England) coach said at the time that he may be too young.
But I played at 17 and I asked myself `Why can't he play at 18?'
	   ``He is one of the big surprises, but he needs to get
experience.''
	   Former England maestro Bobby Charlton, who faced Pele at World
Cups, also admired Owen's contribution.
	   ``He has been a revelation in this World Cup _ his goal last
night was sensational,'' said one of the stars of England's 1966
triumph.
	   ``Everybody was afraid he wouldn't be able to handle all the
attention, all the hype and all the pressure, but he has handled it
perfectly well. He is still incredibly young, so he has plenty of
time on his side and the whole world in front of him.''
	   How France wishes it had a striker like Owen as it prepares to
face Italy.
	   The host has a wealth of talent in midfield and, although it
scored nine goals against modest opposition in three first round
games, struggled to beat Paraguay in round two and needed a goal
from defender Laurent Blanc to gain the last eight.
	   It may have to face the Italians without Thierry Henry, who has
scored three times.
	   Henry is nursing a sprained left ankle suffered in the
second-round victory over the Paraguayans.
	   ``If I can, I will play,'' Henry said. ``If not, we are not
going to take any risks.''

 &UR; Eds: items on surviving referees, Beckham ad, Bubka final hopes,

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ If the top referees from Germany, Italy, Brazil,
France and Argentina aren't at the World Cup any more, that's
because their nations are.
	   Referees for the quarterfinal matches Friday and Saturday
comprise a mix from early-exiters Scotland, Egypt, Norway and
Mexico.
	   On Friday, Scotland's Hugh Dallas will work Italy-France, while
Gamal Ghandour of Egypt will handle Brazil-Denmark. On Saturday,
Rune Pedersen of Norway gets Germany-Croatia, and Mexican Arturo
Brizio Carter will blow the whistle at Netherlands-Argentina.
	   FIFA announced the list of 10 referees and 20 assistants and
linesman for the remaining eight games and none come from the eight
survivors.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talk about a bad omen. On Tuesday, shoe
manufacturer Adidas took out full-page advertisements in national
newspapers in England with a close-up picture of midfielder David
Beckham.
	   Plastered across his face were the words: ``After tonight,
England vs. Argentina will be remembered for what a player did with
his feet.''
	   Well, that's exactly what happened. Beckham kicked an opposing
player and was ejected in the second half of Tuesday night's game,
making him the goat in the eyes of many English fans for the
penalty shootout loss to the Argentines.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONACO, Monte Carlo (AP) _ If there's one man who knows if the
standard of play in the World Cup is going up and up, it's pole
vault world record holder Sergei Bubka.
	   ``The level of play is excellent and the organization appears to
be very good as well, with every match booked out,'' the Ukraine
world champion said.
	   ``It would be great to see Brazil and France play together in
the final.''
	   Bubka, who played alongside Prince Albert of Monaco, motor
cycling star Max Biaggi and skier Alberto Tomba in a charity match
against stars of Italy's Juventus, is no slouch on the soccer
field.
	   ``I played as a forward,'' he said. ``But I'm equally at ease in
any position, I just like to get out there and play.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian striker Christian Vieri will turn
25 on July 12, the day of the World Cup final.
	   Asked if he considered it a good omen and the chance for a
double celebration, the Atletico Madrid striker, joint top scorer
with Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta with five goals, wasn't sure.
	   ``It could be the greatest present for me,'' he said. ``Or the
greatest disillusion.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian political leaders,
fearing a loss of influence, will meet again Sunday to discuss ways
they might be able to work with Kosovo's independence fighters.
	   Members of Kosovo's 16 ethnic Albanian political parties failed
to agree Wednesday on a joint approach to cooperation with the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The political parties fear that as the
popularity of the guerrilla movement grows, support for their own
non-violent independence campaign is decreasing.
	   The issue has become so important to the political parties that
Ibrahim Rugova, the leader supported by most of Kosovo's Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's population, also
participated in the meeting.
	   Rugova has up to now refused to cooperate with the armed
insurgents, preaching non-violence as the only way to achieve
independence for the Serbian.
	   The United States has continued to support Rugova. On Wednesday,
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin described him as
``central and indispensable.''
	   The Pristina talks came as hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels
regrouped in western Kosovo to stave off rapid advances by Serbian
security forces in Kosovo's west.
	   Police said the rebels moved west to the Drenica region after
Serbian forces recaptured the area surrounding a strategic coal
mine from the KLA on Tuesday. Reporters at Belacevac and Hade, the
two towns just a few hundred meters (yards) from the coal mine saw
the Serbs in control on Wednesday, with no signs of fighting.
	   Also Wednesday, U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke said that
international observers could begin making symbolic patrols of the
tense Kosovo province of Yugoslavia as early as this week.
	   ``The goal of the observer missions is to demonstrate an
international presence fast in the area, which may help calm things
down,'' Holbrooke said in Oslo, Norway.

Workers put final touches on new Hong Kong airport before Clinton

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Construction workers will still be putting the
final touches on the new, hi-tech Chek Lap Kok airport when Air
Force One touches down.
	   Although several ceremonial flights have used the airport,
located on an island about 20 miles (35 kms) from the city, airport
officials say U.S. President Bill Clinton and his entourage will be
the first passengers to land from outside Hong Kong.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in town for the first anniversary
of Hong Kong's handover, was to dedicate the airport Thursday and
fly out before Clinton arrives later in the day.
	   Officially, the downtown Kai Tak airport, famous for its
heart-stopping approach low over Hong Kong, ends it 73-year history
at midnight Sunday. Chek Lap Kok opens for regular business the
next morning.
	   On a recent visit, the sleek, airy passenger terminal was filled
with the sounds of hammering and drilling as workers completed the
airport's retail stores.
	   Bare-chested workers strolled in groups in the sprawling
terminal with carts of building materials in tow. A handful of them
were catching afternoon naps by the windows.
	   Clinton is unlikely to see all the evidence of last-minute work
because he'll be arriving at night, said Airport Authority
spokesman Chris Donnolley.
	   The Air Force One entourage will leave the tarmac directly for
their hotel, bypassing the terminal, Donnolley said.
	   ``We're providing a parking spot for his plane,'' he said.
	   The dlrs 20 billion airport was built on a manmade islet west of
outlying Lantau island to replace Kai Tak, one of the few remaining
airports in a congested urban area.
	   Building the new airport meant flattening two uninhabited islets
and pushing back the sea for the runways. Half of the world's
dredging fleet converged here at one time to conduct the
reclamation work.
	   Over the weekend, thousands of people rushed to the buildings
near Kai Tak to catch one final glimpse of the airport, the
approach to which involves skimming over the rooftops of a cluster
of short-rises before making a sharp right-hand bank toward the
runway.
	   Even though most people agree that the airport has become too
crowded and is too close to the city, Kai Tak will be sorely
missed.

World Cup: Yet another last game for Michael Laudrup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULON, France (AP) _ Michael Laudrup won league titles for
powerhouses Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and his last one with
Ajax this season.
	   He just missed a hat trick near the end of the match as Denmark
shut out Brazil 4-0 to win Danish soccer's Centennial tournament in
Copenhagen nine years ago.
	   How many can match those accomplishments? Nobody.
	   Denmark's most famous striker ever is unique in many ways.
	   Ajax tried to sign Laudrup when he was a 13-year-old wonder boy.
``No thanks, too early,'' said his dad Finn, a former Danish
national team player with foreign experience in the Austrian
league.
	   Scoring two goals against Brazil was memorable.
	   ``Not too many players can say they beat Brazil 4-0,'' Laudrup
told The Associated Press before Wednesday's practice in this
Mediterranean port city.
	   The Brazilian team featured stars like Branco, Mazinho, Edu,
Gerson and Careca. Denmark, and especially Laudrup, was awesome in
the Centennial, also crushing (6-0) traditional arch rival Sweden,
which one year later would play in the World Cup in Italy.
	   At 34, Laudrup is retiring from pro soccer after France '98.
	   After the dazzling Danes' brilliant 4-1 over Nigeria -- Laudrup
set up two goals with brilliant passes -- he has yet another last
game to play.
	   He couldn't have asked for a better one. Brazil, most players'
favorite opponent, await the Danes in their first-ever World Cup
quarterfinal.
	   ``Of course, it could be a fantastic ending for me,'' he said.
''First, winning the double in Holland with Ajax and now to be in
the quarterfinal. It's a fantastic result for Denmark already.
	   ``And now to play Brazil! Until nine o'clock on Friday we all
dream about beating Brazil. Maybe we'll succeed. Maybe not. But at
least nobody can take away the dream from you. That's fantastic. If
we just play well on Friday, I think I couldn't have asked for
anything better. Yeah, maybe if we win ... but that's another
story.''
	   After Ajax failed to sign Laudrup at such an early age, he
started his career in his native Denmark with Brondby, the first
team to be listed on the Danish stock exchange. After a stint with
FC Copenhagen, Laudrup went to Juventus in 1983. He had a spell on
loan to Lazio in Rome for two seasons before returning to ''Juve''
and winning the '86 league title alongside Michel Platini.
	   In Spain, Laudrup became a league champion four straight times
(1991-94) with Barcelona before leaving for archrival Real Madrid,
where he won a fifth straight title in 1995. After a year in Japan
with Vissel Kobe, he returned to Europe and Ajax, capping it with
the recent Dutch double.
	   Laudrup is the only remaining player from the 1986 team in
Mexico, which beat Scotland, Uruguay and eventual finalist Germany
before crashing out 5-1 to Spain.
	   In the early 90s, both Michael and his younger brother Brian
refused to play for their country at one point under former coach
Richard Moller Nielsen. Only Brian played in the 1992 European
Championship finals in Sweden, where Denmark upset Germany 2-0 in
the final for its only major international triumph.
	   Encouraged by new Swedish coach Bo Johansson's less rigid
approach to tactics, the Laudrup brothers are now back to their
best. Pulling all the strings in the Danish midfield, Michael
Laudrup often feeds his kid brother with inch-perfect passes.
	   They never played together at club level, but ``it was very
close that we played together for Ajax, but it never happened. It's
nice playing with him here in France,'' Michael said.
	   After ending his remarkable career, Laudrup will return to
Denmark with his family. But may not be leaving soccer altogether.
	   ``First I will rest for a few months, but I'm only retiring from
professional football,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll regret it. You never
know. I can't say because I have never quit before. But maybe I can
call you in six months and tell you.

World Cup: Luck finally running for Dutch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA TURBIE, Monaco (AP) _ Lady Luck finally seems to be smiling
on the Dutch.
	   Dennis Bergkamp acknowledged Wednesday that fortune favored the
Netherlands in the World Cup second round match against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Yugoslavia missed a penalty, my foul was not punished and
Davids scored,'' Bergkamp said. ``We had a lot of luck.''
	   Bergkamp appeared to stamp on Yugoslav defender Sinisa
Mihajlovic early in the second half of Monday's second round match
but Spanish referee Jose Garcia-Aranda did not see the incident.
	   France's Zinedine Zidane was red carded for a similar foul
against Saudi Arabia and suspended for two matches in the
tournament's qualification stage.
	   Pundits say that to win the World Cup a team needs quality
players and a slice or two of good fortune. The Dutch have often
had the great players but rarely the good breaks.
	   ``We didn't have it four years ago,'' Bergkamp said referring to
the Netherlands' World Cup quarterfinal defeat by Brazil at the
Cotton Bowl in Dallas.
	   Brazil's first two goals looked offside _ Dutch supporters
maintain _ and after the Netherlands had scored twice to equalize,
Brazil's Branco fired in the winner with a 30-meter free kick that
Ed de Goey got a hand to but could not hold.
	   The Dutch lost 3-2 as Brazil rode its luck all the way to the
title.
	   Late in the quarterfinal of the 1996 European Championships,
with the score at 0-0 against France, the Dutch claimed a penalty
after defender Marcel Desailly handled the ball. Instead, the
referee gave a free kick just outside the penalty area and Phillip
Cocu blasted it against the post. The French eventually won the tie
on penalties.
	   Then there was 1978. In the last minute of a controversy-laced
World Cup final against Argentina, with the score at 1-1, Rob
Rensenbrink broke through on the left and shot against the post.
The deflated Dutch went on to lose 3-1 in extra time.
	   Or the 1974 World Cup final, when the famous Dutch side led by
Johan Cruyff took the lead against host West Germany only for the
Germans to equalize through a penalty that many agree should not
have been given. The Germans went on to win 2-1.
	   A bit more luck like the Dutch had Monday against Yugoslavia in
Toulouse might help the team a step further than the teams in '74
and '78 and actually win the World Cup.
	   ``We were lucky with the Yugoslav penalty,'' Edgar Davids said.
``If that had gone in, it would have been 2-1 for them and very
difficult for us.''
	   Instead, Davids scored the Netherlands' winner, his first
international goal, in injury time at the end of the match. Coach
Guus Hiddink had decided against substituting him despite Davids
complaining of cramp in his legs.

Evidence mounts that AIDS-wrecked immune system can rebuild itself
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Drugs that stop HIV in its tracks may also allow
the body's AIDS-wrecked defenses against disease to rebuild
themselves, new research suggests.
	   Treatment combinations that include medicines called protease
inhibitors have dramatically changed AIDS therapy. The drugs have
pulled some patients back from the brink of death while stopping
many others from getting sick.
	   Still in doubt, though, is whether the body's immune system _
the main target of the virus _ is able to reconstitute itself after
AIDS or whether it remains permanently weakened.
	   Dr. Brigitte Autran of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris said
Wednesday that measurements of patients' crucial white blood cells
suggests the news is good.
	   ``We are now providing proof that indeed the immune system is
not dead,'' she said Wednesday at the 12th World AIDS Conference.
	   HIV's target is a category of disease-fighting white blood cells
called CD4 T cells. Like others, Autran found that these soon
rebound after treatment starts.
	   She followed 303 patients in very late stages of AIDS. After 18
months of treatment, their CD4 T cell counts rose from an average
of 51 per cubic millimeter of blood to 194.
	   About a year into treatment, she also found a rise in so-called
naive cells, newly generated cells that had never been exposed to
HIV. This is considered a good sign that the immune system is
indeed returning to its former state.
	   ``We saw a very strong very strong but very late regeneration of
naive cells in every single patient'' whose virus levels had
plummeted, she said.
	   Furthermore, the patients' CD4 cells appeared to be more
aggressive disease fighters.
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S. National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said evidence of immune
reconstitution has been building, although it's still not clear how
complete it will be.
	   He said Autran's ``work is among the best in showing that there
is at least partial reconstitution of the immune system.''
	   Despite their improvement, many of these once terminally ill
patients continue to take a variety of drugs intended to fight off
so-called opportunistic infections. These are diseases caused by
usually innocuous germs that are dangerous because of the lack of
strong immune defenses.
	   Fauci said he believes doctors should not routinely take
patients off these medicines until a study is conducted to see if
their immune systems are truly strong enough to ward off these
microbes.
	   However, Dr. Bernard Hirschel of the Geneva Cantonal University
Hospital said he sometimes stops such treatment if patients' CD4
cells have risen strongly and their virus levels are low.

Former Mexican police director convicted of abuse of authority

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A former federal police director who admitted
accepting dlrs 1 million in bribes from a drug lord has been
convicted on unrelated charges of abuse of authority and sentenced
to four years in prison.
	   Adrian Carrera Fuentes was convicted Wednesday on charges of
torturing a suspect in the 1994 murder of a ruling party
politician, the government news agency Notimex reported. The
suspect later was convicted in the case.
	   Carrera still faces charges of money laundering related to the
bribes he said he accepted from deceased drug lord Amado Carrillo
Fuentes.
	   According to Carrera's April 1998 confession, Carrillo Fuentes
called him to his Mexico City mansion, gave him a suitcase full of
cash and ordered one of his henchmen to buy the officer a Cadillac,
``the most luxurious model.''

Former dictator gets Suriname's highest award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ The former military dictator of
Suriname, still wanted in the Netherlands on cocaine smuggling
charges, was awarded the country's highest decoration on Wednesday.
	   President Jules Wijdenbosch awarded Desire Delano Bouterse the
Grand Ribbon in the Honor Order of the Yellow Star during
ceremonies celebrating the 1863 abolition of slavery.
	   Wijdenbosch said Bouterse helped establish democracy in the
South American country and strengthened its independence from the
Netherlands, its colonial master.
	   Bouterse was an army officer when he led a military coup in
1980, five years after Suriname won independence.
	   He ruled until stepping down after elections in 1987, but
remained a power broker and helped orchestrate a second, bloodless
military coup in 1991.
	   His party lost the 1992 elections, but he helped arrange an
alliance among political parties and remains a special adviser to
Wijdenbosch.
	   At the request of Dutch prosecutors, Interpol issued an arrest
warrant against Bouterse on cocaine smuggling charges in August
1997. Bouterse has denied the charges. He faces arrest if he tries
to leave Suriname.

World Cup: Vieri, Batistuta have chance to clear 20-year hurdle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Increasingly plagued by the scourge of defensive
tactics and even more cautious managers, the World Cup hasn't seen
more than six goals scored by one player in more than 20 years.
	   Thanks to a rule change, an increased emphasis on offense and a
pair of exciting strikers, that could change in France.
	   With five goals each heading into the quarterfinals, Argentina's
Gabriel Batistuta and Italy's Christian Vieri have a chance to be
the first to break the six-goal barrier since Poland's Grzegorz
Lato in 1974.
	   ``Batistuta had a good chance. Holland plays open. They like to
play good football,'' said Brazilian legend Pele, referring to
Argentina's quarterfinal opponent. ``Batistuta has a better
chance.''
	   The Dutch have allowed three goals in four games while France,
the next opponent for Italy and Vieri, has given up just one.
	   Batistuta also takes the penalties for Argentina, and he's
converted twice already.
	   The World Cup's top scorer routinely used to scored more than
six, usually in double figures. From 1938 to 1974, only once _ in
1962 _ did the leading scorer tally less than seven goals, that
being five by Yugoslavia's Drazan Jerkovic.
	   Frenchman Just Fontaine is the all-time leader with 13 goals at
the 1958 World Cup.
	   Russia's Oleg Salenko, who scored five against Cameroon, and
Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov shared the 1994 honors with six each.
	   Vieri and Batistuta both seem on pace to achieve what no one
else has for the last six World Cups. And if they're thinking about
it, they're not letting on.
	   ``The main goal is that Italy goes on in the tournament. If I
can continue my scoring streak the better,'' said Vieri, who turns
25 on July 12, the day of the World Cup final. ``I want to take
advantage of this magic moment, but I'm not obsessed with the
strikers standings.''
	   Despite leading the Spanish league this past season with 24
goals, the Atletico Madrid forward, who grew up in Australia where
his father was player-coach with a local soccer team, had been
overlooked by many heading into France 98.
	   He had scored only two goals in eight matches for the Azzurri
before his World Cup debut.
	   ``I'm tranquil, whatever happens to me. This is my real
strength,'' Vieri said. ``I'm fit, in good form. I'm ready to play
France.''
	   Just as casual about the scoring race is the 29-year-old
Batistuta, who has been known by Fiorentina fans by the offensive
moniker of ``Batigol''.
	   ``I did not come here to set records,'' said Batistuta, who is
known not to be a favorite of Argentina coach Daniel Passarella and
was questionable even to make the team at one point. ``I came here
to win the World Cup. But I hope I score more goals.''
	   Batistuta is the only player so far to have scored three goals
in one game, tallying thrice against Jamaica.
	   While goal scoring has not dramatically increased overall, some
have seen a change. Most attribute it to FIFA's dictate that foul
tackles from behind be punished with immediate expulsion.
	   ``No doubt the rule has opened the game,'' said Pele, a member
of Brazil's World Cup winning squads in 1958, '62 and '70. ``It has
changed things in the minds of players, and it is good for the
game.
	   ``To score in a World Cup is difficult. Everybody knows this.
But this World Cup has many more strikers who can score than other
World Cups.''

World Cup: Batistuta has yet to convince his coach

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Although Gabriel Batistuta keeps
scoring and setting records for Argentina, he has yet to win over
his coach.
	   Daniel Passarella even benched the striker, whose five goals has
him tied for World Cup scoring lead, in the second half of Tuesday
night's shootout victory over England.
	   ``It was one of those decisions one makes in the heat of the
moment,'' Passarella said. ``I thought it was the right thing to do
and I did it.''
	   And Batistuta, whose first-half penalty kick made him the
all-time leading World Cup scorer in Argentine history, refused to
criticize Passarella.
	   ``I left the game because the coach thought it necessary to make
a change and I have no problem with that,'' Batistuta said. ``The
main goal was to win and we did.''
	   Argentine players and fans know all too well that Passarella has
no option but to start Batistuta: The Fiorentina striker seems to
have been born to score goals.
	   But in fairness to Passarella, Batistuta was not in top form
against England, although he steadily drew two or three defenders
and opened lanes for his teammates.
	   His replacement, Hernan Crespo, fared no better and almost went
unnoticed in the English backfield.
	   In the end, Passarella's benching of Batistuta almost lost
Argentina the match when Crespo missed his shot in the critical
penalty shootout.
	   Batistuta, on the other hand, has made a living out of the spot
kick. Two of his five goals at France 98 have been penalties.
	   With the goal against England, Batistuta now has nine tallies in
two World Cups for Argentina, one ahead of Guillermo Stabile and
Diego Maradona. He stands 10th on the Cup's all-time scoring list.
	   But all that matters little to Passarella.
	   In 1990, while coaching Argentina's River Plate, he let
Batistuta go after using him only sparingly. Batistuta joined
River's archrival, Boca Juniors, and won the league title.
	   Even when Fiorentina signed Batistuta in 1991, Passarella
ridiculed the move by the Italian club.
	   ``They made a mistake in signing him. He has no technique,'' he
said.

Police to get tough after Buenos Aires violence spoils World Cup
</HEADLINE>
victory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with Argentina deploying 1,800
officers for Saturday's game and halting alcohol sales &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentine officials promised to
tighten security for Argentina's next World Cup match, a day after
rock-throwing clashes injured dozens celebrating a victory over
England.
	   Miguel Angel Toma, Argentina's Secretary of Security, said
Wednesday that 1,800 security officers would be deployed Saturday
before Argentina's World Cup quarterfinal match against the
Netherlands.
	   Toma also said he will ask stores to stop sales of alcohol two
hours before the game's start.
	   A federal police official, Luis Fernandez, said police would
seek a ban on big outdoor TV screens, which drew large crowds to
downtown Buenos Aires for Tuesday's match, which Argentina won 4-3
on penalties after a 2-2 tie.
	   Authorities, who had used tear gas and a water cannon to
disperse the throng the night before, put the toll Wednesday at 78
injured. Twenty six police officers were hospitalized.
	   Fernandez told reporters that 127 people were arrested and would
face such charges such as destruction of property and theft.
	   He blamed the Buenos Aires violence on a group of about 300
people, many of them drunk, who lingered after a much larger and
peaceful celebration by thousands of chanting, cheering Argentines.
	   ``It transformed into a huge group of hooligans,'' Fernandez
told reporters, hours after sanitation workers picked up the rocks,
bricks and broken glass littering a downtown plaza.
	   Fernandez would not discuss specifics of security changes, nor
did he mention how many officers would be patrolling when Argentina
and the Netherlands meet on Saturday.
	   Argentina's post-game chaos showed even countries outside France
are not immune to the violence that has marred World Cup venues.
	   Since the tournament began June 10, French police have arrested
more than 700 people and tallied at least 3,200 injuries, most of
them slight. To combat violence, authorities have closed down bars,
sent hooligan spotters into crowds, and put hundreds of police at
potential flaspoints.
	   Argentina's celebrations began peacefully with thousands pouring
into the streets, waving flags and chanting ``Ar-gen-tina!'' But
the mood turned ugly as night fell and thousands gathered at the
Obelisk, a downtown monument resembling the Washington Monument.
	   Rowdy youths began throwing rocks and bottles, ripping up street
signs and taunting police.
	   These ``people didn't come to celebrate. They came to rob and
steal on a day that Argentina should be happy,'' said Gustavo Lopez
Gil, a candy store owner who ducked the violence.
	   For some, the victory was bittersweet. It was ``a terrible way
to end a fantastic day,'' said 59-year-old Marcelo Vargas.

Runoff from de-icing chemicals at airports can cause pollution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Martyn correct in 5th graf, ``However, both ...'' &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES HANNAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ A mounted kingfisher with its wings
spread clings to the office wall of Wilmington College biology
professor Fred Anliot. It's a reminder that the birds used to
flourish around nearby Lytle Creek.
	   Anliot says the aquatic life that once fed the kingfishers has
all but disappeared because of de-icing chemicals used at Airborne
Express' sprawling overnight-delivery airport, among the largest
privately operated ones in the country.
	   The chemicals are used because keeping ice off airplane wings
and runways is crucial for air safety. Even a thin layer of ice can
be a safety issue, says John Mazor, spokesman for the
Washington-based Air Line Pilots Association.
	   ``Improper de-icing on an aircraft can result in having that
airplane crash, sometimes before it gets out of sight of the
airport,'' Mazor says.
	   However, both national and state officials are increasingly
seeing a need to balance that factor with public demands for more
attention to airport pollution, said Martyn Burt, of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency's surface-water division.
	   The owner of the Ohio airport, ABX Air Inc., has 106 DC-8s and
DC-9s at the 2,200-acre (890-hectare), two-runway airport and plans
to put five Boeing 767s into service later this year. ABX employs
7,500 workers and handles 1 million packages a night.
	   Anliot said he began to notice an antifreeze-like smell in Lytle
Creek five or six years ago. In the past two years, he said, the
odor has got so bad that people who live more than a mile (1.6
kilometers) downstream can smell it.
	   During the winter, rocks in the creek become coated with
de-icing agents or bacterial byproducts; last February, thousands
of fish, including bass and bluegill, were killed, he said. ABX
said there was no confirmed fish kill.
	   ``The stream does clean itself up by midsummer,'' said Anliot.
``It's basically a nice clear stream in the middle of the summer.
But it is dead.''
	   Anliot said his real fear is possible harm to residents.
	   ``People are complaining about getting sick,'' he said. ``When
I'm working back in there, I come out of there with a headache and
a very strong taste in my mouth.''
	   Burt said there is no human health hazard as far as the agency
knows. But he agreed with Anliot that de-icing fluid can affect
wildlife.
	   The state environmental agency issued a notice of violation to
ABX for exceeding its limit for de-icing runoff during a snowstorm
last February. It asked ABX to provide a spill-response plan by
Oct. 15.
	   ``To be fair to Airborne, when the agency has brought matters to
their attention, they have in the main tried to respond,'' Burt
said. ``They still have a ways to go.''
	   According to EPA records, ABX has a history of spills and
discharges.
	   An EPA memo in March 1992 said the company had 10 spills of jet
fuel and firefighting foam since 1985 and that de-icers were
running off into Lytle Creek.
	   Joe Hete, chief operating officer for ABX, said the company
hasn't figured out how to prevent de-icer runoff, but is trying to
use limited amounts without compromising safety. ABX switched to
non-toxic de-icers a few years ago, but they have drawbacks too.
For instance, one type sucks the oxygen out of water as it breaks
down, Hete said.
	   The company has established an experimental, manmade wetland
designed to help break down de-icers before they can enter the
streams. ``We've seen some pretty encouraging results so far,''
Hete said.
	   Anliot said the state regulators have not been aggressive
enough.
	   ABX is not alone in dealing with pollution from de-icer runoff.
	   Baltimore-Washington International Airport, for example, has
been wrestling with the same issue since de-icers were found in
nearby streams, according to Quentin Banks, spokesman for the
Maryland Department of the Environment.
	   Banks said the airport has purchased vacuum trucks to suck up
de-icers as they stream off aircraft. It also has agreed to build
an additional concrete pad to collect the chemicals and to step up
monitoring of the streams.
	   Airport spokeswoman Marilyn Corbett said a trenching drain has
also been built to capture de-icers. She said the airport is trying
to balance two important issues _ sensitivity to the environment
and the airlines' requirement to de-ice the planes for passengers'
safety.
	   Carter Morris, director of environmental affairs for the
American Association of Airport Executives, says airports have
traditionally had a good response to environmental concerns.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was slightly lower against the yen
early Thursday, hours before the scheduled announcement of measures
to stabilize Japan's banking system. Stock prices moved higher.
	   The dollar bought 138.22 yen in early trading, down a marginal
0.02 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but higher than its late New
York level of 138.07 yen overnight.
	   Investors bought the yen following Japanese newspaper reports
revealing contents of the plan, scheduled to be announced later in
the day, traders said.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party has been studying various proposals for a so-called ``bridge
bank'' system to clean up mountains of bad loans in the nation's
banking system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   News of the plan has created the impression among investors that
Tokyo was seriously moving to clean up its debt-ridden banking
system.
	   Some traders warned, however, that there may be quick selling of
the yen after the announcement, expected in the evening.
	   The stock market also reacted positively to the expected
announcement of the bank plan. Prices were sharply higher on
growing hopes that the government would also implement permanent
tax cuts to buoy the flagging economy.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 175.47 points, or 1.07
percent, to 16,538.36 in the first 30 minutes of morning trading.
On Wednesday, the index had jumped 532.62 points, or 3.36 percent,
rising for the sixth day in a row in a streak that has seen the
benchmark gain nearly 9 percent.
	   Major Japanese newspapers reported Thursday that Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto was considering making temporary tax cuts
permanent to boost consumer spending.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 11.50 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,282.25. The
TOPIX had gained 40.37 points, or 3.18 percent, the previous day.
	   Share prices were also supported by rises on Wall Street and in
futures prices in Chicago overnight, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.370 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of 1.380
percent, driving its price up to 110.68 yen from 110.62 yen.

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Robert Helms is a human lab rat gone bad _
he's biting the hand that feeds him.
	   For the last three years, as a subject of medical experiments,
Helms has been injecting unknown fluids into his blood, jabbing
tubes up his nose and popping mysterious pills. It was sometimes
the only way to pay the rent.
	   But today, Helms has turned into a renegade rat.
	   His paycheck is funding reports that criticize the way
scientists treat those who volunteer for America's medical
experiments.
	   And now it's the researchers who are sore from the jabs.
	   Helms, 40, has started a magazine that monitors how well
hospitals care for the rights and safety of their paid subjects.
	   When Helms is not subjecting himself to needle pokes, he spends
his days under a flickering lamp compiling ``Guinea Pig Zero,'' the
only known occupational professional magazine for people used as
medical or pharmaceutical research subjects.
	   The magazine is giving a voice to a group of people in a very
risky profession, he said.
	   One issue was dedicated to a 19-year-old Rochester, New York,
woman who had a heart attack a few hours after she left a research
unit where she received a fatal overdose of lidocaine, a local
anesthetic. She was being paid dlrs 150 for participating in
research on the effects of smoking and air pollution.
	   ``Yeah, this scares me a little bit,'' said the black-booted,
jeans-clad Helms, sitting in his dingy Philadelphia apartment among
liberation posters, milk crate bookshelves of anarchist literature
and a stuffed guinea pig in a corner.
	   ``But it's worth it,'' he said.
	   Helms prides himself on being the ideal lab rat: a healthy
average white male, 5-foot-9-inches (1.75-meter), 155 pounds (70
kilograms), brown hair, hazel eyes, glasses.
	   But he is picky. He says no to all psychotic drugs, and yes to
all that have minimum side effects, such as hypertension or
antifungal drugs.
	   ``I just want to pass the time and get money for doing it. I
don't want any big experiences,'' Helms said. ``It's one thing to
sell your body, it's another thing to sell your body and your mind.
I want complete control of my mind.
	   ``I'm definitely no brain slut,'' said Helms, using a phrase he
coined for participants in psychiatric studies, as opposed to lab
rats, or guinea pigs, who volunteer for physical research.
	   The magazine aims to help others avoid falling ``victim to the
evil uses devised for us by scientists who forget that we and they
are of the same species,'' Helms wrote in the latest issue.
	   Four years ago, Helms was a regular working man, earning dlrs
40,000 as a union representative for health care workers. He says
he grew tired of the job and now, as a full-time guinea pig, he
makes about dlrs 15,000 a year. His magazine, launched two years
ago, appears quarterly, depending on the state of his bank account.
	   He sells about 1,000 copies of his dlrs 3 magazine nationwide,
but is hoping circulation will double this year through
subscriptions, Internet distribution and Tower Records stores.
	   ``Since we're the only one who's making it possible for progress
in medicine, this is how we can raise the consciousness and respect
for what we do,'' Helms said.
	   Even a subscriber at the National Institutes for Health is
listening.
	   ``I've had a subscription since volume I,'' said Gary Ellis,
director of the Office for Protection from Research Risks. ``It's
an interesting perspective. And as far as I know, there has not
been a publication catered to so-called professional research
subjects.''
	   And now the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is also
addressing the issue. It sent a draft report to Congress
questioning the ability of overworked medical boards that oversee
the safety of people enrolled in medical research.
	   Helms was noticed nationally last year after he published a
critical and hotly contested review of Allegheny University of the
Health Sciences. He accused it of keeping volunteers waiting to
draw blood, doing sloppy injections, and not distributing the
protocol of the experiment unless pestered to do so.
	   He gave other facilities such as Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital an ``A plus.''
	   After Harper's Magazine printed a version of the report,
Allegheny sued Harper's and Helms for libel, its lawyer calling the
article ``false, defamatory, malicious, and ... of tremendous harm
to Allegheny.''
	   The magazine made a hasty apology, Helms gave up the report card
series and the case was settled.
	   This year, Helms decided to bring the report cards back. The
magazine also includes stories about historical research
experiments, tales about guinea pigs' work experiences, and a
number of fictional narratives, book reviews and veiled anarchist
messages. Helms writes and edits most of the 40-page publication.
	   He no longer participates in jobs at Allegheny, and a few
research groups have prohibited him from participating in their
studies.
	   Helms says it's because of his magazine. ``They manufacture
reasons to get rid of me,'' he said. ``It's discrimination against
an activist.''
	   But at least some guinea pigs welcome what he's doing.
	   ``I think it's nice... . It's almost like being in a labor
union,'' said Don Layton, 26, a video store manager who makes dlrs
3,000 a year extra from participating in research. ``Someone's
looking out for the guinea pigs now.''

With handshake, major Protestant and Catholic parties join forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With a handshake, David Trimble
and Seamus Mallon have launched a fragile partnership between
Northern Ireland's two largest Protestant and Catholic parties.
	   Trimble, considered a hard-liner when he was elected leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party three years ago, and Mallon, long toiling
in the shadow of his Social Democratic and Labor Party leader John
Hume, will try to guide the Northern Ireland peace agreement to
fruition.
	   They were jointly elected on a 61-27 vote after groundbreaking
debate at Wednesday's opening session of the Belfast Assembly, the
main pillar of April's agreement among eight parties.
	   ``I know in my heart that this is the opportunity for the people
in the north of Ireland once and for all to sort out our
problems,'' Mallon said.
	   In last week's election Mallon's moderate Irish Catholic party
won 24 seats on 22 percent of the vote, while Trimble's British
Protestant party managed to get 28 seats with 21.3 percent.
	   The results entitled Trimble to the top ``first minister'' post.
But his hold over Protestant opinion is vulnerable because 28 other
Protestant Assembly members are committed to hampering the
agreement.
	   While Trimble officially has higher rank than Mallon, in
practice _ just as in the wider Assembly _ decisions can only be
taken if both sides approve.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, during his visit to China,
telephoned Trimble and Hume to congratulate them on Wednesday's
election, and urged them to work together to prevent any more
violence.
	   Wednesday's first session shattered other taboos, as Protestant
politicians in Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party zealously
tossed insults across the table with Martin McGuinness and Gerry
Adams, leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   Paisley, 72, who had never engaged in face-to-face debate with
Sinn Fein before, emphasized he hadn't gone back on his policy of
boycotting Sinn Fein. He drew a distinction between negotiating
with the party, which he refused to do by withdrawing from the
negotiations last year, and ``condemning them and exposing them.''
	   The Assembly won't meet again until Sept. 14, then faces a
six-week deadline to make fundamental decisions on which parties
should hold which positions in a 12-member administration, to be
called the Executive, with Trimble and Mallon at the helm.
	   The Executive is supposed to take gradual control of six
departments run by the British government since 1972, when Northern
Ireland's Protestant-dominated Parliament was abolished. They
include finance, economic development, health and education.

Dogfish in danger of being overfished, fisheries folk say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAISLEY DODDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Dogfish have long been considered the dogs of the
sea _ a junk catch used as fertilizer filler and cheap fillets in
fish and chips.
	   Not anymore.
	   Too many female dogfish are now being caught and sold off to
international buyers, reducing the chances for the species to
reproduce.
	   According to regulatory officials, six times more spiny dogfish
are now being caught compared to 10 years ago.
	   So to help rebuild the stock, the Northeast Fishery Management
Council is considering a set of restrictions that would limit the
dogfish catch and set trip limits for fishermen.
	   The fish is just one of a long line of species, including cod
and flounder, to be regulated in Atlantic waters.
	   ``Three years ago, council people were telling fishermen to go
fish for dogfish because they were underutilized,'' said Stephen
Barndollar, who runs Seatrade International in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. The dealership sells dogfish to European dealers.
	   ``Now they're coming up with all these restrictions,'' he said.
	   One management suggestion already getting criticism from
fishermen is a quota.
	   In 1996, 28,000 tons of dogfish were caught from Florida to
Maine, and most of it was sold overseas, Barndollar said. One of
the proposals involves a quota of 4,600 tons per year.
	   Once that quota is reached, fishermen would not be allowed to
fish for any more dogfish in that year.
	   ``There's never been any restriction on dogfish,'' said Andrew
Applegate, a staff biologist for the council. ``If we allow mature
dogfish to be heavily fished, we're going to lose the opportunity
to rebuild the stock.''
	   Dogfish, a spiny cousin to the shark, has soft, white meat and
is more popular among Europeans. The fish, also called Cape Shark,
are slowgrowing, can live for about 50 years, and produce an
average of 12 young every two years.
	   Some fish, like cod, produce millions of eggs every year.
	   ``They (regulatory officials) were talking about an 85 percent
reduction, but these restrictions are going to kill the fishery,''
said Chris Hickman, who fishes for dogfish and other species, out
of Hatteras, North Carolina.
	   Like many dogfish fisherman, Hickman depends on his dogfish
catch for more than half of his annual income. He says if a quota
is imposed, it will become difficult for him to earn a decent
living.
	   ``During the winter months, I really rely on dogfish,'' he said.
``I'll have to fish for something else but all of these management
plans have a cumulative effect.''
	   In the past several years, quotas and trip limits have been
imposed for other fish, such as scup and cod.
	   Last year, dogfish fishermen sold more than dlrs 25 million
worth of the species to international buyers. The average cost per
pound was between dlrs 1.15 and dlrs 1.20.
	   ``If you take that away these guys are going to lose out
substantially,'' said Barndollar.
	   The New England Fishery Management Council will finalize the
proposals and is expected to schedule public hearings in the next
two months.

Officials meet to finalize bank rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meetings on final plan; ADDS detail, byline
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese officials headed into a final round of
meetings Thursday to work out the details of a plan to rescue the
country's debt-laden banks and pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The meetings were expected to last most of the day, but the
Cabinet and prime minister's office had scheduled press conferences
in the evening for their formal announcements.
	   Expectations that the bank rescue plan will bolster Japan's
sagging economy strengthened the yen against the U.S. dollar and
sent stock prices up in early trading.
	   The markets reacted positively on the hope that the moves mean
Tokyo is seriously trying to clean up its financial system. Some
traders warned, however, that players may quickly move to sell the
yen for the dollar after the announcement.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party had been studying various proposals for a so-called bridge
bank system to clean up mountains of bad loans in the nation's
banking system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   The bridge bank concept was first used by the U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. in the late 1980s to deal with a spate of
bank failures following the savings and loan debacle.
	   Japan's financial institutions are saddled with 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans left from the collapse in the early
1990s of the ``bubble'' created by rampant stock and real estate
speculation.
	   Hashimoto's government has been scrambling to put the plan
together since it pledged aggressive action to clean up ailing
banks at a meeting of international finance officials last month.
	   Also adding to the ruling party's sense of urgency is a set of
elections on July 12 for the upper house of Japan's bicameral
Parliament. Scoring points on the economy is seen as critical if
the party is to come out of those elections victorious.
	   An outline of the plan published in the morning edition of the
Nihon Keizai financial daily said the first stage of he rescue
would involve establishing ``government-managed bridge banks,''
while the second would entail ``public, or government-owned, bridge
banks.''
	   Under the system, government officials would be sent to manage a
failed institution until a buyer was found or its assets were sold.

Plan involving Becker for new tour fails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Repeating protectively: &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A plan by Boris Becker and a Swiss
company to create a new men's tennis tour has been rejected, and
the ATP Tour instead announced more modest changes Wednesday.
	   The marketing company Prisma sought to create a circuit that
would replace the men's ATP Tour. Becker represented Prisma at a
clandestine meeting with chairmen of the four Grand Slams, but they
rejected the proposal, the Evening Standard of London reported.
	   The meeting took place this spring after the ATP rejected a
three-year television package proposed by Prisma.
	   ``Have Becker and Prisma been around making inquiries?
Absolutely,'' said Mark Miles, chief executive officer of the ATP
Tour. ``Do I think it has any chance of getting anywhere? No.
Period.''
	   The ATP announced four-year marketing agreements Wednesday with
ISL, a Swiss company that handles World Cup marketing, and Octagon,
a London business involved in sports marketing. The deals will
increase revenue for men's tennis by about 30 percent, the ATP
said, though the agreements are less lucrative than Prisma's
proposal.
	   The ATP also said plans have been finalized to change the men's
ranking system in 2000. A new points race will begin each January,
and the system that counts results from the previous 52 weeks will
be abandoned.
	   Under the new system, top-ranked Pete Sampras would instead be
No. 12 this week, more accurately reflecting his slump in the first
six months of 1998.
	   Sampras said he favored the change because it makes the rankings
easier to follow.
	   ``To have a race, and whoever has the most points at the end of
the year is No. 1, I think that's the simplest way for everyone to
understand it,'' Sampras said.
	   The tour's nine top-tier events will remain unchanged. Top
players will be required to play in all top-tier tournaments as
well as the Grand Slams, and those events will weigh more heavily
in the rankings.
	   The ATP is continuing to pursue a proposal for combined
tournaments with the women's tour in Hamburg, Rome and Canada. Bart
McGuire, chief executive officer of the WTA Tour, said last week
the women are interested in the idea.
	   The ATP also announced plans to discontinue up to 10 small
tournaments, which will streamline the men's calendar and create
more flexibility in the schedule. Tournaments to be affected
weren't disclosed.
	   Miles said he had discussed possible changes in the tour with
Becker, the winner of six Grand Slams.
	   ``We have talked over the months about the plans we announced
today, and he was very supportive _ right up until we parted
company with Prisma,'' Miles said.
	   Miles said Prisma's TV package was rejected in part because the
company proposed pay-per-view telecasts.
	   ``We believe in the best possible broadest exposure,'' Miles
said, ``especially for our best tennis in our top tournaments.''
	   Prisma's plan also would have diminished the importance of
dozens of small tournaments, the ATP said.
	   A Wimbledon spokesman had no comment Wednesday on the proposal
made by Prisma and Becker to the Grand Slam chairmen.

Commission lifts its moratorium on sanctions against Swiss banks

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ California was set to become the first state to
impose sanctions against Swiss banks holding assets of Holocaust
survivors after a commission of U.S. finance officials said no
negotiated solution to the situation was at hand.
	   The commission on Wednesday lifted its moratorium on sanctions
because talks between the banks and Holocaust survivors seeking
their families' assets ``have reached a total stone-like impasse,''
said commission chairman Alan Hevesi.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stonewalled survivors and their heirs after
World War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   On Thursday, California will become the first state to impose
sanctions.
	   California State Treasurer Matt Fong, who oversees dlrs 32
billion in state funds, said his state will not be seeking any new
contracts with U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks.
	   New York State, which with California has the largest pension
funds linked to Swiss banks, will decide on Thursday how and when
its sanctions will be imposed, Hevesi said.
	   In New York City, Credit Suisse manages about dlrs 1 billion in
investments for municipal pension funds. Swiss banks also handle
overnight investments and letters of credit for the city, and
frequently underwrite municipal bond offerings.
	   If there was a surprise announcement from the Swiss banks,
Hevesi said the committee might reconsider its recommendations.The
commission represents more than 800 U.S. state and local officials
who have the power to withhold government business from major Swiss
banks with American branches.
	   Robert O'Brien, managing director of the Credit Suisse in New
York, speaking for UBS, a recent merger of Swiss Bank Corp. and
Union Bank, said ``Our two organizations have done the right thing.
There's no basis for taking action. We are still very actively
concerned about maintaining a dialogue.''
	   The two banks said the proposed sanctions ``are completely
unjustified and will only serve to further polarize the parties,
destroying any chance for a prompt resolution.''
	   In Washington, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who
mediated months of negotiations between the two sides, said he
hopes failure to reach an agreement ``will not lead to
recrimination and hardening of positions on both sides.''
	   However, he said, the U.S. government believes that the
imposition of sanctions ``may lead to an opposite reaction which
will delay still further the resolution of these issues.''
	   Melvyn Weiss, lawyer for more than 31,000 plaintiffs in a
class-action against Swiss banks, said ``there's a virulent cancer
throughout the Swiss society.''
	   ``We gave them an opportunity to get rid of it (the cancer) with
a massive dose of radiation at a cost that is very small _ and
they've turned it down.''
	   Weiss said he was referring to Jewish groups' proposal that the
Swiss agree to a dlrs 1.5 billion global settlement to cover claims
against all Swiss banks and the Swiss government.
	   The Swiss banks made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of dlrs 600
million last month.

Experts, activists call for practical action against needle-spread
</HEADLINE>
HIV
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC;

 &UR; Repeating protectively: &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Delegates at the World AIDS Congress Wednesday
urged that the number of needle-exchange programs be increased
worldwide to halt the rising spread of the AIDS virus through drug
injection.
	   But poverty and a collapse in drug prices, along with an
increase in drug trafficking and harsh government attitudes in many
countries, stand in the way of curbing the problem, they said.
	   In some countries, infection through drug use accounts for more
HIV infections than sex.
	   ``The law-and-order approach has not been successful in
eliminating drug use,'' said Palani Narayan of Thailand-based group
Asian Harm Reduction Network.
	   A U.N. report last week said in Malaysia, Vietnam and other
countries, three-quarters of recorded HIV cases are among drug
addicts. In the last two years, four out of five new HIV infections
in Russia have been among the same group, it said.
	   Even encouraging people to buy clean needles is ``easier said
than done'' in Asian slums, Narayan said. ``There is a need to
recognize drug users as citizens.''
	   Gerry Stimson of Imperial College, London, and Moruf Adelekan of
Nigeria's University of Ilorin both noted the risk of increased HIV
infections as heroin and cocaine use spread to poorer parts of
society in developing countries.
	   In Nigeria, injection is still generally confined to a few
middle-class people who have no problem obtaining clean needles,
Adelekan said.
	   He warned that a depressed economic climate and a collapse in
drug prices could help spread the practice of injecting drugs.
	   ``It's a good opportunity to catch it at this level,'' he said.
	   Several speakers agreed that far too few needle-exchange
programs were in place.
	   ``We have been hitting our heads against a brick wall for
several years (in Asia)'' Narayan said, stoppingto praise programs
in Vietnam and India.
	   In 1997, 116 countries reported cases of intravenous drug use
and 96 of those reported HIV cases connected to drug injection,
according to the World Health Organization.
	   In April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
pushed through legislation that would permanently ban federal
funding of needle exchanges, saying those programs jeopardize the
battle against drugs.

Muhammad Ali to attend AFL final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Muhammad Ali has accepted an
invitation to attend this year's Australian Rules football final,
but there are no plans yet to include him in an official role.
	   The three-time world heavyweight champion was invited by
Australian businessman Anthony Pratt, who said Ali's wife confirmed
the visit Thursday.
	   Ali's contribution to the Atlanta Olympics, where he lit the
flame at the opening ceremony, was the highlight of the games.
	   ``There are no plans for him to be part of the AFL final, but if
somebody put forward a proposal we would look at it, as we would
look at a lot of proposals,'' AFL spokeswoman Jenny Cooke said
Thursday.
	   Pratt said he met Ali in 1996 and they became friends and the
fighter and his wife had attended his wedding.
	   ``At my wedding a bloke who used to play for the (AFL club)
Footscray was there and he asked Muhammad whether he would be the
number one ticket holder at Footscray,'' Pratt said.
	   ``Muhammad Ali kind of just, I don't think he understood what
sort of football he was talking about and they talked about
Australian Rules being a game where they don't wear shoulder pads.
I remember Muhammad saying - do they break bones?''
	   Pratt said Ali would arrive Sept. 23 and return on Sept. 27.

In about turn, Blair to publish ``Diana'' land mine bill

 &UR; With BC-Britain-Diana's Grave
 &UR; Repeating protectively: &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Completing an about-turn on Princess Diana's
birthday, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday that a bill to
ratify an international treaty banning land mines will be published
next week.
	   ``If legislation is completed in July, as we wish it to be, then
we will be amongst the first 40 nations to ratify _ as we promised
to do,'' Blair told the House of Commons.
	   The government said mid-June there was no parliamentary time to
ratify the treaty in time for the Aug. 31 anniversary of Diana's
death in a Paris car crash. The treaty was signed in Ottawa in
December by 100 nations, including Britain, but not the United
States.
	   Several legislators attracted publicity by campaigning for
ratification by the anniversary as a tribute to Diana, who espoused
the cause of eradicating land mines and visited victims in Angola
and Bosnia.
	   The government then said it would get the treaty ratified before
the anniversary, if necessary with special sittings. Parliament
usually rises for a recess of about 10 weeks late July or early
August.
	   Blair was replying Wednesday _ which would have been Diana's
37th birthday _ to a lawmaker who raised the issue in the House of
Commons.
	   Earlier, Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, opened to the public a
Diana Museum at the family's ancestral home, Althorp.

Hanson: Figures faked to cover Australia's ``Asianization''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist leader Pauline
Hanson on Thursday accused the government of falsifying official
immigration figures to cover up the ``Asianization'' of Australia.
	   ``Our leaders are deceiving the Australian public by not
disclosing the true figures,'' the leader of the One Nation party
told Channel 9 TV.
	   One Nation immigration spokeswoman Robyn Spencer said the real
annual immigration figures for Australia were 159,000, not the
85,000 quoted in government figures.
	   ``The government figures do not include many categories. They
don't include New Zealanders for instance; just two years ago we
had 25,000 of those,'' Spencer said.
	   One Nation also said 70 percent of Australia's migrant intake
was Asian.
	   Quoting a leading Canberra demographer, Dr. Charles Price,
Hanson said Australia would be 27 percent Asian in 25 years.
	   ``Dr. Price estimated Australia would have 27 percent Asian
(population) in 23 to 25 years and we are talking about it because
we want to have a right to protect our ethnicity and racial culture
here,'' Hanson said.
	   Australian Bureau of Statistics projections show that by 2030 to
2040, the total percentage of all Australians of Asian ethnicity
would be 7 percent, figures Spencer described as a total sham.
	   ``As soon as (illegal migrants) get to the airport they destroy
their passports, any identification whatsoever, claim refugee
status, and they are extras here in Australia,'' she said.
	   Hanson said 500 Asian immigrants came through Sydney Airport
alone every week.
	   ``Security people at airports tell me they are pulling up
illegal immigrants all the time and Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock knows this is going on,'' she said.
	   Hanson said she was not against Asians coming to Australia.
	   ``I had an Asian girl who worked in my (fish and chips) shop for
four months who was absolutely wonderful, and I have Asian
friends,'' she said.
	   ``But do you think that people who have come here from Poland,
England, Germany, want to come out to a country that's been
Asianized? They would have gone to Asia if they wanted this.''
	   Speaking on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, Hanson declared
her immigration policy was non-discriminatory but said existing
arrangements had got ``out of whack'' with the blowout in Asian
arrivals in the period 1984-1995.
	   She said people were not comfortable with the current situation
as existed in places such as Cabramatta in Sydney and Surfers
Paradise, Queensland, where signs in Asian languages abounded.
	   ``Between 1984 and 1995, of all the immigrants coming to
Australia, 40 percent were Asian.
	   ``All I have ever said is that I want the balance restored.
Asians have and always will have a presence in Australia but there
must be a balance there.''
	   Hanson said many Australians felt very uncomfortable in
neighborhoods where the Asian presence was most noticeable.
	   ``The place I have in mind is Cabramatta because a lot of people
feel unsafe. They don't want to go there; they can't read the signs
on the shops; they don't know whether they are walking into a
butcher or hairdresser,'' she said.
	   ``Surfers Paradise is another example. A lot of Australian
tourists from down south, even Melbourne, have said they will not
go back to Surfers Paradise again because they feel like they are a
foreigner in their own land.''

Lees gather in Boston for one last family reunion before the
</HEADLINE>
millennium &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL LUO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Imagine a family with almost 100 million members
worldwide. Lined up side-by-side for a family photo, the relatives
would stretch one and a half times around the world.
	   Lee (or Li, depending on the Chinese transliteration) recently
edged out Chang (or Zhang) as the largest surname in China, and,
therefore, the world.
	   Nearly 500 Lees, representing more than 20 chapters of the Lee
Family Association throughout the United States, Canada, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and China, are meeting in Boston this week for their last
family reunion of the millennium.
	   The family is so big, it even has its own credit union _ worth
dlrs 22 million _ and maintains an extensive array of real estate
holdings.
	   It's all part of keeping things in the family, said Yon Lee,
English secretary of the Lee Family Association of New England.
	   The Lees are serious about their claim of relatedness. They say
they are all descended from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao
Tzu, founder of Taoism, who lived 2,500 years ago.
	   A figurine of Lao Tzu sits atop the Lee Family Temple in the
city's Chinatown neighborhood. Lees pay as much as dlrs 3,000 to
have tablets of their deceased ancestors placed in the temple.
	   It is considered taboo to marry another Lee.
	   ``Technically speaking, when you're married to a Lee, you're not
expanding. You're downsizing. You have to bring other surnames into
the flock,'' said Yon Lee.
	   But prolific mating is not the reason behind the exorbitant
number of Lees in the world.
	   Steven Lee, National Grand President of the Lee Family
Association, traces the explosive growth of the family back about
1,300 years to the Tang dynasty, when an emperor named Lee bestowed
his surname upon favored subjects.
	   ``At that time, it was an honor to be a Lee,'' said Steven Lee.
``The emperor said, `If you're loyal to me, good soldier, I give
you the last name, Lee.'''
	   The family association itself dates back to the 1800s, when
Chinese first arrived in the United States to work as laborers on
the transcontinental railroad.
	   Facing a hostile foreign environment, Chinese of similar
background or surname formed social support organizations.
	   ``The family association acted like an extended family'' said
Wilson Lee, who is president of the New England chapter of Lees.
	   The associations provided emigrants with everything from food to
shelter to medical treatment.
	   And if a Lee passed away, they would arrange to have his remains
sent home.
	   Today, in an age when many Chinese-Americans are quickly losing
touch with their heritage, the family associations are seeking to
reinvent themselves to avoid extinction.
	   ``What can we offer the young people?'' said Wilson Lee, who
hopes to succeed Steven Lee as Grand National President.
	   One of his ideas is to establish a host family program in which
young high school-age Lees visiting colleges, for example, could
stay with another Lee family.
	   ``We can still serve the purpose of an extended family,'' said
Lee. ``We can offer them a home away from home.''
	   The associations may also play a role in the political future of
Chinese-Americans.
	   In fact, the highest-ranking Asian-American in the Clinton
administration is civil rights chief, Bill Lann Lee.
	   In Asia, Lees wield even more political clout. There's Lee
Teng-Hui, president of Taiwan; Li Peng, former premier of China;
and Lee Kuan-Yew, former prime minister of Singapore.
	   With 100 million Lees worldwide _ and 100,000 in the United
States _ the Lee clan hopes to one day be a political force that
puts the prominent U.S. family, the Kennedys, to shame.

Langer rejects London to stay with Brisbane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Star rugby league scrum-half Allan
Langer has rejected an approach from London Broncos to sign a
further two-year deal with Brisbane.
	   Langer, the outstanding player and Queensland captain in the
recent State of Origin series against New South Wales, said he
accepted a pay cut to stay in Brisbane.
	   Langer, 32, was wanted by Virgin boss Richard Branson's London
club to help redingote fading interest in the code in the city.
	   Brisbane chief executive Shane spark described the contract
signing as one of the most significant in the club's history.
Langer has played 11 seasons with the club since its inception in
1988.

Hong Kong eager for Clinton visit to counter negative perceptions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Some pictures are worth a thousand words. Hong
Kong officials hope that others will be worth millions of dollars.
	   The president of the United States cruising Hong Kong Harbor at
dusk _ the lights of skyscrapers and huge neon signs illuminating a
vibrant cityscape of cosmopolitan pleasures _ is, they hope, one of
those priceless images.
	   President Bill Clinton was coming to Hong Kong late Thursday and
Friday to close out his grand tour of China.
	   Tourism, responsible for one in every eight jobs in Hong Kong,
has suffered since the territory returned to Chinese rule a year
ago. Overall, it remains down more than 20 percent.
	   One reason is Asia's economic downturn: many Asians simply don't
have the money to travel.
	   But tourism officials also are worried about a perception in the
rest of the world that Hong Kong has changed irrevocably since 150
years of British colonial rule ended.
	   The consensus in the former colony is that it isn't much
different from the energetic mix of East and West that it always
was, and the changes are not a result of the handover.
	   Tourism couldn't ask for a better way to make that point than
warm-and-fuzzy pictures of Clinton and his family enjoying
themselves in the thriving metropolis at the end of their long tour
of China.
	   ``It's worth billions in advertising,'' said Hong Kong Tourist
Association spokesman Peter Randall. ``Hong Kong is back on the
world stage.''
	   That is particularly important as Hong Kong marks the July 1
anniversary of the change of its sovereign rulers. Potential
travelers need to be reminded that the territory ``hasn't floated
away, hasn't been swallowed up by mainland China,'' Randall said.
	   Although Clinton's itinerary isn't official, he is widely
expected to take a tour of Hong Kong's harbor, one of the busiest
in the world, around dusk Friday before leaving for the United
States.
	   While Asians aren't traveling, the U.S. economy is strong.
Tourism officials are particular about what potential tourists in
the United States think of Hong Kong. Arrivals from North America
were down 15 percent in the first five months of the year, to just
more than 300,000.
	   Tourism officials say a recent survey of North Americans
indicates that those who visited Hong Kong both before and after
the handover found it virtually unchanged. Those who visited only
after the handover found it to be a better destination than they
had expected, researchers said.
	   Even such critics as Martin Lee, outspoken proponent of more
democracy for Hong Kong, agrees that the worst fears regarding the
handover have not been borne out so far.
	   While long-term worries persist, China has allowed Hong Kong
largely to run its own affairs.
	   The big changes are economic, and many have to do with Asia's
woes.
	   There are sales everywhere. Several thousand people who work in
hotels or retail trade have lost their jobs because of the tourism
downturn. Overall, unemployment is at a 15-year high, and the
economy is just entering what is likely a protracted recession.
	   The Hong Kong that Clinton sees, however, probably will show
little evidence of the problems. It remains a world-class center of
commerce and banking. Chauffeur-driven Rolls Royces and other
luxury cars still sweep through the streets. The cuisine of Canton
and other regions of China is among the best anywhere, and
top-class international restaurants and hotels abound.

	   ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
talked by telephone with Northern Ireland Protestant and Catholic
leaders to congratulate them on their joint election victory.
	   Clinton, while touring China, talked with David Trimble of the
Ulster Unionist Party and Social Democratic and Labor Party leader
John Hume, whose deputy, Seamus Mallon, will share power with
Trimble in the new Belfast Assembly.
	   Trimble and Mallon were jointly elected on a 61-27 vote at
Wednesday's opening session of the assembly, set up in a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement to provide some self-government for
the British province.
	   A senior administration official, speaking on background aboard
Air Force One en route to Guilin, said Clinton also discussed with
the Irish Protestant and Catholic leaders his concerns about
possible violence during a planned march this weekend in Belfast.
	   ``The president urged both of them to try and work together ...
to defuse the situation,'' the official said.

Despite China's gains, Clinton delivers environmental warning

 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ With the fabled limestone peaks of Guilin
as a backdrop, U.S. President Bill Clinton brought a stern
environmental warning to China: it soon will have the ``unfortunate
distinction'' of replacing America as the world's No. 1 producer of
greenhouse gases.
	   Clinton picked this picture postcard Chinese village to urge
China to shed its reputation as one of the most polluted places on
Earth and to offer U.S. help to improve.
	   Arriving Thursday from Shanghai, Clinton had meetings scheduled
with U.S. and Chinese environmental experts.
	   He said Wednesday that a major legacy of his visit will be
U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the environment _ something that ``ten
years from now people will look back and say that's one of the
biggest things they did.''
	   In a speech to American business leaders, Clinton urged China to
clean up corruption, open trade markets and combat the
environmental catastrophe hanging over the world's most populous
country. He said it was wrong to believe _ as many do _ ``that
there is an iron, unbreakable link between economic growth and
industrial-age energy practices. ... It is simply not true.''
	   The president was accorded a third opportunity of national media
exposure in a taped interview with state television CCTV. He was
asked friendly questions and sidestepped whether he or President
Jiang Zemin has a tougher job.
	   With the end of the Cold War, Clinton said, ``America has this
role which is temporary _ it won't last forever _ as the only
superpower in the world.''
	   He said the world ``needs a leader but not in the sense of one
country telling everyone else what to do.''
	   Clinton's stop on Thursday in Guilin put him amid the splendor
of cloud-shrouded mountains and winding rivers that have inspired
artists for thousands of years, a contrast to the high-rise modern
structures of Shanghai.
	   After floods along the Li River, the government sent in 5,000
soldiers to clean up the mud-coated banks. The troops hauled away
20 tons of drift and sludge to improve things for Clinton.
	   After a river boat ride, the president will fly to Hong Kong,
last stop on his nine-day tour of China.
	   Jiang will wrap up a visit to Hong Kong _ marking the first
anniversary of the handover from British rule _ just hours before
Clinton arrives.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alex Gonzalez hit a go-ahead, three-run homer in
an eight-run eighth inning as the Toronto Blue Jays had their
biggest offensive day of the season, beating the New York Mets
15-10 Wednesday on Canada Day.
	   Toronto, which won for the eighth time in 10 games, scored its
most runs since July 13, 1996, when it beat Milwaukee 15-7. The
eight-run inning tied the club record set at Minnesota in a 14-8
win on May 28, 1986.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo homered twice for the Mets.
 &UR; Padres 8, Athletics 4
	   In Oakland, California, Greg Vaughn hit his 28th homer, a
controversial three-run shot, and Kevin Brown got his 10th win.
	   Quilvio Veras added a two-run single and Tony Gwynn, Ken
Caminiti and Jim Leyritz all had RBI singles for the Padres.
	   Vaughn, named an NL All-Star reserve before the game, only got
credit for his fourth-inning homer after an appeal to the umpires _
who first ruled the ball had hit the center-field wall and was in
play.
	   Vaughn, who ended up at third, and the Padres argued it had
bounced off a camera booth beyond the wall, and the umpires
eventually agreed.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Diamondbacks 4
	   In Chicago, rookie Kerry Wood, left off the National League
All-Star team, struck out 13 in eight innings to lead the Cubs over
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Wood (8-3), backed by fans who hung ``K's'' around Wrigley Field
for each strikeout, improved to 6-0 in eight starts at home. He
gave up a one-out single in the third, a leadoff single in the
fourth and a leadoff triple in the seventh.
 &UR; Tigers 9, Pirates 1
	   In Pittsburgh, Seth Greisinger held Pittsburgh to five hits over
eight innings for his first major league victory as the Detroit
Tigers beat the slumping Pirates.
	   The Pirates were in danger of being shut out for the third time
in four games until scoring in the eighth on Doug Strange's
sacrifice fly.
	   Bobby Higginson had a two-run double in a three-run fifth inning
marked by some sloppy Pirates' defense, and run-scoring singles by
Damion Easley and Gabe Alvarez keyed a two-run first against Chris
Peters (3-6).
 &UR; Red Sox 6, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Bret Saberhagen pitched seven innings of three-hit
ball and Nomar Garciaparra extended his hitting streak to 22 games
for Boston.
	   Saberhagen (10-5) retired the first 10 batters and had still
faced the minimum before Shane Andrews homered with one out in the
sixth. That was the only run allowed by the two-time Cy Young Award
winner, who struck out five and walked none.
	   Dustin Hermanson (6-7) lasted just 4 2-3 innings, allowing five
runs and eight hits. He walked five, and two of his runs were
unearned as the Expos had one error, a passed ball and two wild
pitches.
 &UR; Twins 2, Reds 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Brad Radke, Minnesota's lone All-Star
representative, got his ninth win as the Twins halted Cincinnati's
five-game winning streak.
	   Radke (9-6) allowed nine hits and struck out four in six innings
after being named to his first All-Star team earlier in the day.
Rick Aguilera pitched a perfect ninth for his 17th save.
	   Pokey Reese went 3-for-3 for the Reds.
 &UR; Braves 6, Devil Rays 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Chipper Jones' second homer of the
game _ a two-run, two-out shot off Roberto Hernandez in the ninth
inning _ gave the Atlanta Braves a victory over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays.
	   Jones lined a 1-1 pitch over the right-field wall after Walt
Weiss singled off Hernandez (0-3), who was trying to protect a 5-4
lead the Devil Rays took with two runs in the eighth.
	   The homer was the 20th of the season for Jones, who hit a solo
shot off Julio Santana in the first inning.
 &UR; Yankees 5, Phillies 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Tino Martinez homered and drove in four runs, and
David Wells celebrated his first All-Star selection by pitching the
New York Yankees past the Philadelphia Phillies.
	   The Yankees won for the sixth time in seven games and improved
to 12-3 against NL teams, the best interleague mark in the majors.
Scott Rolen homered for the Phillies, who lost their fourth in a
row.
	   Wells (11-2) was among five Yankees picked for the AL All-Star
team earlier in the day. Coming off a shutout at Atlanta, he gave
up one earned run in seven innings to win for the eighth time in
nine starts.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Orioles 3 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Livan Hernandez won his fourth straight decision
as the Florida Marlins handed the Baltimore Orioles their eighth
straight loss.
	   Florida scored two runs in the first inning without a hit and
never trailed en route to its ninth win in 13 games. The Marlins
are 5-0 against Baltimore over two seasons and their 20-10
interleague record during that span is the best in the majors.
	   Hernandez (7-4) gave up three runs and 10 hits in 7 2-3
innings.
 &UR; Indians 5, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, All-Stars Jim Thome and Omar Vizquel drove in two
runs apiece and Kenny Lofton had three hits as the Cleveland
Indians snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   Dave Burba (10-5) allowed two runs and four hits in 6 2-3
innings, and Mike Jackson pitched the ninth for his 18th save.
	   Lofton added a season-high three steals and scored twice for
Cleveland, which had four All-Star reserves named Wednesday by
Indians manager Mike Hargrove, the AL manager.

Tokyo shares jump on hopes for banking system, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices jumped Thursday morning on
optimism that the government will soon act to stabilize Japan's
banking system. The U.S. dollar was slightly higher against the
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 328.52 points, or 2.00
percent, to 16,691.41 points at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the index soared 532.62 points, or 3.36 percent, rising
for the sixth day in a row in a streak that has seen the benchmark
gain nearly 9 percent.
	   Expectations that a government rescue plan for banks will boost
Japan's weak economy helped bolster sentiment on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, traders said.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's governing Liberal Democratic
Party has been studying various proposals for a so-called ``bridge
bank'' system to clean up a pile of bad loans in the nation's
banking system and keep credit flowing to healthy borrowers.
	   News of the plan has created the impression among investors that
Tokyo was seriously moving to mend its debt-ridden banking system.
Details were to be announced later Thursday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 15.80 points, or 1.24 percent, to 1,286.55.
The TOPIX had gained 40.37 points, or 3.18 percent, the previous
day.
	   Major Japanese newspapers said Thursday that Hashimoto was
considering making temporary tax cuts permanent to boost consumer
spending.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar advanced slightly after players
who earlier sold the currency bought it back amid caution ahead of
the bank announcement.
	   In midday trading, the dollar bought 138.35 yen, up 0.11 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York
rate of 138.07 yen overnight.
	   The dollar also gained ground against the German mark, boosted
by renewed worries over Russia's economy and diminishing prospects
for a rise interest rates in Germany.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.385 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.380 percent, driving its price down to 110.58 yen from 110.62
yen.

Suspected drug dealer to be extradited, pending appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The Federal Court Thursday ordered a
Hobart businessman be extradited to Germany to face charges of drug
trading.
	   However, the court ordered a 15-day stay so Gregory Parker, 59,
could seek special leave to appeal against the extradition order to
the High Court.
	   German authorities originally issued a warrant for Polish-born
Parker's arrest in 1991, alleging he was part of a gang trading in
drugs in various parts of Germany between 1989 and 1991.
	   A Hobart magistrate ordered his extradition but on appeal,
Federal Court judge Peter Heerey overturned the decision.
	   The Australian government, on behalf of Germany, then appealed
and in Thursday's decision the Federal Court overturned Justice
Heerey's judgment.
	   Parker's lawyer Michael Hodgman said outside the court that the
decision was based on ``very technical'' law which raised important
issues that needed to go to the High Court.
	   Hodgman said Parker, an Australian citizen, insisted that he had
not committed the crimes with which he is charged and the evidence
submitted by the German authorities ``wouldn't last two minutes in
an Australian court.''

Coral ``bleached'' along Thai coast; El Nino blamed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIRAPORN WONGPAITHOON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The El Nino weather phenomenon is
believed to have played a role in ``bleaching'' coral in the Gulf
of Thailand, which causes the underwater formations to lose their
colors and weakens them, sometimes fatally.
	   The bleaching, which turns coral pale or white, is widespread
over most of Thailand's eastern coast, which lures tens of
thousands of divers from around the world each year.
	   Marine scientist Suraphol Sudara told The Associated Press on
Wednesday that the scale of the problem was unprecedented in this
Southeast Asian country and could have been caused by the El Nino
weather patterns.
	   He expressed concern that pollution from industrialization along
sections of the coast over the past decade would inhibit the
recovery of the bleached coral.
	   Similar widespread coral bleaching has been reported in the past
few months from such far-flung locations as East Africa, Florida
and Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
	   ``It is the first time this phenomenon has happened on such a
large scale in Gulf of Thailand,'' said Suraphol, a researcher at
Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. ``I was shocked to see scores
of formations turned white.''
	   Bleaching usually occurs when the surrounding waters turn warmer
than usual, something caused by El Nino. Suraphol said the average
water temperature in the gulf had increased from 28-29 degrees
Celsius (82-84 F) to 32 degrees (90 F).
	   What is described as bleaching is actually the absence of the
algae Zooxanthellae, which normally live in the cells of the coral,
providing coloring as well as nutrition for the structures.
	   Depending upon a range of conditions, the affected coral may
recover or die with two to three years.
	   Suraphol said coral bleaching had affected Thailand's western
coast, on the Andaman Sea, a few years ago.
	   Last month, a Kenyan scientist said unusually high sea
temperatures have damaged up to 70 percent of the coral reefs and
other marine plants at the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa.
	   Bleaching was also robbing the color from the coral reef off the
Florida Keys, said scientists there.
	   In April, Australian marine officials said the coral of the
Great Barrier Reef was suffering some of the worst damage in
recorded history.
	   High water temperatures and freshwater runoff caused coral
bleaching in reefs off Queensland, said a spokesman for the Great
Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. In some areas, up to 80 percent
of coral had reportedly been affected.

	   GUILIN, China (AP) _ Amid the craggy limestone peaks of Guilin,
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that the environment
should not be sacrificed for economic growth in China, one of the
most polluted countries on Earth.
	   Clinton came to this fabled land of cloud-shrouded mountains and
winding rivers to showcase the environmental revival of a region
once polluted but now coming back to its natural beauty. The
storybook scene here stands in contrast with China's polluted
cities.
	   Meeting with Chinese environmentalists on a sweltering day,
Clinton said that even in America ``there is a big fight'' over
environmental protection because ``there are always people who are
afraid if we take any step, it will hurt the economy.
	   He said that if Guilin wants tourists to come, ``you have to
have a clean environment. If you want a strong economy, you have to
produce healthy children. So at some point we have to see these
things together.''

Officials: Malaria outbreak in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Ministry of the Environment
Thursday reported seven new cases of malaria in Singapore,
diagnosed over the last few weeks.
	   Though the mosquito-born disease is endemic to Southeast Asia,
Singapore authorities have in recent years almost eradicated
malaria from the island-republic, limiting it to few small islands.
	   Now, the parasitic disease is making a comeback on the main
Singapore island.
	   According to the ministry, five of the recently diagnosed
victims were infected in the eastern part of Singapore, and at
least one on the Sentosa island, which is one of prime tourist
attractions here.
	   In June, malaria claimed the first fatality in Singapore this
year, after a local teenager contracted the disease on the nearby
Indonesian island of Batam.
	   Dengue fever, caused by a different type mosquito, has been in
decline over recent weeks. The total number of dengue cases reached
2,079 for the first five months of this year, up from 1,285 in the
same period last year. Some types of dengue fever can be fatal.

years of environmental mismanagement.

developing rapidly but later in time than other countries, to avoid
making the same mistakes we have made.''
	   ``Our traditional energy use that causes pollution is about
one-third in vehicles transportation, about one-third in buildings,
housing and office building, and about one-third in factories,''
Clinton said.
	   ``In China, it's probably more in factories, but it would come
toward these numbers. In the vehicles, you have opportunities'' to

Court imprisons Indonesian soldier for shooting East Timorese man

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ A military court sentenced an Indonesian
soldier to 10 years in prison Thursday for killing an East Timorese
civilian.
	   Prosecutors accused 2nd Sgt. Slamet, 23, of shooting Herman dos
Dores Soares on Tuesday in the town of Manatuto, 60 kilometers (37
miles) east of Dili, on June 16.
	   They said the victim had been collecting wood by a roadside.
	   Military officials later said they were still investigating two
other recent killings by troops in the troubled territory, invaded
by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   The slayings happened amid increased diplomatic efforts to end a
long running guerrilla war and human rights abuses in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   Troops opened fire and killed one man when rival pro and
anti-Indonesian demonstrators clashed in Manatuto on Saturday.
	   On Monday, plainclothes security officers shot a man to death
during a protest rally held as three European Union diplomats met a
local Roman Catholic bishop in Baucau, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of Dili.
	   East Timorese activists have been stepping up their campaign for
a vote on independence in the wake of the resignation last month of
President Suharto, who sent troops to invade the territory 23 years
ago.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
democratic reform in Indonesia.
	   He has offered to grant special status to East Timor and to
release a jailed guerrilla commander in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty over the territory. But he
has ruled out a referendum.

Griffey smacks No. 34 in third inning against Rockies

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 34th home run
for the Seattle Mariners in the third inning against the Colorado
Rockies on Wednesday night.
	   Griffey, who led the league with 56 homers last season, hit a
two-run shot off Mike Saipe, making his second major league start,
to give Seattle a 4-0 lead.
	   Griffey's 34 home runs tied Frank Howard for the third-most
homers prior to the All-Star break. Howard had 34 for the
Washington Senators before the All-Star break in 1969.
	   When Griffey hit his 56 homers last season, he had 30 before the
All-Star break.
