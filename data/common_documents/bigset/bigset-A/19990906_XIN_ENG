<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Israel to Comply With New Wye Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat called on Israel Sunday to sincerly
implement the revised version of the Wye agreement signed on
Sunday in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Rome where he briefed Pope John Paul II on
the document, Arafat told reporters at his office here Sunday
evening that the new accord "entrusts us with a new responsibility
to go on the way."
</P>
<P>
Arafat recalled the Berlin Declaration, the address of United
States President Bill Clinton last April and the message he
received from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the Berlin Declaration issued last March, the European Union
asserted support for the Palestinian people's right to
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said last April the Palestinian people had the right to
enjoy freedom on their free land.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Albright handed message to Arafat guaranteeing
Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank according to the newly-set
timetable.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in Sunday's
meeting of his cabinet which ratified the new agreement that the
agreement allows Israel to postpone the redeployment to hold more
intensive negotiations in the final status stage with the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Other Europeans to Join French Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Economy
and Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Sunday that France
welcomes other Europeans to ally with the banks of Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP) and the Societe Generale (SG), now that
they have finished their merge battle.
</P>
<P>
The BNP will take over a majority of shares of another bank,
Paribas, and will have about 38 percent of the shares of SG, after
half a year of merge battle among them.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French television channel TF1,
Strauss-Kahn said that the French government had prevented any
foreign bank or speculator from intervening during the merge
operation, in fear of destabilizing the country's financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want that at a moment when the French enterprises are
solving their own problems, they are attacked from outside,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that from now on, France welcomes its ``European
allies'' to join the BNP or SG on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the role of government in the merge
operations of enterprises was to arbitrate or mediate instead of
becoming a direct actor.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says Israel Will Not Tolerate Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak ordered a swift investigation into two ill-fated car
bombings in northern Israel Sunday afternoon, saying that Israel
would not tolerate any terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"A major incident has been averted with the perpetrators
possibly killed...The Israeli government will not tolerate any
terror act against its citizens," Barak's office said in a
statement in response to the two car bombings.
</P>
<P>
Two occupants in a car were killed and two passers-by wounded
in the first explosion in Tiberias, near the Sea of
Galilee. Minutes later, a second car bombing rocked the port city
of Haifa, killing one inside the car.
</P>
<P>
Polices said the two car bombings were possibly "terror
attacks." They said the three dead were possibly terrorists on
their way to carry out attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy expressed "serious concern"
over the two incidents, urged the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to take tough measures to curb terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and blood can not exist," he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The bombings came hours after Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat signed a deal in Egypt Saturday night to revive the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet ratified the deal by an overwhelming
majority Sunday afternoon, paving the way for the implementation
of the U.S.-brokered Wye accords, signed and then frozen by
Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The 23-member cabinet voted 21-2 to approve the agreement,
signed at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in the
presence of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky from the Yisrael b'Aliya, or
Russian immigrant party, and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy of the
Right wing National Religious Party, were the only two ministers
who voted against the deal.
</P>
<P>
The accord is the first agreement since Barak took office in
July promising to revive the peace process on all its tracks.
</P>
<P>
Barak said at the cabinet meeting that the major achievement
of the agreement was to have delayed the transfer of some land
from joint control to full Palestinian control by three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel would complete the troop
withdrawals stipulated by the Wye agreement by January 2000,
rather than by mid-November under the original Wye timeline.
</P>
<P>
Under the new deal, Israel and the Palestinians are supposed
to have entered an advance stage of permanent talks by early
2000, which would help reduce the potential risk of confrontation
between the two sides raised by the troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have set February 2000 as the target date for a
framework for the permanent talks, which deal with thorny issues
like the Palestinian statehood and Jerusalem, and September 2000
for an over-all deal aiming to end century-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militant groups Hamas and Jihad have threatened to
stage attacks against Israel to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two militant groups, which oppose the Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking, have carried out a series of suicide bombings
killing scores of Israelis since the signing of the historic Oslo
accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In less than two weeks after the Wye accords were signed in
last October, the two groups staged two failed attacks against
Israelis, one outside a bloc of Jewish settlements in Gaza and
one in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In responding to the latest peace deal, Hamas spiritual leader
Sheik Ahmed Yassin said his supporters reserved the right to
resist Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Barak's statement said the Israeli government would decide how
to react after the investigation ends, implying that the peace
process would not be halted by the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls For International Control in E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Sunday called on the
Indonesian government to allow the international community to help
restore order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that more than 100 people may have been
killed in East Timor in the violence by pro-Indonesia militias
following last week's independence vote, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said he was alarmed by the deteriorating situation in that
territory.
</P>
<P>
"If the government of Indonesia cannot get its own security
forces to restore order, it should allow the international
community to assist in securing an orderly transition to
independence in East Timor," the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would use a trip to Japan on Monday to discuss the
crisis with Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and would
also contact other regional powers while he was in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cook told BBC television from Finland, where he was
attending a meeting of European Union foreign ministers, that EU
ministers had agreed on a number of steps to ensure the Indonesian
government to ensure security in the territory.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting the right words on that out of Jakarta. As yet
we have not seen the right action on East Timor," he said, adding
that he hoped top Indonesian officials would ensure orders from
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations announced on Saturday that 78.5 percent of
East Timorese had rejected Jakarta's offer of broad autonomy,
putting the former Portuguese colony on the road to independence.

percent of its custom revenues.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report, the center estimates Morocco's losses at
about 6.8 billion dirhams (700 million U.S. dollars), on account

overall foreign trade, it was reported by Sunday's Arab daily "Al
Hayat."
</P>
<P>

<P>
He said he was very pleased to visit China again and

China, including the parliament members, for the attitude they
took towards the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs).

Kuwait insists that Iraq is still detaining over 600
Kuwaiti and third country nationals snatched on the streets by
Iraqi troops during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.

In response to the question about his specific agenda in
China, Salem said there are "a lot of things in the plates
of both sides." But he did not elaborate.

LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) - Britain on Sunday condemned the
suspected car bombings in two northern Israeli towns which killed
at least three people inside the vehicles.

He said the Middle East peace process made significant progress
on Saturday with the signing by Israel and the Palestine Authority
of the agreement to implement the Wye Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
"Such acts(the bombings) will only serve to harden the resolve
of those in the region and elsewhere in their search for a

JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (U.N.)
has selected a South African military official as one of 90 U.N.
military liaison officers (MLOs) to advise on the implementation
of a peace-keeping operation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Puso Tladi, spokesman for the Defense Ministry, said that
Colonel Hans Swart would leave Monday for Kenyan capital Nairobi
where he would start a U.N. mission induction training course
Wednesday and then leave for Ugandan capital Kampala Saturday, the
day after the course ends.
</P>
<P>
So far, 30 military liaison officers have been appointed by the
U.N. They will be deployed in different areas to deal with the DRC
 conflict and will submit a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on the security situation on the ground, which will help
establish procedures for the deployment of a full-scale
peace-keeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Swart is one of the eight officers, whose name were submitted
to the U.N. by the South African government for possible selection
as military liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether any of the other officers may be
selected at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
"Many people confuse these MLOs with observers," Tladi said,
adding that the MLOs will only come in at a later stage during the
implementation of the peace-keeping operation.
</P>
<P>
"The major task of the observers is to monitor the cease-fire,
standstill as well as the withdrawal of troops," he added.

GAZA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security agencies
have evidence that the Palestinian extremist groups Hamas and

CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday
expressed welcome to the memo for the implementation of the Wye
accord signed between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is "an important step on the road of the (Middle

Abdel-Meguid said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid underlined the importance of liberating every
inch of the occupied Palestinian territories and restoring the

</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity of an honest implementation of the
agreement without procrastination, and the respect for the

</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak signed the revised Wye accord

</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will, among other things, pull back

their hopes and aspirations, foremost the establishment of an
independent state with Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum expressed
hope that the Syrian-Israeli peace talks will be resumed from
where they were left off.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations came to a halt in early 1996
due to dispute over the Golan Heights captured by Israel from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War. The two sides have expressed
readiness to resume their peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Urges Turkey to Help Improve Climate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Sunday called on neighboring Turkey to help improve the
climate of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki, Simitis said that Greece was exercising a policy of
peace and cooperation, and Turkey should examine its own line, its
own views, and finally make a move that would help to bring a
major improvement in the climate, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
As for Greece's earthquake aid to Turkey, he said that Greece
operated a principle of assisting other countries, especially
neighboring ones, when disaster struck.
</P>
<P>
Greece's principle was friendship and cooperation among peoples
and the earthquake in northwestern Turkey could not be viewed as
an opportunity, because that would make a mockery of Greece's
policy, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greece Sunday welcomed acceptance by
the European Union (EU) foreign ministers of its proposal that
Turkey should receive reconstruction aid after the earthquake from
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The aid will reportedly be nearly 200 million euros in the
form of grants and another 600 million euros in loans from the
European Investments Bank.
</P>
<P>
For years, Greece, which has a strained relations with Turkey,
has blocked the more than 1-billion U.S. dollars EU financial aid
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has this week signalled it would support short-and
long-term aid being prepared by the EU in response to the
devastating August 17 earthquake in the neighboring country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Central Bank Withdraws Notice From Local Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the country's
central bank, on Sunday withdrew its show-cause notice from the
board of directors of a private bank recognizing the management
under its chairman, who was reportedly forced to resign last
month, as the legal authority of the bank.
</P>
<P>
"Only a return of normalcy and restoration of confidence of the
public and deposition in the bank has now caused the Bangladesh
Bank to withdraw the notice dated August 27, 1999," said a central
bank order addressed to Mr. Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury whom the center
bank addressed as the "chairman of the board of directors" of the
United Commercial Bank LTD (UCBL).
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank notice, directing the board of directors of
the UCBL to refrain from participating in the bank's management
until further notice and asking why they should not be dissolved,
was issued one day after Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu, a former
director of the bank, reportedly stormed a board meeting of the
UCBL along with armed outsides and forced several board members
including Zafar Ahmed to resign.
</P>
<P>
The High Court later stayed the central bank's directive to the
board of directors of the UCBL following a prayer of the writ
petition filed by UCBL Chairman Zafar Ahmed and 10 directors.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh Bank notes that there was a failure of security in
the board meeting of the bank on August 26, 1999 resulting in
chaos and the resignation of several directors which were
retracted promptly," the central bank's withdrawal order said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a hurriedly-called press conference after the
Bangladesh Bank order, Zafar Ahmed said that "though late, the
central bank decisions has restored the people's confidence and
saved a private bank."
</P>
<P>
He demanded police action against Babu under the criminal
producer code "for the sake of security and growth" of private
sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The UCBL has 79 branches throughout the country with a deposit
of 11 billion taka (about 220 million U.S. dollars), employing
more than 2,500 people, according to Zafar Ahmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent study carried out
in Nepal showed that about 25,000 Nepalese have been affected with
HIV/AIDS (Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Human Immunodeficiency
Syndrome), the official RSS news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to National AIDS and Study Control Center, Nepal,
1,312 people have so far been officially recorded as HIV positive,
of which 137 have already died.
</P>
<P>
Among those contracted with the HIV/AIDS, 312 are women
involved in prostitution, 726 men having sexual relationship with
such women, 80 housewives and 163 drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Law and Justice Tarani Datta Chataut said at a
workshop on HIV/AIDS opened Sunday that the spread of a fatal
disease like HIV/AIDS would become a huge problem for a country
like Nepal with minimum resources and low education.
</P>
<P>
Some participants of the workshop called for the need to
generate public awareness to control the disease. Lack of the
knowledge about AIDS is one of the main reasons the disease spread
fast in Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Sunday that there was great international support for the
creation of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who returned to Italy Sunday morning following the
signing of Saturday's peace agreement with Israel, said that he
had received "very important" declarations from "Europe, the
Japanese government, Russia, China and President Clinton"
concerning their support for Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was
speaking at the annual industrialists' conference in the Italian
northern town of Cernobbio.
</P>
<P>
He said that action must be swift and decisive in order to
consolidate the peace process and international co-operation is
vital.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians want peace verbally and factually but time is
a decisive factor. If progress isn't tangible and immediate, the
enemies of peace will use this period to instill doubt about the
feasibility and benefits of peace," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"The intervention of friendly nations is urgent, in particular
that of Egypt and its President, Mubarak, the U.S. President
Clinton, Europe and all the forces supporting liberty and peace,"
he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians remain committed to the process of reconstructing
infrastructure and the economy, in spite of the disaster inherited
from the Israeli occupation," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak signed Saturday evening in Sharm el Sheikh on
the Egyptian Red Sea an agreement for the application of a
modified version of the Wye Plantation land-for-peace memorandum
signed on October 23 of last year, turning a further 7 percent of
West Bank territory over to Palestinian control and entailing the
release of 350 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Palestinian leader has been shuttling backwards
and forwards to Italy over the last two days: he flew into Rome
Saturday morning from Gaza for a round of meetings with Italian
President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Premier  Massimo D'Alema; then
he flew out to Egypt in the afternoon for the signing ceremony
with Israel; he returned to Italy Sunday morning and is now
scheduled to fly back to Gaza in the early afternoon.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Meeting to Support Production Ceiling Accord: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The coming ministerial
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) will support the production ceiling accord signed last
March to maintain the stability of oil market, said Omani Oil
Minister Mohammed al-Ramhi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The conference of OPEC's ministers of petroleum to be held in
Vienna on September 22 will come out with resolutions to support
stability of the oil market and confirm the cuts of production
approved by the organization's member countries," al-Ramhi was
quoted by the Oman News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed in March to cut oil output by 1.7 million
barrels per day (bpd). Non-OPEC producers including Mexico,
Norway, Oman and Russia agreed to cut output by 400,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
With these countries sticking to their quota observance, oil
prices have been rising ever since.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ramhi said Oman would take part in the Vienna conference,
which would evaluate the current oil market situation and elect a
new OPEC secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The minister also praised a recent agreement reached in
Caracas, Venezuela, between the petroleum ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela to maintain the March accord up to
April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers expressed their satisfaction with the oil
market's gradual return to stability and promised to maintain the
output cut accord after their meeting last week.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Beefs Up Efforts to Curb Substandard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will establish
six check points to control the inflow of substandard contraband
food and industrial products, the Ethiopian Standards Authority
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The check points will be established in the main ports of Bahir
Dar, Mekelle, Nazreth, Dire Dawa, Gambella and Awassa towns.
</P>
<P>
The authority urged the customs in various parts of the country
and all the concerned institutions to curb the inflow of
commodities that are hazardous to the public health and
detrimental to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Currently, expired canned food and beverages as well as light
and heavy industrial products are being imported into the country
without the knowledge of the standards authority.
</P>
<P>
However, 234 state standards had been set up in the just-ended
fiscal year, the authority said, adding that efforts had been
intensified to set up Ethiopian standards for medicines and pepper
soon.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with the associations of mechanical,
electrical and agricultural engineering, the standards authority
has finalized a study to put in place the new Ethiopian standards.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Indians cast
their votes on Sunday for the first phase of five-stage general
elections, the third in four years, with moderate to heavy
turnouts amid a tight security.
</P>
<P>
President Kocheril Raman Narayanan, Congress President Sonia
Gandhi and senior officials of the caretaker government went to
the polls in their constituencies in New Delhi,
</P>
<P>
However, Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (NJP) and the caretaker prime minister, is scheduled to file
his nomination as BJP candidate next Tuesday from Lucknow, capital
of the north Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The pollings, which began from 0700 AM local time and
concluded at 0500 PM, passed off peacefully, if not for three
minor incidents, amid tight security and with an estimated turnout
of 45 to 50 percent in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
A 55,000 strong police force, assisted by some 5,000 central
para-military soldiers were deployed across the capital, where 45
polling stations had been identified as "hyper-sensitive" and 175
as "sensitive".
</P>
<P>
Police had also sealed the city's borders with neighboring
states and arrested a large number of "anti-social elements" in a
bid to ensure peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
Electronic voting machines were used for the first time in all
seven constituencies in the capital and reportedly received an
enthusiastic response from the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Out of 8,668 machines, 139 were found faulty and were changed
before the start of the polls while three were replaced after the
polls began.
</P>
<P>
Things were not going on so smoothly in another 144
constituencies spread over 16 states and union territories.
</P>
<P>
In the south state of Andhra Pradesh, three people were killed
in poll-related violence between supporters of the contested
parties. The Central Election Commission is likely to order a
repoll in 60 polling stations in the area.
</P>
<P>
In the northwest state of Punjab, three people were reportedly
injured and police fired in air at a polling station while 12
people were hospitalized after consuming allegedly poison-laced
tea at another station.
</P>
<P>
However, an estimated 55 percent of the total electorate of
467,000 in the south states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka exercised
their franchise in the polling, which was by and large peaceful.
</P>
<P>
In the state of Haryana which around the capital, between 59 to
62 percent of the 11 million electorate turned out at 15,457
stations to make a choice of 10 Lower House members out of a total
of 114 hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Between 40 to 42 percent polling was recorded at 26
constituencies in the west state of Gujarat today, during which 35
untoward incidents were reported including 18 cases of bogus
voting and impersonation.
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring state of Maharashtra, around 56 percent
voters cast their ballot for 24 national parliament and 144 state
assembly constituencies peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Another four phases of elections have been scheduled to be held
on 11th, 18th and 25th of September and on October 3.

LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) - Northern Ireland First Minister
David Trimble expressed pessimism Sunday about the outcome of the
US-mediated Northern Ireland's peace process review.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not optimistic about the outcome of it because it seems to
me that we have a very serious problem," Trimble told the BBC. He
blamed a lack of commitment to peace by paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
US Senator George Mitchell, who paved the way for the Good
Friday agreement, is conducting the review of the process.
</P>
<P>
"I have the greatest respect for George and I know that he will
do his utmost in this situation. But the problem isn't something
that can be solved just by him," Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also made clear that his anger over Britain's ruling
last week that an Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire was
intact despite continuing violence and his opposition to Sinn Fein
entering government before its IRA allies disarm had not
subsided."

LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The standing stones at
Stonehenge and Avebury in Britain depict human faces just like the
stone statues found on Easter Island in the Pacific, a physicist
said in a British newspaper on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prehistoric standing stones at Stonehenge and Avebury, have
been the subject of speculation for generations. People have
variously argued that the stone circles were built by visiting
aliens or pagan worshippers and were used as an antiquated
calendar or for magical rites.
</P>
<P>
Terence Meaden, a former professor of physics, argues that
Avebury is "an art gallery" dedicated to a mother goddess figure,
according to the Independent on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Photographs show what could be human faces as well as sheep and
snakes in the stones at certain angles in certain lights, Meaden
said.

which had solely ruled the state for 15 years before the election.
</P>
<P>
And in the eastern Brandenburg state, the SPD suffered an even
heavier loss. Its vote dropped to about 39 per cent from 54.1
percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The CDU won 26 percent of the vote in Brandenburg, but the
bigger winner was the Democratic Socialism Party (PDS), the
successor to the Communists in former East Germany which won 24
percent of the vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A fresh face that would emerge in the Bradenburg state
parliament was the rightwing extremist German People's Union
(DVU), which had won 5.3 per cent of the vote. The party won 13
percent last year in the state election in Saxony-Anhalt.
</P>
<P>
The DVU and other rightwing extremists, such as the Republicans
and the National Democratics of Germany, had won shocking
achievements in recent German regional elections, especially in
the east states.
</P>
<P>
Both in Saarland and Brandenburg, the Greens Party, Schroeder's
junior partner in Berlin cabinet, was not able to score more than
5 percent of the vote to hold a seat in the state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The elections on Sunday shifted the balance in the Bundesrat,
the upper house of German federal parliament, against Schroeder's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Made up of representatives from the 16 German federal states,
the Bundesrat is able to veto legislature bills of the SPD, which
had lost majority after successive defeats in three state
elections.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's ambitious reform package, projected to cut billions
marks of the budget by limiting social welfare spending, is afraid
by many to be blocked, since dozens of SPD lawmakers have openly
attacked the bill and already threatened to vote against it in
Bundestag, the powerful lower chamber of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the voters were disappointed in the SPD's poor
achievement in solving Germany's domestic problems since it gained
the power nearly one year ago. The reform package itself also
aroused skepticism both inside and outside the party.

<HEADLINE> S. African President to Attend OAU Summit in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki is scheduled to leave for Libya Monday to attend a
special summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
Sirte, media reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During his forthcoming three-day visit to the north African
country, Mbeki will also attend a celebration in Libyan capital
Tripoli to mark the 30th anniversary of the revolution that
brought Muammar Gadaffi to power in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Mandated by OAU member states at a meeting in Algiers earlier
this year, the special summit will review the OAU's charter in
Sirte, a town near Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The review will form part of a broader re-examination of the
Africa's largest organization, its structures and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The proposed revisions to the charter are seen as an attempt to
 strengthen economic and other forms of cooperation among member
states.
</P>
<P>
The charter, signed in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in 1963,
already commits its signatories to promoting African unity and
solidarity, and to coordinate political, economic and defense
policies.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma,
senior officials from the presidential office and the department
of foreign affairs.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli Officials End Athens Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian and Israeli
officials ended their fourth meeting in Athens Sunday with a
common declaration calling for close cooperation in fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a common declaration, participants, which included former
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Palestinian official
responsible for the Jerusalem issues, Faisal Al-Husseini,
condemned all forms of acts of terrorism and violence. Both sides
were determined to cooperate closely in an uncompromising fight
against terrorism, which would safeguard the peace process and
allow the two peoples to become an integral part of the Middle
East community.
</P>
<P>
The participants also recognized the Palestinian people's
legitimate right for self determination while the Palestinians
stated that their goal would be the establishment of an
independent democratic state alongside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which began Thursday, decided to establish three
committees, an inter-parliamentarian committee, a civil society
and people-to-people committee and a political committee.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that the steering committee composed
of representatives of both sides and of a representative of the
Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs would monitor and report on the
implementation of what has been agreed upon in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also endorsed the proposal advanced by the Greek
side to explore the possibility of close cooperation among Israel
and the Palestinian Authority and Greece in the preservation of
cultural heritages as well as in the protection of natural
resources and other environmental issues. Two respective
committees will be formed towards this end.
</P>
<P>
The Athens meetings were sponsored by Greece in order to foster
a climate of trust and seek viable and lasting solutions to the
Mideast problem.
</P>
<P>
The first such meeting took place in Athens in July 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale rally was held
Monday in the southern Afghan town of Kandahar, demanding arrest
of those responsible for a bomb blast outside the residence of
Taliban supreme leader Mulla Muhammad Omar last month.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 people gathered at a mosque in central town and
condemned the blast, describing it a conspiracy of anti-Islamic
elements, sources from Afghanistan said.
</P>
<P>
The speakers, however, didn't accuse anyone of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed and some 30 others injured when
a truck loaded with highly sophisticated explosive materials blew
off near Omar's house on late August 24. The Taliban leader
escaped unhurt in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Taliban have rounded up dozens of suspects in connection with
the blast, however, the Islamic militia have not blamed any one
for the incident, the sources said.

CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following is economic briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Monday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" predicts that the
economy of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will pick up this year
thanks to the improvement of crude oil prices and the recovery
of non-petroleum sectors.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources expect a growth of over 5 per cent in gross
domestic product, as compared to a drop of 5.5 percent last year
due to the fall in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The sources also anticipate that growth in the petroleum sector
alone will reach some 15 percent, to bring in about 22.43 billion
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UAE central bank expect that UAE gross domestic
product this year will amount to about 180 billion dirhams (US
dollar equals 3.67 UAE dirhams), as compared to 170 billion
dirhams last year, a growth of approximately 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian Minister of Finance Khaled Mahyni has denied
reports that dropping gold prices have brought about a loss of
about 545 million Syrian liras (US dollar equals 50 liras) in view
of the circulation of about 25 tons of gold in the market.
</P>
<P>
Monday's "Al Hayat" quoted Mahayni as saying Syria's economic
policy has abandoned the idea of expanding total reserves ever
since the seventies, and has moved toward stable reserves.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The final report issued by the Egyptian Ministry of
Tourism on the Tourism and Shopping Festival put the number of
tourists visiting Egypt at 445,273 from July 20 to August 20, as

1998.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Cairo daily "Al Ahram" says that average hotel
occupancy in the governorates participating in the 1999 festival
has also increased to 87.5 per cent, 20.7 percent higher than the

and the Syrian "fairs company" in order to benefit from each
other's distinguished relations with European and African states,

Union). The two sides also examined the prospects of establishing
a company for animal fodder and another for cotton weaving.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands to Modify Regulation On Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said on
Monday that it has decided to improve the regulation and
assessment of termination of 24-week pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
It can happen that a woman who is advised that her unborn child
has little if any chance of survival is unable to face the
pregnancy and asks her doctor for a termination, the government
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"In situations in which the child is and can never be viable,
the doctor is required to notify the municipal coroner of the
termination and to have the decision assessed by a peer group,"
the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Such an action is not a punishable offense and need not
therefore be appraised by the government, it added.
</P>
<P>
The regulations' second category concerns serious disorders as
a result of which "the child is not expected to survive for long
after birth and prevailing medical opinion gives it no hope".
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances, a late termination of pregnancy is
possible too, on grounds of an emergency situation and subject to
strict conditions, the government said.
</P>
<P>
However, such a situation remains a punishable offense in
principle, the government added.
</P>
<P>
The new release said the modifications were recently decided by
the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands.

KUNMING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Governor Li Jiating of Yunnan
Province in southwest China was awarded a gold medal for his role
in hosting the ongoing World Horticultural Exposition in Kunming,
the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Otto Koch, chairman of the Association Internationale des
Producteurs del'Horticulture (AIPH), presented the award at the
51st annual meeting of the AIPH, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Koch expressed warm congratulations to the host province on its
success in sponsoring such a world-class exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Led by the central government and with the help from across the
country, Kunming spent merely three years preparing for the grand
event, while most other host countries in the past had to take
five to seven years preparing, Koch noted.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the horticultural industry will become even
more competitive in the next century, and horticultural producers
worldwide will have to work harder to reduce costs and improve
quality.
</P>
<P>
China's horticultural industry has developed rapidly in recent
years, but Chinese horticultural workers should attach greater
importance to science and technology rather than to speed, Koch
said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing international horticultural show began on May 1 and
will run through October 31.

<HEADLINE> DPJ Candidate Opposes Amendment to Japan's Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Takahiro Yokomichi, a candidate
from Japan's largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)
presidential election, said Monday the preamble and the war-
renouncing Article 9 of Japan's constitution should be left intact.
</P>
<P>
Yokomichi, also head of the DPJ executive council, strongly
criticized the suggestion by the party's Deputy Secretary General
Yukio Hatoyama that the pacifist Constitution be amended, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama plans to include the issue in his campaign for the
September 25 election for DPJ presidency.
</P>
<P>
"If we play around with the text of the Constitution, there
will no longer be a limit to dispatching troops overseas and to
the exercising of the right to defend ourselves collectively,"
Yokomichi said in an interview with Kyodo News.
</P>
<P>
"There is historical significance of the preamble and Article 9,
and we should not touch them," Yokomichi said.
</P>
<P>
Article 9 of Japan's constitution bans the threat or use of
force as a means of settling international disputes.
</P>
<P>
The issue is sensitive within the DPJ as its members, who range
from conservatives to left-leaning lawmakers, have different
opinions on it.
</P>
<P>
Yokomichi, who is running along with Hatoyama against incumbent
leader Naoto Kan in the DPJ presidential race, also blamed
Hatoyama for saying it may be inevitable that the party will break
up as a result of the debate on amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand how someone in a leadership position of an
organization can say such a thing," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State Visits Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright began a two-day working visit to Vietnam
Tuesday and held talks with Vietnamese government and party
leaders on bilateral relations and regional and international
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
After her arrival here earlier in the day, Albright held talks
with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam in the afternoon. She also paid separate courtesy visits
to Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu and
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai later.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, according to the Press and Information
Department of the Foreign Ministry, the two sides exchanged views
on bilateral relations as well as regional and international
issues of mutual concern. They satisfactorily acknowledged the
steps of improvement in their relations since the two countries
resumed diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Both sides, during these talks, recognized the importance of
the Vietnamese-U.S. Trade Agreement based on equality and mutual
benefits, which marks the normalization of the two countries'
socio-commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a press conference on Monday evening that she and
the Vietnamese leaders had also discussed problems such as tracing
American soldiers missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam War,
the human rights issue, and cooperation in fighting against drug
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to attend a ceremony on Tuesday morning
to receive four remains of American servicemen listed as MIA at
Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport. The remains were found
recently by Vietnamese-U.S. joint search teams or the Vietnamese
side alone.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also visit the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi
Minh City, and meet with the city's Mayor Vo Viet Thanh and U.S.
businessmen in the city before leaving Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
She is accompanied by senior officials of the U.S. Department
of State and Ambassador to Vietnam Douglas Peterson.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to Vietnam is en route to the APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting in Auckland, New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
This is Albright's second visit to Vietnam. Her first visit to
Vietnam was in June of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and the United States normalized their diplomatic
relations in July, 1995, 20 years after the Vietnam War ended in
1975.

<HEADLINE> Singapore SilkAir Crash Probe in Final Stages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Investigations into the
Singapore SilkAir MI 185 crash which killed 104 people, have gone
into the final stages, Singapore Communications and Information
Technology Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response to an inquiry of the latest developments on
investigations of the details of the crash, Yeo also told the
Parliament that investigations have not found a reason to blame
the captain of the flight for any disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (ACAS) is satisfied
that there was no reason to ground the captain of the flight for
his disciplinary actions as the safety of the passengers were not
compromised, said Yeo.
</P>
<P>
He also added that investigations were conducted in line with
standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO).
</P>
<P>
Although Singapore's airliners have excelled in the past in
light of international standards set by ICAO, they can not be
complacent and have to continue reviewing their practices, said
Yeo.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to participate actively in
investigations and extend its full cooperation," said Yeo.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the air-crash victims have been asking the
authorities to fully investigate the cause of the tragedy in 1997
near Palembang, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Latest media reports raised doubts over the flight captain's
disciplinary behavior as the investigations went on.

<HEADLINE> First Libyan-Made Car Goes on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 6 (xinhua) -- For the first time in the
automotive history, a Libyan company unveiled a prototype vehicle
Monday to mark the country's 30th anniversary of Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The car, said to be unprecedented in its high level of safety,
is produced by the Libyan Arab Domestic Investment Company
(LADICO) as the outcome of the country's Jamahiriya Rocket Vehicle
Project.
</P>
<P>
The LADICO, by far the largest stock company in Libya with a
general assembly of over 70,000 shareholders employing over 1,000
people, entered the auto industry only 4 years ago and has
established itself as the leading distributor of CBU vehicles in
the market.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the contemporary technical features such as a
four-wheel independent suspension system, four-wheel disc brakes
with anti-lock braking system, two-liter four-cylinder injection
engine, the medium-sized "libyan Rocket" incorporates leading edge
technology in safety devices both on the interior and exterior.
</P>
<P>
The project, launched two years ago, is aimed at meeting the
dire need to save the lives of thousands of Libyans from
increasing road fatalities.
</P>
<P>
And the automotive Division of the LADICO has been making
efforts to localize the country's auto industry in response to
booming demand for cars in the domestic markets.

Australia at the invitation of Australian Governor-General William
Patrick Deane.
</P>
<P>
This represents the first state visit to Australia by a Chinese
head of state.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the airport, Jiang said in a written statement,
"My present visit to Australia is aimed at enhancing friendship,
deepening cooperation and opening up the way to the future with
the interests of the Asian-Pacific region in mind."
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to an extensive and in-depth exchange of
views with Australian leaders on bilateral relations and
international and regional issues of common interest in the
upcoming days, and working together to promote the all-round
development of the mutually beneficial friendly relations and
cooperation between our two countries," he added.

<P>
"I am convinced that, with the efforts of both sides, my visit
will be a complete success, and the Sino-Australian relations will

the mutually-beneficial bilateral economic and trade cooperation.

important countries in the Asian-Pacific region, to strengthen
contacts and develop cooperation further at the turn of the
century," Jiang said.

two countries and two peoples, but also conducive to maintaining
and promoting peace and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is expected to deliver a speech at a Sino-Australian
symposium on trade and investment at noon Tuesday before
proceeding to Canberra to meet Governor-General Deane and attend a
welcoming banquet in his honor.

</P>
<P>
"Both sides are to be congratulated and commended on this

<HEADLINE> Estrada Cites China as Example of Open Policy Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has cited China, which ranks high in terms of economic
growth in Asia, as a top example of the success of market
liberalization policy while stressing the need to open up the
Philippine economy to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement released here Monday, Estrada noted
that China recorded rapid growth of gross national product after
adopting liberalization measures that brought in foreign capital,
new technologies and more jobs for its people.
</P>
<P>
"That's what China did. This move created more jobs for the
people and brought in new technologies," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said his call for economic reforms to relax the restrictions
on foreign land ownership and equity in local businesses and
public utilities through the charter change aims to not only bring
in billions of pesos in foreign capital, and new technologies that
will modernize domestic industries but also bring down the costs
of delivering basic services to the people.
</P>
<P>
"So if we allow 100-percent foreign ownership, there will be an
influx of overseas investors along with technology transfer, which
is very important to us. This will help us a lot," the president
said in his weekly radio-TV program.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Mines, Environment
and Tourism Deputy Minister Edward Chindori-Chininga Monday said
that African countries should go out of their way to conserve
their natural resources as they provide numerous products and
services.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to imagine life without forests because it
would not exist. In Africa forests provide numerous products and
services," said Chindori-Chininga when he officially opened an
environmental workshop in Mutare of east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said large varieties of foods were derived from forests
while commercial industry depended on forests for the raw
materials energy.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the high rate of deforestation and degradation of
forests and other woodlands which resulted in loss of
environmental values.
</P>
<P>
He said over the last 10 years there had been alarming trends
in global deforestation leading to a deep forest crisis worldwide.
</P>
<P>
While the crisis received attention and prompted many
initiatives by governments to arrest the problem, Chininga
commended Costa Rica and Canada for organizing and financing the
workshop.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the five-day workshop would explore mechanisms of
promoting management, conservation and sustainable development of
all types of forests in view of degradation and deforestation
facing the region.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss and come up with a consensus on
international arrangements and mechanisms for a legally binding
instrument on all types of forests.

LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A UK Athletics disciplinary
committee cleared former Olympic champion Linford Christie of
doping charges on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old British sprinter, the 100 meters Olympic
champion in Barcelona in 1992, attended a hearing on Friday after
he tested positive of nandrolone in February.
</P>
<P>
"The Disciplinary Committee concluded that it could not be
proven beyond reasonable doubt that the substance present in the
sample was derived from a prohibited substance. Therefore, Linford
Christie has been cleared of all charges." The British's athletics
governing body said in a statement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Christie, now a successful coach, protested last month that he
was innocent after his urine sample showed traces of the same drug
that fellow veteran Merlene Ottey tested positive for prior to the
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Christie failed the test at an indoor meeting in Dortmund in
February, though his positive sample was only made public on
August 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea described on Monday
Ethiopia's rejection of the Technical Arrangements last Saturday
as "tantamount to a declaration of war".
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia Foreign Ministry reiterated on September 4 its
territorial demand from Eritrea while demanding interpretations
of the Technical Arrangements proposed by Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's rejection "indicates, without any shred of doubt,
that it is about to unleash its war of aggression", said a
statement released Monday by Eritrean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Such a move "not only constitutes a rejection of the Technical
 Arrangements but of the entire OAU peace package", said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accepted the Technical Arrangements on August 7, which
required two sides to respect the boundary inherited from the
colonial rule and not resort to force in resolving border
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The border conflict broke out in early May between the two Horn
of Africa neighbors and soon escalated into a war of attrition.

General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, stressed
here today that the PLA has "a strong determination and enough
capability" to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and maintain the country's unity.
</P>

Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, said the
PLA strongly supports the Chinese government's principled stand on
the Taiwan issue during talks with his visiting counterpart from

<P>
Lee Teng-hui has continued to be obsessed with his "two-states"
remarks and even wrote the remarks into Kuomintang's documents, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral army relations, Fu voiced his belief that Sedivy's
current visit will further promote friendship between the two
countries and the two armies, and promote the armies' relationship
in all fields and at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Sedivy replied that the Chinese army has left a deep impression
on him, and now that the two armies have reached consensus on
exchanges of officer training, the Czech Republic hopes that its
military ties with China will continue to grow.

<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The city government of Beijing
announced today that it will send 10,082 pieces of ancient stone
engraved with Buddhist sutras back to their original underground
home in order to preserve them.
</P>
<P>
The stone tablets were carved by Buddhist monks from the Sui
Dynasty (581-618) to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). In 1957, the
tablets were excavated from caves near the Yunju Temple in
Fangshan County outside of Beijing, and since then they have been
stored in a special temple warehouse.
</P>
<P>
Because the tablets have been eroding, the city government has
built an underground palace using modern technology and equipment
for these precious relics.
</P>
<P>
Now, visitors will have to go underground to see the stone
sutras which will be kept in a closed environment saturated with
nitrogen and kept at a constant temperature and humidity.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony to mark the event will be held at the Yunju
Temple on the morning of September 9, with people from both China
and abroad attending.

<HEADLINE> Americans Work Longest Hours Among Industrialized Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Workers in the United States
spend more hours on job than those in other industrialized nations,
clocking up nearly 2,000 hours per capita in 1997, according to
the latest study of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
That means the Americans work two more weeks than their
counterparts in Japan where annual hours worked have been
gradually declining since 1980, the ILO said in the study released
here Thursday. But the working hours of 1,889 in 1995 in Japan are
still the second longest among the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The ILO study examines 18 Key Indicators of the Labor Market (
KILM) including labor productivity, labor costs, unemployment and
underemployment and hours worked.
</P>
<P>
The long working hours of U.S. and Japanese workers contrasts
most sharply with those of European workers, who are logging
progressively fewer hours on the job, particularly in the
Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweden where hours spent
in work in 1997 were respectively 1,399 and 1,552 per year.
</P>
<P>
The ILO study also found that in spite of divergence in working
hours, the major industrialized countries are seeing convergence
on the labor productivity front.
</P>
<P>
On average, labor productivity growth in western Europe has
been increasing at a faster rate than in the United States,
according to the study. This suggests that the major competitive
challenge to current U.S. productivity dominance comes not only
from a reviving Asian economy, but also from the major European
economies.

PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Anarchy has installed in Dili, capital of East Timor, in the
wake of the victory of the supporters of independence in the
referendum held last Tuesday. Shootings of automatic arms were
heard throughout the city since Saturday night, as pro-Indonesia
militiamen criss-crossed the roads, killing and looting in a total
madness.
</P>
<P>
-- With the long hand-shakings Saturday night in Sharm el
Sheikh in Egyptian Sinai, Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak closed a
parenthesis of three years and relaunched the peace process which
agonized under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu. Once the last
version of Oslo agreements was signed, the Israeli prime minister
announced the beginning of a new era, an optimism immediately
shaken by a double bombing attack in Israel Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with the Corsicans who want always more government
power, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will start a visit to
the island on Monday and Tuesday to defend his policy to establish
a rule of law there and present a budget for the island. With 1.4
billion francs of state aid each year, or 5,335 francs per capita,
Corsica is the region which benefits the most from the state.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac has become the first foreign
head of state to visit Nunavut, the icy and snowy territory of
Inuit Eskimos in northeast Canada which has just obtained autonomy
from Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Over 40,000 Fraud Cases In 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 40,000 fraud cases
have been solved in China in the last two decades, Liang Guoqing,
vice procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"After untiring efforts against fraud crimes using legal
weapons, the Chinese government has effectively curbed the
increase," Liang said at a speech today at the 4th annual meeting
of the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP).
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the crimes of "fraud and corruption" is on the
agenda for academic discussions at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Liang admitted that China has faced great challenges in
fighting fraud in recent years, especially with the increasing
number of transnational frauds and organized fraud groups
penetrating the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of foreign swindlers who
practised frauds and were arrested in China in 1998 was 10 percent
higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Recent years have also seen more Chinese criminal suspects who
absconded to foreign countries with huge funds obtained through
fraud," Liang added.
</P>
<P>
"The fraud rings and their members tend to use intelligent and
high-tech means to perpetrate crimes, which creates many
difficulties and higher challenges for cracking down on frauds,"
Liang pointed out, stressing that they not only have modern means
of telecommunications and transportation, but also use such high-
tech means as information networks.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang, China has built a comprehensive legal
framework in dealing with fraud crimes, with police, prosecutors
and judges each responsible for the investigation, prosecution and
adjudication of such cases, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police bureaus established specialized bodies in 1998
to focus on economic crimes, including frauds, the senior
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
"China's legislature has also amended many anti-fraud laws, as
swindlers have developed their craft in many new forms in recent
years," Liang added.

<HEADLINE> End of Polar Adventure Era, Now its Science Led </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research
has taken the place of adventure and become the major task of
human activity in the polar region, according to Chen Liqi, chief
scientist of China's first arctic expedition.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "Adventure Era" started early this
century with a number of pioneers embarking on explorations; and
then from the 1930s to 1950s came the "Heroic Era" which was
characterized by the challenging of mankind's endurance capacity.
</P>
<P>
"With more high-tech instruments and decreased risks, we have
now entered the era of scientific research," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"It differs from the personal or folk style of adventure
because scientific research has specific goals and subjects, aimed
at ensuring that people can make use of the resources in the North
and South polar regions," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Adventure did contribute to the development of know-how about
the two regions but inevitably we have to say good-bye to it as a
form of activity, turning to further scientific research which
must be based on a higher starting point," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> 6th Int'l Blindness Prevention Assembly Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Agency for
the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) opened its sixth general
assembly today in Beijing, which is the first event of this kind
ever held in China, which experts estimate has the largest number
of blind people.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "The Right To Sight", the assembly's main task
is to promote the "Vision 2020" action launched by the World
Health Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
IAPA President R.Pararajasegaram said that through global
cooperation, this action will help eliminate avoidable blindness
worldwide before 2020.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a congratulation letter to
the assembly today, saying the Chinese Government will sign the "
Vision 2020" manifesto, with solemn promise of helping to prevent
and cure blindness.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the WTO said that with up to 45 million blind
people in the world today and a further 135 million people with
serious visual impairment, blindness has become an important
international public health problem. One fifth of the blind people
in the world live in China, with cataracts listed as the main
cause.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, Chinese Minister of Health, said at the opening
ceremony that the Chinese government has made great efforts to
prevent and cure blindness since the 1950's, and established State
and local organizations responsible with that brief. The country
now has over 23,000 ophthalmologists, most of which are serving at
county level or above hospitals.
</P>
<P>
He also admits that with the rapid increase of aged people and
limited ability for curing blindness, China is far from capable of
controlling the incidence of cataracts effectively.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 ophthalmologists from 36 countries and regions and
over 200 domestic experts and officials are attending the five-day
assembly, with the main programs including the management of
cataracts in children, the screening and management of diabetic
retinopathy, and community participation in eye care.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1975, IAPB has over 70 member countries. China
joined the organization in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Condemned for Defying One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, is to publish a commentator's article tomorrow
condemning Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui and his "two states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has defied the principle of "One China" and ruined
the foundations for the normal development of cross-Straits
relations, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It outlines the history of Lee Teng-hui's approach to the "two-
states" remarks, and points out that the intention of his remarks
like "one country, two governments," or "one country, two
political entities" is to defy and abandon the "One-China"
principle.
</P>
<P>
The article also reviews Lee Teng-hui's divisive actions in
such areas as history and culture, cross-Straits relations, and
Taiwan's external relations. Lee stripped off his usual camouflage
when he made the public remark about the "state-to-state"
relations, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The "One-China" principle is the basis and precondition for the
peaceful reunification of the motherland as well as a necessary
condition for a healthy growth of relations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
What Lee Teng-hui has done does not repudiate this principle
and change the framework under which the international community
recognizes only one China in this world, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
It says Lee cannot prevent Chinese people from at home and
overseas from safeguarding the unity of the motherland and
fighting against splittism.
</P>
<P>
No matter how serious and complicated the situation will be,
the Chinese Government and Chinese people are determined to
eventually realize the reunification of the country by removing
all difficulties, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Regulate Medicine Resources Extraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is intended to
license the extraction of natural resources for the traditional
medicine industry in the country, Forestry Department
Director-General Zul Mukhshar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move would ensure that the supply of raw materials from the
forest is sustained and would prevent the extinction of such
resources, he said in Alor Setar of the northern state of Kedah,
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said Malaysia has developed the traditional
medicine industry successfully and needs to look into sustaining
the supply of raw materials now.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's traditional medicine sales amounted to 2 billion
ringgit (about 526.315 million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the industry to venture into planting medicinal
herbs for its long-term supply.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, licenses are so far only required for the
extraction of timber, rattan and bamboo. Under the National
Forestry Act 1984, anybody found guilty of extracting restricted
forest products without a license can be fined up to 500,000
ringgit (about 131,600 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Emergency Systems for China's Maritime Oil Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua)-- Emergency fast reaction
services to tackle oil spills in China's seas will be established
early next year, according to Liu Dehong, deputy director-general
of the Chinese Maritime Safety Administration (CMSA).
</P>
<P>
He announced this at a seminar on International Oil Pollution
Compensation Funds (IOPCF) held here today.
</P>
<P>
The areas covered will include the northern seas, the East
China Sea, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that China now has an oil turnover volume of 200
million tons, which is increasing by 10 million tons annually,
with a resultant greater possibility of oil spill accidents.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency system will help prevent spilled oil from
diffusing and reduce the pollution damage as soon as possible," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the CMSA introduced emergency exercises for
oil spill accidents around Shanghai, Dalian and Shenzhen, three
major ports on China's east coast.
</P>
<P>
The director of the IOPCF, Mans Jacobsson, attended the seminar
and told delegates that the organisation was established under the
auspices of the 1971 Fund Convention, which was supplementary to
the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil
Pollution Damage.
</P>
<P>
These two conventions were amended twice in 1992, in what are
known as the 1992 Civil Liability Convention and the 1992 Fund
Convention.
</P>
<P>
China has ratified the 1992 Civil Liability Convention, which
will come into force on January 5, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Bidding Committee for 2008 Olympic Games Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing officially launched
its bidding campaign for the Olympic Games as the city established
the Bidding Committee for the 2008 Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of China, which failed in its bid for the 2000
Olympic Games, has submitted the application to the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Bidding Committee consists of a total of 76 members,
with Beijing Mayor Liu Qi as President and Wu Shaozu, President of
the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC), as Exective President.
</P>
<P>
Chinese legendary volleyball coach Yuan Weimin, who is also
Deputy Minister of China's sports governing body the State Sports
General Administration, and Beijing Vice Mayor Liu Jingmin have
been named as administrative Vice Presidents of the Committee.
</P>
<P>
He Zhenliang, member of the IOC Executive Board, is the only
advisor of the Bidding Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It will not only be an honor for the people of Beijing and
China to have the Olympic flame ignited for the first time in
China whose population accounts for one fifth of the world's, but
a good chance to disseminate the Olympic spirit and boost the
Olympic Movement," Liu Qi said.
</P>
<P>
"Bidding for the Olympics is an arduous job with hope and
challenge," Liu said. "But with the support of all the Chinese
people, we are fully confident that we will win the bid."
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu said:"Beijing has its own advantage in bidding for
the Olympics. It's an ancient city with a history of 3,000 years.
And most importantly, in the past 10 years, it has built quite a
few sports facilities with international standard and summed up
rich experience of staging international competitions."
</P>
<P>
"COC will fully support Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympic
Games," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Vice Mayor Liu Jingmin said his city will improve the
conditions to meet the required standards of the IOC for staging
the summer Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Fishery Sector Urged to Increase Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday urged the
country's fishery sector to increase fish output to meet the
demand of the increasing population in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Sulaiman Daud made the appeal when
launching the aquaculture code of practice in the northern state
of Pulau Pinang, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that since Malaysia's population was projected to
increase to 28.41 million by 2010, the fishery sector would have
to boost the present annual fish output of 1.24 million tons to
1.93 million tons by that time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for aquaculture, the government has targeted an
annual yield of 600,000 tons, a 450-percent increase from the
present annual output of 133,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister was confident that the desired aquaculture output
to meet both domestic and export demand is achievable if there is
good balance between production and sound environmental
management.
</P>
<P>
He said the government, in this context, has adopted approaches
aimed at enhancing the quality of aquaculture products,
introducing guidelines for aquacultural development and practicing
the code of practice for aquaculture.

LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Lawrie McMenemy has been
offered a new contract to stay as national manager by the Irish
Football Association despite the team's failure to qualify for
Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
McMenemy's current deal expired at the end of qualifying for
the European Championships.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 3-0 home loss to Turkey shattered Northern Irish
hopes of reaching next year's finals in Belgium and the
Netherlands, but the Irish Football Association had already
decided to offer McMenemy an extended deal although Northern
Ireland have recorded just one competitive win during McMenemy's
12-match reign.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Football Association wants McMenemy to stay on as
manager for the 2002 World Cup campaign. A deal is expected to be

<HEADLINE> China's Longest Railway Tunnel Completed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Work has been completed on a 18.
46 kilometer long tunnel on the Xi'an-Ankang rail line in
northwest China, which is reckoned to be the country's longest
railway tunnel and ranks the 2nd in Asia and the 6th in the world.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony to mark the event was held today at the northern
point of the tunnel, in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel runs through the Qinling Range, which forms a
demarcation line between northern and southern climates and a
watershed between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers.
</P>
<P>
Two basically parallel single-track tunnels, 30-meter apart,
have been laid in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Several generations of Chinese have long dreamed of a tunnel
through the Qinling Range, but because of the length, complex
geological structure, and possible disasters, a number of railways
had to be built around it, in the form of a figure "8"- or bulb-
shaped way, a Ministry of Railways official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It took engineers some eight years before they hit on the
present plan, which allows the tunnel to pass through five big
faults in the shortest way.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Poll Gives President Obasanjo Pass Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A poll found that a majority of
the respondents in Nigeria thought President Olusegun Obasanjo
had performed above average in his first 100 days in office.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted last week by local newspaper The Post
Express said that among the 553 persons polled, 339 representing
61.3 percent said that the president had done well in addressing
the myriad of problems confronting Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results released by the paper on Monday,
164 persons or 29.66 percent do not think the president has done
well while 50 persons or 9.04 percent are indifferent.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who gave the president a pass mark praised his
handling of the fuel crisis which characterized the General Sani
Abacha era and continued till the handing over of the power by
the military to the new administration in May this year.
</P>
<P>
They also commended his administration's policies toward better
 telephone services, employment generation and the retirement of
military officers.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, nearly all those who said that the president
had not done well criticized his tardiness in addressing the
electricity problem which has crippled many small and
medium-scale industries and made life painful for ordinary
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
They also slammed the president for not moving decisively
against armed robbers and other social miscreants who have made
the nation's major cities unsafe for law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper said that the nationwide poll sought an
assessment of the performance of the president by Nigerians of
all walks of life, including men and women of diverse political
persuasion and ethnic background.

<P>
To improve rail transport in southwest and midwest China, the
government has decided to invest more than 10 billion yuan (about
1.2 billion US dollars) into a railway going directly through the
middle of Qinling Range. The Qinling tunnel alone cost over 2
billion yuan (about 240 million US dollars), the official said.
</P>
<P>
And to ensure the success of the tunnel, a great part of the
expenditure went on the most sophisticated excavating equipment
for building the project.
</P>
<P>
Work on the line began at the end of 1997. Not a single
accident occurred in the arduous effort.
</P>
<P>
Authorities note that the tunnel is a milestone in the country'

building similar tunnels.

program for 1996-2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Resume Troops Pullout From S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said on Sunday the pullout of Nigerian troops from Sierra
Leone would resume next month.
</P>
<P>
The president said on a national television program marking his
first 100 days in office that he failed to agree with the United
Nations on keeping the peace keepers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 Nigerian soldiers in the West African Peacekeeping
Force or ECOMOG was flown back last week. But Nigeria government
suspended the pullout following an urgent visit of Sierra Leonean
President Tejan Kabbah who called for the regional power to
re-consider its decision for the stability in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria originally planned to withdraw its troops at a rate of
2,000 men per month and leave only a 1,000-strong contingent at
the end of the six- month pullout. The country has about 12,000
men in the 14,000-strong ECOMOG

force stationed in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo did not say whether the policy could be
reviewed if disarmament did not move as quickly as planned under
a July peace accord between Kabbah and rebels to end more than
eight years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Sarawak State to Increase Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Sarawak State
plans to increase rice production to ensure 65 percent
self-sufficiency within the next five years, State Agriculture and
Food Industries Minister Adenan Satem said Monday.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, Sarawak is devising an efficient rice
production system incorporating latest technologies from the very
basic seed production to post harvest operations, the minister
said at a three-day seminar on "Commercial Rice Production in
Sarawak: Prospect and Challenges" in the state capital of Kuching,
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far 804,470 hectares had been identified
suitable for wet paddy cultivation in the state and there were 10
potential granaries covering 128,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Although land for the wet paddy cultivation is abundant in
Sarawak only 57,000 hectares were cultivated with wet paddy
annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the state government would consider various incentives
that could boost food production in Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
According to the state minister, the current rice production of
60,432 tons in the state only met 35 percent of the state's needs
and the other 65 percent or 114,500 tons had to be imported.
</P>
<P>
Last year Sarawak imported 114,500 tons of rice valued at 111
million ringgit (29.21 million U.S. dollars) and this accounted
for about 10 percent of the state's total food import bill, Adenan
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Kicks off Landmark Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein left here Monday for a landmark two-day visit to Kuwait in
a bid to repair and restore bilateral ties to levels prior to the
1990-91 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Queen Rania Al Hussein and a high-level
delegation, Abdullah is expected to hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Ahmad Sabah to further cement ties, which had just
been normalized in March after 10 years of strains.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib described the
visit as a "major development that will restore relations between
the two states to previous levels" before the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait severed its relations with Jordan as Amman sided with
Baghdad after Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait in 1990, which
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The most important factor of Abdullah`s visit is to restore
bilateral political relations to previous peaks, Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that Jordan and Kuwait had enjoyed "strong
bonds on a reciprocal basis" over three to four decades before the
Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
After Abdullah took the throne in February, Jordan has been
cautiously following a policy to maintain friendly ties with all
Arab countries, including its powerful neighbor Iraq and Iraq`s
arch Arab rivals Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said on many occasions that his kingdom will not
improve ties with one country at the expense of another.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman believed Jordan has to strike a delicate
diplomatic balance between Iraq and Kuwait, which still saw each
other as enemy nearly 10 years after the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan depends on Iraq as its only source of crude
oil under the U.N. oil-for-food program for Iraq, but the
debt-ridden kingdom has to eye the lucrative labor market in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian workers had remitted hundreds of millions of
U.S. dollars each year from Kuwait before they were expelled by
the emirate during the Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> WHO's Regional Blindness-prevention Campaign Launched in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A regional campaign initiated
by the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate avoidable
blindness was launched today in the Chinese capital as the country
's health minister signed a global declaration of support.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, issued earlier this year in Geneva by WHO's
director-general Gro Brundtland, calls for cooperation among
governments, international organizations and non-governmental
organizations to work on Vision 2020, a global coalition to
eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
As blindness continues to be an important public health problem
in the Western Pacific region, the WHO has chosen China as the
location for the regional Vision 2020 launch, according to Dr.
Bjorn Thylefors, director of WHO's Geneva-based Disability
Prevention Programme.
</P>
<P>
"The venue of the regional launch was not a random choice.
China has the largest number of blind people in the world - around
five million, or about 18 percent of the world's blind," explained
Dr. Thylefors.
</P>
<P>
"An estimated 450,000 Chinese become blind each year. This
means that in China almost every minute of every day a new case of
blindness occurs," Dr. Thylefors emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In the Western Pacific region, the WHO's largest region in
terms of population and the home to 20 percent of the world's
blind, cataracts, Vitamin A deficiency in children, trauma in
adolescents and trachoma are blamed as major causes of blindness.
</P>
<P>
However, ophthalmologists say, up to 80 percent of blindness is
avoidable, resulting either from conditions that could have been
prevented or that can be successfully treated.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Strive Against AIDS Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National AIDS
Authority (NAA) has proposed three measures aimed at preventing
the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country.
</P>
<P>
The measures include promoting the use of condoms, educating
people about the danger of HIV/AIDS and expanding health care for
people infected by HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
One-hundred percent use of condoms has been promulgated as a
national policy and will be implemented in all brothels and sex
establishments to ensure the safety of sex services, said NAA
Vice-President Dy Narong Rith at a press conference held on Monday
in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is a small country with 11.5 million population, but
HIV/AIDS has been spreading very quickly because of the lack of
education and increasing prostitution.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, 100 people were infected with AIDS and 20 died
of it every day, and the latest figures also show that 20,000 have
got AIDS while 200,000 are infected with HIV in the whole
country," said Dy Narong Rith.
</P>
<P>
According to a NAA survey, more than 90 percent of AIDS
patients got infected with the disease through sexual intercourse,
while 46 percent of prostitutes were AIDS carriers.
</P>
<P>
Since HIV/AIDS has been spreading at an alarming rate, the main
strategy to respond to the epidemic is to prevent people from
getting infected with it by raising the awareness of the disease
because so far there is no cure for this disease.
</P>
<P>
The government of Cambodia has realized that HIV/AIDS is an
urgent priority because this disease is causing an increasing
public health, economic and social problem for the whole country.

"Necessary ophthalmologic services are yet accessible in vast

Vision 2020 activities are expected to help the country's
county-level hospitals by providing affordable and good-quality
cataract surgeries, training programs, and appropriate equipment
and technologies, according to a WHO press release.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that Vision 2020 will help China address all
these issues," said Dr. Thylefors. "For if the present trends are
allowed to continue unchanged, by 2020 the number of China's blind
is expected to increase fourfold."

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Backs Women-Friendly Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Speaker Manny Villar
aired his support Monday for the passage of two "women-friendly"
bills being taken up by the House of Representatives, Philippine
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
One bill seeks to grant a one month cumulative leave with pay
to women workers who undergo major surgical operations on the
internal reproductive organs, while the other seeks to reserve
suitable parking or seating spaces for pregnant women in public
places, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We should make a concerted effort to make things easier for
women who carry the burden of bearing children," said Villar.
</P>
<P>
Several government agencies, including the Department of the
Interior, Civil Service Commission, through their representatives
have likewise signified their support for the two bills during
committee deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Villar said the House has already passed on final reading an
Anti-discrimination bill to prevent unfair treatment of women
workers in the work-place. It was one of the more than 220 bills
and resolutions passed during the House's first regular session.
</P>
<P>
"There should be equality and justice in treating women, while
recognizing their specific and unique needs," he said, adding that
these differences "should not be used as an excuse to discriminate
against women."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Justifies Syrian Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss has justified the two-decade Syrian military presence in his
country when he met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during her visit to Beirut two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio Monday said Albright had raised
the issue of the presence of Syrian troops on Lebanese soil during
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting of its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been asking Israel to withdraw its troops from its
border enclave without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
"I told her that Lebanon differentiates between the Israeli
occupation of a chunk of the south and Syrian military
presence," Hoss was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Lebanon viewed the Syrian presence as
legitimate because it was requested by the late Elias Sarkis when
he was president of Lebanon in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The 35,000 Syrian troops, which were then called in to help
halt the country's 1975-1990 civil war, are still deployed across
the country ostensibly to help maintain the nation's post-war
stability.
</P>
<P>
But, the country's ultra-rightist flank of Christian community,
which is spearheaded by exiled former army commander Michel
Aoun, has been opposed to Syria's military presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian forces will remain in Lebanon as long as the
Lebanese government deemed their presence necessary," Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
Albright made a unscheduled brief visit to Lebanon on Saturday
in the course of her Mideast tour, the first since Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak took power from his hardline predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu in July.

<HEADLINE> 6th Int'l Blindness Prevention Assembly Opens in Beijing (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Agency for
the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) opened its sixth general
assembly today in Beijing, which is the first event of this kind
ever held in China, which experts estimate has the largest number
of blind people.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "The Right To Sight", the assembly's main task
is to promote the "Vision 2020" action launched by the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
IAPB President R. Pararajasegaram said that through global
cooperation, this action will help eliminate avoidable blindness
worldwide before 2020.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a congratulation letter to
the assembly today, saying the Chinese Government will sign the "
Vision 2020" manifesto, with solemn promise of helping to prevent
and cure blindness.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the Vision 2020 coalition as "a measure of
great significance to promote global blindness prevention and
treatment to reduce the harm of visual impairment".
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always paid great attention to
public health issues, and has taken a series of therapeutical
measures to help 2.46 million blind people have their lost
eyesight restored in the recent decade," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Through a nationwide campaign to provide cataract surgeries in
partnership with Lions Clubs International, China is expected to
realize negative growth of cataract-related blindness cases by the
year 2001, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the WHO said that with up to 45 million blind
people in the world today and a further 135 million people with
serious visual impairment, blindness has become an important
international public health problem. One fifth of the blind people
in the world live in China, with cataracts listed as the main
cause.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, Chinese Minister of Health, said at the opening
ceremony that the Chinese government has made great efforts to
prevent and cure blindness since the 1950's, and established State
and local organizations responsible with that brief. The country
now has over 23,000 ophthalmologists, most of which are serving at
county level or above hospitals.
</P>
<P>
He also admits that with the rapid increase of aged people and
limited ability for curing blindness, China is far from capable of
controlling the incidence of cataracts effectively.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 ophthalmologists from 36 countries and regions and
over 200 domestic experts and officials are attending the five-day
assembly, with the main programs including the management of
cataracts in children, the screening and management of diabetic
retinopathy, and community participation in eye care.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1975, IAPB has over 70 member countries. China
joined the organization in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Manila Pledges Steady Rice Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
work harder to keep the prices of rice and other basic commodities
steady, Philippine News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Edno Joson, head of the National Food Authority (NFA), said his
agency continues to sell rice at 14 pesos (one dollar is equal to
40 pesos) per kilo, and that he does not foresee any increase in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Our stocks remain sufficient to maintain the 14 pesos per kilo
consumer price," Joson said.
</P>
<P>
He added the NFA has deployed at least 45 rolling stores in
Manila alone, and is now setting up more such stores nationwide so
that a greater number of poor Filipinos can avail of low-priced
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Joson said the NFA, which is directly under the Office of
President Joseph Estrada, aims to set up at least 4,000 of these
stores to meet a self-imposed target of 10 percent of all
communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have set up some 2,500 of these stores. We are
monitoring the process of establishing more of these," he said.
</P>
<P>
These NFA rice stores offer basic commodities that are priced
20 percent lower than those sold in other outlets. Such strategy
has helped bring prices down, he added.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Improve Employees' Rights, Benefits in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government has adopted a progressive
approach in improving employees' rights and benefits to keep pace
with Hong Kong's social and economic development, a senior
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drive is aimed at striking a balance between the interests
of employees and employers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the department's "Know the
Employment Ordinance Week" on Monday, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung,
commissioner for labor, said that this approach has worked well in
the past and will continue to be adhered to in future.
</P>
<P>
Cheung noted that the Employment Ordinance (EO) had undergone
several major reviews and amendments since its enactment in 1968
to better protect employees' rights and benefits.
</P>
<P>
The more recent amendments included increasing an employee's
entitlement of paid annual leave from seven days to a maximum of
14 days according to his length of service, and strengthening of
maternity and employment protection.
</P>
<P>
"As for education and publicity work, we will take into account
the uniqueness of individual industries and arrange for specially
designed promotional activities for employees and employers to
have a better understanding of their rights and benefits as well
as obligations under the EO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Labor Relations Promotion Unit of the Labor
Department, the "Know the Employment Ordinance Week" aims to
promote labor relations in Hong Kong by enhancing public
understanding of the Employment Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Promotional activities such as exhibitions, seminars, quizzes
and a radio program will be organized from September 6 to 12.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Services Banned From Using </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- In a landmark ruling,
Israel's Supreme Court Monday barred the security services from
using interrogation methods, which it ruled were tantamount to
torture.
</P>
<P>
The nine-judge panel decided that it was illegal for
Israel's Shin Bet security service to use those interrogation
methods, which have been inflicted on thousands of Palestinian
detainees.
</P>
<P>
``The court declares the Shin Bet does not have the
authority to shake a person, to force him into a (contorted)
position or to kneel in a frog-like position or deprive him
of sleep,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
"The authority which allows the investigator to conduct a
fair investigation does not allow him to torture a person, or
treat him in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner," the court
added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling overturned a decision made by a
government-appointed commission headed by a Supreme Court judge in
1987, which permitted the Shin Bet to use "moderate physical
pressure" against suspects.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups estimate that some 850 detainees a year
are subjected to those interrogation techniques, which the Shin
Bet says should be used in order to prevent terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came just a day after two car bombs exploded
Sunday in two Israeli cities, killing three people, presumably
the bombers, who apparently were trying to carry out terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Following the ruling, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that ``limiting the
Shin Bet's (investigative) capabilities does not help protect
Israel's citizens in the reality in which we live.''
</P>
<P>
However, human right groups, that hailed the ruling as a
watershed, said that the "ticking bomb" cases are extremely rare
and the Shin Bet just systematically mistreated detainees to
extract information.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Army Management Seminar Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September (Xinhua) -- Army chiefs of Singapore and
the United States stressed here Monday at a regional seminar that
armies are in transition, changing from a cold war army to an army
for the 21st century in some profound ways.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Army of the Singapore Armed Forces Major General Lim
Chuan Poh and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army General Eric K.
Shinseki made the point in their respective keynote speeches at
the opening ceremony of the five-day 23rd Pacific Armies
Management Seminar (PAMS XXIII).
</P>
<P>
The seminar, co-hosted by the Singapore Armed Forces (Army) and
the United States Army Pacific, is being attended by army chiefs
of regional countries as well as 105 delegates from 35 countries.
</P>
<P>
Army chiefs of 20 regional countries are in Singapore for the
four-day first Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference (PACC-I) on
September 5-8, 1999, with their discussions focusing on "changes
confronting the armies of the 21st centuries."
</P>
<P>
PACC-I opened here on Sunday and Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Defense Tony Tan Keng Yam gave a dinner
in honor of the participants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the dinner, Tony Tan said, "Many countries are
recovering from the economic crisis and they will need a stable
environment to rebuild their economies and attract foreign
investments."
</P>
<P>
"The events of the past two years have clearly shown that the
security and economic prosperity of countries are inextricably
linked," he added.
</P>
<P>
The concurrently-held PAMS XXIII under the theme "Managing
Change for Armies in the 21st Century," is focusing on four topics
concerning the transforming of armies for the 21st century,
optimizing personnel in the 21st century, integrating technologies
into 21st century armies and defense diplomacy in the 21st century
environment.
</P>
<P>
Lim told the seminar that the fundamental driving force of the
change is the external geopolitical and security environment, the
domestic considerations, technology and knowledge with technology
being the biggest enabler of the change and knowledge being the
most important factor.
</P>
<P>
General Shinseki underlined that transformation is underway and
must continue and his army is going to promote the transformation
quickly and coherently and move forward professionally and
institutionally so as to build an army capable of meeting the
challenges of the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also gave emphasis to the training of soldiers and the
development of competent, gifted leaders to meet the demands of
the uncertain world.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Deepens Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Beijing issued a new housing reform plan today in a bid to enable
all families in the Chinese capital, rich or poor, to pay for
their own housing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's reform plan is in conformity with a Ministry of
Construction plan on housing reform for employees of the central
government. Moreover, the capital's plan will cover a wider range
of people, according to Miao Leru, the city government official in
charge of the program.
</P>
<P>
Under the city's scheme, low and middle-income families will
enjoy government subsidies to purchase or rent housing, but the
rich will have to pay for their apartments at market prices.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is expected to go into force on October 1, after
the government carries out a survey of housing conditions for
local residents and works out a series of regulations on the
commercialization of residential housing, Miao said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Beijing has made great efforts to
deal with the severe shortage of apartments. By 1998, Beijingers
had an average residential floor space of 14.86 square meters per
person, compared with 6.76 square meters in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In March of last year, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji proposed
shifting from the decades-old policy under which the government
paid for all residential housing, to a new policy of
commercializing the housing sector and allowing people pay for
their own apartments or houses.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes this new policy will help fuel the current
sluggish real estate market.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Should Speed Up Agricultural Modernization: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine farmers will lose
heavily if the Philippine fails to modernize its agriculture
sector within the next three years, a senior official warned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing on the Agrilink '99, Agriculture
Secretary Edgardo Angara said that "the next three years will be
critical for us since 2002 is our deadline to be competitive
globally as tariffs on all products go down."
</P>
<P>
Angara said modernizing agriculture through the use of science
and technology will reduce the country's dependence on
importation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, for instance, imported 80 million pesos (about
2 million U.S. dollars) worth of rice last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country may even opt to import substantial
volume of fish if it also failed to develop the marine sector.
</P>
<P>
The Agrilink '99, the biggest agri-business exhibition of its
kind in the country, is slated on October 7-9 at the Philippine
International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the government thus needs to strengthen the
farmers' capacity to compete globally through various
interventions.
</P>
<P>
These include the provision of post-harvest facilities and
farm-to-market roads, enhancing research and development and
improving packaging of products to make them attractive to the
export markets, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM on Boycott of Election in Indian-Held Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Monday the boycott of so-called elections in
Indian-Held Kashmir by the vast majority of Kashmiris demonstrates
the complete alienation of the Kashmiri people from Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in a statement "the boycott has once again
demonstrated the Kashmiri rejection of the Indian occupation and
their determination to continue their struggle against the Indian
occupation and for their right of self-determination."
</P>
<P>
"This boycott also exposes India's false propaganda campaign
that the Kashmiri struggle is being sustained by infiltration from
outside," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The lowest ever turn out in these sham elections should once
again focus international attention on the reality of the Kashmir
issue, Aziz noted.
</P>
<P>
He said India cannot talk about its democratic credentials, as
long as it refuses to recognize the Kashmiri's democratic right of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single country in the world has ever accepted that the
territory of Kashmir is a part of India. Yet India has forcibly
occupied this disputed territory with the help of 700,000 troops,
who are carrying out a brutal repression of the Kashmiri people
and violating their basic human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz congratulated the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC)
in India-held Kashmir and its leaders for successfully organizing
the boycott of these illegal elections and for continuing their
political struggle for a U.N. supervised plebiscite to decide the
future of Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: Australia Tour to Enhance Friendship, Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said on Monday his visit to Australia is aimed at enhancing
friendship, deepening cooperation and opening up the way to the
future with the interests of the Asian-Pacific region in mind.
</P>
<P>
He is "very pleased" to come to Melbourne to begin the state
visit at the invitation of Australian Governor-General William
Patrick Deane, Jiang said in a written statement upon arrival in
this second biggest city of Australia.
</P>
<P>
This represents the first state visit to Australia by a Chinese
head of state.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to an extensive and in-depth exchange of
views with Australian leaders on bilateral relations and
international and regional issues of common interest in the
upcoming days, and working together to promote the all-round
development of the mutually beneficial friendly relations and
cooperation between our two countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that he is also "ready to, through this opportunity,
get in touch with Australian friends from all walks of life, get a
better knowledge of and learn from the achievements and successful
experience of Australia in its nation-building effort."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that, with the efforts of both sides, my visit
will be a complete success, and the Sino-Australian relations will
see greater development in the coming new century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Australia are in the Asian-Pacific region, he
said, adding that the friendship and exchanges between the two
peoples date back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he went on to say, with the concerted efforts
of both sides, the relations between the two nations have gained a
good momentum of all-round development.
</P>
<P>
"The bilateral high-level exchanges have been frequent. The
friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields have
progressed smoothly with remarkable results," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As the two economies are highly complementary to each other, he
continued, there are broad prospects for the further expansion of
the mutually-beneficial bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"It is all the more important for China and Australia, both
important countries in the Asian-Pacific region, to strengthen
contacts and develop cooperation further at the turn of the
century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This is not only in the common interests of the two countries
and two peoples, but also conducive to maintaining and promoting
peace and development in the region, the president explained.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that being one of the oldest states and cities in
Australia, the state of Victoria and the city of Melbourne are
abundant in natural resources.
</P>
<P>
They boast a picturesque landscape, advanced agriculture,
animal husbandry, manufacturing and financial industries, and
occupy an important position in history and play an important role
in the national economic development of Australia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Victoria and Melbourne have long served as pivotal links in the
friendly exchanges between China and Australia, playing a positive
role in the development of Sino-Australian relations, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Review Peace Accord With MNLF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Senate committee
on Monday called for a review of the 1996 peace agreement with the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) to ensure peace in the
southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Gregorio Honasan, who chairs the Senate peace, unification and
reconciliation committee, issued the call on the third anniversary
of the signing of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the accord has been marked by "an apparent discontent"
among the former Muslim rebels over its implementation, Philippine
News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"President Estrada is duty-bound to comply with the commitment
contained in that peace accord," Honasan said during his regular
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We must assure that whatever we had promised to the MNLF will
be satisfactorily complied with," he added.
</P>
<P>
"With the peace agreement, the nation has very well gained due
 recognition in the international community for ending more than
two decades of armed hostilities with Muslim rebels. Let us not
allow these gains to break down," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Honasan said the Estrada Administration should conduct a
critical assessment of how far the obligations stipulated under
the peace accord have been fulfilled and what are the other areas
that need to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"After three years since the peace pact was forged, we still
have to see real economic progress in the region that has been
isolated from the mainstream for quite a long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even in terms of peace and order, we have a lot of work to
do," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said government's peace efforts will always remain shaky
and unstable unless there is a Comprehensive National Peace
Policy to guide government representatives in their obligations
with the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Honasan added that he is proposing the peace policy which also
seeks to institute necessary structural reforms -- socially,
politically and economically -- independent of political
patronage.

WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Pro-Indonesian militias continued their campaign of violence
and thousands of people fled East Timor on Sunday, as diplomats
and U.N. officials said signs were mounting that military and
police units were participating in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
-- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's ruling Social Democratic
Party suffered serious losses in two state elections Sunday,
reflecting the unpopularity of a controversial austerity program
that the German leader says is necessary to revitalize the world's
third largest economy.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of Russia said that Russian
law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an inquiry into a
suspected money laundering scheme involving Russian money at the
Bank of New York, and asserted that the sums involved were far
less than the billions of dollars reported in the press.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Security Council met to condemn the violence in
East Timor "in the strongest terms" and to ask Indonesia to live
up to its pledges to provide peace and security to the territory,
which has been torn by violence after a ballot there favored
independence. But the Council has no real power to act to stop the
violence.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Warns Against Disturbance of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Monday
warned that it would take severe and effective action against
those disturbing peace and law and order of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Briefing heads of missions of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations stationed here on Monday, Myanmar Deputy Foreign
Minister U Khin Maung Win said that "subversive elements" within
and outside the country and some members of the opposition
National League for Democracy (NLD), were again trying to
instigate unrest following their failed attempt last year during
the 10th anniversary of the "Four-Eight Incident."
</P>
<P>
The "Four-Eight Incident" refers to the massive violent unrest
which began on August 8, 1988 in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
U Khin Maung Win also blamed the western media including radio
stations like the Voice of America, the British Broadcasting
Corporation and Radio Free Asia for giving extensive coverage
almost everyday to those activities, said a press release issued
by the Myanmar Foreign Ministry late Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said these efforts would be in vain, adding that the people
of Myanmar do not wish to see a repeat of the anarchic conditions
of 1998 when the Four-Eight incident took place on August 8 that
year.
</P>
<P>
Citing some instances of foreigners intervening in the internal
affairs of Myanmar, he warned that his country would never allow
any nation to involve in such activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD said in a recent statement that the Myanmar
military authorities have been arresting democracy activists in
fear of the planned uprising of the opposition on September 9,
1999, or the "Four-Nine Incident."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the authorities are not only openly
denying the results of the 1990 general election which reflected
the real desire of the people, but also refusing to have a
dialogue with the democracy forces including ethnic minorities to
settle all issues of the nation in crisis. The authorities are
suppressing dissidents instead, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election, sponsored by the present military
 government and participated by 93 political parties, the NLD won
396 out of the 485 parliamentary seats. However, no parliament has
emerged yet since the end of the election, another NLD statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The present government took over power on September 18, 1988 in
the aftermath of the "Four-Eight Incident."
</P>
<P>
The briefing was attended by Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win
Aung, the Lao ambassador and other ambassadors and charge d'
affairs from Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Man Gunned Down for Threatening Egyptian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian presidential guards
gunned down a man who threatened President Hosni Mubarak's life
with a knife on Monday, while the president was slightly injured,
the media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted witnesses as saying that the man approached
Mubarak's car waving a knife as the president was waving to a
crowd through his car window in Port Said, a city 180 kilometers
northeast of Cairo, at the northern end of the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Security guards opened fire and the man, who was not
identified, was hit several times, the witnesses said on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was on his way to address a meeting in Port Said while
inspecting projects in the city. After the incident, he went on to
his meeting and delivered a speech as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has survived at least three attempts on his life.
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, Muslim militants fired on his limousine as it was
driving out of Addis Ababa airport of Ethiopia on the way to a
summit of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated in
1981 by Islamic militants angered at his signing of a peace treaty
with Israel in 1979. Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice president,
became president after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak plays a key role in mediating the peace talks between
Arab countries and Israel. He has helped the Palestinians and
Israel reach several peace agreements. The latest was the memo on
the implementation of the Wye accord, which was signed between the
two sides on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak severely cracked down on Islamic militants who has
attempted since 1992 to topple the secular Egyptian government and
install a strict Islamic rule in the country.

<HEADLINE> Security Guards Kill Man Grazing Egyptian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A man on Monday grazed Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak with a sharp tool as Mubarak drove through
a northern port city. The president's guards gunned down the man,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
"While the president was waving through the car's window, a
person approached the motorcade holding a sharp tool and inflicted
a light wound," said a statement issued by the president's office,
indicating Mubarak was injured on the arm.
</P>
<P>
"The special security guards dealt with the incident
immediately and killed" the unidentified assailant, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's wound was treated with a disinfectant before the
president went on to a meeting and delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
One of his guards was hit by a stray bullet and wounded, the
witnesses said. But the government statement said the wound - a
finger cut - was caused when the guard tried to stop the assailant
from reaching the car.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred in Port Said, 180 kilometers northeast of
Cairo, at the northern end of the Suez Canal, where Mubarak was
inspecting industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian television later showed videotape of crowds on the
streets of Port Said cheering Mubarak, but cut away as shots rang
out and did not show the attack. The next pictures showed Mubarak
at the meeting hall, where supporters clapped and chanted "Mubarak
is the people's beloved! We salute you Mubarak."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said nothing about the attack in a speech devoted to
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The most serious of the attacks on Mubarak came in June 1995,
when Muslim militants fired on his limousine as it was driving out
of the airport of Addis Ababa of Ethiopia on the way to a summit
of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated in
1981 by Islamic militants angered at his having signed a peace
treaty with Israel in 1979. Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice
president, became president after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak plays a key role in mediating the Arab-Israeli peace
talks and has helped the Palestinians and Israel reach several
peace agreements. The latest is the memo for the implementation of
the Wye accord, which was signed in Egypt between the two sides
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has severely cracked down the Islamic militants who has
attempted since 1992 to topple the secular Egyptian government and
install a strict Islamic rule.

<HEADLINE> Canada Ends Probe of Mossad Use of Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada has ended the probe of
suspected use of Canadian passports by Israeli secret service
Mossad, the country's Globe and Mail reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign affairs source was quoted as confirming that the
investigation recently ended with the conclusion: There is
insufficient evidence to prove that Israel broke its pledge.
</P>
<P>
Canada began a second probe in 1997, when the Mossad was
alleged to break its pledge not to use Canadian passports in
covert operations.
</P>
<P>
Mossad was previously found to use purloined Canadian passports
in an assassination attempt on an Islamic official in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy received Iron-clad
assurances from former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in 1997 that Mossad would no longer do it again, the newspaper
said.

<P>
CANBERRA, Septemper 6 (Xinhua) -- Rumours were dismissed on
Monday that Sydney would be booked out and overcrowded during next
year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Australian Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly said the biggest
threat to the goal of a 10 percent increase in international
visitors next year was widespread rumours that it was just too
much trouble, accordint to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"There is myth and innuendo that Australia is oversold, full up,
booked up, you can't get there," Kelly was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Australian tourism industry is chasing the cash from an
extra 400,000 international visitors next year, which would
represent a 10 percent increase in arrivals to 4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said people's travel and accommodation plans were tightly
bound into the event schedule, and just what accommodation and
flights were or were not available would not be known until the
ticketing was finalised.
</P>
<P>
"Once those tickets are out I think a lot of things will
crystallise, but at the moment they are being hoarded up and not
necessarily made available," she added.
</P>
<P>
Olympic ticket allocation has been thrown into disarray by a
row with the International Amateur Athletic Federation over the
track and field schedule.

JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided in a telephone
conversation Sunday night to work together to trace the source of
the car bomb explosions in two Israeli cities earlier in the day,
a senior Palestinian security official said. But though he sought
cooperation this time, Barak will stop the final-status
negotiations if Israel is hit by a wave of terror attacks, a
senior Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is refusing to renew peace talks between
Syria and Israel before a formula is found that is agreeable to
both sides. According to U.S. officials, there is no point in the
two sides meeting as long as it is not clear that the talks will
bring peace. That is the conclusion reached from U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's recent shuttle mediation between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved the new agreement
signed between Israel and the Palestinians over the implementation
of the Wye accord. Twenty-two ministers voted for the deal,
while only two ministers voted against it.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet began to discuss the state budget for
the year 2000 on Sunday night. Since there is still dispute
between the ministers over the spending cuts, the discussion is
expected to continue later this week.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China's Largest Private Enterprise Rolls On (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- It is yet another busy day for
Liu Yonghao, president of the Hope Group, China's largest private
enterprise, whose daily output value of 27 million yuan (about 3.
25 million U.S. dollars ) matches the annual production of a
normal State-owned enterprise and represents one-tenth of the
country's daily total.
</P>
<P>
The firm, which processes and sells animal feed among a myriad
of other activities, employs 20,000 workers and last year the
group's net assets surpassed 2.5 billion yuan (about 300 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
And an ambitious aim of Liu and his three brothers, who set up
the company in 1982 after raising 1,000 yuan, a mere 120 U.S.
dollars, by selling their watches and bicycles, is to develop the
Hope Group into one of the world's 500 largest enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his brothers were listed as the richest men on the
Chinese mainland by the influential U.S. Forbes magazine in 1994,
a status which lasted for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
China now has 1.26 million privately-owned enterprises which
employ 78 million people. And their combined output value accounts
for one-fifth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Hope Group owns 128 enterprises in China. In 1998,
its animal feed output reached 3.5 million tons, while its annual
output value exceeded 7.5 billion yuan (about 903 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Besides the feed industry, Liu has also expanded his business
to financial services, real estate, trade, food processing and
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the group has set up four more plants in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in far northwest China. And an
animal feed processing plant involving an investment of 40 million
yuan (about 4.8 million U.S. dollars) is expected to be built in
Viet Nam, a mark of the group's determination to expand business
overseas.

<P>
For Liu's day begins early and the 48-year old "feed giant"
drives to work at 7.00 a.m. As soon as he arrives at his office
compound, dubbed the "barracks" by some western business media, in
urban Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, he
checks his daily work tasks.
</P>
<P>
A typical diary can include a board of directors meeting at 8:
00 a.m., discussion on the purchase of an animal feed plant at 9:
30, discussion about expanding investment in Vietnam at 11:00,
attending a housing fair after lunch, meeting with a central
government official at 3:30 p.m., an interview with a reporter
from the U.S.-based "Forbes" magazine at 6:30 p.m., ...and so on.
</P>
<P>
An American economist once described the success of the Hope
Group as the realization of the "American dream", yet Liu says it
is mostly due to the Chinese government's policies on providing
development opportunities for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected it to develop so well and so rapidly," Liu
remarked, citing the country's reform and opening-up policies
introduced in the late 1970s and the market economy policy in 1992
as the main factors influencing his group's success.
</P>
<P>
"Before the end of the chaotic 'Cultural Revolution' (1966-76),
there was no private enterprise in China," explained Liu Yonghao,
who is also vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce and a member of the Standing Committee of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
"This year's government insistence on the private economy being
considered an important component of a socialist market economy by
the revised Constitution is a significant turning point," he added.

Though a billionaire, Liu likes to have lunch with his fellow
workers whenever he has time. "It's a good chance for me to listen
to their suggestions as well as complaints," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Liu Yonghao and his brothers are easy to get along with,"
according to the group's vice-president Song Zuwei, who is the
former general manager of the Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co.
Limited, a leading car producer in China.
</P>
<P>
Indeed about half of the group's staff and the majority of its
management personnel used to work in State-owned enterprises
before they were employed by the Hope Group. "Competition amongst
private enterprises is actually about qualified personnel mostly,"
revealed Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuxin, a former worker in the State-owned Panzhihua Iron
and Steel Company, said that "It's the flexible system that has
attracted me to work in the group. Income here is directly linked
with our own performance. So I have to fully engage in my work."
</P>
<P>
Liu, who prefers to wear a grey Western-style business suit,
has no special hobbies and he neither smokes nor drinks. Sometimes,
though, he plays badminton with his fellow workers.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to do some exercises, but I don't have much time,
" Liu said regretfully.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Liu usually goes home to relax and watch TV
with his wife and their child. However, he often spends a lot of
time surfing on the Internet in order to learn more about the
outside world.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Launch Electronic Cheque Clearing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A new electronic cheque
clearing system is soon to be launched in Zambia and all
commercial banks registered in the country will fully implement it
within the next two weeks, a Zambian newspaper, the Post, reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zambia Electronic Clearing House Limited
project manager James Kalengo as saying all work relating to the
new system had been completed, test runs had been successful and
the system would be launched on September 20.
</P>
<P>
"With the introduction of the new system, banking in Zambia
would be made much easier as zambia becomes one of the few African
countries to introduce this very advanced system," Kalengo said.
</P>
<P>
Kalengo said the initial aim of the new system was to reduce
risks with cheques and speed up the clearing process through an
automated approach.
</P>
<P>
Member banks would use computers and electronic sorting
equipment to improve cheque processing, allowing cheques to be
machine read.
</P>
<P>
He said all cheques for the new system had been printed and
supplied to all six participating commercial banks. The clearing
equipment was supplied by a South African company and two
processing centers had been set up in Zambian capital Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> China: Attractive for World's Investors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the People'
s Republic of China. The past five decades of achievements in the
economy have attracted the attention of the rest of the world.
Xinhua began issuing a series of stories on the nation's economy
on August 17. This is the sixteenth story.
</P>
<P>
 BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua)-- Hundreds of top business
leaders from the world's best known multinational companies and
organizations will assemble in Shanghai later this month to attend
the influential 1999 Global Forum which is being staged by the
prestigious Fortune magazine, amongst other important bodies.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has been chosen as the venue because it is recognized
as China's largest and fastest developing economic and financial
center which will have a key role in world business affairs in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Official data indicate that 200 enterprises out of the Top 500
listed by Fortune magazine have already invested in China. And
since 1993 the country has become the second most attractive for
international investors after the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the amount of
overseas investment actually used has grown at an average annual
rate of 32.9 percent in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the number of projects involving foreign
direct investment had topped 324,000, with a total paid-up amount
of 265.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first three Sino-foreign joint ventures in China appeared
in 1980, one year after the government issued the Law on Chinese-
Foreign Equity Joint Ventures. Today over 170 countries and
regions invest in China, compared to around 30 in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the investment from other parts of Asia was valued at
31.33 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 68.9 percent of the
country's overseas investment. And an investment of 4.31 billion U.
S. dollars came from Europe, 4.56 billion U.S. dollars from Latin
America and 4.33 billion U.S. dollars from North America,
accounting for 9.5 percent, 10 percent and 9.5 percent of the
total respectively.

<P>
After 20 years of development, overseas funds have been
introduced into the major fields of China's national economy such
as agriculture, oil exploration, transportation,
telecommunications, commerce, trade, finance and banking; instead
of being restricted to the industrial and construction sector as
they were in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The expansion in the investment fields has helped improve the
entire industrial structure of China, with many sectors beginning
to change from being labor-intensive to technology-intensive.
</P>
<P>
While making great efforts to attract overseas investment,
China has actively encouraged its own organizations to invest
abroad during these recent dynamic years of change and challenge.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China invested 6.33 billion U.S. dollars in
setting up 5,666 enterprises overseas, including 3,000 trading
companies.
</P>
<P>
The country's overall investment portfolio spans more than 160
countries and regions, the major part of which lies in developing
countries, while its investment in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union grows rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In terms of investment from China, the United States has become
one of the hot-spots for Chinese non-trading enterprises, which
totaled 257 by the end of 1997, 12 percent of the total of Chinese
enterprises overseas. Russia is ranked second followed by Thailand,
Australia, Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises are now investing in even more fields,
expanding from trading to resources-exploration, agriculture,
manufacture, construction, transportation, medicines, finance and
tourism.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Diversify Power Generation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
diversifying power generation in a bid to reduce the adverse
effects of drought on supply, Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia
has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a long service award ceremony
to 78 employees in the power sector held recently in Mombasa, a
coastal city in southeastern Kenya, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said 383 out of the 527 megawatts that will be connected to
the national grid by 2003 will be generated from non-hydro power
sources.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 80 percent of power supplies in Kenya is
produced from the hydro-power stations, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Due to a long spell of drought this year, the water levels in
the three main energy reservoirs have fallen, causing a shortfall
in power generation.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Kenyan government announced a power rationing
across the county from September 1 because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that his government would inject 32.5
billion shillings (around 440 million U. S. dollars) into the
power sector in the next five years to facilitate power supply in
the country.

birth of Confucius, China's ancient thinker and educator, started
today in the Confucius Temple in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Among the events there will be a general knowledge test on

<HEADLINE> Reform the Only Way out for SOEs: Chinese President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The only solution for the
problems facing the massive number of China's state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) is to further deepen the reforms with the core
aim of establishing a modern corporate system, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin stressed recently.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during recent tours that took him to
Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong and Liaoning,
where he paid visits to major SOEs and met with local officials on
SOEs reforms, according to the Outlook weekly magazine published
here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that through the reforms, SOEs must become
corporate entities which are autonomous in business and bear
responsibilities for their own losses.
</P>
<P>
He added that corporate reforms must be carried out in large
and medium-sized SOEs so that they would have an effective
management system, including a good stimulus and control mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that great attention must be paid to the
leadership in SOEs, adding that it is very important to select
good senior managers.
</P>
<P>
As to the SOEs' heavy debts, surplus staff and social burdens,
Jiang said these problems must be solved gradually in accordance
with the principles of the market economy, instead of using the
old "big pot" methods.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the need to adjust the strategic structure and
layout of the state-owned economy, which demands that the
production capacity of some traditional industries be reduced and
that enterprises with backward equipment, that wastes resources
and produces heavy pollution, are eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Loan Scheme Helps Poor College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- College freshmen in China who
lack the funds to do pay their own tuition this year will still
have an opportunity to go to learn: the Chinese government began
offering loans to financially-strapped college students, today's "
China Education Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, in Beijing, 17 students from Qinghua
University and Beijing University have been granted a total loan
of 482,000 yuan from the Construction Bank of China, which started
providing loans for poor college students from July 8.
</P>
<P>
Each student can receive between 2,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan in
loans and are required to pay it back after they complete their
studies.
</P>
<P>
College students in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality
are required to pay half of the interest on the government loans
within four years of graduation. Chongqing is one of the eight
cities which has launched the new government loan project. The
other seven cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang,
Nanjing, Wuhan, and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
This was the direct result of an experimental loan system for
poor students which allows a 50-percent discount on interest and a
four-year repayment period after graduation.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has been jointly introduced by the People's Bank of
China, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and
will be administered by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China. It was launched as the new academic year began last week.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangxi Province, ten high school graduates who
have received the college matriculation notice recently received
loans from the Bank of China Jiangxi branch, which is the first of
this kind in the province, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Reform the Only Way out for SOEs: Chinese President (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the macro-economic situation and the state coffers allow,
Jiang said the banks might be asked to increase their reserves to
write off bad loans, which would be spent on promoting mergers and
settling bankruptcy cases among large and medium-sized SOEs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those SOEs satisfying set conditions should be
allowed to swap their debts with state-owned banks for equities to
be held by their asset management companies, which have been
established recently to manage the banks' bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also mentioned the need to allow more SOEs the
opportunity to raise funds from the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one of the most important and difficult jobs in
deepening the SOEs reform is to create new jobs for laid-off
workers, Jiang stressed that local governments must provide the
necessary funds.
</P>
<P>
He promised financial support from the central government to
the middle and western regions and old industrial bases, which do
not have the means to re-employ the laid-offs.
</P>
<P>
The president said efforts should be made to encourage laid-off
workers to start their own businesses or be employed by non-state-
owned sectors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for further efforts on the part of the government
to restrict its role in SOEs, taking a non-interfering role in
their operations.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said SOEs should also change their
attitudes and not continue to rely on the government. Instead,
they should adapt to the needs of the market and seek their
survival and prosperity through market competition.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his satisfaction over the general
situation of SOEs reform and their performance, citing statistics
which show a remarkable increase in enterprise profit and tax
revenues in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the government's policies in SOEs reforms
have been proved correct and that the goal of the reform is
completely attainable if such policies are implemented to the
letter and advantages are fully taken of the SOEs assets,
equipment, technology and other elements.

MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in
the August 4 bombing of a residential building in Buinaksk, a city
in Russia's Dagestan republic, has risen to 36, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The powerful blast demolished a five-story apartment building
in a military compound, killing 14 people instantly. Fifty of the
injured remain hospitalized, Tass said, quoting a spokesman with
the local emergencies ministry.
</P>
<P>
The explosion also badly damaged two nearby buildings and
smashed windows throughout the complex.
</P>
<P>
Search and rescue operation continues at the site, where at
least 10 people are still believed to be under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials blamed the Saturday night car bomb attack on
Islamic militants. A second bomb in another car was found and
defused Sunday in the military housing complex, they said.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Kolesnikov said the
bomb blast was directly linked to an incursion Sunday by militants
who crossed the border from Chechnya and seized four villages. An
estimated 1,500 federal troops were sent to the Novolaksky region,
located 65 kilometers northwest of Buinaksk, to counter the
incursion.
</P>
<P>
The militants were said to have Russian police totally
surrounded in the village of Novolaksky. Federal forces used tanks
and mortars to attack the militants, whose numbers were estimated
at 2,000 men.

<HEADLINE> Economists Pessimistic About Zambia's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) --Barclays bank's analysts have
doubted whether the economic growth target set by Zambian
government for this year will be hit.
</P>
<P>
The Quarterly Economic Review for the second quarter available
here Monday said the economy has not experienced any growth in the
year to date and prospects for the remaining months are not
brighter.
</P>
<P>
The government early this year projected a real economic growth
of four percent.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates the sale of mines, a good harvest and
reduced tariffs for the manufacturing sub-sector were supposed to
have played a major role in attaining the government goal.
</P>
<P>
However, the sale of mines were further delayed after the
pullout of a prospective strategic partner, Codelco, the Chilean
copper mining firm.
</P>
<P>
Results from the farming community have showed unexpectedly
lower harvest due to late fertilizer supply and bad weather.
</P>
<P>
"Large debt burdens, reducing local order books, pressure from
zambia revenue authority and demands for wage and salary
increments all add up to a serious situation," the review notes.
</P>
<P>
The review says that available statistics indicate total sales
volume slumping by 11 percent for the first five months of this
year, compared with the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Investment pledges have also reduced to 71 million U.S.
dollars in the first half of this year from over one billion
dollars in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This low level of investment pledge is of concern and the
situation will not change until the regional economy perks up and
investor confidence is restored through the stabilization of the
domestic economy," the review says.

New Nigerian:
</P>

the need to give a sense of belonging to all Nigerians as the
greatest challenge facing his administration.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:

<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian air force jets made
nearly 40 sorties of air strikes on rebel positions in Dagestan on
Sunday, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 light bombers and Su-25 attack planes bombed and fired
rockets at Islamic extremists around the villages of Karamakhi and
Chabanmakhi, Interfax said, quoting sources with the Russian
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, reconnaissance An-30 planes also flew over the
Novolakskaya district, which was captured by rebels from
neighboring Chechnya, a breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
The militants have captured the town of Novolakskoya and the
villages of Chapayevo, Sushiya, Akhar, Novoluki, Tukhchar and
Tamiyakh, Each of the villages was surrounded by hundreds of
armed militants, Interfax said, citing Russian military sources.
</P>
<P>
Large Russian federal units have not yet moved into the
district or Makhachkala, the sources say.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 militants have amassed around the village of
Borozdinskaya on the Chechen-Dagestani border, the local law
enforcement agencies said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the number of people killed in the
Saturday night car bomb attack, which demolished a five-story
apartment building in a military compound in Buinaksk, Dagestan,
has risen to 40, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 120 people injured in the blast, 58 have been
hospitalized, 22 have received medical aid on the spot and
released.
</P>
<P>
Search and rescue operation continues at the site, where at
least 10 people are still believed to be under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials blamed the attack on Islamic militants. A
second bomb in another car was found and defused Sunday in the
military housing complex, they said.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (Kanu) has won two more seats in the just
concluded parliamentary by- elections, therefore consolidating its
dominant position in the National Assembly.

<P>
The seats from constituencies in East Province, previously held
by the opposition Democratic Party, were captured by Kanu in
Saturday's by- elections.
</P>
<P>
Kanu has obtained 121 seats among the total of 222, while the
major opposition Democratic Party reducing its seats from 41 to
38, Daily Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the by-elections for local councils, Kanu also took 11 out
of 15 seats countrywide, even in strongholds of the opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
Although there is much criticism against the ruling party over
 corruption, poor governance and low efficiency, no opposition
parties are able to pose a menace to Kanu in the east African
country.

<HEADLINE> Habibie Says He Takes Responsibility for What is Happening in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Amid criticism over the
situation in East Timor, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
reaffirmed here Monday that he would take responsibility for what
has happened in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I am responsible for what has happened in East Timor," Habibie
said in a response to a question from journalists after a
consultative meeting with legislators at the House of
Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
Habibie also stressed that the Indonesian government would keep
struggling to create peace and calm the situation in East Timor
during the post-ballot and transitional period as arranged by the
New York agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said he had long talks with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan this morning, and because the two parties' have different
views, they will have further talks Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"What we have achieved right now is the fact that we have a
transparent, peaceful ballot (in East Timor). Don't take that for
granted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie conducted a consultative meeting with House leaders
after a majority of the East Timorese rejected an autonomy package
in the August 30 direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The situation in East Timor has been tense since the
announcement of the ballot results on September 4. The results
showed that over 78 percent of the voters supported East Timor's
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said a total of 145 people were killed in the
past two days and tens of thousands fled to some provinces of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, several Indonesian senior ministers including
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Defense Minister/Commander of
Armed Forces Wiranto visited Dili, capital of East Timor, and held
talks with officials of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET),
local religious leaders and leaders from pro-integration and
pro-independence groups. They discussed the security situation in
East Timor and other issues related to the future of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday, the U.N. Secretary General's special envoy for
East Timor arrived in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia. He is
expected to meet President Habibie and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
to discuss the situation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls East Timor Situation Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
called the situation in East Timor "absolutely unacceptable," as
anti-independence militiamen are ruling the territory with terror
after a majority of East Timoris voted for independence last week.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statement during a telephone conversation with
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio on Sunday, said Agence France-
Presse.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that France provides a total support to the
efforts of the United Nations Security Council aimed at ending the
violence in the former Portuguese colony, occupied by Indonesia
since 1975.
</P>
<P>
At least 145 people have been killed by pro-Indonesian
militiamen in East Timor since last Friday when the result of the
U.N.-sponsored referendum was announced, according to reports from
Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross said that 23,000 East Timoris are
taking refuge in the houses of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided on Sunday to send a mission
to Jakarta to pressure Indonesia to stop the violence in East
Timor.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore swimmer who won
gold in last month's South East Asian Games has failed a dope test,
according to an official at Singapore National Olympic Council (
SNOC) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old Nicolette Teo, who is asthmatic, tested
positive for terbutaline, a substance commonly found in medication
for the illness, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Terbutaline is on the list of stimulants banned by the world
swimming body Fina although its use is permitted if an athlete
declares it before a drug test.
</P>
<P>
Teo set a new Under-14 national record for the 200 meters
breastroke at the games in Brunei last month. After her win, she
received the routine test for all winners where she declared
ventolin, a medication she had been using for more than ten years.
</P>
<P>
The SNOC has not made a final decision to her offence.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Limits Truck Weight to Protect Roads, Bridges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 6 (Xinhua) -- In order to protect roads
and bridges, the Cambodian government introduced a new measure
last week to limit the weight of transport trucks.
</P>
<P>
According to a sub-decree approved by the Council of Ministers
last Friday, the trucks that exceed the weight limit by 5 to 10
percent will be fined 100,000 riel (about 25 U.S. dollars) and the
trucks that are more than 10 percent over the limit will be fined
25 U.S. dollars per ton. Offenders will not be allowed to proceed
until the fine is paid.
</P>
<P>
The weight limit will vary, depending on the type of trucks.
</P>
<P>
Five vehicle scales had already been set up last month on
National Route 6 between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap town and
National Route 7 between Capital Phnom Penh and Stung Treng.
</P>
<P>
The move, it was said, has achieved some success that fewer
overweight trucks are now being caught, but it is impossible to
completely stop the problem. Stronger enforcement is needed,
according to an official of the Transport Ministry.

<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that China supports Cote d'Ivoire's bid to host
the next Universal Postal Congress (UPC) and wished it success.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in a meeting with Daniel Kablan Duncan,
prime minister of Cote d'Ivoire, who arrived in the Chinese

Extending him a warm welcome, Zhu said the Chinese government
emphasizes the importance of the current UPC.

<P>
"Thanks to the concerted efforts of all parties the congress
has run smoothly," he said, adding that he knew it would be a
complete success and contribute further to the development of the
world's postal services.

The premier noted that relations between the two countries have
witnessed steady and healthy growth since the establishment of
diplomatic ties 16 years ago. "In recent years especially,

<HEADLINE> Modern Technology Being Used to Protect Chinese Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists are
using modern technology from chemistry, physics, biology and other
fields to restore mottled murals, fragments of sculptures, broken
cups and bowls, and other old cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Modern technology has been used since the 1960s to help protect
Chinese cultural relics, and, especially in recent years, to
reduce the harm done by humidity, pollution, and bacteria,
according to relics restoration specialists.
</P>
<P>
The 45,000 square meters of murals in the Mogao Grottoes at
Dunhuang in Gansu Province, northwest China, have been blurred or
become moldy for various reasons, so specialists at the Dunhuang
Academy developed a chemical bond to fix the murals, with special
tools.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological and environmental observation posts have set up
on the top of and inside the grottoes to monitor sunlight, wind
currents, precipitation, temperature, and humidity in the grottoes.
An environmental data bank is also being established at the
academy to provide information.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists in Shaanxi Province, also in the northwest, have
restored a bronze chariot from the Qin Dynasty more than 2,200
years ago in one of the most complicated restoration projects in
China.
</P>
<P>
The provincial museum of Guangdong in south China has developed
the country's first air filtration and purification system to
protect valuable paintings and books.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Cultural Heritage Administration,
cultural relics preservation specialists have developed various
technology to protect wooden buildings, stone inscriptions, murals,
and sculptures, to remove the rust from metal relics, to clean
textiles and papers, and to prevent moth and mold damage.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also know that some ancient relics are difficult
to preserve with modern technology. To them the earth can be
better than the most advanced museum for the time being.
</P>
<P>
So, more than 8,000 stone tablets with Buddhist scriptures will
be buried at the Yunju Temple in suburban Beijing on September 9,
after having been unearthed for more than 40 years. The weather
and air pollution have greatly damaged them and archaeologists are
waiting for more advanced technology to be found to help solve
their problem in the future.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Launches Export Diversification Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Commerce and
Industries Tofail Ahmed has expressed the hope that Bangladesh's
annual export earnings would reach 10 billion U.S. dollars very
soon from the current level of 5.3 billion provided the government
and private sector work closely to diversify export items.
</P>
<P>
To increase export earnings Bangladesh will have to diversify
its export items as well as explore export markets with a view to
finding out new areas where its products can be sold, he said
while addressing the launch ceremony of Bangladesh Export
Diversification Project (BDXDP) Saturday, according to the Daily
Star Monday.
</P>
<P>
BDXDP was formally launched with a 50 million U.S. dollars
assistance package from the World Bank, aiming to help sift their
export items and increase earnings.
</P>
<P>
At the launch ceremony, Frederick T. Temple, the World Bank
country director, said that with the help of this project
Bangladesh's exporters would be able to sustain the momentum which
they had already achieved in the garments, shrimp and leather
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need for a political will to overcome the
narrow vested interest in order to serve broader public interests.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh must make more rapid progress in addressing the
problems which drive up the costs of doing business and thus
undercut other steps to increase export competitiveness, Temple
said.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates, lack of sufficient medium and long-term
financing, poor power system, problematic ports and weak laws and
order situation are the main causes for the rise in the cost of
running businesses here, according to the WB country director.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rate Lower in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate slowed down to 5.5 percent in August from 5.7
percent in July mainly due to steady food rate, the National
Statistics Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The August figure brought the nation's inflation rate in the
first eight months of this year to 7.7 percent, well within the
government target range of 8 percent to 9 percent for the whole
year, the office said in a report issued here.
</P>
<P>
The office noted that the inflation rate for food remained at
3.2 percent, unchanged from the previous month, although higher
rates were posted in the prices of fish, 7.5 percent from 7.3
percent, and fruit and vegetables, 4.3 percent from -1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The unchanged food inflation rate was contributed to the lower
rates in the prices of rice, 2.9 percent from 3.5 percent, corn,
-4.4 percent from -2.3 percent, cereal preparations, 3.3 percent
from 3.9percent, dairy products, 3.1 from 3.3 percent, and eggs,
4.9 percent from 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the office said, the rate for clothing slowed down
to 5.5 percent from 5.7 percent, housing and repairs, 9 percent
from 9.3 percent, fuel, light and water, 5.9 percent from 6
percent, and services, 10.3 percent from 10.8 percent.
</P>

registered for July.

<HEADLINE> Growth In Sino-Russian Border Trade In First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Trade with Russia at China's
largest land port at Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia increased to 191.
96 million U.S. dollars worth in the first half of this year, up
30 percent from the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Why China Is Doing Research In Eastern Arctic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist
has explained why China chose the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean,
which has been ignored by humans for 100 years, for its first
Arctic Expedition.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, chief scientist on the expedition, says that most
countries have focused on sea areas close to Europe and North
America but that China looked at eastern region because it has a
greater impact on China. It is covered with very thick ice and is
hard to enter and little data is so far available because of its
proximity to the U.S. and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The 56-day survey will fill this gap and provide fairly
valuable information about how the region will affect global
climate changes.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. opened some formerly forbidden zones in
the mid 1990s and decoded a great deal of classified data, which
was favorable to China's Arctic research, Chen says. With 15 years
of Antarctic research, his country has been able to train a large
number of polar researchers and establish its own polar research
system to support this first Arctic Expedition.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China joined the International Arctic Science
Committee, which requires every member to do substantial research
and to contribute to the Arctic Pole sciences development.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges "Concrete Steps" by Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council said on Sunday it was planning to send a mission
to Jakarta to discuss with Indonesia how to deal with the violence
in post-ballot East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The council met Sunday night on the deteriorating situation in
the territory following the August 30 ballot on its future,
especially after the announcement of the ballot result Friday.
</P>
<P>
The majority of East Timorese, numbering some 800,000, voted in
favor of breaking ties with Indonesia, which has ruled the half-
island territory since 1976 after the withdrawal of the former
ruler Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Violent acts, in which anti-independence militias are believed
to be involved, have inflicted life losses on civilians and have
threatened the security of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET),
which organized and conducted the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Security Council September president, Arnold Peter van Walsum,
of the Netherlands, said the mission would consist no more than
five members and they are expected to depart on Monday, though the
members are not decided yet.
</P>
<P>
The mission would discuss with Indonesia "concrete steps to
allow the peaceful implementation of the ballot result," according
to a press statement issued by the president.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Indonesia has welcomed this intention," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The council "condemned in the strongest terms the intensifying
violence in East Timor" and "underlined once again the
responsibility of the Government of Indonesia to guarantee peace
and security in East Timor, the safety and security of all UNAMET
staff, local staff and premises," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is responsible for peace and security in East Timor
during the ballot and in its transition to independence, according
to the U.N. mediated agreement between Indonesia and Portugal on
May 5.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rice Export Likely to Top 4M Tons in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam expects to export 4.2
million tons of rice this year, 200,000 tons more than the
original forecast of the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
This, according to a report of Vietnam News Monday, is based on
an anticipated increased harvest and the turnover of Vietnam's
finished rice export.
</P>
<P>
The rice exports of the country already stood at 3.4 million
tons by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The gross output of Vietnam's spring-winter crop this year has
reached 14.04 million tons, 48,000 tons above the previous crop.
</P>
<P>
The final yield of the now-harvested autumn-summer rice crop is
forecast at 8.3 million tons, 800,000 tons higher than last
year's.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 tons of rice are in storage.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Trade Ministry estimated that Vietnam will export
400,000 to 500,000 tons of processed rice this month.

<HEADLINE> Museum Strings Changes for Ethnic Tujia People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Xiuhua Mountain Hall in the
city of Zhangjiajie in central China's Hunan Province is a
masterstroke accomplished by Chen Chuhua and Gong Daoxiu, a couple
of ethnic Tujia background, through life-long dedication.
</P>
<P>
The hall, the first household-based museum built for Tujia
people, holds several thousand pieces of folk handiwork belonging
of the Tujia people.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 5.8 million, the Tujia live mainly in the
mountains of western Hunan Province, southwestern Hubei Province,
and eastern Chongqing Municipality. In Hunan alone, there are 1.8
million Tujia people.
</P>
<P>
The Tujia long led an extremely miserable life because the
places where they lived featured harsh natural conditions and a
social order dominated by bandits.
</P>
<P>
The waterwheels, looms, oil mill utensils, and other farm tools
in the museum remind people of the harsh past lived under the
Kuomintang rule before when the People's Republic of China was
founded.
</P>
<P>
The hall also stores a number of luxury items belonging to well-
off families of Tujia background, including chairs and cupboards
bearing fine engravings, and brocades, which serve as a testimony
to the heavy oppression previously suffered by ordinary Tujia
people.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Tujia have become their own masters since liberation
in when the last group of bandits were crushed, said the husband,
Chen Chuhua. In the early 1950s Chen was a youngster enrolled in a
local drama troupe where he began to learn more about the culture
of the Tujia people.
</P>
<P>
Great progresses have been made in economic growth, social life
and cultural development in the western part of Hunan Province,
where the poor population has been dropping sharply year by year
since China initiated its reform and open-up drive in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Earth-shaking changes have taken place in the lives of 900,000
Tujia people living in Zhangjiajie, now a popular tourist
destination, and a growing number of them have moved from mountain
caves into high-rise flats with modern home appliances.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chuhua's own prize-winning miniature garden, featuring a
design called "skiff having left 100,000 hills," is representative
of the Tujia people now advancing toward a comfortable life, and
his design is among the many exhibits.

<P>
Though still living in the mountains, the Tujia have been
brought closer to the outside world with the completion of more
railways, highways, and the airport at Zhangjiajie. Many of them
are now good businessmen, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
"But Zhangjiajie, where Tujia people have lived for generations,
is losing its features with the rapid disappearance of its unique
traditional arts like suspended houses, and only a small number of
traditional items have been placed in my hall," Chen said sadly.
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to build a group of suspended houses near
his hall in a bid to protect them from completely disappearing and
also to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Chen's museum hall is constructed in traditional Tujia
architectural style, and has become a must-see item for tourists
in the region, receiving about 500 people daily during the height
of the tourist season.
</P>
<P>
The hall opened in 1997, and has won the support of the
Zhangjiajie city government. When direct air service from
Zhangjiajie to Hong Kong was inaugurated early this year, Chen
Chuhua, was specially invited by the city government to visit Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Many of the items collected at the hall are now also used as
samples by Zhangjiajie and other areas of western Hunan to develop
tourist souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jun, the couple's son and also a Chinese language and
literature graduate of Xiamen University, has chosen to return
home and manage the hall.
</P>
<P>
"It is a lot more backward here than it is in coastal areas,
but I can find a broader space to continue study and improve
myself," said the junior Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jun has pledged that he will enhance the value of the
museum by using the exhibits for research into the history of the
Tujia people to realize his pursuits and those of his people.

COLOMBO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
approved 568 industrial projects this year under an investment
promotion program to reduce joblessness, the Industrial
Development Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said that 325 industrial projects out of
586 are in commercial production, providing employment to nearly

<HEADLINE> Unforgettable Experience at UNDP (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-five-year-old Wei
Yuming, former vice minister of foreign economic cooperation,
remembered clearly what happened when he visited the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As an official in charge of China's foreign assistance, Wei was
leading a Chinese delegation on a visit to the UNDP in 1978, at
which time he told the UNDP administrator that China was ready to
accept foreign aid, breaking a 20-year taboo.
</P>
<P>
Shocked by Wei's remarks, the UNDP official could not believe
his ears and asked the interpreter to translate again. When they
finally understand what was meant, the administrator promised to
take the proposal into consideration and visit China the next year.
</P>
<P>
"I can remember every details of the scene," Wei told Xinhua in
a recent interview. "Before that I had pondered the question over
and over again -- why can't China, a developing nation, accept
foreign aid?"
</P>
<P>
Wei's trip to the UNDP ushered in a new era in China's
cooperation with the outside world. Prior to that, China was only
a contributor to the international community, not an acceptor.
</P>
<P>
For 20 years after the Soviet Union stopped its assistance to
China in the 1960s, China refused virtually any kind foreign
assistance, but did contribute money to the UNDP and other
international bodies constantly during this period.
</P>
<P>
Wei said his feeling that China should accept international aid
grew stronger after China again refused international
contributions of about 100 million US dollars following the
cataclysmic Tangshan earthquake in 1976 that claimed 240,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is not so rich, why can't we accept international
aid?" Wei asked.

<P>
But all that changed after 1979. Within the first five years
after that year, the UNDP offered 100 million US dollars of
assistance to China, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Assistance from the UNDP has added up to some 500 million US
dollars so far for more than 840 projects in China involving
agriculture, industry, energy, telecommunications, transportation,
health care, education, finance, taxation, social security,
poverty alleviation, women's development, economic restructuring,
and the utilization of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
"This effective cooperation between China and the UNDP has
helped expand bilateral ties between China and international
organizations on a mutually beneficial basis, introduced new
technology, and trained specialized professionals for China," Shi
Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (
MOFTEC), said at a seminar last week.
</P>
<P>
"With limited capital, the UNDP has played a unique role in the
China's reform and opening drive and economic construction of the
country that has a vast territory and a huge population," he said.
"This fully demonstrates that the UNDP's assistance is effective."
</P>
<P>
China has been implementing the policy of both giving and
accepting international assistance since 1979, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Other international bodies such as the UN Children's Fund and
the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, have followed suit. The
UN Children's Fund, for instance, cooperated on a total of 150
projects in China with aid of 300 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Brief History of China's National Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China's flag, the Five-Star
Red Flag, flies over Tian'anmen Square in the heart of the Chinese
capital and in front of government and commercial buildings and in
schoolyards
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are so familiar with it that every child knows that
the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong personally hoisted the flag for
the first time over Tian'anmen and announced the founding of the
People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Few people, however, know that the flag was selected by members
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
from 2,992 suggestions and Mao Zedong removed the proposed hammer
and sickle, the symbol of communism, from the final, as a sign of
greater democracy and national unity.
</P>
<P>
The time was 1949, when the Communist Party of China had seized
power from the corrupt Kuomintang regime, who then fled to Taiwan.
Between June and September of that year, the CPPCC met in Beijing,
then known as Beiping, to establish a government. Many issues were
discussed, and one was the new national flag.
</P>
<P>
People from all over sent in their own ideas to the political
advisors who discussed it and submitted their final candidate to
Mao. On the evening of September 25, he made the final changes.
</P>
<P>
During the struggle against the Kuomintang, the Party had
always held the banner of democracy and unity high and the one
large and four small stars against a red backdrop indicated that
the CPC wanted a coalition among all anti-Kuomintang forces and
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
On September 27, the CPPCC passed a resolution making the Five-
Star Red Flag the national flag, saying that it symbolized greater
unity among the revolutionary people of China.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Liansong worked as a secretary with a local news agency in
Shanghai when he submitted the winning design. In 1950, Zeng was
given five million yuan in the old currency for his design, or
about 500 yuan (60 U.S. dollars) in today's currency. He was also
invited by the central government to stand on the Tian'anmen
Rostrum to watch the parade during New China's first anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oil Refineries Trying to Turn Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The five major oil refineries
of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) are expected to
face tougher challenges in turning losses into profits by the end
of this year, as world oil prices and production costs continue to
rise, CNPC Vice-President Ren Chuanjun said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the five companies, in Jilin,
Daqing, Fushun, Liaoning, and Lanzhou respectively, cut their
losses by 2.46 billion yuan from one year earlier, with cumulative
losses reduced to 1.54 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this progress, it will be difficult for the five
refineries to turn their losses into profits within this year,
according to Ren, because they face restructuring problems in the
remaining months of the year. It is only by changing management
methods, improving quality and developing new products that they
can hope to become profitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The five have assets worth 107.4 billion yuan, or a fifth of
CNPC's total. They began to sustain losses in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready to Host 2006 Asiad, Says Sports Chief) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) General Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar Sunday
reiterated Indonesia's readiness to host the 15th Asian Games in
the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for that though we must of course see that our
country's situation and condition are good. We are not too rigid,"
Wismoyo said in Pekanbaru, capital of Riau.
</P>
<P>
To be able to host the games, Indonesia should have a strong
commitment to developing its own sports.
</P>
<P>
"Only with such strong commitment, were will be trusted by
other Asian countries to hold the Asian Games," the chief was
quoted by the Antara News Agency Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides Indonesia, Malaysia and Qatar are among the Asian
countries to bid for hosting the regional Olympic style games.
</P>
<P>
On Malaysia's wish that Indonesia abandons its plan to host the
games, Wismoyo said Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur must talk about it.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's dismal performance at the recent Southeast Asian (
SEA) Games in Brunei has prompted Minister of Sports and Youth
Affairs Agung Laksono to call for yet another review over the
country's planned bid to host the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was dealt a blow at the biennial Southeast Asian
sporting event last August, ending in third place behind Thailand
and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"What we are left with now is how to upgrade performance. We'd
better keep the aspiration of how Indonesia can become the host of
the 2006 Asian Games," Agung said here last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Agung rejected a further idea that he might as well
call for a halt to the plan, bearing in mind that the effort would
need a huge amount of money while the prospect looks gloomy.
</P>
<P>
The 14th Asian Games will be held in the South Korean city of
Pusan in 2002, while the 13th was held in Bangkok, Thailand, last
year.
</P>
<P>
In the last Asian Games, in which some 6,000 athletes from 41
countries and regions took part, Indonesia grabbed six gold, 12
silver and 17 bronze medals.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Push Allies to Answer Ustica Crash Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minster Massimo D'
Alema said Sunday that in the light of an investigative report,
the government would push the allied nations for more answers to
the mysterious crash of an Italian DC-9 passenger plane 19 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by Rome investigating judge Rosario Priore
last week, indicated that the crash off the island of Ustica near
Sicily killing all 81 on board was not an accident nor due to a
bomb aboard, but that the airliner might have been hit by
crossfire in a battle between warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The judge said it has been ascertained that there were at least
six fighter planes in the area, two French and four American,
including two F-104s near the airliner, and that an unidentified
plane, possibly a Libyan MIG warplane, appeared next to the DC-9
not long after it took off.
</P>
<P>
Given the results of such a lengthy investigation, D'Alema said
it was the duty of the government to press the allied governments
and NATO for any and all information that would help arrive at the
truth.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China has made a remarkable
breakthrough in controlling water and soil erosion in Northwest
China's Loess Plateau, the country's wasted and worn land, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the cycle is being slowed by planting sea
buckthorn, a drought-tolerant plant that holds other important
qualities. Soil and water erosion are among China's top
environmental issues. They plague over one-third of the country's
territory and threaten the survival of many rural people in
chronic poverty.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quotes Zhu Dengquan, vice minister of water
resources as saying that sea buckthorn has become a pioneer tree
species in arid and semi-arid areas, mostly featuring severely
eroded lands.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the plant is especially effective in the sandstone
area of the Loess Plateau, with its drought tolerance, highly
developed root system, adaptation to poor soil and fast growth.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, China has controlled soil erosion in 32,000 square
kilometers in border areas crossing Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the worst eroded areas
of the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
China is set to plant 2 million hectares of sea buckthorn in
the Loess Plateau border area within 10 years. The project many
reduce annual sediment washed into the Yellow River by 170 million
tons. Of those, 82 percent are coarse sediments.
</P>
<P>
Having treated soil and water conservation as "basic State
policies" since 1991, the government is now accelerating erosion
control and reclamation. So far this year, about 900,000 hectares
of sea buckthorn plantations have been established. Combined with
the plant's natural habitat, China has some 1.5 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, the Chinese government spent 30 million yuan (3.
6 million U.S. dollars) on a demonstration project of sea
buckthorn in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River,
says the paper.

Editor's note: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People' s Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is
releasing about 50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old,

experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the sixteenth story.
</P>
<P>
GUILIN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- With the four new tiger cubs
that were born last month, 37-year-old Zhou Weisen now has raised
171 tigers on his Xiongsen Mountain farm for bears and tigers in
this scenic city of Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
south China.
</P>
<P>
The mountain farm is considered the world's largest tiger
breeding and scientific research base, where tigers are also
taught how to hunt to prepare them for their return to the wild.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Zhou, now a private businessman,
claimed that he has had an unbreakable bond with tigers since his
birth in 1962, the Year of Tiger according to the traditional
Chinese lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
Zhou came from a poor family in Fuzang Township of Pingnan
County in Guangxi. When he was young, he was forced to leave
school in the third grade because his family could not afford the
tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
He made a living first by rearing ducks. In the early 1980s,
encouraged by the government that "getting rich is glorious," Zhou
learned to trap snakes for sale to urban areas in Guangdong
Province and Guangxi where there is a tradition of eating snake
meat.
</P>
<P>
When the government promulgated laws to protect wildlife, Zhou
switched to rearing snakes in captivity, and with the guidance of
technical experts, he raised 500,000 snakes a year and earned over
one million yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
"After that shift, I found I have gradually changed from a
wildlife trapper to a wildlife protector," said Zhou, who built a
center for scientific research and propagation in 1993 on his
hometown's mountain with millions of yuan in savings.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's cause won support from the Chinese Forestry Ministry,
the regional forestry bureau of Guangxi, and local governments,
and he was given a permit to rear large animals like tigers and
black bears. After that, 13 tigers and more than 60 black bears
were transferred from around the country to his center for
propagation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Zhou has invested a total of 400 million yuan in
building the 500,000-squre-meter Xiongsen Mountain Farm for Tigers
and Bears, where now roams Siberian tigers, south China tigers,
Bengali tigers, white tigers, black bears, and leopards -- all on
the state's top protection list.
</P>
<P>
"Tigers are the king of beasts, and my life's goal is to give
the world a gift by producing more tigers and saving tigers from
the brink of extinction," said Zhou.

<P>
Experts estimate that the number of tigers living in the wild
in China is no more than 50, and no more than 3,000 worldwide.
Artificial procreation has become the major method for saving
tigers from extinction.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Zhou Weisen has led a group of experts
to try a range of measures, including simulating the environment
of the wild and stepping up the prevention and cure of diseases to
improve the tigers' procreation capacities.
</P>
<P>
As a result, tigers now breed in all seasons and mate more
often than before. From June 7 to 16 this year alone, three female
tigers at the farm gave birth to 11 cubs.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Wildlife Resources College of the
Northeast Forestry University and the Veterinary Medical Institute
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army University for Agriculture
and Animal Husbandry have conducted research in cooperation with
technical experts on the mountain farm which leads the country in
the research on tiger viruses, blood transfusions for tigers
suffering anemia, and Cesarean births.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for creating a gene bank for tigers at the
mountain farm, the first of its kind in China, are also underway.
</P>
<P>
In preparing tigers for their return to the wild, training is
also held to teach them to hunt at the mountain farm.
</P>
<P>
When the training first started, the tigers shied away when
they saw oxen or pigs. But after some training, they become
aggressive and the cattle and pigs had to run for their lives.
</P>
<P>
Rearing these animals is a non-profit business, said Zhou, who
added that the source of income for the mountain farm is sight-
seeing and tourism programs based on animals shows, coupled with
donations.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the current propagation speed of tigers at the farm,
the number of tigers there will exceed 500 next year and 1,000 in
2003, he said.
</P>
<P>
"My ambition is to become the tiger-rearing king of the world,"
said Zhou, "Then, I will send them abroad, free of charge."

nations and is part of an international technique training program
the Chinese government started in 1990.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Xinjiang to organize a class like
this for people from Central Asia. In 1995, Kazakhstan Uzbekistan,
and Kyrgyzstan sent 12 students to attend the training courses.

<HEADLINE> Houston Beats New York to Win 3rd WNBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inspired by the memory of former teammate Kim Perrot, who died
of cancer on August 19, and stung by Teresa Weatherspoon's miracle
game-winning shot from beyond midcourt that evened the series for
New York on Saturday, the Comets stifled the Liberty with a
standout defensive performance.
</P>
<P>
"We won this for the memory of Kim. This has been a wonderful
time winning back to back to back," said Cynthia Cooper, who
garnered her third straight WNBA Championship Most Valuable Player
award after a 24-point performance.
</P>
<P>
Said Houston coach Van Chancellor: "After yesterday, today's
game was the sweetest it's ever been. Give New York credit, they
did an amazing job."
</P>
<P>
Houston, which improved to 7-0 when facing elimination in the
WNBA playoffs, held New York to 7-of-30 (23.3 percent) shooting in
the second half and 31 percent (17-of-55) overall.
</P>
<P>
The Comets held the Liberty without a basket for a 10:29
stretch bridging the halves and opened a 38-29 lead with 11:54 to
play.
</P>
<P>
Tina Thompson, who finished with 13 points, dealt the crushing
blow as she netted seven points in a 10-0 tear that extended the
Comets' lead to 48-31 at the 4:29 mark.
</P>
<P>
Sue Wicks scored 11 points and Vickie Johnson added nine for
New York, which was thwarted by Houston in the WNBA Finals for the
second time in three years. The Comets also knocked off the
Liberty in the inaugural WNBA Final in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Houston made 27-of-32 free throws while New York only went to
the line nine times, making eight. Cooper was 13-of-15 from the
charity stripe.

<HEADLINE> Special Scholarship For Rural College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A double dose of joy could
strike students from villages who were admitted to colleges this
summer as they might also be in line for nearly 1,000 U.S. dollars
of scholarship grants - if they are the first college students in
the half century history of their villages.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 colleges and universities in China are now open
for such applications from freshman who are from villages.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship is jointly sponsored by the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF), China Youth Daily (CYD) and Coca
Cola Co., Ltd. (China).
</P>
<P>
A qualified college student will receive a scholarship of 8,000
yuan (about 964 U.S. dollars) during his or her four years'
college life. The scholarship was designed to help these students
finish their college education.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors expect to grant eight million yuan in total for
this special scholarship, which is mainly available to some 50
famous universities. Normal, agricultural or forestry universities,
and those for ethnic nationalities will be given preference.
</P>
<P>
The final result of the scholarship is scheduled to be
announced in mid-October.

<TEXT>
<P>
The win comes two weeks after Esperance convincingly trounced
defending champions ASEC Abidjan 3-0 in their opening match of the
Champions League campaign.
</P>
<P>
Goals from Khalid Azatez and Edith Agoye in the first 18
minutes of the game ensured Esperance have a clear lead in group
two.
</P>
<P>
Morocco's Raja Casablanca are the leaders in group one after
their shock win over pre-tournament favourites Al Ahli of Egypt in
Cairo on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Khoubbach's late winner kept up the 1997 winner's 100
percent record in their group and left Ahli's campaign in tatters.
</P>
<P>
The popular Egyptian club lie third after Hearts of Oak of
Ghana moved up to second place in the group with a 3-0 win over
Shooting Stars of Nigeria in the west African derby on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All three goals in the game in Accra came in the first half as
Stars slumped to their second successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
They now look likely to keep up Nigeria's unenviable record of
never having produced a winner in Africa's top club competition in
more than 30 years of entering teams into the event.
</P>
<P>
In group two, ASEC Abidjan's teenage team got their campaign
back on track by beating St Louisienne from the French island of
La Reunion 3-1 in Abidjan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the Ivorians had to come from a goal down at half-time to
take maximum points.

In the African Cup Winners' Cup, both Club Africain of Tunisia

Club Africain drew 1-1 away against former winners Power
Dynamos of Zambia in Kitwe on Saturday after a penalty by veteran
striker Faouzi Rouissi gave them a 30th minute lead.
</P>
<P>
Dynamos equalised within three minutes through Japhet Makayi
but will find the going tough in Tunis in the return on September
25.
</P>
<P>
Africa Sports led for most of their match in Rabat on Sunday
against Morocco's Royal Armed Forces after a 26th minute goal by
Fadel Keita.

<P>
But the military side got a face-saving equaliser through
Mohammed El Fadli six minutes from time.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson Approved to Use Its Own Telecom Equipment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing and Nanjing
branches of Ericsson (China) are the first to be granted all the
certificates necessary to expand its complete set of GSM (Global
System of Mobile phone) 900/1800 MHz telecommunication technology
and products in the Chinese telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
The company recently obtained four certificates for the digital
mobile telecommunication exchange and station systems, and
together with two certificates for its mobile phone system, has
now passed all the quality test for the GSM 900/1800 MHz system.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1995, Ericsson (China)'s Beijing branch has a
registered capital of 20 million U.S. dollars, with total
investment reaching 28 million dollars. Last year, it had a sales
volume exceeding 3.4 billion yuan (about 408 million U.S. dollars),
earning 51.9 million dollars from exports.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing branch, set up in 1992, deals mainly in producing,
selling, and installing Ericsson's GSM 900/1800 MHz digital mobile
telecommunications stations, mobile telecommunication exchanges,
and program-controlled telephone exchange systems.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish company, a telecommunications giant, has set up 23
agencies and eight joint ventures in China, its largest market in
the world, with over 3,800 Chinese working for them.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry
show that Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson now occupy around 90
percent of the Chinese mobile phone market.

<HEADLINE> United, Powerful China Vital to Overseas Chinese, Scholar Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A united, powerful and
prosperous China is vital to the interests of overseas Chinese,
said a university professor here.
</P>
<P>
This is a shared feeling of numerous Chinese Canadians, who are
busy preparing unprecedented large-scale parades in celebrating
the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. B.N. Cham, chairman of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese
Canadian Organizations, expressed to Xinhua their deep-rooted
emotions for a respected China.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will look up to you, if you are too weak and
indifferent in defense of your own interests," said the 63-year-
old professor of York University.
</P>
<P>
He lambasted the idea of splitting China into "two countries"
being preached by Lee Teng-hui in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people suffered enough in old China under the so-
called "political pluralism," which proved nothing more than death
and poverty resulted from dogfights of warlords, the professor
said angrily.
</P>
<P>
"Warlords and political pluralism harmed overseas Chinese as
well, for you can imagine the humiliation overseas Chinese felt in
those days, when the rift-torn China was considered inferior and
the Chinese were rejected even entry into restaurants or cinemas
of the white," Cham said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
Cham said, the overseas Chinese have for the first time enjoyed a
feeling of self confidence and respect in the world.
</P>
<P>
He found himself irresistibly attracted by historical events
and theory of the revolution in the mainland of China. He read
works not only by Chinese leaders, but also by famous foreigners.
</P>
<P>
A "China craze" arose in the wake of the historic handshake of
Chairman Mao Zedong and U.S. President Richard Nixon and a second
wave of "China craze" came after China opened its door to the
outside world, Cham continued.
</P>
<P>
He was carried away by the China wave and in 1979 made his
first home visit to Puning County, Guangdong Province,-- still a
poor and backward place, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
But great changes overwhelmed Cham in his later home visits. "
Just see those newly erected magnificent buildings along the
streets of the same township," he said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
Cham envisages broad prospects for China in the next century
with stronger national defense and higher economic development
level.

<HEADLINE> Survey Highlights Sharp Income Disparity in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Most young workers
recently surveyed see an America in which there are sharp
disparities in income and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The national survey of nearly 800 American workers between 18
and 34 found that there are many unmet needs among workers despite
the fact that the country is enjoying the lowest jobless rate in
almost 30 years and more than 19 million jobs created since 1991.
Many of them believe corporate America has failed to share the
rewards of success.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the AFL-CIO, the U.S. national federation of
labor unions, the survey was conducted by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates and released at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Six-two percent of workers from 25 to 29 say employees fall
short when it comes to sharing profits with employees. By the time
they reach their 30s, young workers have come to view the economy
as one that fails to adequately reward all who contribute to its
success: 70 percent of workers from 30 to 34 say the most
important goal for the economy is to "make sure everyone, not just
CEOs, gets their fair share."
</P>
<P>
Young workers without degrees feel more insecure about the
future. The are facing a host of financial and economic pressures
that many college graduates are escaping. According to the survey,
49 percent of those without degrees are far more likely to worry
often about their income falling behind the cost of living, not
having enough money for retirement, being unable to afford an
education for their children, having more debt than they can
handle and health expenses they can't afford.
</P>
<P>
Three-fourth of today's young workers in the United States do
not have college degrees. This "forgotten majority" is in a
disadvantageous position because, according to the U.S. Labor
Department, the country's new economy is creating high-skilled,
highly-paid jobs, but most require a college degree. Among them
are computer engineers, database administrators, desktop
publishers, medical assistants and securities and financial sales
people.
</P>
<P>
While 71 percent of young college graduates have full-time,
permanent jobs, only half of young workers without degrees have
standard employment; the rest are working in part-time, temporary
or other substandard arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the survey, only 39 percent of young workers
without degrees are covered by employer-provided health insurance
and only 36 percent have a retirement plan with employer
contributions.
</P>
<P>
While two-thirds of young college graduates say they are
earning enough to save for the future, 51 percent of young
nongraduates say they are earning just enough or not enough to pay
the bills. Only 36 percent of them earn at lease 20,000 U.S.
dollars a year, compared with 68 percent college graduates who
earn more than this sum.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that a new generation is entering the work
force with high hopes that are quickly replaced by
disillusionment.

to see China in the World Trade Organization because Beijing had a
major role to play in ensuring long-term strength and stability in

"Membership would ensure that China's trade partners enjoy
improved market access and a stable environment for investment and

<P>
Caborn's scheduled visit to China, which begins on Monday, is

China.
</P>
<P>
"The UK is now the sixth largest global investor in China and
by far the leading European investor with British companies
involved in more than 2,000 joint ventures," Caborn said.
</P>
<P>
"UK companies recognize that China is a market for long-term
investment, not easy short-term profits, and most are pleased with
their business achievements in China," added the trade minister.

<HEADLINE> Redknapp out of Poland Decider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The injury kept the Liverpool captain out of England's 6-0
drubbing of Luxembourg but coach Kevin Keegan had been hoping the
midfielder would be fit enough to play against Poland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
England must win in Warsaw to ensure a play-off place in the
European Championships.
</P>
<P>
The news is a blow to Keegan, who is staring at a lengthening
injury list which already contained David Seaman, Darren Anderton,
Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand.
</P>
<P>
Inspirational playmaker David Beckham has a hamstring problem,
while Tony Adams has a dead leg and Kieron Dyer was substituted at
half-time following a knock and cramp.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who hopes all three will be fit again by Wednesday,
said: "They have all received treatment and we are hopeful about
their progress. David is very bullish about his own fitness."
</P>
<P>
The good news for Keegan is that Paul Scholes, who scored a hat-
trick against the Poles at Wembley, is back from suspension.
</P>
<P>
Chris Sutton's foot injury has cleared up and with 19-year-old
striker Michael Owen proving himself back from injury with a
sensational last-minute goal at Wembley, Keegan has plenty of
permutations to unlock the Poles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Dyer, who says he hopes Keegan's decision to
substitute him at half-time against Luxembourg means he is being
saved to face the Poles, says his debut was the best day of his
life.
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard that kind of reaction towards me from a crowd
before.
</P>
<P>
"It nearly brought tears to my eyes. It was unbelievable. I
think it was when I set up Alan Shearer for his hat-trick goal
that they were shouting `There's only one Kieron Dyer.'
</P>
<P>
"Wembley was everything what I expected and more especially
with the crowd giving me a standing ovation when I walked around
the pitch at the start of the second half."
</P>
<P>
"Stuart Pearce said to me before the game `If you bring the way
you train onto the pitch, you'll be the best player today' and I
did just that," he added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meeting on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council late Sunday began discussing how to deal with the
violence in East Timor since the announcement of a ballot on the
future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-conducted ballot on August 30 turned to be in favor of
East Timor independence from Indonesia with only 21.5 percent of
voters wanting it to stay within Indonesia while enjoying special
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Western reports said many East Timorese were killed in two days
after the ballot result was made public on Friday EST.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the international community would like the U.N.
to send peace-keeping forces to East Timor, but U.N. officials
said they hope that Indonesia will take the responsibility of
maintaining peace and security there according to the May 5
agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting began at 5:15 pm EST with a council
statement expected tonight, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Update: Summit of la Francophonie Ends in Moncton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The 8th summit of la
Francophonie ended Sunday morning in Moncton, Canada, with a final
communique and a plan of action stressing the role of young people
for the future.
</P>
<P>
Peace, security, individual rights, education, jobs and new
technology are the common concerns of the young people of the la
Francophonie nations, according to Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, who chaired the three-day meeting in the capacity of
host.
</P>
<P>
With a traditional topic of youth, which is the theme of the
Moncton summit, the meeting was for the first time distracted by
tense dispute over the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a delegate from the Democratic Republic of
Congo and two other Congolese Saturday when they were approaching
for a fight over the issue outside the summit building. The
delegate was later released.
</P>
<P>
Of the 52-member summit of la Francophonie, 32 African nations
were named as "human rights abusers" by some media and
organizations, giving rise to open wrangling about their
membership.
</P>
<P>
Chretien and French President Jacques Chirac told the final
press conference Sunday that they were opposed to sanctions or
expulsion of member states from the group of 49 nations.
</P>
<P>
The biannual summit of la Francophonie was first held in 1986,
when 41 governments were represented. Membership has since
expanded to 52 governments, including the participating
governments of New Brunswick and Quebec of Canada.
