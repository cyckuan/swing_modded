Glitch Delays Missile Defense Test
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A technical glitch has delayed a $100 million missile
defense test by at least two hours, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. He
said engineers were hoping to fix the problem in a short time, and the test was
expected to start shortly after midnight EDT. He said the problem was a weak
battery that supplies power to the missile's telemetry system, which is needed
to help engineers on the ground record the exact point of impact between the
target -- actually a dummy warhead sent aloft by the missile-- and a ''kill
vehicle'' streaking toward it from the opposite direction. The test, if
successful, could move the United States a step closer to building a nationwide
anti-missile shield.

Second Earthquake Strikes Nicaragua
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The second strong earthquake in as many days shook
Nicaragua on Friday, causing houses to collapse and terrifying residents, radio
reports said. There were reports of at least two deaths and several injuries.
The 5.2-magnitude quake hit at 6:10 p.m. and was centered in the Laguna de
Apoyo, a lake that also was the epicenter of a 5.9-magnitude quake Thursday that
killed four children. The lake is located about 25 miles east of the capital,
Managua.

Typhoon Plows Into Japan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A typhoon that killed 12 people in the Philippines plowed into
Japan Saturday, sending earth loosened by a powerful earthquake crashing down
from cliffs to bury buildings and roads. The storm lashed the Izu island chain
south of Tokyo early Saturday before heading northeast to skirt the Pacific
coast of Japan's main island of Honshu. The festival hall of a shrine and three
homes were demolished by landslides overnight on Kozushima, where 788 residents
had been evacuated, said local official Chizuru Ishida. There were no injuries.

Lawmakers Support Montenegro Stand
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Lawmakers on Saturday backed the Montenegrin
government's decision to reject changes to the constitution -- amendments aimed
at concentrating power into the hands of the Yugoslav president while reducing
Montenegro's status. After a marathon session marked by insults between
pro-independence and pro-Yugoslav camps, 35 of the parliament's 53
representatives voted in favor of the resolution adopted Friday by the
Montenegrin government. The other deputies in the 78-member legislature were not
present or abstained.

Fuel Cans Found at Davidian Compound
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Four gas cans and a homemade torch were recovered from
what had been the dining room of the Branch Davidian complex after fires
consumed it in 1993, Texas Rangers testified Friday. Bobby Grubbs, one of the
Rangers who helped gather evidence including the fuel cans after the deadly
fire, testified that Clive Doyle, one of nine people who escaped, told him the
blaze was started with Coleman fuel that was distributed throughout the
compound. When asked if he knew who started it, Doyle refused to answer the
question, Grubbs testified.

U.K. Kids Grab 'Harry Potter'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Eager young hands grabbed thick volumes of ''Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire'' at midnight Friday, the moment that bookstores around
Britain began selling the boy wizard's fourth magical adventure -- a massive hit
even before its publication. As Harry's latest exploits burst upon a waiting
world in the middle of the night, it was hard to tell who was more excited --
the book industry or the throngs of youngsters whose genuine eagerness to read
it created a marketer's dream.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose strongly Friday as investors welcomed cooler job

interest rate increases. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 154.51 at

Yankees Defeat Mets 2-1

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With the Yankees' superiority in question for the first time
in years, Paul O'Neill made a home-run saving grab to back Orlando Hernandez and
preserve a 2-1 win over the Mets tonight. After Melvin Mora tripled with one out
in the eighth inning, Derek Bell hit a towering drive to right field. O'Neill
went back to the wall and timed his jump perfectly, reaching about two feet over
the eight-foot wall to bring back a sure, game-tying home run.

<HEADLINE> In search of the rare Lozier car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Wanted: Car lovers seek rare Lozier.
Plattsburgh-built, internationally-raced car, probably about 90
years old. given as gift would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   The Lozier Motor Co. once built luxury automobiles at its
Plattsburgh plant, expensive racers exported to Europe and other
foreign markets. Eighty-two years after the company stopped making
cars, the only reminder is the building where the vehicles were
assembled.
</P>
<P>
   But owners of antique and classic cars like Anthony Vaccaro are
looking for a Lozier to be given back, hopefully as a gift for
display in the community where it was created. Vaccaro envisions a
museum-like display with maybe an interpretive center featuring
other historical artifacts, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that a few Loziers still do exist,'' Vaccaro told the
Plattsburgh Press-Republican. ''What wed like to do is form a
committee and look at the possibility of finding one and bringing
it back to Plattsburgh as a gift to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Lozier initially built powerboats. In 1907, he started
racing his cars, winning one and finishing second in four races the
Loziers competed in.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the company produced its first six-cylinder engine
and finished one-two in the Brighton Beach race at Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Lozier cars competed in the first-ever Indianapolis
500. A Lozier vehicle driven by Ralph Mulford finished second in
the controversial race. Mulford and many others believed his car
had finished first but felt judges had lost count of laps and gave
the victory to another car.
</P>
<P>
   Lozier eventually moved operations to Detroit. Vaccaro is
searching for a Lozier that was built in Plattsburgh. The company
was forced into bankruptcy and closed in 1918.

<HEADLINE> Kids line up, cash registers jingle, for Harry Potter  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO IBARGUEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Children hyped for the first copies of ''Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' crowded East Coast bookstores at
midnight Friday, anxiously grabbing up volumes of the boy wizard's
fourth magical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Stores nationwide happily accommodated the kids' wishes, hosting
parties and sleepovers from places as varied as Brooklyn, N.Y., to
West Des Moines, Iowa. Web-based companies like Amazon.com and
Kozmo.com gave others the chance to get the books as fast, if not
faster, from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll just read it until I have to go to bed ... and
finish it when I can,'' said 12-year-old Jason Mellow as he waited
for the doors to open at Books of Wonder in Manhattan. ''Then I'll
probably read it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing second in line, he was beat out by Douglas Korvis, 53,
who showed up to hold a spot for his daughter Alexandra. She and
Jason both read the three previous Harry Potter volumes by
flashlight under the covers - long past bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra snatched the latest edition as soon as the clock
struck. Holding it up and smiling for the TV cameras, she gleefully
handed over her dad's $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for being such a very good sport about this,'' shop
owner Peter Glassman told her. ''Enjoy the book and come tell us
how you like it!''
</P>
<P>
   The story was no different in London, where Harry's latest
travails went on sale at 7 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love them,'' proclaimed 12-year-old Philadelphian Julia
Rainer as she savored her new book at Waterstone's bookstore in
Piccadilly Circus. ''It's almost as if you're in the book when you
read them.''
</P>
<P>
   She and scores of other kids waited in a line that ran from the
cash register through the store, out the door and down the block to
buy their 640 pages of excitement at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry. (The U.S. version, in a different type face, is 734
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Far from daunted by the extraordinary length, 11-year-old
Anthony Chapman was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's even better than the other ones, because you get
a lot to read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Meier, a 14-year-old from Seattle had to share her copy
with her family, and they took turns reading passages aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been fighting over who gets to read a part and then we
stop and give it to each other,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Harry's latest exploits burst upon a waiting world in the
middle of the night, it was hard to tell who was more excited - the
book industry or the throngs of youngsters genuinely eager to read.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important and magical outcome of this story is the
love of reading that Harry Potter has rekindled among readers of
all ages, especially young children,'' said Barnes &AMP; Noble Vice
Chairman Steve Riggio, whose company promised same-day delivery of
books ordered by 11 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Waterstone's in Great Britain, some Barnes &AMP; Nobles in the
United States invited youngsters to bring sleeping bags and await
the witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the Glasgow Waterstone's, events manager Kim Hardie called
the response phenomenal, saying ''about 80 percent of my time in
the last fortnight (two weeks) has been spent dealing with Harry
Potter queries.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Amazon.co.uk Internet site promised customers their
pre-ordered copies would go in the mail Friday for delivery by
Saturday. Amazon.com employees at warehouses in Seattle stacked
books floor to ceiling preparing to ship a minimum of 250,000
copies the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site had tallied up more than 347,000 sales -
more than six times the existing prepublication record set in March
by John Grisham's latest novel, ''The Brethren.'' New York-based
Barnes &AMP; Noble said it already had 360,000 pre-orders and expected
to break records for first-day and first-week sales for any book in
the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' occupied the top spot on
both Amazon's and barnesandnoble.com's best seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Not every bookstore was a happy scene, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Moran, co-owner of Apple Valley Books in Winthrop, Maine,
said she ordered half of her Harry Potter books from Ingram, just
in case, and half from Scholastic in January. The Scholastic books
never showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got kids who are going to be very unhappy because the
small independent bookstores were treated this way by a big
company,'' Moran said. ''I want Harry Potter to come here and I
want those people at Scholastic to be turned into toads.''
</P>
<P>
   The first print run by the book's British and U.S. publishers
totaled 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Author J.K. Rowling was too busy last year writing this book to
do much publicity for ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,''
the third book in the series.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she's doing book signings on a promotional tour that
sets off on a Hogwarts Express train from ''Platform 9 3/4'' at
King's Cross station, where the boy wizard and his friends embark
each year on their way to adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Some bookstores broke the embargo set by U.S. publisher
Scholastic Inc. and began selling copies early.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schuppe, an independent bookstore owner in Stockton, Calif.,
said he had not signed an agreement with the publisher to make his
customers wait. By Friday morning, he had sold out of his 50
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, were waiting to celebrate the midnight launch.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people had reserved copies of the book at Borders
Books and Music in Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't do nutty stuff like that very often, but this is
maniacal,'' said Doug Weaver, a manager at Borders. ''It's amazing.
This is a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're hard to put down,'' agreed 11-year-old Rebecca Gant, a
Lawrence resident. ''I love a good story.''

<HEADLINE> Perot Supported Ousted From Post  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bending to wishes of Pat Buchanan's campaign,
the chairman of the Reform Party has ousted a longtime supporter of
Ross Perot from a crucial committee post.
</P>
<P>
   Perot backer Russell Verney had already been removed from the
party's national committee, and on Friday he was also removed as
co-chairman of the credentials committee, which helps determine
which delegates are seated at the party's August convention in Long
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, in turn, will help determine who gets the
party's presidential nomination and the $12.6 million in federal
campaign dollars that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Party members are now voting through mail-in ballots, but the
convention has the power to overturn those results with a
two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a longtime Republican, left the GOP in hopes of
running for president with the Reform Party. But some Reform Party
veterans worry that his socially conservative positions will take
them in the wrong direction and they resent him trying to take over
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Moan, the party's acting national chairman, said he
decided Friday to remove Verney and replace him with Kelley Abt, a
Buchanan supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Moan said he made the change because Verney had become too
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fairly or unfairly -- I consider it unfairly -- Russ had become
a lightening rod,'' Moan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Verney and his supporters argued it was an old-fashioned
power grab by the Buchanan forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Buchanan jihad,'' said Donna Donovan, the party's
press secretary and a Verney backer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Buchanan supporters told Moan they had enough votes
to call for a special meeting of the national committee. And,
according to Verney and Donovan, they threatened to use that
meeting to remove Moan as chairman if he did not remove Verney
first.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a political calculation that the acting chairman had
to make,'' Verney said. ''They would have removed the acting
chairman in order to remove me so they can stack the committee with
their people so they could assure only Buchanan-committed delegates
get seated at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had to face fairness in how people were credentialed
it wouldn't go their way in all likelihood,'' added Verney, who now
holds no leadership post in the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who runs her brother's campaign, confirmed that
his supporters were set to force a national meeting. But she said
it was Verney who was not dealing fairly with Buchanan supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said we felt the credentials committee has to be fair and
objective,'' she said. ''Russ Verney was basically designating
himself as leader of the anti-Buchanan movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said he is not supporting any candidate, though he
predicted that the power play by Buchanan would benefit John
Hagelin, who is challenging Buchanan for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only a few disgruntled former Perotistas on board that
are unhappy about Pat Buchanan,'' she said. ''For them to control a
critical committee like credentials isn't fair.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Padres 4, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- David Segui's two-out RBI single in the
10th inning lifted the Texas Rangers to a 5-4 victory over the San
Diego Padres on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers loaded the bases with none out in the 10th.
Pinch-hitter Frank Catalanotto led off with a double off Matt
Whiteside (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   After Luis Alicea walked, San Diego shortstop Kevin Nicholson
dropped a throw from second baseman Bret Boone for an error on an
attempted forceout at second on Rusty Greer's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got two outs when Nicholson threw to the plate to
force out Catalanotto on Scarborough Green's grounder, and Ivan
Rodriguez popped to second.
</P>
<P>
   But Segui's single to right drove in Alicea for the Rangers'
first extra-inning win in five tries this season.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davis (3-1) pitched a perfect 10th for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez gave the Rangers an early lead with a first-inning
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Texas loaded the bases against Woody Williams on Alicea's
single, a walk to Greer, and Rafael Palmeiro's single.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez just missed a homer on the first pitch, hitting a
drive a few feet to the right of the right-field foul pole. He then
hit Williams' 0-1 pitch 442 feet into the left-field seats for his
second career grand slam and 26th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing Rodriguez's homer, Williams gave up only three
more hits, retiring 11 straight from the third through the sixth
innings. Williams allowed four runs and six hits over 7 1-3
innings, struck out four and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko got San Diego's first hit with a single leading off
the fourth, and Boone's two-run homer one out later cut Texas' lead
to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's RBI single in the seventh off reliever Jeff Zimmerman
made it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego tied it at 4 in the eighth as Tim Crabtree hit Wiki
Gonzalez with a pitch, walked Dave Magadan and gave up Nicholson's
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Matt Perisho allowed two runs and three hits in 5
1-3 innings. He struck out four and walked four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rodriguez's homer was the longest of the season at The
Ballpark in Arlington. He will compete in the Home Run Derby on
Monday at the All-Star workout in Atlanta. ... Before the game the
Padres optioned right-hander Will Cunnane to Triple-A Las Vegas.
... Boone has 61 RBIs, setting the club record for second basemen.
Roberto Alomar had 60 in 1990. ... Catalanotto is 6-for-14 as a
pinch-hitter this season.

<HEADLINE> Julius Erving's Son Found Dead  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- After weeks of searching and a nationwide
plea for clues, investigators found the body of the missing son of
basketball star Julius ''Dr. J'' Erving less than a mile from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy Friday confirmed 19-year-old Cory Erving's identity,
but the cause of death will not be determined for a few weeks,
Sheriff Don Eslinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that no foul play was suspected and that
Erving, who was known to drive fast, may have died in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Erving family members said they were grateful to know what
happened to the teen-ager, who had been missing for 40 days before
searchers with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office found his car
and body late Thursday at the bottom of a murky retention pond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are thankful to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office for
bringing Cory back to us. We now have resolution. Getting closure
was very important to the family in coping with our loss,'' Julius
Erving said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Divers had searched 36 bodies of water in central Florida during
the investigation. Searchers even flew over the 8-foot-deep
retention pond June 20 but saw nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Erving's car was found 20 yards from shore, less than a mile
from the Erving family's home in a gated community near Orlando.
The windows were up and Erving's seat belt was not fastened.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said that while Erving had on the same clothes he
was wearing the day he disappeared six weeks ago, investigators are
not sure how long the car was in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests, which usually take weeks, could determine
whether he was on drugs at the time of his death. Erving had had a
history of drug and alcohol abuse and run-ins with the law, and
investigators had raised the possibility during the search that he
had gone off on a crack binge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the news they wanted. They were hoping to find him
alive,'' said Pat Williams, senior vice president of the NBA's
Orlando Magic and a spokesman for the Ervings. ''The unknown was
what was hardest for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Erving disappeared May 28 after going out to buy bread for a
Memorial Day family cookout. When Julius Erving went public with
his son's disappearance on June 13, all indications pointed to
something bad.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Erving had recently gotten into a fight with a person who
broke the window of his car with a brick. A witness told
investigators that Cory had tried to buy a gun and get even.
</P>
<P>
   And Julius Erving said that one of Cory's friends claimed Cory
had used marijuana and ''roofies'' -- the illegal sedative Rohypnol
-- the night before he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 reward was offered for his safe return. But there was
no sign of him or his black 1999 Volkswagen Passat until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving and his wife, Turquoise, have three other adult
children. Erving, a Hall of Famer who revolutionized basketball
with his high-flying slam dunks for the Philadelphia 76ers, moved
with his family to Florida three years ago and is now executive
vice president of the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have learned a lot from this tragedy and we will be a
stronger family as a result,'' Erving said in his statement. ''The
Erving family will go forward from here. We have no other choice.''

<HEADLINE> Missile Test Gets Under Way  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's rocket scientists lit the fuse
on a $100 million missile defense test early Saturday. If
successful, the test could move the United States a step closer to
building a nationwide anti-missile shield. Congress says it is
urgently needed; critics decry it as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   After fixing a last-minute technical glitch that delayed the
start of the test by about two hours, a modified Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead atop its
third stage rocket blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif., at 12:19 a.m. EDT, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig
Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket headed toward the central Pacific. Within 20 minutes
of liftoff, an interceptor missile carrying a warhead-blasting
''kill vehicle'' was to launch from Kwajalein Atoll.
</P>
<P>
   If all went according to plan, the ''kill vehicle'' would use
target data gathered from ground-based radars to maneuver itself
into the path of the dummy warhead 140 miles above the Earth. The
goal was a 16,000-mile-an-hour collision that would disintegrate
the warhead by sheer force of impact.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the future of a multibillion dollar project that has
upset Russia and China and caused many of America's closest
European allies to wince at the prospect of a U.S.-only defense
against a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton says he will decide soon whether to
keep the project moving toward an anticipated deployment in 2005,
it will be up to his successor to make the final steps to build and
deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   This fast-approaching decision deadline for Clinton gave
Saturday's test extra urgency and public attention.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute technical glitch was a weak battery that
supplies power to a telemetry system which is needed to help
engineers on the ground record the exact point of impact between
the dummy warhead and the ''kill vehicle.'' The battery was
recharged and all other systems appeared normal prior to liftoff,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday's test worked, Defense Secretary William Cohen
seemed likely to recommend to Clinton that he take the first steps
in a phased building plan that would have the missile defense
system ready to use by December 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If it failed, Cohen could still recommend going ahead, but it
would appear more likely that he would favor another option such as
stretching out the timetable to allow for more flight tests. The
Pentagon's independent advisers have said the 2005 timetable may be
overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said in an interview Friday with National Public Radio,
before the missile test, that he did not expect to make his
recommendation for another three or four weeks and he could not
predict what it would be.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third in a series of missile intercept tests. The
first, last October, succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
Saturday's test was delayed more than two months to fix the problem
that plagued January's test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-nuclear activist group Greenpeace had hoped to halt
Saturday's test by placing a ship in the Pacific where a rocket
stage is expected to splash down about 110 miles offshore from
Vandenberg, said Steve Shallhorn, the group's campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace also set up camp outside Vandenberg's main gate.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House before Saturday's test, spokesman P.J.
Crowley said that even if the missile hit its target there would be
weeks of detailed analysis before the Pentagon could verify that
everything worked properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say a hit doesn't automatically suggest success, nor
does a failure automatically come with a miss tonight,'' Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest backers of missile defense in Congress, Sen.
Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said in an interview Friday that he believes
America can afford a missile defense even though defense dollars
are tight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, Congress will approve the funding for a
missile defense system'' so long as U.S. military leaders feel
confident it is technologically ready for deployment, Cochran said.
Cost estimates range from the Pentagon's $36 billion to the General
Accounting Office's $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Pentagon must deploy a national missile defense as
soon as it is technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Feasibility and cost are two of four factors Clinton has said he
will take into account in deciding whether to give the Pentagon the
go-ahead to begin preparing a construction site on Shemya Island in
the Aleutians. A high-powered ''X-band'' radar would be built there
to track a missile in flight toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other two factors Clinton will consider are the urgency of
the missile threat against the United States and the implications
of building a missile defense for U.S. foreign relations.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 155; Nasdaq Rises 63  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose strongly Friday as investors
welcomed the latest indication that the economy is slowing enough
to prevent more interest rate increases. The brightening mood
particularly helped banks and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.51 at 10,635.98.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also gained. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 62.63 to 4,023.20 and The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
22.23 at 1,478.90.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow gained 188.09 and the Nasdaq added 57.09.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks turned robust Friday after the Labor Department reported
that American businesses added fewer jobs than expected in June.
That's the clearest evidence yet that the Federal Reserve is
succeeding in its campaign to keep the economy from overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses added 206,000 jobs last month after cutting 165,000
positions in May, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate
fell to near a 30-year low of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's six interest rate increases in the past year
-- along with fears more may be necessary -- have cooled investor
enthusiasm for many stocks in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But with businesses adding fewer jobs, and demand for housing
and automobiles ebbing, Wall Street is feeling more comfortable
with the notion that the Fed is bringing the high flying U.S.
economy in for a soft landing. As a result, investors are betting
the central bank is just about done raising rates for the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a perception that the economy has slowed,'' Steven
Goldman, market strategist for Weeden &AMP; Co. of Greenwich, Conn.
''There is a feeling in the market that we are in the 8th inning of
interest rate rises,'' he said. ''And that's put stocks in a
pre-emptive mode.''
</P>
<P>
   An improving outlook for interest rates put a glow on financial
companies, which benefit from steady or declining interest rates.
Chase Manhattan rose $2.063 to $50.063, and BankAmerica rose $1.438
to $47.438.
</P>
<P>
   Big retailers gained with the expectation that steadier interest
rates will fuel consumer buying. That included Home Depot, up
$4.125 at $55.375, and Wal-Mart, up $4.688 to $61.875.
</P>
<P>
   The positive jobs report helped calm the market, which has been
jittery over the past week ahead of second-quarter earnings reports
due out beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report is one of the most important economic barometers
the Fed uses to determine the fate of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Other big gainers on the stock market Friday included Texas
Instruments, up $1.50 at $68.625; and Gateway, up $5.188 at
$61.938.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm bucked the upward trend, slipping $5.063 to $56.625 on
a report that Korean wireless operators would not use technology
from the telecom company. Yahoo also slipped $5.875 to $116.50
after Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown downgraded the stock, citing
concerns about revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche upgraded online recruiter Hotjobs.com, which jumped
$3.125 or 24 percent to $15.938.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 9-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.13
billion shares, up from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.90 to 528.22.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent,
Germany's DAX index was up 1.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Police: Two off-duty cops shoot and kill assailant  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo NYR112
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two off-duty police officers shot and killed a
man on Friday after he leaped from a nearby car and assaulted the
cops, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The male sergeant and female detective, whose names were not
immediately released, were in a pickup truck and were not in
uniform, Sgt. Brian Burke said. They were driving along the Grand
Central Parkway near Francis Lewis Boulevard around 6:30 p.m. when
a man jumped from the passenger side of a Kia two vehicles in front
of them, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   A livery car swerved to avoid the man and the sergeant slowed
his truck. Before the officers could get out of their vehicle, the
man ran toward them and assaulted the sergeant, Burke said. The
officer stepped on the gas pedal and his car lurched forward,
striking the livery cab.
</P>
<P>
   The man from the Kia then ran around the truck, opened the
passenger-side door, and tried to pull the female detective out as
he assaulted her, Burke said. Both officers then drew their weapons
and began firing, perhaps four shots, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The man died at the scene. Police were withholding his identity
until the man's family could be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Both officers were taken to Long Island Jewish Hospital, where
they were treated for physical and emotional trauma, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Saturday, police had yet to interview the officers
who were assaulted. The preliminary report was based on interviews
with the drivers of the Kia, the livery car, and two other
witnesses, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant is a 13-year veteran and the detective has been on
the force for 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Angels 12, Rockies 4  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Troy Glaus homered twice and rookie
Bengie Molina hit his first major league grand slam Friday night as
the Anaheim Angels handed the Colorado Rockies their fifth
consecutive loss, 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Given the previous night off by manager Mike Scioscia and mired
in a 1-for-29 slump, Glaus led off the second inning with a home
run off Kevin Jarvis. The Angels third baseman added his 25th
homer, a three-run shot, in the sixth off reliever Scott Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, just named to his first All-Star Game, tied Leon Wagner
for most homers ever by an Angels player heading into the break.
Wagner had 25 at the before the 1962 All-Star game, but just 12 the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Ramon Ortiz (3-2), hastily recalled from the minors a day
earlier when Tim Belcher went on the disabled list, allowed three
runs on five hits over eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Molina's home run was his 10th of the year and also his eighth
homer in his last 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   After Jarvis (2-4) walked Glaus to load the bases with one out
in the fifth, Molina drove Karl's first pitch of the game over the
left-field fence to give the Angels a 9-3 pad.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn went 3-for-4 and scored three runs and Garret Anderson
drove in two runs for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, sent to Triple-A Edmonton after giving up eight runs in 3
2-3 innings against Oakland on May 8, struck out four and walked
two in the win over the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's runs came on Todd Helton's RBI groundout in the first
and Neifi Perez's RBI triple in the fifth, followed by Tom
Goodwin's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies lost five in a row for the first time since last
Aug. 6-10, when they also went through a five-game slide.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis gave up eight runs on nine hits in 4 1-3 innings. He
walked three, hit a batter and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Belcher was suspended for three games and fined Friday for
arguing with an umpire during a June 27 game in Seattle. Belcher,
who is 2-2 with a 9.69 ERA and is currently on the disabled list,
is appealing the suspension. ... Glaus, Anderson and Vaughn are the
first Angels trio ever to have 20 or more homers by the All-Star
break. In addition to Glaus' club-high 25, Anderson has 24 and
Vaughn 22. The last major league team to have three players with 20
homers by the break were the Rockies in 1997, with Larry Walker at
25, Vinny Castilla 22 and Andres Galarraga 22. ... The Rockies
faced a pitcher named Ortiz for the second consecutive game when
they opened their series at Anaheim Stadium. They went against Russ
Ortiz on Thursday in San Francisco, a 6-5 Colorado loss, before
facing the Angels' Ortiz and losing again.

<HEADLINE> Most U.S. Kids At Work by 15  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Half of American 12-year-olds hold informal
jobs like baby-sitting or yard work, and by age 15, nearly
two-thirds are employed, according to a new Labor Department
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American work ethic starts at an early age,'' said Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman of the findings about young Americans'
working habits, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study found that a smaller percentage of the teen-age
population held jobs in the late 1990s than two decades earlier, in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   During the period from 1977 to 1979, an average 30 percent of
15- to 17-year-olds held jobs during the school year and 43 percent
did in the summer. By comparison, from 1996 to 1998, an average of
25 percent in the same age group held jobs during the school year
and 34 percent in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The BLS study combined findings from annual government surveys
of American households with in-depth interviews conducted in 1997
with 9,022 young men and women who were between the ages of 12 and
16 on Dec. 31, 1996. Findings were focused on kids 15 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 interviews revealed that about 50 percent of kids had
worked in informal jobs at age 12. By age 14, the share of kids
working rose to 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 43 percent of 14-year-olds were still doing only odd jobs
like neighbors' yardwork or baby-sitting, while 24 percent had
formal, ongoing employment, and some did both kinds of work.
</P>
<P>
   By age 15, 64 percent of teen-agers were working -- 38 percent in
formal, ongoing employment arrangements, and 31 percent in formal
jobs that included hours worked during the school year -- not just
over summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The average weekly hours worked by employed 15- to 17-year olds
were 23 in the summer and 17 during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   White teen-agers are more likely than minorities to work, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds -- 64 percent -- of white teen-agers did some
type of formal or informal work by age 14, compared with 43 percent
of black teen-agers and 41 percent of Hispanic teens. Similar
disparities persisted among 15-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Girls were just as likely to be working by age 15 as boys, but
were apt to be doing different types of jobs. Girls were more
likely to hold informal jobs, like baby-sitting, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Among 15-year-old boys, about 42 percent were formally employed
while only 34 percent of girls were.
</P>
<P>
   For 15-year-old boys, the top three formal jobs were cook,
janitor or cleaner, and miscellaneous food preparation. Girls of
the same age were most likely to be cashiers, waitresses or general
office clerks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. child labor laws allow 14- and 15-year-olds to do some
types of work -- such as agricultural, retail and food service jobs
-- but limit the hours they can work. Children under age 14 may not
be formally employed but can perform informal jobs, such as
baby-sitting, on an occasional basis.
</P>
<P>
   The BLS study looked separately at agricultural work, finding
that teen-agers between 14 and 17 made up 7 percent of U.S. farm
workers between 1993 and 1998. About half of the estimated 126,000
minor farm workers live and work away from their parents.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talks Won't Divide Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pushing a centrist agenda, the Democrats'
platform committee drafted a statement of principles calling for
open trade, teacher certification and continued support for the
death penalty despite objections from liberal, education and labor
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   The policy positions dovetail with the agenda of Vice President
Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate who also supports
capital punishment despite growing debate nationwide about its
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Friday, the committee added an amendment to the death
penalty plank in the party platform, calling for DNA evidence to be
used when appropriate and for efforts to ensure defendants
effective legal counsel, which is in line with Gore's view.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some believe serious consideration ought to be given to
repealing the death penalty,'' said Gerald Shea, assistant to the
president for government affairs of the AFL-CIO, citing differences
of opinion on the committee. ''I think the party is committed to
being tough on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party spent the past decade trying to shake a
soft-on-crime image that Republicans promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Gore's Republican opponent, has come
under fire for heading a state with the nation's highest number of
executions: more than 130 since Bush took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who oversees the draft committee,
said he believes Democrats will support the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are differences in the party about the death penalty,''
he said. ''But the vice president and I support it in certain
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft committee will submit the document to the platform
committee on July 29 in Cleveland. Democrats will weigh final
approval during their national convention, Aug. 14-17, in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it's a platform the Vice President Gore can run on,
and it's a platform he can win on,'' said Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically:
</P>
<P>
   --On trade, the proposed policy does not address the issue of
favored trade status for China, which has been a source of
contention within the party and among big labor. But it encourages
the need to ''aggressively open new markets in which to sell our
goods -- at home and abroad.'' Major industrial unions have opposed
the context and tone of such language.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats included a pledge to educate American workers so that
they can compete for jobs in a global economy. The platform also
vows to protect human rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the kind of document we would write,'' said the Shea
of the AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Gore. ''But in the context of it
being an outside group's document, we believe our issues were
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   --On education, the draft calls for federally required teacher
certification and a ''rigorous test'' for all new teachers despite
opposition from some teachers organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers should be answerable for what goes on in the
classroom,'' the draft states. ''Bad teachers who are out there
should not be allowed to sully the reputation of the teaching
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, said teachers need to be treated fairly and ensured of
due process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not shying away from accountability,'' she said. ''What
we're trying to do is to make sure that the field we are playing on
is level and that we have the tools to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also included language requiring schools that fail
to improve to be shutdown or placed under new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Teasley, director of government relations for
National Education Association, offered an amendment to ensure that
schools and teachers are rewarded for making positive differences
in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Democrats reaffirmed their commitment to abortion
rights. But Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, a co-chair of
the platform committee, said the party should work to reduce the
numbers of abortion in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a debate within our party,'' she said. ''We could go
in the back room and hide it. But we're putting it out on the
table, just like trade.''

Pentagon Says Missile Test Fails
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. missile interceptor launched in a burst of flame
Saturday from a Pacific island missed its intended target -- a dummy warhead
gliding through space, the Pentagon said. The failure raised the possibility of
a substantial delay in the Pentagon's timetable of having a national
anti-missile defense system ready for use by the end of 2005. The next attempted
intercept is scheduled for this fall, but depending on the severity of the
problem with Saturday's test, that could be pushed back a number of months.

south of Tokyo early Saturday before heading northeast to skirt the Pacific
coast of Japan's main island of Honshu. The festival hall of a shrine and three
homes were demolished by landslides overnight on Kozushima, where 788 residents
had been evacuated, said local official Chizuru Ishida. There were no injuries.

Montenegrin government. The other deputies in the 78-member legislature were not

<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Four gas cans and a homemade torch were recovered from
what had been the dining room of the Branch Davidian complex after fires
consumed it in 1993, Texas Rangers testified Friday. Bobby Grubbs, one of the
Rangers who helped gather evidence including the fuel cans after the deadly
fire, testified that Clive Doyle, one of nine people who escaped, told him the
blaze was started with Coleman fuel that was distributed throughout the
compound. When asked if he knew who started it, Doyle refused to answer the
question, Grubbs testified.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Eager young hands grabbed thick volumes of ''Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire'' at midnight Friday, the moment that bookstores around
Britain began selling the boy wizard's fourth magical adventure -- a massive hit
even before its publication. As Harry's latest exploits burst upon a waiting
world in the middle of the night, it was hard to tell who was more excited --
the book industry or the throngs of youngsters whose genuine eagerness to read
it created a marketer's dream.

   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- David Segui's two-out RBI single in the 10th inning
lifted the Texas Rangers to a 5-4 victory over the San Diego Padres on Friday
night. The Rangers loaded the bases with none out in the 10th. Pinch-hitter
Frank Catalanotto led off with a double off Matt Whiteside (2-3). After Luis
Alicea walked, San Diego shortstop Kevin Nicholson dropped a throw from second
baseman Bret Boone for an error on an attempted forceout at second on Rusty
Greer's grounder. Segui's single to right drove in Alicea for the Rangers' first
extra-inning win in five tries this season.

<HEADLINE> Accused Army General To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two-star general accused of sexually
harassing the Army's highest-ranking woman has asked to retire, a
move that appears to close a case that drew widespread attention.
</P>
<P>
   The case had already cost Maj. Gen. Larry Smith an appointment
to be the Army's deputy inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was given a written reprimand for conduct unbecoming an
officer and for sexually harassing an officer. He has submitted his
request to retire Sept. 1, Army spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said.
Officials said it was likely the request would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of harassment were substantiated in an inspector
general's report released Friday, although the general denied any
wrongdoing in a brief statement issued by the Army on his behalf,
his first public comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, for the good of my family and the Army, we have
elected to put it behind us and move on with our lives,'' he said,
making no explicit mention of the alleged offense nor his intention
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   His accuser, Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, said: ''I am satisfied
with the Army's action in this case. As far as I am concerned, this
matter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's announcement marked the first time it publicly
acknowledged that Kennedy made an accusation and that Smith was the
accused officer. Kennedy, a three-star general, outranked Smith. In
May, officials privately acknowledged that Army inspector general
Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman had substantiated Kennedy's allegation,
but no details were offered.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Army
released a sanitized copy of the inspector general's report. It
said it had substantiated two allegations: that Smith ''improperly
displayed disrespect toward a commissioned officer ... by holding
her and kissing her against her will,'' and that he had
''improperly sexually harassed'' Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There were no witnesses to the incident, which was said to have
occurred in Kennedy's Pentagon office in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Smith and Kennedy were in ''total disagreement''
about what happened in her office that day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told investigators he had hugged Kennedy and possibly
given her a ''cheek kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied anything beyond that happened,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told investigators he grabbed her, held her against her
will and kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   Smith provided 52 character witnesses in his defense, seven of
whom were interviewed by the inspector general's office. Six others
who had served with Smith also were interviewed. None said they
knew of any prior misconduct by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general concluded Smith was a ''highly respected
officer and gentleman with an unblemished career.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it found that Kennedy's credibility was a decisive
factor. She had no motive for making a false allegation against
Smith, the report said, and the two generals were not in
competition for the same job.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., applauded the Army for its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope her example will empower and encourage more women to be
brave enough to come forward if they have been sexually harassed or
assaulted,'' Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is married, began his Army career in 1966 as a second
lieutenant and served three tours of duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the outcome, the Army said Smith had
been given an ''administrative memorandum of reprimand'' on
Wednesday by Gen. John Keane, the vice chief of staff who reviewed
the inspector general's finding.
</P>
<P>
   The Army saw no basis for a criminal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the Army announced that Smith was to become deputy
inspector general, a move that spurred Kennedy two months later to
tell superiors about the alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's job change was suspended in November and quietly
rescinded in May. Since November, he has worked as a special
assistant to the Army Materiel Command's commanding general.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement ceremony June 2 -- 31 years to the day after she
entered the Army -- Kennedy said the institution she grew up with
has made ''measured and steady'' progress toward fairer treatment
of female soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, more than ever, women are a powerful force'' in the
U.S. military, she said then.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said she had more than fulfilled the aspirations she
held when she was commissioned a second lieutenant on June 2, 1969
-- at a time when women served in a separate Women's Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've risen further than I ever dared to hope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had served since May 1997 as the Army's deputy chief of
staff for intelligence. With her departure, the Army has no
three-star female generals.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that since she entered the Army, thousands of
positions once held exclusively by men have been opened to women.
''The change has been measured and steady,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has left her Pentagon post, Kennedy's official
retirement date is Aug. 1. Her departure plans were set before her
sexual harassment case became public in March.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Campaign Not Getting Results  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has toured key battleground states
with a reminder of the nation's prosperity, and Democrats have
spent more than $11 million in pro-Gore advertising in recent
weeks. But so far there are few tangible rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bit of bad news for the vice president is from
Michigan, where a statewide presidential poll of 600 likely voters
showed Republican George W. Bush with 46 percent and Democrat Gore
with 34 percent. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader took 8 percent
and Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan had 3 percent. In May, Bush
and Gore were very close in a Michigan survey by the same pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Between those polls, the Democratic National Committee spent
more than $1 million on TV ads in Michigan to promote Gore. The
vice president launched the ''prosperity tour,'' announced a
retirement savings plan and began an offensive on Midwest gas
prices as part of a message makeover. Michigan is a top target for
both Bush and Gore in their search for state electoral votes and
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush's number remained unchanged. The only drop has been from
Gore, and those votes went to Buchanan or Ralph Nader,'' said Ed
Sarpolus, whose firm Epic-MRA conducted the poll for the Detroit
Free Press. ''Gore has a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky and New Jersey, two states that should be
competitive, polls taken in recent weeks have shown no signs of
movement in Gore's direction. Gore remained down by 14 points in
Kentucky and he and Bush were about even in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic activists predict the vice president's fortunes will
change after voters return from summer vacations and begin paying
more attention to the election campaigns. Yet even these allies
concede Nader could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ralph Nader is not going to win the election, but he can help
Gore lose it and George Bush win it,'' said Debbie Dingell, chair
of Gore's campaign in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   A recent California poll showed Nader votes coming at the vice
president's expense. Gore advisers are also worried about Nader in
Oregon and Washington, where some environmentalists question the
vice president's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, labor leaders -- a key part of the Democratic
base -- are upset with Gore and giving Nader a look.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters and the United Auto Workers have openly considered
backing Bush or Nader. The powerful AFL-CIO endorsed Gore, only to
be angered by his choice as new campaign chairman: free-trade
backer Bill Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor provides money and manpower critical to
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's allies say tensions will ease once the Senate votes this
month on a China trade bill supported by the vice president. In
addition, Dingell said Nader has yet to prove himself a credible
candidate and ''people supporting him have to think about how it
will affect their lives if George Bush wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican and a Bush ally,
said the survey highlights Gore's weakness. ''People don't want a
third Clinton-Gore term,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impeachment may still be a problem for Gore. One in
six Michigan respondents rated family values as a top issue, and
Bush had their support by a 3-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   In other battleground states, activists acknowledge the vice
president's problems but believe he's improving his position for
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania state Rep. T.J. Rooney, a Democrat from Bethlehem
and close Gore ally, says the campaign ''is beginning to turn the
corner. He's had a good month in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Gore now is that ''it's tough to get people's
attention now,'' said Cliff Zukin, chairman of the Rutgers
University public policy department in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there will be any fundamental change in the
dynamics of the presidential election until the conventions,''
Zukin said. ''It's hard to communicate when no one's listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is working to shore up his base by addressing union groups
and raising questions about the profits of oil and drug companies.
Next week, he picks up the endorsement of former rival Bill
Bradley, who ran to the left of Gore in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But all this happens at a time when people are more focused on
their summer vacations, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said New Jersey analyst Jim McQueeny, ''The two
leading candidates are lethargy and torpor.''

<HEADLINE> Prospect For Peace in Eritrea Grows  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   TESENEY, Eritrea (AP) -- Standing in what used to be his clothing
shop, Alaizor Nebruhtu says a U.N. peacekeeping force can't come
soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Alaizor, 55, fled Teseney twice when it became a pawn in the
two-year Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict. Since Ethiopia launched its
final offensive on May 12, Teseney has changed hands three times.
Last month, his shop was destroyed by an Ethiopian tank.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family are here, but I have no job. I will try to build it
up but I have no money, all my money was put into here,'' he said,
pointing to the rubble and charred clothing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the prospect of peace seemed a little closer when a
U.N. team arrived in the capital, Asmara, to lay the groundwork for
a peacekeeping mission along the disputed 620-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia says it will not withdraw from territory it occupies
until peacekeepers are deployed in a 15-mile buffer zone inside
Eritrea, as agreed to by both parties in a cessation of hostilities
agreement signed June 18 in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Ethiopians so near, Eritreans fear that fighting
could be sparked anytime and say they will not feel safe until the
buffer zone is secured.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission, which arrived after three days of meetings
with Ethiopian officials in Addis Ababa, will meet with the
Eritrean ministers of foreign affairs and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very happy the way the mission is progressing,'' said
Australian Maj. Gen. Timothy Ford, who is leading the mission. He
called discussions in Ethiopia ''positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will look for places for its headquarters and other
offices along the border before leaving Tuesday, said Simon Nhongo,
the U.N. resident coordinator in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Nhongo said the peacekeepers would arrive in the middle of
August at the earliest. Ford said he could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tempo of this has been much faster than expected,'' Nhongo
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Nhongo said it was still not clear which countries would
contribute to the force, which he estimated would number between
3,000 and 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once the peacekeepers are deployed in the buffer zone in
Eritrea, experts will demarcate the boundary over which an
estimated 100,000 people died. Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993, and the border was never formally drawn.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million Eritreans were uprooted in the last two
months of fighting. As they slowly trickle back to major towns
including Teseney, 140 miles west of Asmara, and Barentu, they say
everything has been looted.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 3.5 million people, who endured a 30-year
independence struggle and have prided themselves on their
self-reliance, are now forced to rely on relief food for at least
the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest nations,
spent millions of dollars on arms.
</P>
<P>
   The war has delivered Eritrea, Africa's youngest nation, an
economic body blow. With most 18 to 40-year-olds at the front, this
year's agricultural output with be minimal, the U.N.'s Nhongo said.
</P>
<P>
   The war-ravaged southwest is Eritrea's breadbasket and normally
accounts for 60 percent of the country's agricultural output. And
presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel said the annual rate of
economic growth fell from a prewar 7 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy,'' Yemane said. ''Emergencies of this kind are
not new, but the scale is extremely big.''

<HEADLINE> Kids Line Up for 'Harry Potter'  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Children eager to grab the first volumes of
''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' crowded bookstores at
midnight Friday, grabbing up volumes of the boy wizard's fourth
magical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Stores nationwide happily accommodated their wishes, with
parties and sleepovers. Web-based companies like Amazon.com and
Kozmo.com gave others the chance to get the books as fast, if not
faster, from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll just read it until I have to go to bed ... and
finish it when I can,'' said 12-year-old Jason Mellow as he waited
for the doors to open at Books of Wonder in Manhattan. ''Then I'll
probably read it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing second in line, he was beat out by Douglas Korvis, 53,
who showed up to hold a spot for his daughter Alexandra. She and
Jason both read the three previous Harry Potter volumes by
flashlight under the covers -- long past bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra snatched the latest edition as soon as the clock
struck. Holding it up and smiling for the TV cameras, she gleefully
handed over her dad's $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for being such a very good sport about this,'' shop
owner Peter Glassman told her. ''Enjoy the book and come tell us
how you like it!''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thorpe, 12, of Alaska, was vacationing in Arlington, Va.,
with his mother and said he had to be in the bookstore the moment
the latest installment went on sale. He waited two hours in line.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a four-hour time difference (from Alaska) -- so I get to
be the first person in school to read the new Harry Potter book,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story was no different in London, where Harry's latest
travails also went on sale at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love them,'' proclaimed 12-year-old Philadelphian Julia
Rainer as she savored her new book at Waterstone's bookstore in
Piccadilly Circus. ''It's almost as if you're in the book when you
read them.''
</P>
<P>
   She and scores of other kids waited in a line that ran from the
cash register through the store, out the door and down the block to
buy their 640 pages of excitement at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry. (The U.S. version, in a different type face, is 734
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Far from daunted by the extraordinary length, 11-year-old
Anthony Chapman was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's even better than the other ones, because you get
a lot to read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Harry's latest exploits burst upon a waiting world in the
middle of the night, it was hard to tell who was more excited -- the
book industry or the throngs of youngsters genuinely eager to read.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important and magical outcome of this story is the
love of reading that Harry Potter has rekindled among readers of
all ages, especially young children,'' said Barnes &AMP; Noble Vice
Chairman Steve Riggio, whose company promised same-day delivery of
books ordered by 11 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Waterstone's in Great Britain, some Barnes &AMP; Nobles in the
United States invited youngsters to bring sleeping bags and await
the witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the Glasgow Waterstone's, events manager Kim Hardie called
the response phenomenal, saying ''about 80 percent of my time in
the last fortnight (two weeks) has been spent dealing with Harry
Potter queries.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Amazon.co.uk Internet site promised customers their
pre-ordered copies would go in the mail Friday for delivery by
Saturday. Amazon.com employees at warehouses in Seattle stacked
books floor to ceiling preparing to ship a minimum of 250,000
copies the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site had tallied up more than 347,000 sales --
more than six times the existing prepublication record set in March
by John Grisham's latest novel, ''The Brethren.'' New York-based
Barnes &AMP; Noble said it already had 360,000 pre-orders and expected
to break records for first-day and first-week sales for any book in
the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' occupied the top spot on
both Amazon's and barnesandnoble.com's best seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   The first print run by the book's British and U.S. publishers
totaled 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The boy wizard has even won over some older fans.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Taylor, of Atlanta, was steering his son Malcolm out of
the store as the 9-year-old was already reading the book jacket.
Both were wearing bathrobes. Taylor said he had read all three
books.
</P>
<P>
   ''It teaches kids integrity and making good choices when they
are at a precarious age,'' the father said. ''They're great stories
that are wonderful page-turners. The characters are really
something kids can identify with. The stories talk about being
bullied and accomplishing something at great odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill and Eric Robbins, of Arlington, Va., are in their
''mid-twenties'' said they are addicted to Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great reading,'' said Jill Robbins. ''I think adults can
enjoy at as much as kids do.''
</P>
<P>
   Author J.K. Rowling was too busy last year writing this book to
do much publicity for ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,''
the third book in the series.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she's doing book signings on a promotional tour that
sets off on a Hogwarts Express train from ''Platform 9 3/4'' at
King's Cross station, where the boy wizard and his friends embark
each year on their way to adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Some bookstores broke the embargo set by U.S. publisher
Scholastic Inc. and began selling copies early.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schuppe, an independent bookstore owner in Stockton, Calif.,
said he had not signed an agreement with the publisher to make his
customers wait. By Friday morning, he had sold out of his 50
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, were waiting to celebrate the midnight launch.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people had reserved copies of the book at Borders
Books and Music in Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't do nutty stuff like that very often, but this is
maniacal,'' said Doug Weaver, a manager at Borders. ''It's amazing.
This is a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're hard to put down,'' agreed 11-year-old Rebecca Gant, a
Lawrence resident. ''I love a good story.''

<HEADLINE> Warplanes Found in Indonesian River  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The placid waters of the Brantas River
conceal an astonishing treasure-trove of aviation history -- a
squadron of Dutch warplanes scuttled by retreating allied troops
during the dark days of 1942.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious plan to recover the eight Fokker T.IVs and five
C.11s -- the only surviving examples of either type -- is a ''boyhood
dream come true'' for Lt. Cmdr. Joz Rozenburg of the Royal
Netherlands Naval Air Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rozenburg, who heads the project to salvage the squadron from
its watery grave, has been obsessed with the historic aircraft
since he first learned of their existence in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the only location in the world where we have any hope
of retrieving either type,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The T.IV was a twin-engine torpedo bomber of which only 33 were
built.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the C.11s were elegant biplanes that served as
fleet artillery spotters and were typically based aboard cruisers.
But they were removed from Dutch warships in 1941 because of fears
their fuel tanks could ignite the vessels if hit.
</P>
<P>
   That proved fatal for the Allies in the pivotal Battle of the
Java Sea, which sounded the death knell for Dutch rule in the East
Indies, today's Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of aerial reconnaissance, a hapless Allied task force
blundered into the Japanese invasion fleet, whose patrol aircraft
had shadowed it throughout. Caught unaware, the task force was
annihilated.
</P>
<P>
   Following that disaster, all Allied forces were instructed to
evacuate to Australia. Airplanes that did not have the range to
make the trip were ordered destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking demolition charges and frantic to escape, Dutch airman
at the Brantas base, 500 miles east of Jakarta, simply punched
holes in the Fokkers' floats and wings. The 13 aircraft sank into
the river intact, settling in upright positions on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   They might have remained there, forgotten, had Rozenburg not
taken an interest in their fate. He enlisted the Netherlands
Military Aviation Museum to sponsor a series of surveys of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   A scan of the riverbed revealed the aircraft in remarkably good
condition with silt from a newly built dam protecting their
aluminum skin.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers remember that before the dam was constructed they were
able to glimpse the ghostly warplanes -- their machine guns still
aimed at the sky -- whenever dry seasons caused water levels to
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, scavengers never disturbed the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Locals said there was a superstition that since the aircraft
sank under adverse circumstances, it was not auspicious to touch
them,'' Rozenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to recover two of the planes this summer were postponed
because Indonesian authorities disagreed about jurisdiction over
the historical artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   A new salvage expedition at the site is scheduled for next
spring, when the administrative snags are expected to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''This project will also benefit local inhabitants since it will
provide jobs for many of the villagers here,'' said Maslihan, a
local government official in Mojokerto, a town near the site.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, only one plane of each type will be brought to the
surface, Rozenburg says. These will be shipped to the Netherlands
for restoration and preservation before a decision is made on the
fate of the others.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Police Probe Kosovo Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a case that could have serious
repercussions throughout Kosovo, U.N. police are investigating a
shootout between a former Kosovo Liberation Army commander-turned
politician and a family allied with his political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj was taken to the U.S. military hospital at Camp
Bondsteel following the Friday shooting, which occurred in the
western village of Streoce. Haradinaj's condition was stable, NATO
spokesman Maj. Scott Slaten said.
</P>
<P>
   Haradinaj's political party, the Alliance for the Future of
Kosovo, said the former KLA commander and his relative, Daut
Haradinaj, were traveling by car when their vehicle was hit by a
rocket-propelled grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Daut Haradinaj is a sector commander of the Kosovo Protection
Force, which was organized as a civil emergency unit after the KLA
was officially disbanded last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Streoce, Sadik Musa claimed the Haradinajs and some of their
followers attacked his home about 1 a.m. with automatic weapons.
Musa told Associated Press Television New that he and his relatives
returned fire, wounding the two Haradinajs.
</P>
<P>
   Musa and others claimed the attack was launched because they
support Haradinaj's rivals in the Democratic League of Kosovo, led
by Ibrahim Rugova. Musa said Ramush Haradinaj abducted his brother
last year because he was fighting in a rival ethnic Albanian
militia led by Bujar Bukoshi, who is a member of Rugova's party.
</P>
<P>
   Musa spoke under the trees in front of his home, which was
pocked with bullet holes. Italian and U.N. police stood guard. Two
bullet-riddled cars were parked in the compound and bloodstains
were visible on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to win the election in Kosovo by force, by killing
his rivals,'' another man, Beslim Balaj, said of Haradinaj.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press telephoned Ramush Haradinaj's party for
comment on the allegations but was told no spokesman was available.
</P>
<P>
   The incident could drive up political tensions among Kosovo
Albanians in advance of local elections expected in October.
</P>
<P>
   The case also raises questions about NATO's control of the
Kosovo Protection Corps, which was supposed to be an unarmed,
civilian relief and humanitarian organization set up last year to
provide a role for former KLA fighters.
</P>
<P>
   When the protection corps was organized, NATO assured both the
Kosovo Serb community and international governments that its
officers would be placed under strict control and would not serve
as a paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj was a leading commander in the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla army during the 18-month conflict with the Serbs, which
prompted NATO military intervention last year.
</P>
<P>
   After the conflict ended and NATO-led peacekeepers replaced Serb
forces here, Haradinaj organized what is believed to be the
third-largest political party in the ethnic Albanian community.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Haradinaj scuffled with Russian peacekeepers, after they
stopped him at a checkpoint. He suffered a black eye when he was
briefly detained, after two weapons were found in his car without
proper paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said he had attempted to flee and that peacekeepers and
military police ''subdued him.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says Missile Test Fails  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. missile interceptor launched in a burst
of flame Saturday from a Pacific island missed its intended target
-- a dummy warhead gliding through space. Officials blamed a
technical failure of the booster rocket which was supposed to
release a warhead-busting device called a ''kill vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the kill vehicle did not detach from the booster, it
never activated the on-board sensors and other high-tech devices
that it would use to intercept the warhead, Air Force Lt. Gen.
Ronald Kadish said. Kadish is director of the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We failed to achieve an intercept,'' said Pentagon spokesman
Bryan Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   The test cost $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said the kill vehicle -- a small, maneuverable device that
destroys its target by ramming into it -- apparently did not
separate from the booster rocket because it did not receive a
necessary electronic signal. He said it might take days for
Pentagon scientists to understand why the internal booster signal
was not received.
</P>
<P>
   Radish said the booster, which was produced by Lockheed Martin
Missiles &AMP; Space, had been a reliable item and ''wasn't even on my
list'' of potential concerns. The booster had been used in four
previous tests without encountering a problem with releasing the
kill vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The failure raised the possibility of a substantial delay in the
Pentagon's timetable of having a national anti-missile defense
system ready for use by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third test of the intercept program with two of them
having failed.
</P>
<P>
   The next attempted intercept had been scheduled for this fall,
but that timetable might now be put back.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday's test had succeeded, it could have moved the United
States a step closer to building a national missile defense that
Congress says is urgently needed, but that critics decry as
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   After fixing a last-minute technical glitch that delayed the
start of the test by about two hours, a modified Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead atop its
third stage rocket blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif., at 12:19 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket headed toward the central Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one minutes later, at 12:40 a.m. EDT, an interceptor
missile carrying a warhead-blasting ''kill vehicle'' launched from
Kwajalein Atoll.
</P>
<P>
   The interceptor was supposed to have collided with the mock
warhead after about 10 minutes of flight over the Pacific, but
television monitors showed no flash indicating a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half hour passed before officials who monitored the
flight test from a basement office in the Pentagon reported that
the interceptor missile had missed its target.
</P>
<P>
   The ''kill vehicle'' was programmed to use target data gathered
from ground-based radars to maneuver itself into the path of the
dummy warhead 140 miles above the Earth. The goal was a
16,000-mile-an-hour collision that would disintegrate the warhead
by sheer force of impact.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the future of a multibillion dollar project that has
upset Russia and China and caused many of America's closest
European allies to wince at the prospect of a U.S.-only defense
against a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton says he will decide soon whether to
keep the project moving toward an anticipated deployment in 2005,
it will be up to his successor to make the final steps to build and
deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   This fast-approaching decision deadline for Clinton gave
Saturday's test extra urgency and public attention.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute technical glitch was a weak battery that
supplies power to a telemetry system which is needed to help
engineers on the ground record the exact point of impact between
the dummy warhead and the ''kill vehicle.'' The battery was
recharged and all other systems appeared normal prior to liftoff,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Saturday's test worked, Defense Secretary William Cohen had
been expected to recommend to Clinton that he take the first steps
in a phased building plan that would have the missile defense
system ready to use by December 2005.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third in a series of missile intercept tests. The
first, last October, succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
Saturday's test was delayed more than two months to fix the problem
that plagued January's test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-nuclear activist group Greenpeace had hoped to halt
Saturday's test by placing a ship in the Pacific where a rocket
stage is expected to splash down about 110 miles offshore from
Vandenberg, said Steve Shallhorn, the group's campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House before Saturday's test, spokesman P.J.
Crowley said: ''I would say a hit doesn't automatically suggest
success, nor does a failure automatically come with a miss
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest backers of missile defense in Congress, Sen.
Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said in an interview Friday that he believes
America can afford a missile defense even though defense dollars
are tight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, Congress will approve the funding for a
missile defense system'' so long as U.S. military leaders feel
confident it is technologically ready for deployment, Cochran said.
Cost estimates range from the Pentagon's $36 billion to the General
Accounting Office's $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Pentagon must deploy a national missile defense as
soon as it is technologically feasible.

<HEADLINE> 'Looping' Catching on in Schools  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORTHINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- Elementary school teachers are trying a
variation of the one-room schoolhouse by sticking with their
students through two or three grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the teaching method -- called looping -- provides a
stable learning environment in the critical years of development by
allowing students to keep the same instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers increasingly are trying looping as they become aware
of the benefits to students,'' said Sylvia Seidel, director of the
National Education Association's Teacher Education Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Schools nationwide, including some in Attleboro, Mass., Colorado
Springs, Colo., and Sacramento, Calif., have reported positive
looping results.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ohio districts, including Worthington and East Cleveland,
also are trying the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids need a lot of stability in the younger grades as they
develop mentally. Change is very disruptive,'' said Rich Bates,
principal at Worthington Park Elementary in this middle-class
Columbus suburb. ''This is a way to make sure kids have some
continuity in those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators say looping also brings parents into the
teacher-student relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really an extended partnership between the child, the
parents and the teachers to make sure the child gets a solid
education. It brings back an element I believe today's children are
missing -- family structure and stability -- because it involves the
parents,'' said Frederick Hampton, an associate professor of
education at Cleveland State University who studied the use of
looping in East Cleveland, a low-income Cleveland suburb.
</P>
<P>
   However, as with any teaching method, looping has some potential
drawbacks, educators say.
</P>
<P>
   An instructor's teaching style might not work with a given
student, a personality clash between a student and teacher might be
prolonged, and students might not be exposed to as many adult
viewpoints as they would be in a traditional class.
</P>
<P>
   But both supporters and critics say that because of those
drawbacks, parents always have the option of putting their children
in a traditional class.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups of teachers at Bates' school have used looping
for the past four years. When Iris Morris moves her class from
first grade to second grade, Kathy Schmidt takes over at first
grade.
</P>
<P>
   The two say they are able to use class time more productively in
the second year because they can jump right into teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''By eliminating the six weeks of get-to-know each other time,
there is more time for instruction,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers already know each child, as well as each child's
learning style, ability and competency. Likewise, students already
are comfortable with the teacher and know the teacher's teaching
style, expectations and rules.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jonathan Katz, 8, of Worthington, liked about having
Morris as a teacher for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really happy about it because I knew everybody in our
class and I knew her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he will start third grade in the fall with a new
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be weird, but I'll be fine. And I'll still see her
(Morris) around,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead in Japan Typhoon  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A typhoon that left at least 16 people dead in the
Philippines pummeled eastern Japan, leaving two dead, flooding
cities, snapping power lines and burying homes in landslides.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Mito, northeast of Tokyo, trudged through torrents
of muddy water Saturday that raced down streets and lapped
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   An 81-year-old man drowned after falling into a flooded canal,
police said, and a 30-year-old man was found floating after his car
veered off a wet road and plunged into an irrigation ditch.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, Typhoon Kirogi was heading northeast in
the Pacific Ocean, about 66 miles northeast of Sendai, 190 miles
northeast of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains from Kirogi, which was packing winds up to 76
mph, flooded at least 300 homes in the Tokyo metropolitan area,
according to the Tokyo Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The typhoon knocked out power lines in several parts of central
Japan, cutting electricity to 20,000 homes for as long as four
hours, said Soichi Takeguchi, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power
Co.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tokyo area, a 63-year-old woman and a 24-year-old
newspaper delivery man were injured after falling down in strong
winds.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 domestic flights were canceled and some train
services were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning the storm lashed the Izu island chain south
of Tokyo before barreling into Japan's main island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   The festival hall of a shrine and three homes were demolished by
landslides on the island of Kozushima, where 788 residents had been
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one person died in a strong earthquake that rocked
the island and damaged buildings and roads.
</P>
<P>
   As skies cleared Saturday, officials lifted the evacuation order
for residents on the island, about 93 miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes two weeks ago
when a volcano rumbled to life on Miyakejima Island near Kozushima,
setting off hundreds of tremors in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tropical storm in the South China Sea was upgraded
to a typhoon and headed for mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, floods and rain from typhoons bracketing the
region drove 400,000 people from their homes, officials said
Friday. At least 16 people were dead and 10 missing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns remained that the typhoon season could jeopardize a
July 21-23 summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations. The
meeting is to be held on Okinawa island.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau issued a sea and land warning
Saturday for another typhoon, Kai-tak, located about 160 miles
southwest of the southern tip of the island at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kai-tak was moving toward southern Taiwan at a speed of 3 mph,
the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The fringes of the typhoon have brought heavy rains and high
waves off the island's southern coast in the past two days. A man
was killed Friday when waves carried him away off southern
Kaohsiung, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities urged residents to evacuate several mountainous
areas in central Taiwan, which were struck hard by a 7.6-magnitude
earthquake last September.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says Missile Test Fails  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The missile interceptor the Pentagon is
developing as the key component of a national missile defense not
only missed its intended target over the Pacific Ocean early
Saturday, it didn't even try to hit it.
</P>
<P>
   In a new twist for the Pentagon's oft-criticized missile defense
program, the ''kill vehicle'' that was supposed to guide itself
into the path of a dummy warhead in space -- destroying it by the
force of impact -- never separated from the booster. So it never
activated its sensors to hunt for the approaching target.
</P>
<P>
   The interceptor passed harmlessly by the target, and few of the
critical technologies of missile defense were put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million test was the third to attempt an intercept, and
the second to fail. The first failure, in January, was blamed on
moisture inside the ''kill vehicle'' that prevented it from using
heat-seeking devices to ''see'' its target.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not intercept the warhead that we expected to have
tonight. We're disappointed with that,'' said Air Force Lt. Gen.
Ronald Kadish, director of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said he had never had a concern about the booster
properly releasing the ''kill vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't even on my list'' of potential problems, he said,
adding that it had been used successfully on earlier tests. He said
the kill vehicle did not separate from the booster because it did
not receive the necessary electronic signal. It may take days for
officials to understand why the signal was not received, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At an early morning news conference in the Pentagon, Kadish was
asked what he learned from the failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it tells me is we have more engineering work to do,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cordesman, a defense strategist at the private Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview after
Saturday's test that, logically, the failure should mean a delay in
the Pentagon's fast-track timetable for building a national missile
defense. The target date is December 2005, but even the Pentagon's
own advisers have acknowledged that this may be overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to decide by this fall whether to
approve sticking to that timetable. The president will base his
decision in part on a recommendation from Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who told National Public Radio on Friday that he expected to
make his recommendation in three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Saturday whether the Pentagon still believed
the missile defense project was ready to move toward deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Logically, you do regroup after something like this and you
don't go forward with the existing schedule,'' Cordesman said,
although he added that pressure from Congress might compel the
Pentagon to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The next attempted intercept is scheduled for this fall, but
that schedule might now be put back. More than a dozen additional
flight tests are scheduled before 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday's test had succeeded, it could have moved the United
States a step closer to building a national missile defense shield
that Congress says is urgently needed, but that critics decry as
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   After technicians fixed a last-minute glitch that delayed the
start of the test by about two hours, a modified Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead atop its
second-stage rocket blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif., at 12:19 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket headed toward the central Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one minutes later, at 12:40 a.m. EDT, an interceptor
missile carrying the ''kill vehicle'' launched from Kwajalein
Atoll.
</P>
<P>
   The ''kill vehicle'' was supposed to separate from the
second-stage rocket booster exactly 2 minutes and 37 seconds into
flight, then maneuver itself into the path of the mock warhead.
Television monitors showed no flash indicating a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half-hour passed before officials who monitored the
flight test from a basement office in the Pentagon reported that
the interceptor missile had missed its target.

from ground-based radars to maneuver itself into the path of the
dummy warhead 140 miles above the Earth. The goal was a
16,000-mile-an-hour collision that would disintegrate the warhead

<HEADLINE> A Protein Said To Boost AIDS Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Adding a cancer-fighting substance appears to
boost the effectiveness of AIDS drug cocktails, government
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope interleukin 2 will translate into better
survival rates for AIDS patients. The treatment is still
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in next week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, an AIDS theme issue published to coincide with
the 13th International AIDS Conference, which begins Sunday in
Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Though potent combinations of AIDS drugs in the past decade have
made AIDS more manageable by subduing the virus, they are not a
cure. Worried about drug-resistant virus strains, researchers tried
adding interleukin-2 to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Interleukin 2 is a protein that regulates the body's immune
response. A synthetic version is produced by Chiron Corp. and is
federally approved for the treatment of melanoma and kidney cancer,
but not AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The study -- funded by Chiron and led by Dr. Richard T. Davey Jr.
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases --
involved 78 patients on various combinations of antiviral AIDS
drugs. About half also got twice-daily injections of interleukin-2
periodically during the two-year study, which ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus was suppressed in almost twice as many of the
interleukin patients, 67 percent versus 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also measured levels of CD4 T cells,
disease-fighting white blood cells attacked by the AIDS virus.
After one year, CD4 levels among the interleukin group climbed an
average of 112 percent, compared with 18 percent for the others.
The higher the dose, the better the response.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not look at survival rates; two larger
interleukin studies are examining that.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, two Johns Hopkins University doctors said that
additional research is needed to determine if the potential
benefits of interleukin outweigh the side effects, which may
include fever, fatigue and muscle pains.
</P>
<P>
   JAMA's cover usually depicts a renowned work of art, but this
issue's is blank, to symbolize ''how much there is yet to do and
how much more urgent this task is than ever before,'' wrote Dr. M.
Therese Southgate, JAMA's cover section editor.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue also includes an Italian study showing that
drug combinations that have helped stabilize AIDS in adults also
improve survival in children; reports suggesting that while the
danger of contracting AIDS through U.S. blood donations is
extremely low, high-cost testing of single units rather than pooled
blood may be needed to further reduce the risk; and a 1994-98
survey of 3,492 young gay or bisexual men in seven large U.S.
cities showing that nearly 10 percent of 22-year-olds were
HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   The issue follows recent disturbing news about a near-tripling
of HIV infections among gay and bisexual men in San Francisco and a
U.N. report saying that AIDS is expected to wipe out half the
teen-agers in some African nations.
</P>
<P>
   The grim picture is told in a devastating account in the journal
from an anguished caregiver in Kenya detailing the final days of
his 17-year-old AIDS patient, once ''a beautiful young man with
stunning eyes,'' now ravaged by intestinal worms, hideous
infections and agonizing pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''His tear ducts have dried up, his hair fallen out, his bones
are brittle. He has no muscle or fat,'' writes Michael K.
Elmore-Meegan. ''His fingernails and toenails have fallen out. His
skin is blistered and scaly, and scabs cannot form. He can barely
move, has no tears to show his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I whisper to him, and kiss him. He slowly inhales, half closes
his eyes,'' then relaxes. ''He is gone,'' Elmore-Meegan writes. ''I
held him in my arms and wept.''

<HEADLINE> William McGowan, founder of Irish group, dead at 76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - William John McGowan, a founder of a fraternal
organization of Irish-American police officers in New York, died of
heart failure July 1 in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department Emerald Society is the
oldest of its kind and now has 10,000 active members, said Joseph
J. Keenan Jr., its current president.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous Irish societies, which were centered on religion
or ancestor's county of origin, the Emerald Societies that began to
take root in the 1950s were for those of Irish descent in a
particular occupation. Among the other Emerald Societies are those
for sanitation workers, firefighters and telephone workers.
</P>
<P>
   The founding of New York's police Emerald Society in 1953 was
indicative of how much the Irish had assimilated into American
society and of the increasing diversity of the police department.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan was born in Brooklyn, and at 17, he joined the Navy,
where he became a chief petty officer.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the New York police force in 1947, and retired in 1972
as a detective captain. He later opened Danny Boy's Pub, in
Manhattan, which he sold in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Levy to join in on calls to remind summer school kids to get to class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The families of students who missed the first
days of summer school could get a call from Schools Chancellor
Harold Levy this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is spearheading a weekend telephone blitz to remind parents
to send their kids to class next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education is pulling out all the stops to boost
attendance for its $150 million, 319,000-student summer program,
which was marred by high-absenteeism and scattered glitches in
staffing and school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was set to join 25 attendance teachers in making calls
Sunday from a special command center at the board's Brooklyn
headquarters. Over 1,800 calls were made Thursday and the teachers
worked the phones for more than four hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that many parents might have kept their
children home last week because of the July 4 holiday, ''all
reasons for keeping your child home are over now,'' said board
spokeswoman Pam McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts reported absentee rates of 30 to 40
percent on Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Muggles go wild for boy wizard's fourth adventure  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO IBARGUEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Children and adults, unwilling to wait until
morning, swamped bookstores across America into the wee hours
Saturday, eager to read the latest exploits of Harry Potter, the
boy wizard.
</P>
<P>
   The midnight Friday sale of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' rolled through the country at stores offering parties,
refreshments and, in some cases, sleepovers. Web-based companies
like Amazon.com and Kozmo.com gave others the chance to get the
books as fast, if not faster, from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you feel like you're entering Willie Wonka's factory?''
asked Peter Glassman, owner of Books of Wonder in Manhattan, as he
opened the store to buyers minutes before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Dave Lambert, 28, and Kathleen Soule, 36, of Hoboken,
N.J., said they were fans of the first three Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   ''Early on she created characters you can relate to,'' Lambert
said of author J.K. Rowling. Soule agreed, adding that the books
''don't talk down to children ... and they don't talk down to
adults either.''
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Los Angeles, more than 100 children showed up at a
Border's store in Santa Clarita, Calif., two hours before midnight
for a party that included a trivia contest, scavenger hunt and
readings.
</P>
<P>
   Kids got a lightning bolt stamp on their foreheads on the way
in, a nod to the unusual scar of the books' title character. A few
of the kids showed up costumed as Harry Potter complete with thick,
round glasses and tall magicians' hats.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the parents at the Santa Clarita event, Debbie
Jelen, mother of 7-year-old Kali, was willing to give herself up to
the hype. ''I'm excited that it's helping her to learn to read
books,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get started tonight,'' said Tricia Pace, mother
of Tovia Gehl, 8, in Seattle. ''My mother has read them and my
brother has read them - and he's 50 and a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   At Quail Ridge Books in Raleigh, N.C., Margo Arrowsmith, 52,
said she was buying the book for herself. ''The writing just keeps
getting better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Barnes &AMP; Noble in Towson, Md., a suburb of Baltimore, the
book was sold only to customers who had reserved copies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in line for nothing,'' said a disappointed Jennifer
Moulton, who was with her daughter, Brianna, 13. ''We started to
order online at Amazon, but we thought this would be more
convenient, which turned out not to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual scene left several bookstore workers in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable,'' said Kim Fetty, manager of Taylor Books
in Charleston, W. Va., of the late night crowd there. ''I've never
seen anything like it. It's not just the kids. Adults are crazy
about this book, too. Harry is a classic underdog and most everyone
likes to see the underdog win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Smith, manager of the largest Barnes &AMP; Noble in Iowa, said
she had underestimated the crowd at the West Des Moines store.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew there would be a big turnout, I just didn't know how
big. I'm figuring 700 to 800 people. I gave out at least 500
tickets for the line,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The store had 1,200 books, which she expected would be sold out
by midday Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At another Barnes &AMP; Noble store in Chicago, Louren Mack, 11,
held the 734-page book and said: ''It will last me about a week.
They are really hard to put down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Rumpus book store in Minneapolis, Minn., was pummeled
by a heavy storm that knocked out power fifteen minutes into the
sale, forcing workers to manually run credit card slips.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the perfect Harry Potter night,'' said Grace Vermeer, 12,
standing in the rain outside the store. She said she had planned a
sleepover party with five friends.
</P>
<P>
   Hordes of fans also swamped stores in London, where Harry's
latest travails went on sale at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of kids waited outside a Waterstone's bookstore in
Piccadilly Circus to buy their 640 pages of excitement at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (The U.S. version is longer
because it has a different type face.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Waterstone's in Great Britain, some stores in the United
States invited youngsters to bring sleeping bags and await the
witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapter 11 store in an Atlanta mall hosted about 150 people
to a pajama party.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lathbury, of Atlanta, said he, like his son Jason, 6,
enjoys the books.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got caught up in it. I'm having the same problem
everybody else is. He (Jason) goes to bed and I keep reading,''
Lathbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com employees at warehouses in Seattle stacked books
floor to ceiling preparing to ship a minimum of 250,000 copies the
first day.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site had tallied up more than 347,000 sales -
more than six times the existing prepublication record set in March
by John Grisham's latest novel, ''The Brethren.'' New York-based
Barnes &AMP; Noble said it already had 360,000 pre-orders and expected
to break records for first-day and first-week sales for any book in
the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' occupied the top spot on
both Amazon's and barnesandnoble.com's best seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   The first print run by the book's British and U.S. publishers
totaled 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Some bookstores broke the embargo set by U.S. publisher
Scholastic Inc. and began selling copies early.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schuppe, an independent bookstore owner in Stockton, Calif.,
said he had not signed an agreement with the publisher to make his
customers wait. By Friday morning, he had sold out of his 50
copies.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the excitement was the story itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's everything you dreamed about when you were young,'' said
Masaka Fukouka, 29, outside a Manhattan Barnes &AMP; Noble. ''The
candystores, learning to fly, it's like going back to your old
dream.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Gore Blamed For Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson blamed high
fuel prices on the Clinton-Gore administration Saturday, saying
consumers are being ''Gored'' at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ''How have we stumbled to this point?'' Thompson said in the
weekly GOP radio address, taped Friday. ''It's quite simple.
President Clinton and Al Gore have completely failed to develop an
energy policy to lead our nation into the new century, and each and
every one of us is paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the Clinton-Gore administration's failure to
decrease the country's dependence on foreign oil and open up
exploration of domestic oil sources have led to higher fuel prices
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring prices have been particularly severe in the
Milwaukee and Chicago area, where prices peaked at more than $2 a
gallon in June.
</P>
<P>
   The high fuel prices have become a favorite political issue in
the presidential campaign. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush has started quoting a passage from Gore's 1992 book
''Earth in the Balance'' in which the vice president states his
support for higher fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a longtime Bush supporter, struck a similar theme,
claiming Gore's support of higher fuel taxes means he supports
higher fuel bills that will lead to more expensive summer vacations
and higher air conditioning costs.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the only answer to the rising fuel prices is to
decrease the country's dependency on foreign oil and open up
exploration of domestic oil sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll tell you one thing Al Gore did help invent: Higher gas
prices,'' said Thompson, who Bush picked to chair the GOP
convention platform committee and has been mentioned as a possible
running mate. ''Well, it won't work. The American people realize
that gas prices won't drop to an acceptable level until we develop
a strong energy policy that allows us to deal with foreign nations
while taking advantage of our resources at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has countered by accusing the Republican-led Congress of
sitting on legislation that would improve energy efficiency and
conservation. But he has saved his strongest attacks for the oil
companies, which he says have been earning huge profits and may be
guilty of price gouging.

<HEADLINE> Environmental concerns worry neighbors of casino tunnel project  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - In the Penrose Canal, the orange tint
is noticeable. It is visible on the water-line of boats, the sides
of bulkheads and the boulders that line the banks of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   To neighbors of the $330 million Atlantic City-Brigantine
Connector, the discoloration is a subtle indication of something
amiss in the giant road-and-tunnel construction project being built
next to the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Other indications aren't so subtle, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Williams, 67, has begun suffering from eye infections and
sinus problems since construction began in earnest on the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the dust, and whatnot,'' he said Friday. ''And
I've had neighbors who wheeze, who have asthmatic reactions more
since the last year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and others who live in the shadow of the construction
cranes believe contaminated soil at the site is being disturbed and
carried into the Canal and surrounding neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on complaints, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
has ordered the contractors on the tunnel to start collecting
weekly water samples to make sure the project does not violate
federal Clean Water Act statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenic, lead and benzene that were already present in the soil
beneath Horace J. Bryant Jr. Drive are now migrating from the site,
tunnel critics contend.
</P>
<P>
   Some contamination is contained in the five million gallons of
water that are pumped daily from the excavation site into Penrose
Canal, according a lawyer representing about 50 residents of the
West Side neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have reported skin lesions, skin rashes and
respiratory problems that may be related to the contamination,
according to Cherry Hill lawyer Salvatore Zerbo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't stand the idea of this environmental disaster
occurring under the eyes of the DEP and the EPA, under the guise of
people doing it for a buck, without care about its impact on the
neighborhood,'' Zerbo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're poisoning the fish, they're poisoning the mollusks,
they're poisoning the water, and they're doing it at the rate of
five million gallons a day. The fox is guarding the henhouse
here,'' Zerbo said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials acknowledge the presence of the contamination
but say a work plan to keep it on the site is succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, meanwhile, is probing allegations that construction
activities are violating the Clean Water Act. Last month, the EPA
issued a 40-page report citing 17 ''potential non-compliance
items'' based on a surprise inspection in March.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA gave Yonkers Contracting Co. one month to correct the
problems, which may include the discharges into Penrose Canal. The
banks of the canal have shown orange tinting, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has not said whether the contractor violated the Clean
Water Act, however. That is still under investigation, EPA
spokesman Richard Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a mode where we're investigating this, and we're
asking for additional information from the contractor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Berg, a site remediation official for the state
Department of Environmental Protection, said Friday the
contaminants at the site are within accepted levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not have high concentrations of soil contaminants. We do
not have unusual contaminants or particularly toxic contaminants
along the pathway of this project. And it's not unusual, in an
urban setting like Atlantic City, to encounter the types of things
they've encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going smoothly for us, from our vantage point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerbo and resident Pearl Running Deer, 41, of Michigan Avenue,
say it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Zerbo said it doesn't make sense to pump water from the
excavation into the canal without first testing it for contaminants
already known to be in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not prove that any of the alleged health
problems could be linked to the contamination or to the tunnel
construction, but said the contamination was being downplayed by
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''My prediction: You're going to see people in moon suits there
soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental concerns aren't new for the 2.2-mile Atlantic
City-Brigantine Connector, which, when completed, will link the
Atlantic City Expressway with the marina district and Brigantine.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the state found that contractors had failed to
perform daily air monitoring to measure for dust blowing from the
site. The South Jersey Transportation Authority, which will own the
tunnel when it is completed, agreed to pay $225,000 for violating
construction permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the neighbors are complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than being scared of the whole thing, we haven't had any
problems,'' said Ken Wilburn, Jr., 33, who lives across the street
from the excavation on Ohio Avenue. ''I haven't seen or felt
anything outside of the tremors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Einhorn, 43, whose East Riverside Drive home is located on
the canal, said she noticed nothing unusual in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see lots of fish and ducks and geese and things swimming
around in there. I don't see any problem,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Whitesbog: The birthplace of the blueberry  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITESBOG, N.J. (AP) - You can thank Elizabeth White for your
blueberry pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   And your blueberry pie, and scones and muffins and jam.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, Elizabeth, the daughter of a farmer, figured
there had to be a way to cultivate the tiny huckleberries that grew
wild in the sandy soil of the Pinelands.
</P>
<P>
   From their uncertain beginning on the White's farm in the middle
of Burlington County, blueberries have grown into a multimillion
dollar, worldwide crop.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth was the oldest of four daughters of Joseph and Mary
White. When she was 22, she began working on the family cranberry
farm, handing out tickets to workers in exchange for the boxes of
berries they harvested in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   She took a liking to farm work and tried to think of a way to
improve the business by extending the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers in the area had tried to devise a way to cultivate
wild huckleberries, without success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to go around sampling these fruits and one would be
too sour and one would be too flat,'' White said in a tape-recorded
interview in 1953, the year before she died. ''One would be too
skinny and finally, we would come to one that father would call
'peachy,' but we didn't know how to propagate the plant. At that
time, it was said among the farmers of New Jersey that blueberries
could not be cultivated.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, White read that Dr. Frederick V. Coville, a scientist
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was beginning research on
cultivated blueberries. She convinced her father that Whites Bog
had the necessary resources for the research and they asked the
government to let them help with the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had the proper soil, they had huckleberries and they had
money,'' Janet Robbins, a board member of the Whitesbog
Preservation Trust, said in a recent visit to the farm. The trust
is a nonprofit organization that is restoring and preserving the
village where the Whites and their workers lived.
</P>
<P>
   The government agreed to the Whites' proposal and five years
later, the first crop of blueberries was ready for the market. Once
they were cultivated their name was changed from huckleberries to
blueberries, Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   White, who counted herself among the ''Pineys'' in the area,
knew that the local people would know where to find the bushes with
the best and biggest berries.
</P>
<P>
   She gave the Pineys jars of a preservative and metal gauges with
different size holes in them and asked them to find bushes with
berries at least 5/8 inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she approved of the berries, they dug up the bush, brought
it to Whitesbog, took cuttings and started propagating the
bushes,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   The finders got $2 per bush and the distinction of having the
bushes named after them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the Adams bush found by Jim Adams, the Harding bush that
was found by Ralph Harding, and the Dunphy bush that was found by
Theodore Dunphy,'' White said. ''When Sam Lemon found a bush, I
could not name it the Lemon bush, so I called it the Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   A man named Rube Leek of Chatsworth found a bush with large,
good quality berries.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't want to call it the Rube and they didn't want to
call it the Leek, so they called it the Rubel,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   That bush turned out to be ''the keystone of blueberry
breeding,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberry bushes from Whites Bog were sold across the country
and in Canada. They have since become a major crop for several
states and are grown in countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan cultivates more blueberries than any other state,
followed by New Jersey. The berries contribute about $36 million to
the Garden State economy each year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last year for which figures are available, U.S.
farmers cultivated 83,300 tons of blueberries worth $141 million,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlantic Blueberry Co. in Hammonton, the largest
blueberry grower in the nation, several hundred workers have been
handpicking berries since mid-June and will continue until the
middle or end of August, said co-owner Al Galletta.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal conditions for blueberry growing are low humidity with
about an inch of rain per week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This season's pretty good. The quality is nice,'' Galletta
said.

<P>
   Pickers work row by row, hunching over a bush, nudging berries
off with their thumbs and letting them drop into their cupped
hands. After they finish a field, they start at the beginning
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's backbreaking work,'' said Robbins, who grew up picking
berries on her grandfather's farm in Pemberton. ''You got up early
and you worked in the fields all day, but I never got tired of
blueberries.''

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--Blueberry Birthplace, Bjt  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) - Coming soon to a supermarket near you:
blueberry iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Rutgers University's Cook College in New
Brunswick have created the tea and three other products as part of
a plan to increase markets for blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   Most blueberries grown in New Jersey are sold fresh and the rest
are sold frozen for use in pies and other baked goods, said Brian
Schilling, assistant director of research at Rutgers' Food Policy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1998 asked the school to
try to develop new products to increase blueberry markets,
Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognized the need was there for other market
opportunities, but we're economists; we don't know how to make iced
tea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the school's faculty, they recruited a product development
expert, a food scientist, a sensory evaluation specialist, a
marketing specialist and agricultural economists.
</P>
<P>
   Working with blueberry growers, the group came up with four
products: blueberry iced tea, blueberry juice, a sports drink and a
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The products underwent taste, smell and consistency tests at
Cook College. The iced tea has so far been the most popular and is
the one that has been made available to the public on a limited
basis.
</P>
<P>
   It has been sold at festivals at the college and at Whitesbog
Village in Burlington County.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, people just walked by and sort of scrunched their
faces, but when a few adventurous people came by and tried it, we
couldn't keep it cold, it was going so fast,'' Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing people drink bottles of a product the group had
developed, bottled and labeled was very satisfying, Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tangible thing, a real feel-good experience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to sell the products under the trademark Jersey
Blues and is in the process of forming a company to produce and
market Jersey Blues Blueberry Iced Tea.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to make the tea available at county fairs and on
roadside farm stands by the end of this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ultimately looking to get this into supermarkets and
other retail outlets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group, under the direction of Adesoji Adelaja, Dean of
Research at Cook College, is continuing research into the health
benefits of blueberries. Studies have found that they are high in
antioxidants and have anti-viral properties, like cranberries,
Schilling said. Researchers at Tufts University have found that
blueberries also have properties that help promote cell health, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to use that information and other research to
market their products as ''functional foods,'' which have a
beneficial effect on the body.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping to bring some science to the blueberry products
we're developing that show that these indeed have good health
benefits to the consumer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fans line up for newest Harry Potter book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The hour was late and the stores were
crowded to elbowing-room-only, but readers found the Harry Potter
frenzy welcome for more than the another good tale.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's hope if there's people willing to do this for a
book,'' said writer and teacher Michael Rutherford of
Voorheesville, who joined the throngs at the independent Book House
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   People lined the outdoor walkways, some scurrying back and forth
to a nearby coffee shop as they awaited the arrival of ''Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' at midnight. The story involves an
orphan boy whose parents were wizards.
</P>
<P>
   In the Albany suburb of Colonie, a cheer went up at the Barnes &AMP;
Noble store.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lamere, the store's assistant manager, said they received
300 extra copies. ''It looks like we might make it,'' he answered
when asked if anybody would go home disappointed. ''This is
probably the biggest night in book selling.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd tightened around the stacks of books, one father
told his son: ''When number five comes out, we're coming two days
later.''

<HEADLINE> Ticketed restaurant manager stomps police car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVILLE, N.J. (AP) - Usually at the trendy restaurants, it's
the chef who can be counted on to throw a hissy fit now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But police in Morris County say it was the manager of a Denville
eatery who was sizzling when he got a parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Busciglio, 23, of Saddle Brook, was charged with
disorderly conduct and criminal mischief Friday when police say he
attacked a patrol car after getting an $11 parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Rick McConnell said Busciglio, the manager of Bizarro's, was
returning to a public parking lot to feed the meter at 1:50 p.m.
when he noticed he had already gotten a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A woman parked nearby watched him climb onto the trunk of a
patrol car driven by a parking enforcement officer, and begin
jumping up and down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Busciglio then climbed onto the hood and roof, and stomped
those, too, McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the officer said, Busciglio got down and began throwing
handfuls of gravel at the car before kicking it.
</P>
<P>
   He brought another worker out to the lot to show him what he had
done, McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Busciglio posted $5,000 bail, and also had to pay $40 for two
other unpaid parking tickets, McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Follows Jimmy Carter Path  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The stakes may be different but once again, an
American president's legacy and peace in the Middle East are on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Where Jimmy Carter succeeded 22 years ago, shuttling tirelessly
between the cabins of the leaders of Israel and Egypt in the woodsy
seclusion of Camp David, Md., Bill Clinton will now try with
today's Israeli and Palestinian leaders ''to start drawing the
contours of the long-awaited peace'' between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   By every indication, and judging by his post-midnight work in
the Wye talks between Israel and the Palestinians two years ago,
Clinton is as determined as Carter was to work long hours in hopes
of forging an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in 1978, the outcome is in doubt, and there are risks --
both of success and of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, Israel is putting territory on the table in
exchange for promises of security and good will.
</P>
<P>
   The late Menachem Begin, the Israeli prime minister in 1978,
wound up yielding all of the Sinai in exchange for a peace treaty
with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   After three wars, the largest Arab nation opted for a diplomatic
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the Palestinians, after guerrilla warfare and other
forms of violence, also have chosen diplomacy -- in their case, to
gain statehood and, possibly, part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Quandt, who was at Camp David in 1978 as the senior
Middle East specialist at the White House, wrote after the summit:
''In return, Begin not only had won peace with Egypt, which by its
nature may not prove durable, but a completely free hand for Israel
in dealing with the West Bank and Gaza.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For Begin, Sinai had been sacrificed, but Eretz Israel had
been won,'' Quandt wrote. Eretz Israel is the Hebrew term for the
biblical land of Israel which includes the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While the peace has held, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is
now poised to give up most of the West Bank along with control of
what was part of biblical Israel -- the land Begin thought he had
secured.
</P>
<P>
   The late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ran a risk, as well: the
scorn and boycott of other Arab governments for making peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   He was assassinated three years later, possibly for making
peace, or perhaps for arousing generally with his policies the ire
of segments of Egypt's fundamentalist Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Powell, who was Carter's spokesman 22 years ago, said in an
interview last week that ''in some ways the issues are more
complex, but the consequences of failure may not be quite so high''
this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Sadat had set the stage for peacemaking with his historic visit
to Jerusalem in 1977. ''There had never been peace between Israel
and an Arab country,'' Powell recalled. ''If you got that step
done, the chances of there ever being another Middle East war would
substantially decline.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Powell said, in the event of a summit failure
''the potential consequences were more severe.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's summit fails, he said, there is danger of riot and
unrest, but the danger of another Mideast war is substantially
less.
</P>
<P>
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, a key player in 1978 as Carter's national
security adviser, said ''there is an obvious parallel'' between the
two summits.
</P>
<P>
   For Brzezinski, the differences are more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, with more than two years left in the White House, had
time for a fallback, while Clinton has only six months ''and the
participants know it,'' Brzezinski said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Second, Carter not only had the time but he was not writing
his final legacy,'' he said. ''Clinton is writing his final legacy,
and to some extent, seeking some redemption. This puts more
pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brzezinski said, both Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will think that Clinton is under greater pressure to
get a success than either Begin or Sadat thought Carter was.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Camp David I, the process started with both sides very far
apart. The differences not only had to be narrowed, but the end
game had to be played at the same time,'' Brzezinski said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Israel and the Palestinians have had extensive
pre-summit negotiations, leaving only the ''end game'' for the
summit, and ''in that sense, it makes it easier,'' Brzezinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Significant, as well, he said, was that both he and Carter were
willing to threaten to publicly assign blame to either side, or
both, in the event of failure -- and Sadat and Begin knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is a very intelligent and able guy, extremely
persuasive,'' Brzezinski said. ''But whether he is capable of
seriously threatening, I don't know. And that's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Lewis, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who was
involved in the Camp David talks, said he did not think Clinton had
to threaten Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think he has to threaten Arafat, in delicate, diplomatic
ways,'' Lewis said in an interview. ''He has to make clear our
relationship with the Palestinians isn't going to be the same if
there isn't an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Lewis said ''this is a more crucial moment than the
first Camp David was. Both Sadat and Begin could well have gotten
along without peace for a protracted period and then come back to
the subject. Neither was under as much pressure to reach some kind
of agreement as Barak and Arafat are today.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Censors Create a Star  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Zhou Weihui swells with pride as she
announces, ''I'm China's first banned pornographic female
novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chinese censors hoped to chasten the 27-year-old writer of
''Shanghai Baby'' when they banned her mildly racy novel of heroin
abuse, disaffected youth and sex with foreigners, the effort
backfired disastrously.
</P>
<P>
   The April ban made Weihui a star.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shanghai Baby'' is more widely available than ever in pirated
versions. Young women snap up copies at bookstands set up outside
nightclubs. News coverage of the ban has made the author famous
abroad. Publishers in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan are planning
foreign editions of Weihui's book.
</P>
<P>
   And the controversy has done just what Chinese authorities
apparently hoped to avoid -- publicize a growing youth culture of
sex, drugs and parties that would horrify an austere, old-style
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   ''My book and I are only playing the role of a stone thrown into
a pond, unwittingly causing waves that stir up mud,'' said Weihui --
her first name, but the one she prefers to go by.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster impact of the ban also says a lot about the
erosion of government power to control what the Chinese say and
read. The spread of private jobs has reduced the state's power to
manipulate private lives. And state publishing houses, under
pressure to fend for themselves in the market, take on riskier
projects.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier era, Weihui might have vanished into a labor camp
or seen her writing career ruined. Instead, this slim, photogenic
woman with artfully lacquered fingernails carries on an active
social life and speaks her mind in interviews in her modest,
third-floor walk-up apartment. Weihui says she hasn't even heard
directly from government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ban has only helped Weihui,'' said Christiaan Virant, an
American former journalist in Beijing who specializes in Chinese
pop culture. ''Even though a book is banned in China, its
distribution doesn't stop. Circulation grows ten-fold.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Shanghai Baby'' is following the path to fame taken by the
1997 potboiler ''Wrath of Heaven.'' That tale of corruption, which
mirrored a scandal in the Beijing city government, was banned by
censors but went on to become one of China's bestselling books in
pirated editions.
</P>
<P>
   Sex and drugs are hardly new to Chinese pop literature. They are
almost unavoidable in a flood of mass-market, widely available pulp
fiction populated by gangsters, drug dealers and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those books aren't banned. But unlike the legions of
anonymous crime-and-sex writers, Weihui may have chased celebrity
too successfully in a society where folk wisdom warns that ''a man
fears getting famous like a pig fears getting fat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Shanghai Baby'' already was a best seller before the ban, with
80,000 copies in print, according to its publisher, the Spring
Breeze Art Publishing House. That made Weihui a crossover sensation
-- the first of a new wave of young, female ''Glam Lit'' writers
chronicling the Chinese youth subculture to achieve mainstream
success.
</P>
<P>
   It also made her a lightning rod for establishment critics of
the genre, which is hugely popular with teen-age girls and women in
their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnal shows aren't literature,'' harrumphed a government
newspaper in the eastern city of Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly the most explicit writing in China, ''Shanghai
Baby,'' gave censors enough to dislike.
</P>
<P>
   Its main character is Coco, a Shanghai cafe waitress who lives
with a heroin addict and is carrying on an affair with a married
German man. Its cast of young slackers includes a computer hacker
who couldn't work up the ambition to finish college. Another
character is gay.
</P>
<P>
   After a journey through art exhibitions, drugs, nightclubs and
sex, Coco -- named for French fashion designer Coco Chanel -- finds
her boyfriend dead in bed of an overdose. Her adulterous lover
returns with his family to Germany, and Coco is alone.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, Spring Breeze Art Publishing was told to stop
sales of ''Shanghai Baby'' and destroy unsold copies. The
publisher, located in the northeastern province of Liaoning, was
shut down by the government and ordered to undergo a political
review.
</P>
<P>
   Weihui wasn't the only target of the official backlash. Also
banned in April was ''Candy,'' by Mian Mian, a more established
Shanghai counterculture novelist. Mian Mian's previous book, ''La
La La,'' gained notoriety but only modest sales with its graphic
depictions of heroin abuse.
</P>
<P>
   A state news agency denounced both books as vulgar and
criticized them for depicting ''dissolute lives.'' The June 15
report by the China News Agency didn't say whether that was the
reason for the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Weihui dismisses her critics as jealous old men.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't stand to see a young, pretty woman writing so
calmly about sex,'' she said. ''Their lives are usually restricted
and drab, so they envy and hate the life they can't have.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Opposition Had Long Struggle  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of police and soldiers guarded
Mexico's Congress one summer day 12 years ago as the ruling-party
majority prepared to certify the scandal-marred election of Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   A freshman congressman named Vicente Fox -- fraudulent ballots
hung on his ears to mock the large-eared Salinas -- rose to the
podium and pretended to speak as the president-elect, expressing
sorrow that he would have to rule ''against the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the ceremony on television, Salinas reportedly turned
to aides to ask: ''And this one -- who does he think he is?''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Fox was the man who would end the seven-decade
reign of Salinas' party -- a victory that had its roots in long
struggles over frauds such as Salinas' in 1988 and in a slow,
silent transformation of Mexican society.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mexican case is unique because it has been very slow, very
gradual,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a political scientist at the elite
College of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that no opposition party candidate could
have had a victory accepted before at least 1994. And until this
year, all presidential elections were tilted heavily in favor of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the milestones on the path to an opposition victory:
</P>
<P>
   --THE NEW PARTY: In 1939, a small group launched the center-right
National Action Party, or PAN. It would elect a few congressmen and
mayors over the years, but it did not even try to field a
presidential candidate until 1952. In the face of government
intolerance, it remained a small party rooted in northern Mexico's
middle class for almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   --CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM: The PRI's all-embracing network of farm,
labor and urban organizations routinely crushed rivals. But a
strike by dissident railway workers was brutally suppressed by the
government in 1958 -- one of several events that began to weaken PRI
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   --THE MASSACRE: The army's massacre of student demonstrators in
Mexico City in 1968 turned a generation of intellectuals -- and
later their students -- against the ruling party. The hostility it
created also made later generations of soldiers wary of being used
for political ends as they had been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   --THE ECONOMY: President Jose Lopez Portillo used booming oil
revenues and soaring debt to patch up problems in the
state-dominated economy. When oil prices fell, the resulting crisis
alienated millions of middle-class voters. Shortly before leaving
office in 1982, the president vowed to ''defend the peso like a
dog.'' Devaluation followed and Lopez Portillo was greeted with
barks for years.
</P>
<P>
   --FREE TRADE: President Miguel de la Madrid led Mexico toward
private enterprise and free trade, entering the international
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986. He began selling
off the state companies the PRI had used for decades as sources of
jobs for supporters. Increasingly, Mexicans lived in cities and
fewer worked for the state.
</P>
<P>
   --REVOLT AT THE POLLS: In 1986, the PRI used fraud to keep
National Action's Francisco Barrio from winning the governor's race
in Chihuahua state along the U.S. border. Tens of thousands
demonstrated, repeatedly closing border bridges between Ciudad
Juarez and El Paso. ''It was the first time that intellectuals of
the right and of the left joined together to publish petitions and
denunciations in nationwide media and newspapers,'' said M. Delal
Baer, a Mexico specialist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   --CARDENAS: Calling for a more democratic system, left-leaning
PRI members bolted the party to ally with socialist parties and
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the 1988 election. Cardenas awoke
opposition to the PRI even in the countryside, and the government
resorted to fraud to elect Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   --THE SALINAS OPENING: Reforms Salinas instituted cleaned up
corrupt voting lists and created a semi-independent election board.
''Salinas was plagued by illegitimacy and he was acutely aware that
the entire stability of the nation could hang by a thread if Mexico
didn't have adequate electoral institutions,'' Baer said. Other
analysts stress that Salinas had to improve Mexico's reputation to
win a free trade pact with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   --A DANGEROUS MAN: In 1991, Salinas forced the PRI's Ramon
Aguirre to quit after a fraud-marred victory over Fox in Guanajuato
state. It made Fox a national figure. But Salinas balked at the
dangerous Fox, and another PAN politician was named interim
governor.
</P>
<P>
   --A WALL FALLS: Mexico's constitution had barred Fox from the
presidency because his mother was born in Spain. Some of Salinas'
ambitious cabinet secretaries faced the same ban. In 1993, Salinas
had the constitution amended -- but only in time for the year 2000,
ruling out Fox as a contender in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   --ZEDILLO'S OPENING: The PRI's Ernesto Zedillo won the free -- if
not wholly fair -- election of 1994. He continued to dismantle the
state sector, long a PRI power base, and had Congress make the
electoral board fully independent of the government.
</P>
<P>
   --FOX'S CHASE: Running for president virtually from the time he
was finally elected governor of Guanajuato in 1995, Fox created an
unprecedented national support network independent of his party. By
the time National Action chose a candidate, he had overwhelmed
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   --THE PRI STRUGGLES: Zedillo let the party choose its own
candidate for the first time. Francisco Labastida won the PRI's
nomination after a bitter primary in which rival Roberto Madrazo
called him ''the perfect disaster.'' In the general election, many
Madrazo voters turned to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   --THE CAMPAIGN: For the first time, the opposition had extensive
public financing, heavy coverage in news media and an impartial
electoral board. Most final polls showed Fox slightly behind
Labastida. But Fox adviser Jorge Castaneda said the legal three-day
moratorium on campaigning before the election softened the impact
of Labastida's attacks and let voters recall their deeply rooted
distrust of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   --VICTORY: Moments after polls closed on July 2, Mexicans were
stunned when television exit polls showed they had elected their
first opposition party president. At about 11:30 p.m., as official
results started to come in, Zedillo appeared on television to
congratulate Fox.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Under Pressure at Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- First as fiery young guerrilla fighter, then as
ailing elder statesman, Yasser Arafat has been for four decades the
enduring symbol of his people's statehood hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, heading into a U.S.-brokered peace summit a few weeks shy
of his 71st birthday, the Palestinian leader has what may be a
last, best chance to make that dream a reality.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat is going reluctantly to this meeting at Camp David,
the presidential retreat in rural Maryland whose very name evokes
that rarest of commodities in Middle East peace efforts: a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Under what is likely to be unrelenting pressure from President
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat risks
striking the kind of bargain that could leave him branded as a
traitor to the very cause he has fought for all his life.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat's dream is to be the father of Palestinian statehood,
his nightmare is to be known as the leader who lost Jerusalem, or
the man who turned his back on millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Tuesday's summit, the Palestinians
have signaled some willingness to be flexible on territorial
matters, perhaps trading away tracts of the West Bank that are
already given over to large Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be almost impossible for Arafat to sell a statehood
deal to his people that did not include at least a foothold in
Jerusalem and Israel's acknowledgment of the right -- to be
exercised or not -- of Palestinian refugees to return to homes they
fled or were driven from during Israel's 1948 war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says Jerusalem will never be divided, and that the return
of all refugees is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in power, Arafat has weathered bitter political
rivalries, eluded assassination attempts and survived a near-fatal
air crash. But even so resilient a leader understands the powerful
emotional punch carried by issues like Jerusalem and the refugees --
and Arafat knows he cannot afford to be seen by his people as
yielding too much.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Palestinians, and perhaps even Arafat himself,
would rather see peacemaking efforts break down altogether --
perhaps even descending into violence -- rather than surrender on
certain key points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arafat is going to get what the Palestinians need -- this
summit will show that he is not a man to fail his people,'' said
Abbas Abu Ali, a shopkeeper in the sprawling, dusty Shati refugee
camp in the Gaza Strip. ''He will take care of the refugees, and we
will have our Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, while Arafat is genuinely revered as a national
symbol, Palestinian public opinion polls consistently turn up low
levels of trust in him as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how far his popularity slips, no one else can
command anything approaching his degree of support. And Arafat has
made certain over the years that no other political figure emerges
to challenge his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Acutely attuned to public opinion, Arafat has a consistent
ability to play to street sentiment even while working behind the
scenes to defuse a particularly explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of that might be statehood itself. On the one
hand, Arafat has recently given rousing speeches saying a
unilateral declaration of statehood will occur on Sept. 13 -- the
deadline the two sides set to reach a final peace accord -- whether
Israel liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, even as the Palestinians' top policymaking body
expressed ''determination'' to meet that target date, Arafat was
quietly polling the leadership as to whether the Palestinian public
would be willing to wait longer for statehood that would come as
part of a deal negotiated with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   While Arafat might win some international recognition for a
unilaterally declared state, the practical consequences would
present enormous hardship for Palestinians, including a halt to
vital commerce with and through Israel.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, Arafat will be playing to world opinion as
well as domestic sentiment, and press reports in Israel say the
Palestinians will field a high-powered public relations team.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the large Palestinian delegation is Hanan Ashrawi, a
former Cabinet minister who is no longer close to Arafat, but
served as a memorably articulate spokeswoman for the Palestinian
cause when peace efforts began seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As during any high-profile international event, Arafat's age and
health are likely to be a subject of speculation. He turns 71 on
Aug. 4 and has long displayed symptoms typical of Parkinson's
disease, including tremors of his hand and lip. In recent public
appearances, though, he has appeared vigorous and energetic.
</P>
<P>
   In private encounters, the summit may showcase the dramatic
cooling of Arafat's relationship with Barak in the year since the
Israeli prime minister took office.
</P>
<P>
   Their earliest public meetings were characterized by
friendliness -- long, warm handclasps, repeated references to their
role as partners -- but as peace efforts have foundered, the tone of
their dealings has become much more adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that, Arafat's government summoned tough rhetoric as
he prepared to head to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Palestinian nation is more determined than ever to
liberate our land and our holy Jerusalem,'' the Palestinian Cabinet
declared Friday night after its weekly meeting. ''We will establish
an independent Palestinian state, no matter how high the price and
how great the sacrifice.''

<HEADLINE> Police: Two off-duty cops shoot and kill assailant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two off-duty police officers shot and killed a
man on Friday after he leaped from a nearby car and assaulted the
cops, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Stephen Borchers and Detective Jean Weller were in a pickup
truck and were not in uniform, said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police
spokesman. They were driving along the Grand Central Parkway near
Francis Lewis Boulevard around 6:30 p.m. when a man jumped from the
passenger side of a Kia two vehicles in front of them, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   A livery car swerved to avoid the man, Dandre Donnell Cisco, 25,
and Borchers slowed his truck. Before the officers could get out of
their vehicle, Cisco ran toward them and assaulted Borchers, Burke
said. He stepped on the gas pedal and his car lurched forward,
striking the livery cab.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco then ran around the truck, opened the passenger-side door,
and tried to pull Weller out as he assaulted her, Burke said. Both
officers then drew their weapons and began firing, perhaps four
shots, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers were taken to Long Island Jewish Hospital,
where they were treated for physical and emotional trauma, Burke
said.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Saturday, police had yet to interview the officers.
The preliminary report was based on interviews with the drivers of
the Kia, the livery car, and two other witnesses, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Borchers is a 13-year veteran and Weller has been on the force
for 15 years. Both are assigned to the borough-wide Queens
detectives' unit.

<HEADLINE> Police Barricade Sharif's Home  </HEADLINE>
By MUNIR AHMED
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- Police seized the wife of deposed
premier Nawaz Sharif to prevent her from leading a protest march
Saturday, pursuing her in a brief car chase and then towing her
away inside her vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Kulsoom Sharif had planned the march to protest against the
military government that toppled her husband. But after arresting
scores of her supporters, police surrounded her house early
Saturday with barricades to keep her inside.
</P>
<P>
   She and three companions, however, managed to escape in a car
and headed toward the center of this eastern city. Police chased
the car through Lahore's congested streets and finally intercepted
it, witnesses and police said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharif refused to leave her vehicle, police towed the white
Toyota Corolla with her inside.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted on her mobile telephone while still locked in the car,
Sharif said, ''The champions of democracy and human rights have
exposed their real faces by arresting an innocent woman. But they
cannot stop us from our struggle for the restoration of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police took the car to a military officers' club in Lahore, but
were not forcing Sharif and her companions out. Seven hours later,
the four were still locked inside, the engine running to keep the
air conditioning going in the summer heat. It wasn't clear whether
police intended to arrest Sharif or release her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to think. We can't leave our house and I am
worried abut my mother,'' Sharif's daughter Mariam said. ''But no
matter what the government does to us we will not run. We will
fight until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The ousted premier's wife had vowed to lead an anti-government
rally from Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province, to
Peshawar, 300 miles to the northwest. There is a ban on public
protests in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The march was to be a show of protest against the army regime
that threw out her husband's government in October. The ousted
prime minister is now in prison serving two concurrent life terms
on charges of terrorism and kidnapping. He also faces several
charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The military government banned marches and protest rallies
several months ago, saying the first order of business was to get
Pakistan's failed economy working and the endemic corruption rooted
out.
</P>
<P>
   Army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf has promised to restore
democracy to this poor nation of 140 million people within three
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, police conducted raids throughout the country,
arresting as many as 260 of Sharif's supporters to prevent the
march. Some of Sharif's supporters said there were more raids
conducted throughout the night Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Sharif's home Saturday morning, police turned away
vehicles at their barricades. At least 25 people were arrested
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''All night long police raided homes of our supporters and are
now barring workers from assembling at Nawaz Sharif's home,'' said
Tehmina Daultana, a party worker and former Parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife, who was rarely seen in public when her husband
was in power, is now spearheading the anti-government campaign. But
deep divisions have emerged within the former ruling Pakistan
Muslim League party with some leaders expressing resentment over
her leadership. Many senior party members refused to participate in
her planned march.

<HEADLINE> Greek Island Fire Battled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Hundreds of firefighters and civilians
battled a blaze on the Aegean Sea island of Samos on Saturday as
strong winds continued to fan fires across Greece, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in Greece were expected to reach 106 degrees as
hot, dry winds continued to fan forest fires burning since
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Samos, the scene of the largest fire in the country, has been in
a state of emergency since Thursday. Homes were evacuated as about
450 firefighters, soldiers and hundreds of civilian volunteers
tried to bring the blaze under control. A 93-year-old woman was
found dead in a village near the fire. The woman, Maria
Eleftheriou, was burned alive in her home Saturday morning,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking part in the effort were six airplanes, four
helicopters, 40 fire trucks and 15 water tankers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extent of the damage was not known, several
abandoned homes, hundreds of acres of farm land and forest have
been reported destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Another fire on the Ionian Sea island of Corfu raged as more
than 40 firefighters and 13 trucks battled the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   A number of smaller fires also burned throughout Greece,
including blazes on the island of Crete, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect arson in a fire near ancient Marathon and have
arrested three construction workers.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton celebrates first anniversary on the campaign trail  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - On July 7, 1999, Hillary Rodham Clinton
stood nervously before hundreds of reporters, dozens of television
crews and photographers and, with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan at
her side along a dirt road on his farm, became the only first lady
to seek public office.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly a year later, she hopped aboard a bus in Ithaca hauling
about 15 reporters, two television crews and four still
photographers following her campaign for the U.S. Senate. She joked
about a cookie she had just been presented in a local shop. It was
supposed to look like her, with yellow hair and green eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 20 minutes on the bus, she fielded questions on
everything from the man she had just met with the ''carpetbaggers
go home'' sign - ''He just muttered. I've noticed that people who
hold signs like that mutter a lot'' - to whether she and President
Clinton would be vacationing in New York this summer. ''We are. All
over the state, but we don't know where yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation from first lady to candidate for the Senate
seat fellow Democrat Moynihan is giving up at the end of this year
had taught her a few lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to try to stop talking in paragraphs,'' she told The
Associated Press in an interview Friday at a hotel in Corning on
the first anniversary of her campaign. ''But that's very tough for
me. I'm nowhere near able to do it. Somebody said, 'You don't talk
in paragraphs, you talk in volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   And she said, ''There were some rough patches I had to learn to
get through. There were some really tough challenges and I had to
just be absolutely committed to doing this. I'm not a quitter. I'm
pretty much of a persevering type and I had to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough patches included her embrace of the wife of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the end of a speech in which
Soha Arafat had accused Israeli troops of using poison gas on
Palestinians. And, she came out against her husband's offer of
clemency for a group of Puerto Ricans imprisoned for terrorist
activities - without first consulting New York's Puerto Rican
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the recent harsh report from independent counsel
Robert Ray on her involvement in the firing of employees of the
White House travel office and an upcoming Ray report on her and the
president's ties to the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas. That
report is expected before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really doesn't worry me,'' she told the AP when asked about
the Ray report. ''I think most people have made up their minds
about all of these issues years ago. I have no doubt in my mind
that if the partisan political nature of the investigation
continues that people will treat it with the disregard that it
deserves. There is no there there, so it's never bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has also watched her poll numbers in New York
fall from the 60 percent range when talk of her candidacy first
started to the mid-40s where they have been stalled for months. Her
aides said it represented a natural closing of the race. But the
polls also show that a third of the New York electorate simply
doesn't like her very much and that the carpetbagger issue lingers
a half-year after she moved into New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some people it remains a very big concern, but for other
people it's diminished and I sense that all the time,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the day before, one of those who turned out to see the
first lady as she revisited a Lockheed Martin plant near Binghamton
was Peter Wood, a local contractor. Republican Wood said he would
likely vote for Democrat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice that she's paying so much attention to upstate New
York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even before the Democratic state convention in late May
at which she was formally chosen as the party's candidate, Clinton
had managed to visit all 62 of New York's counties.
</P>
<P>
   But to complicate matters, Clinton has had to shift gears
mid-campaign to run against a new opponent.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gave up his
certain claim to the Republican nomination in the face of prostate
cancer and a failing marriage. GOP leaders quickly anointed a
little-known congressman from Long Island, Rick Lazio, as the
substitute. Within a week, polls showed the race to be almost dead
even.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never believed that this race against either of my opponents
would be anything but a tight, tough race,'' she told the AP on
Friday. ''I have no illusions about the work I have to do ... but
I'm also very confident about the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing her sharper edge, Clinton and her supporters have
already begun to work Lazio over. They launched more than a half
dozen television ads in the past three weeks attacking his
congressional voting record, including his opposition to using
federal funds to pay for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The pace has been grueling, Clinton admits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Starting on Senator Moynihan's farm, with more press coverage
than I'd ever seen, certainly until the present day a year later,
this campaign has been running at full steam,'' she said. ''I've
had to take a lot of vitamins in order to keep going every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But she claims to have enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly, it's been a great experience for me,'' she said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 1999, Clinton's first campaign day ended with a visit
to baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown where she signed
baseballs and shook hands with several hundred tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 2000, she ended her 365th day on the campaign trail,
perhaps fittingly, at a minor league baseball field in Jamestown.
With the centerfield wall a distant 414 feet away across the lush
green outfield, she basked in the cheers of more than 400
supporters in the bleachers
</P>
<P>
   ''I've come back on this first anniversary and I want you to
know I will be back time and time and time again,'' she promised.
''If you will help me, and if you do, we will make history
together.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Stolen From Plane in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Fifteen heavily armed men stormed onto
an airport tarmac, opened fire on passengers and stole 134 pounds
of gold from an airplane preparing for take off, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Using automatic weapons and three cars, the robbers took less
less than 10 minutes to rob the plane at Brasilia International
Airport late Thursday night, police spokesman Aprigio Nascimento
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the robbery, the gunmen fired on the parked aircraft and
an airport bus containing passengers before making off with the
gold, Nascimento said, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a thought out plan,'' Nascimento said. ''They went
straight for the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold, worth $607,000, belonged to the Serra Grande mining
company and was apparently headed to Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   During their escape, the robbers dropped a 55 pound bag of gold.
Police later found the cars abandoned outside the city, but have
made no arrests.

<HEADLINE> Haute Couture Shows Open in Paris  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- John Galliano laid on a sensational costume-wedding
piece for Christian Dior Saturday to open the haute couture
showings for fall-winter.
</P>
<P>
   But costume is the key here, rather than wearable winter
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   The mock wedding exploded with exuberant clothes inspired by
various periods, especially 1900 to 1930. The beautiful bride was
in a gorgeous slim cream satin dress with flared hem and long tulle
train; her groom was in a slick tailcoat and striped trousers -- de
rigueur form for any era.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300-strong audience had awaited the show patiently on
padded red benches in the big Beaux-Arts space, converted to
Galliano's taste with plenty of red.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity lineup included filmmaker Steven Spielberg; top
political wives like Bernadette Chirac, wife of the French
president; Claude Pompidou, widow of a former French president;
plus of course Helene and Bernard Arnault. Arnault is the financial
power behind Dior and, as chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton, he is also the king of luxury businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With the rest of the fashion mob, the celebrities spent an hour
listening to kinky electronic sounds of whips cracking and moaning
sighs.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the ''wedding'' began. It was typical of Galliano, who
likes to make people wait before offering a shock of something
hideous, or beautiful, on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was on the gorgeous side, if you like costumes. The
panoply took in everything from a jeweled Orthodox priest in a
panniered robe to a small, draped child playing a recorder. There
were also numbers like spiffy military uniforms for men and women --
sparkling sequined tartans for the Coldstream Guards, or perhaps
Red Army chic.
</P>
<P>
   On the catwalk was former model Marisa Berenson. As ''mother of
the bride,'' she looked gorgeous as ever in a fitted ecru silk
crepe dress, draped beautifully over a hand-embroidered lace body
stocking and a big stiff net hat.
</P>
<P>
   These were fantasy-romantic clothes that suit beauties like
Berenson. But not everyone was exactly beautiful. There was the
perky ''maid'' in a sequined black and white outfit, swinging her
handbag with intention. The girl dressed in a sort of grass hut was
sassy enough to have grabbed Josephine Baker.
</P>
<P>
   An 18th-century shepherdess looked splendid in her silk floral
dress. A corselet dress in wine red with its puffy satin skirt had
a certain charm for the stage. Masked carnival characters came out
in amazing clown or striped polka-dotted fur coats.
</P>
<P>
   And Galliano even threw in some truly kinky details: a violet
silk ballerina dress with bare breast under tulle and many chains
and nail details as jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   It was all divine and well made.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano, who strutted down to take a bow in his top hat, tails
and silver-curled wig, knows nobody's going to buy this
jillion-dollar stuff. But the masses will stuff the coffers of Dior
when they pick up some perfume, a gift, a bit of ready-to-wear.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime couturiere Rosette Mett, known as Torrente, was so
miffed that the Chambre Syndicale, fashion's ruling body, gave her
usual opening spot in couture to Dior that she has decided to take
her show to Monte Carlo on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the week will see big names on runways around town --
from Versace to Chanel to Yves Saint Laurent. There are some new
and lesser designers sending invitations, but the big names are the
ones to watch. Will they show anything wearable, even though
unaffordable?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope so. It's always nice to have a look to copy.

<HEADLINE> East Harlem School builds educated 'warriors' for a new generation  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - They are the old warriors of East Harlem - whose
conquests of other worlds have filled them with sage advice and
made them a valuable asset to their community - even if they aren't
old enough to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   So when four old warriors recently returned to their training
grounds at the East Harlem School at Exodus House, everyone came to
listen to them describe living far from the projects - at some of
the nation's more prestigious prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, but David Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old eighth grader, sent home for arguing with a
superior, missed what is considered a sacred event. While David
could have benefited from the session, the suspension served as a
deeper lesson for one of this private middle school's gifted, yet
stubborn students.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a lot more passionate and interested student than I've
ever known,'' said teacher Laurent Alfred, who has taught David for
four years. ''But it's hard for him to focus sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools might not highlight a student's flaws. But the East
Harlem School's four core teachers and its handful of
administrators shine a scalding light on them, trying to burn away
bad traits. Education never stops for the 63 boys and girls, all
from minority groups, and the lessons are more than books,
multiplication tables and science projects.
</P>
<P>
   Students who struggled elsewhere - some are castoffs from public
schools - are challenged to be better people. They're told that
maybe, if they push themselves, they can attain the success enjoyed
by the old warriors - the term the school uses for its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look for a much more holistic approach with the students,''
Alfred said. ''And we look for the kids that don't do so well. If
not for this school, a lot of these students would be floundering,
and I mean brilliant students.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every child succeeds. School officials say they don't have a
list of kids who dropped out or were expelled, but the numbers are
fewer these days than when the school first opened, partly because
administrators failed to make it clear how strict they planned to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The children have a dress code of white shirts, navy blue pants
or skirts, and dress shoes. They aren't supposed to date one
another. They must sit and walk with an upright posture, speak
English properly and sign a contract to skip television on school
nights. Strict punishments are doled out to those who break the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just physical lessons. The real education digs
into deeper issues of intellect and morality to create a person
with a sense of self and community, a radically different sort from
many who walk the streets of East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   When eighth graders presented their final project before the
whole school, principal and co-founder Ivan Hageman sat quietly in
the rear to hear their report on ''Science and Revolutionary Change
with Society.'' He had been pessimistic about the eight students'
chosen topic, thinking it was too much for them to understand and
describe with any true meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 90-minute presentation, an impressed Hageman
praised the students for ''synthesizing'' so much information. Then
he tested them with a series of questions, ones that left younger
students shaking their heads in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hageman, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, asked about
religion's ''reductory role in society'' and about whether humans
have truly evolved as a species from 150,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to feel pressure, anxiety on an intellectual
level,'' Hageman explained.
</P>
<P>
   Though in their early teens, the students had answers. Hageman
beamed. The session was exactly what he and his brother, Hans, had
in mind when Exodus House evolved into a middle school seven years
ago. The four-story facility, which their parents started as a drug
rehab house in the 1980s, has become a nugget of hope hidden within
a neighborhood of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Though their now-deceased parents - their father was white and
their mother black - had modest incomes, the Hagemans attended
private schools from an early age. Hans, 42, became a defense
lawyer and Ivan, 41, a teacher. Eventually, Ivan decided he wanted
to work with youngsters before they got into trouble - when he
could still make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the school, the brothers had to confront drug
dealers working across the street, who eventually agreed to move
elsewhere, and to accomplish the more important task of raising
money.
</P>
<P>
   It was a struggle, but the Hagemans relied on ties they'd made
to the cultural elite. An old high school friend, John F. Kennedy
Jr., was a board member of the Robin Hood Foundation and prodded it
to donate seed money. The brothers also turned to the rich and
prominent to help keep the school running.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition ranges from $100 to $300 a month for parents who can
afford to pay. But because no one gets turned away for lack of
money, cash must be raised from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''Funding is slowly resolving itself,'' Ivan Hageman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagemans, starting to feel comfortable about the future,
want to undertake a major capital improvement plan - at a cost of
up to $7 million - which includes gutting and renovating a
neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
   But where the school truly earns its marks is in the classroom.
Each class begins with a minute of silence because ''it's a way to
get them engaged, to make a transition, so they realize it's almost
a sacred place here,'' explained Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers employ an interdisciplinary style, which for example
means mixing English with math. Classes are frequently
conversations led by teachers, and if the students latch onto
something good, the lack of a bell system allows the discussion to
continue into the next session.
</P>
<P>
   At least three times a week, students follow Ivan Hageman on a
field trip that he calls ''the warrior walk.'' At times, the
students stroll quietly, taking periods to meditate. At others,
they jog, strengthening their bodies, giving them a sense of
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these kids are coming from war zones,'' Ivan Hageman
said. ''Some of these kids, because they come from a war zone, they
haven't allowed themselves to feel. We want them to feel the pain,
and the positives.''
</P>
<P>
   David called the warrior walk ''a driving force - it's what you
want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ''But for us, young men, it's convoluted. They
want to be sure we become men, but a warrior comes out of having a
strong man ... who is dominant. But what we want is not dominance
of others, but dominance of yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that sort of analysis that led Peter Bidstrup, director of
admissions at the Governor Dummer Academy in Massachusetts, to
recruit David. He saw a born leader in the sleek hockey and
lacrosse star who also plays the violin. He also saw a child who
has overcome the difficulties of both being adopted and of being
black with a white mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bidstrup also saw possibilities that the East Harlem School
could benefit an institution like Governor Dummer, America's oldest
boarding school, opened in 1763.
</P>
<P>
   ''David has tremendous presence and confidence, and I see a
student who is ready to grow,'' Bidstrup said. ''We would love to
have a pipeline from a school like East Harlem. It's a school that
in many ways gives us our life's-blood.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts pressure on David to perform. If he does well, he will
cut a new path for future ''warriors.'' David says he's not even
considering the possibility of failure after his lessons at the
East Harlem School, which he graduated from last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This school did so much for me,'' he said. ''It's the best
thing that ever happened to me, besides being adopted.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Harlem Warriors, Bjt,1300  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - They are the old warriors of East Harlem - whose
conquests of other worlds have filled them with sage advice and
made them a valuable asset to their community - even if they aren't
old enough to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   So when four old warriors recently returned to their training
grounds at the East Harlem School at Exodus House, everyone came to
listen to them describe living far from the projects - at some of
the nation's more prestigious prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, but David Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old eighth grader, sent home for arguing with a
superior, missed what is considered a sacred event. While David
could have benefited from the session, the suspension served as a
deeper lesson for one of this private middle school's gifted, yet
stubborn students.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a lot more passionate and interested student than I've
ever known,'' said teacher Laurent Alfred, who has taught David for
four years. ''But it's hard for him to focus sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools might not highlight a student's flaws. But the East
Harlem School's four core teachers and its handful of
administrators shine a scalding light on them, trying to burn away
bad traits. Education never stops for the 63 boys and girls, all
from minority groups, and the lessons are more than books,
multiplication tables and science projects.
</P>
<P>
   Students who struggled elsewhere - some are castoffs from public
schools - are challenged to be better people. They're told that
maybe, if they push themselves, they can attain the success enjoyed
by the old warriors - the term the school uses for its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look for a much more holistic approach with the students,''
Alfred said. ''And we look for the kids that don't do so well. If
not for this school, a lot of these students would be floundering,
and I mean brilliant students.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every child succeeds. School officials say they don't have a
list of kids who dropped out or were expelled, but the numbers are
fewer these days than when the school first opened, partly because
administrators failed to make it clear how strict they planned to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The children have a dress code of white shirts, navy blue pants
or skirts, and dress shoes. They aren't supposed to date one
another. They must sit and walk with an upright posture, speak
English properly and sign a contract to skip television on school
nights. Strict punishments are doled out to those who break the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just physical lessons. The real education digs
into deeper issues of intellect and morality to create a person
with a sense of self and community, a radically different sort from
many who walk the streets of East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   When eighth graders presented their final project before the
whole school, principal and co-founder Ivan Hageman sat quietly in
the rear to hear their report on ''Science and Revolutionary Change
with Society.'' He had been pessimistic about the eight students'
chosen topic, thinking it was too much for them to understand and
describe with any true meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 90-minute presentation, an impressed Hageman
praised the students for ''synthesizing'' so much information. Then
he tested them with a series of questions, ones that left younger
students shaking their heads in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hageman, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, asked about
religion's ''reductory role in society'' and about whether humans
have truly evolved as a species from 150,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to feel pressure, anxiety on an intellectual

<HEADLINE> Volunteers conduct mission to nourish body, soul  </HEADLINE>
By THEOLA S. LABBE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A red-and-white ambulance came into the city
park around 1:30 p.m. and stopped near the pool fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charlie Muller of Victory Christian Church in Albany,
N.Y., drove into the park not to tend to any medical emergency, but
to feed hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free lunch! Come and get free lunch!'' Muller announced
through a bullhorn Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, there was a stampede as children jockeyed for
position at the back of the ambulance, where Muller handed out
brown-paper-bag lunches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hungry,'' said Aniah Marbley, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Taylor, 9, said he misses the free lunches he gets
during the year at Philip Schuyler Elementary School and was happy
that Muller came by. ''You don't have to spend your money,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a nutrition watchdog group reported that more than a
million poor children statewide who get free or reduced-price meals
during the school year lose that meal when summer vacation hits.
The federally funded Summer Food Program provides free meals only
to 325,500 children in New York state each year at playgrounds,
schools and community centers, according to the Nutrition
Consortium of New York State. Too few sites and a lack of notice
about the summer program to families is to blame, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Friday was the second time this summer Muller drove
to city parks and pools in search of hungry children. In the
morning, he and 11 volunteer Bible students visiting from Toronto
made about 400 ham-and-cheese, bologna-and-cheese, and
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, packed them into paper bags
with an apple and chips - along with a Christian comic book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oooh, I got a prize,'' said Daquan Wilson, 6, as he pulled out
the comic book.
</P>
<P>
   At one park, no youngsters were around so Muller gave out lunch
to adults. ''God's got a plan for your life. It's a good plan.
Don't settle for seconds,'' the pastor told a 21-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile summer lunch program costs Muller's Quail Street
congregation about $600 a week and is supported solely through
weekly church collections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Muller began running the converted ambulance - ''For
Emergency, Call Jesus'' painted on it - and speakers to play gospel
music. He grew frustrated by what he described as the bureaucracy
of a government-sponsored summer feeding program. He said he wanted
to go out and find children in need instead of waiting for them to
come to the church doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our mission to meet the needs of these children,'' said
Muller, 42, who was ordained six years ago by the Independent
Assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   While his goal is to provide physical nourishment, he wants to
provide spiritual nourishment, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to really sow seeds in these kids,'' he said. ''We're
going to reap a harvest.''

<HEADLINE> Orangemen Face Protestant Ire  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Senior politicians and
Protestant clergymen appealed to hard-line marchers to turn away
from conflict Sunday when police and soldiers block them from
marching through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces readied extensive defenses Saturday on the eve
of the Orange Order march in Portadown that has already ignited
widespread street violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Three schools -- two Catholic, the other designed specifically to
teach Catholic and Protestant children together -- were damaged
early Saturday by arsonists in Protestant suburbs of Belfast. No
one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The province's most senior Protestant church and political
leaders appealed to the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Protestant fraternal group, to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not consider violent protest is in any way appropriate
before or after attendance at the worship of Almighty God,''
Archbishop Robin Eames, leader of the Anglican church in Ireland,
said in his most strongly worded letter to the Orangemen of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   A rural Anglican church in Drumcree, north of the predominantly
Protestant town, is the midway point for the Orangemen's annual
parade -- officially to commemorate local losses in World War I, but
in practice a demonstration of Protestant dominance that many
Catholics resent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 Catholic hard-liners in the Garvaghy Road district
have tried to block the parade as it returns to Portadown through
their area.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, protesting that they are being coerced by
supporters of the Irish Republican Army, have refused to go home
through Protestant areas or to negotiate directly with the
Catholics. That position, along with intense Catholic rioting in
1997, has compelled British authorities to bar Orangemen from
Garvaghy Road since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A standoff between Orange crowds and police in 1998 ended only
when three young Catholic brothers died in an arson attack in
another town. Last year Orangemen and their supporters remained
largely peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, notorious Protestant terrorists recently paroled
from prison under terms of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord
have been prominent at the Portadown standoff. To the exasperation
of many Protestants, including Orangemen outside Portadown, the
town's Orange leaders have welcomed their attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence of paramilitary involvement at Drumcree and the
disgraceful exhibition of masked men firing shots in Portadown has
removed further any integrity this protest may have had,'' Eames
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Portadown Orangemen said they intended to disperse
Sunday after handing police a letter of protest at the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   But they appealed for Orangemen across Northern Ireland to mount
four-hour street protests Monday as part of a continuing campaign
to force a march down Garvaghy Road -- and to disband a
government-appointed Parades Commission which sets restrictions on
controversial parades.
</P>
<P>
   Breandan MacCionnaith, the former IRA prisoner who leads the
Garvaghy Road protesters, predicted ''mayhem and possibly murder on
the streets ... as a result of the Orange Order's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant
party who rose to prominence by championing the Portadown
Orangemen's right to march in 1995, said the time had come for
direct talks between the Portadown factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be so much better if the (Portadown Orange) district
could represent itself directly rather than go through
go-betweens,'' said Trimble, an Orangeman who today leads Northern
Ireland's joint Protestant-Catholic administration -- a
power-sharing experiment that many Orangemen oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from past struggles to contain Protestant mobs at
Drumcree, police and army commanders have assembled an array of
defensive measures.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police in flame-retardant uniforms, soldiers in armored
personnel carriers, surveillance planes and helicopters with
searchlights, and high-powered water cannons on loan from Belgium
have been used in recent days to keep angry Orange crowds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, commander of the province's
predominantly Protestant police force, said his officers would
allow Orangemen to engage indefinitely in peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   He said nighttime violence -- the hijacking and burning of cars,
gasoline-bomb attacks on police, and stone-throwing at isolated
Catholic homes -- had eased since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is because people in the areas affected are
standing up and saying: 'We don't want this','' Flanagan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Boy Scouts of America will award its
highest honor to country singer Louise Mandrell.
</P>
<P>
   Mandrell, who helped raise more than $1 million for the scouts,
will receive the Silver Buffalo Award at her theater in Pigeon
Forge on Tuesday. Previous winners include Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart,
Walt Disney and President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts, based in Irving, Texas, aim to build character
and foster citizenship in young men through outdoor activities,
achievement programs and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is people like Louise Mandrell that share their talents and
energies with our organization that make scouting possible for the
youth of America,'' said spokesman Mike Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Mandrell, who is the sister of country star Barbara Mandrell,
has entertained at many scouting events including the National
Jamboree. Since 1994, she has hosted the annual Louise Mandrell
Celebrity Shoot in Nashville, which benefits the scouting program
in Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Mandrell scored hits in the 1980s with ''Save Me'' and ''Maybe
My Baby.''

<HEADLINE> Refugees Flee Russia  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GERZEL, Russia (AP) -- Hundreds of refugees fled Chechnya on
Saturday, saying they feared renewed violence in the wake of
suicide bombings against Russian troops and warnings by Chechen
fighters of more fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was prompted in part by an announcement by rebels
Friday that Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had met 20 rebel
commanders and decided to launch renewed attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to live,'' said Markha Saidova, 45, crossing the
frontier from Chechnya into the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan. ''Now that the terrorist acts have started, I have
decided to leave following Maskhadov's call.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels launched five suicide truck bomb attacks against
Russian positions July 2, killing at least 33 and wounding 84,
according to official figures. Russian forces responded by
arresting dozens of people and tightening security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said there had been television broadcasts by
Maskhadov that broke into the Russia's government channels in the
rebellious province, where Russian troops are trying to restore
Moscow's control in a military operation that began 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   State television officials in Chechnya said that rebels
occasionally appear on the airwaves using mobile, low-power
transmitters that cover small areas, the Interfax news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people an hour were crossing into Dagestan, through the
divided village of Gerzel, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Seda Gelayeva, from the town of Shali, said she was leaving
after hearing about Maskhadov's warnings of more fighting from a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not see Maskhadov's address on television, but a friend
of mine warned me,'' she said. ''It is not calm, it is dangerous
where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechens at the Gerzel crossing point reported Saturday that
Russian warplanes had been bombing suspected rebel hide-outs in the
mountainous southern regions on Vedeno and Shali and in the Argun
gorge.
</P>
<P>
   At the border, Russian troops were also allowing some people to
cross into Chechnya from Dagestan, if they held documents showing
they lived in the immediate area. Almost all were women, carrying
food to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops nominally control most of Chechnya, and are
chasing rebel bands in the southern mountains. But they remain
vulnerable to sniping, bombings and hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Gennady
Troshev, told NTV television Saturday that 30 people had been
detained in connection with the July 2 suicide bombing. Two had
confessed to their roles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was elected president in 1997 after leading rebel
fighters in driving out Russian troops in a 1994-96 war. But he no
longer exerts much control over other major guerrilla commanders.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin said Saturday in his state-of-the-union
address that Chechnya was an ''extreme example'' of the
government's failure to assert its authority over Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The territory has become a bridgehead for the expansion of
international terrorism,'' Putin said, adding that Russia's
military operation had helped avert the threat of a breakup of the
country.

commanders and decided to launch renewed attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to live,'' said Markha Saidova, 45, crossing the
frontier from Chechnya into the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan. ''Now that the terrorist acts have started, I have
decided to leave following Maskhadov's call.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels launched five suicide truck bomb attacks against
Russian positions July 2, killing at least 33 and wounding 84,
according to official figures. Russian forces responded by
arresting dozens of people and tightening security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said there had been television broadcasts by
Maskhadov that broke into the Russia's government channels in the
rebellious province, where Russian troops are trying to restore
Moscow's control in a military operation that began 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   State television officials in Chechnya said that rebels
occasionally appear on the airwaves using mobile, low-power
transmitters that cover small areas, the Interfax news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people an hour were crossing into Dagestan, through the
divided village of Gerzel, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Seda Gelayeva, from the town of Shali, said she was leaving
after hearing about Maskhadov's warnings of more fighting from a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not see Maskhadov's address on television, but a friend
of mine warned me,'' she said. ''It is not calm, it is dangerous
where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechens at the Gerzel crossing point reported Saturday that
Russian warplanes had been bombing suspected rebel hide-outs in the
mountainous southern regions on Vedeno and Shali and in the Argun
gorge.
</P>
<P>
   At the border, Russian troops were also allowing some people to
cross into Chechnya from Dagestan, if they held documents showing
they lived in the immediate area. Almost all were women, carrying
food to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops nominally control most of Chechnya, and are
chasing rebel bands in the southern mountains. But they remain
vulnerable to sniping, bombings and hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Gennady
Troshev, told NTV television Saturday that 30 people had been
detained in connection with the July 2 suicide bombing. Two had
confessed to their roles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was elected president in 1997 after leading rebel
fighters in driving out Russian troops in a 1994-96 war. But he no
longer exerts much control over other major guerrilla commanders.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin said Saturday in his state-of-the-union
address that Chechnya was an ''extreme example'' of the
government's failure to assert its authority over Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The territory has become a bridgehead for the expansion of
international terrorism,'' Putin said, adding that Russia's
military operation had helped avert the threat of a breakup of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Report: Perez Won't Visit Ill Mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie Perez, an outspoken AIDS activist, has
refused to visit her estranged mother who is dying of the disease,
according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported Friday that Lydia Perez has suffered
from AIDS for six years and is now near death.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified nurse as saying the actress
last visited her mother on New Year's Day, and quoted Lydia Perez
as saying her famous daughter's last visit before that was ''a
couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Rosie Perez responded: ''While it is
accurate to say she is not the woman who raised me and we are
somewhat estranged, I have always wished for her the best of health
and continue to offer my support in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a strong AIDS activist, I have pleaded with my mother to
accept my assistance through whatever connections I may have within
the AIDS community; she has refused it,'' the actress said. ''I
have also offered her financial assistance, which was accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who starred in ''Do the Right Thing'' and ''White Men
Can't Jump,'' raises money for AIDS research and counsels young
people to guard against HIV infection.

<HEADLINE> Eminem Gets Trouble from Home State  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Eminem's home state is giving the rapper's tour a
tough time.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, city officials pressured promoters to yank a video
from the ''Up in Smoke'' tour -- featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and
Eminem -- because the video shows partially nude women and depicts a
liquor-store holdup in which Snoop Dogg holds a robber and asks the
audience ''Should I shoot ... ?''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday, Auburn Hills police demanded the same thing and
threatened charges of contributing to the delinquency of minors if
the video wasn't dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the show, tour promoters went to court and won.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes you think you can edit content?'' the federal judge
asked city officials. ''Isn't that classic censorship and prior
restraint?''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn Hills police still ticketed Dr. Dre on a misdemeanor
charge of promotion of pornography. His lawyer said he was
considering suing.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, promoters didn't have time to challenge the city.
City officials viewed the video late Thursday, hours before the
show, and threatened to cut power to the stage and arrest
organizers if the video was shown.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit officials also balked at Eminem's plan to carry an
unclothed inflatable doll on stage. The rapper, already facing a
court appearance the next day on gun charges, gave in.
</P>
<P>
   ''He figured it wasn't worth the risk,'' Eminem lawyer Joel
Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Fights U.S. Migration Policies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people demonstrated Saturday
against American immigration policies as their government pressed
the United States for detailed information about recent arrivals of
Cuban migrants in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40,000 people attended the rally, led by Gen. Raul
Castro, Cuba's Defense Minister and Fidel Castro's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Although 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez returned to Cuba on June 28
following a protracted custody fight between his father and their
Miami relatives, the communist government has promised a rally in a
different provincial city every Saturday. The idea is to draw
attention to American migration and other policies Havana considers
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   A primary target is the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that
allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil to apply for permanent residency.
Havana maintains the law encourages Cubans, such as Elian's late
mother, to emigrate illegally to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and 10 others perished in the sea journey from
Cuba when their boat sank off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fight against the diabolical Cuban Adjustment Act
until it is no more than an unhappy memory,'' student speaker
Anabel Yanes said at the morning rally in the central town of
Yaguajal, about 250 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Havana has told Washington it wants more ''precise information''
about the case of two boatloads of illegal migrants who landed last
week in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Prensa Latina news service reported Friday night that the
Foreign Ministry sent its request in a diplomatic note delivered to
the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the American mission here.
</P>
<P>
   The first group was comprised of 25 people, including 10
children. It landed Wednesday in Marathon. All claimed to have been
smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
   The second group -- 25 men, 11 women and seven children -- was
spotted at sea by authorities Thursday. Their 32-foot boat rammed
the federal boat three times, the U.S. Border Patrol said. No
agents were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In that second case, two suspected smugglers jumped overboard
and were picked up by the Coast Guard. The smugglers' boat ran
aground near Islamorada and the Cuban migrants were apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The 68 migrants are likely to be allowed to stay in the United
States under the Cuban Adjustment Act because they made it to
shore. Under 1994 and 1995 migration accords between Cuba and the
United States, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriates virtually all
Cubans picked up on the high sea.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Cubans who attempt the sea journey always rises
over the summer, when sea conditions are optimal for crossing the
Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 1,205 Cubans have entered the United States
under the act.

<HEADLINE> Clinton spokesman: No tension over convention role  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Aides to Senate candidate Hillary
Rodham Clinton on Saturday sought to play down a report of tension
with Al Gore's presidential campaign over her speaking role at the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the vice president's convention and we're going to do
everything we can to make sure it goes as well as possible for him
and that's our goal,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified sources, said Saturday
that there was tension between the two camps. The report said the
vice president's side wanted the first lady to speak at the Monday
night opening of the convention, along with President Clinton, and
then basically clear out of town for the last three days in order
to leave the limelight to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said the Clinton camp wanted the first lady to speak on
Tuesday night when she would have more of the stage to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the timing of her speech was still being worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any tension between the camps, Wolfson said:
''Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the first lady have generally kept their distance on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson's comments came during Clinton's five-day tour across
upstate New York in her race against her Republican opponent, Rep.
Rick Lazio.

<HEADLINE> Shootout Investigated in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a case that could have serious
repercussions throughout Kosovo, U.N. police are investigating a
shootout in which a former Kosovo Liberation Army
commander-turned-politician was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj was taken to the U.S. military hospital at Camp
Bondsteel following Friday's shooting in the western village of
Streoce. Haradinaj's condition was stable, NATO spokesman Maj.
Scott Slaten said, and a statement from a hospital said he was
''resting comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildly conflicting versions of what happened to Haradinaj
circulated through Pristina, the capital of this southern Serbian
province. Police and the NATO-led peacekeeping command refused to
provide details, citing an ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Haradinaj's political party, the Alliance for the Future of
Kosovo, said initially that he and a relative were wounded by a
rocket-propelled grenade as they traveled early Friday near
Streoce. However, in an interview with Associated Press Television
News, a man allied with Haradinaj's political rivals claimed
Haradinaj and his followers attacked his home about 1 a.m. and that
the politician was wounded in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The man whose home allegedly was attacked is Sadik Musa, whose
family supports a party that opposes Haradinaj. Ethnic Albanian
political sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the
shooting started when an argument erupted during a meeting over the
fate of Musa's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Haradinaj was a leading commander in the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla army during Kosovo's long conflict with the Serb
government. Musa's brother, a member of a rival guerrilla unit, was
reportedly arrested by Haradinaj's troops during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   An international mission has been trying to keep the peace here
since NATO bombing forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
troops to withdraw last year. Milosevic had launched an 18-month
crackdown against separatists in the heavily ethnic Albanian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's incident is potentially explosive for both the
international mission and for Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leadership.
Haradinaj's party plans to contest local elections set for October.
</P>
<P>
   Musa claims the incident occurred because his family supports
the Democratic League of Kosovo, led by moderate Ibrahim Rugova. If
true, that raises concern about political violence in the run-up to
the election.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. police said no one had been arrested in the case as of
Saturday, and the few details released by the NATO-led Kosovo Force
raised more questions than they answered.
</P>
<P>
   A terse statement released Friday said Haradinaj was flown
aboard an Italian helicopter to Camp Bondsteel at 2:30 p.m. Friday
after he ''requested medical attention earlier in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation why, despite wounds, Haradinaj was
transported to the hospital about 13 hours after the shootout
reportedly occurred.

<HEADLINE> Potter Author 'Amazed' by Hoopla  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- J.K. Rowling couldn't find the exact word to
describe her reaction as her latest Harry Potter book went on sale
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm amazed -- think of a stronger word and double it,'' Rowling
said at King's Cross Station, where she boarded a special Hogwarts
Express to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   For the day, the platform was designated 9&AMP;frac34; -- after the starting
point for her fictional wizard's adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At 640 pages, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is twice
as long as earlier books.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the hardest so far to write -- it's a long book,'' she
said. ''It's the culmination of 10 years' work. There was a lot of
external pressure this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it was going to be longer than the third but I was
surprised at how long it was. That's how long it needed to be to
tell the story,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla Saturday was ''certainly not anything I ever
expected, far from it, I never dreamed of this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some London shops reported selling books at a rate of 100 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   At Waterstone's in Piccadilly, 1,200 copies of the children's
book were snapped up before lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably the busiest Saturday we have had since
Christmas,'' said duty manager Simon Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's huge. It's the fastest selling children's book I've ever
known. The kids just couldn't wait to get their hands on it,'' said
Becky Thomas, assistant manager at W H Smith.

<HEADLINE> Gay Pride Week Ends in Rome  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- World Pride 2000 ended with a flourish Saturday as
tens of thousands marched to the Colosseum in what amounted to a
victorious coming-out parade for Italy's gay community.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was jubilant as gays and their supporters from around
the world joined their Italian counterparts, tooting whistles and
bearing banners and signs proclaiming gay pride. ''Keep the church
out of the bedroom,'' one sign read.
</P>
<P>
   For some, flamboyant costumes were the order of the day, with
see-through fishnet outfits a favorite in the summer heat. But the
overwhelming majority -- people of all ages, colors and sexual
preferences -- simply strolled peacefully down Rome's broad avenues
to the ancient amphitheater, then to the Circus Maximus for a
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marchers was a soberly dressed provincial priest
marching in solidarity with an event the Vatican tried to have
canceled. ''I'm not the pope, but I'm here!'' the Rev. Vitaliano
Della Sala said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included young couples with baby strollers,
bare-breasted transsexuals in glittery wigs, animal rights
activists, a guy in a kilt on stilts, agnostics, bikers and
representative of unions and leftist political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated the crowd at 70,000, while the organizers
claimed more than 400,000 and state TV guessed it was as many as
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers turned triumphant as they reached the Colosseum, a
high-profile destination the city had balked at allowing until the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The constitution has won!'' shouted Italy's minister for equal
rights, Katia Bellilo, who was forced by Premier Giuliano Amato to
cancel her ministry's official sponsorship of World Pride. ''We are
a democratic country, we are an anti-fascist country, we are a
tolerant country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The parade marked the end of an international event opposed by
the Vatican, the Italian right, conservative Catholics and
neo-fascists. The opposition boomeranged and instead focused
attention to discrimination against gays.
</P>
<P>
   The first such event in Italy, World Pride became a watershed
for the gay community and one of the most highly politicized
international gay pride events in recent memory. It put gay issues
on the political agenda of a country where ''don't ask, don't
tell'' had long prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines gave unprecedented attention to gay
issues, much of it sympathetic. Politicians promised to push for
laws ending discrimination in the workplace and allowing
homosexuals to be blood and organ donors. Several prominent people,
including a Cabinet minister, revealed that they were gay or
bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   ''Against all expectation, the Vatican and the Roman Catholic
hierarchy suffered tactical and strategic defeats, largely of their
own construction,'' political scientist James Walston wrote in
Saturday's Italy Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's prime-time news featured an editorial
criticizing Amato for opposing World Pride, calling for
anti-discrimination laws and for the church to open a dialogue with
gays.
</P>
<P>
   The week passed without the confrontations the Vatican said it
feared between gays and religious pilgrims visiting Rome for the
Holy Year. The neo-fascists, outnumbered and demoralized, gave up
their counter-march to the Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's international organizers chose Rome for World
Pride 2000 in hopes of provoking a dialogue with the church. They
got one -- but at a far remove.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few dissident priests took part in the World Pride
roundtables and conferences. The Vatican newspaper, meanwhile, made
a point of reiterating the church's teaching that homosexual acts
are a sin. The church, wrote the Rev. Georges Cottier, the pope's
personal theologian, cannot accept the ''public and legal
recognition of homosexuals.''

<HEADLINE> Kids, parents snap up newest Harry Potter novel  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - Almost as if by magic, copies of the
latest book about bespectacled boy wizard Harry Potter began flying
off shelves at bookstores and other outlets across New Jersey early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just unbelievable!'' said Linda Waller, a clerk at The
Town Bookstore of Maplewood, one of many that stayed open late for
the 12:01 a.m. release of the series' fourth book, ''Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The store had about 65 children, with parents in tow, at a
Friday night Harry Potter party complete with costume and trivia
contests and other entertainment based on themes in the wildly
popular book series. One lucky customer got a Nimbus 2000, a
top-of-the-line magic broomstick, handmade by a store employee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had games and we had refreshments and at midnight we
started selling the books,'' Waller said Saturday afternoon as the
store's owner made her second trip of the day to a Pennsylvania
distributorship to get as many additional copies as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Town Bookstore, and a sister store by the same name in
Westfield, stayed open until 12:30 a.m. Saturday, then reopened an
hour early at 9 a.m., when more customers already were lined up
outside to snatch up copies of the book. Together, the stores sold
their first allotment of 250 copies each, nearly all of them
reserved in advance, and had nearly sold out another 50 each by
early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Princeton, Kyle Bremer dragged his mother to the Borders
bookstore early Saturday morning. The nine-year-old rushed back out
in a panic when told the store had already sold out its new Harry
Potter books, but that the supermarket across the street had three
copies left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get in the car! Drive! Drive!'' he begged his mother. ''Put
the pedal to the metal, Mommy!''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle jumped from the car while his mother was still parking
outside the Wegmans Food Market, having already rifled through her
purse and grabbed her American Express card. By the time Kyle's
frantic mother and 7 1/2-year-old sister Tori got inside the
market, he was waiting in the checkout line, amusing a clerk as he
tried to buy the book with the credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was heaven,'' he said afterward, because the upscale market
still had plenty of copies - and free doughnuts - at a big display
in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like these books a lot,'' said Kyle, noting each new edition
seemingly doubles in size.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't very interested in reading before Harry Potter came
along, but expects to finish the latest story in ''maybe a month at
maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Riley, the store's assistant manager, said a half-dozen
customers lined up for the new book before the market opened at 6
a.m. The fancy market - better known for its natural foods, gift
shop, cafe and team of chefs preparing gourmet meals - already had
a Harry Potter display in its book section, so Wegmans was able to
persuade publishers Scholastic Press to give it 400 copies,
''unheard of for a grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 copies, priced 30 percent below the $25.95 list
price, had been sold by noon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipate selling out by the end of the day, easy,'' said
Riley. ''We had about six or seven people buy the whole set
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who is halfway through the series' third book, gave Harry
Potter stickers and temporary tattoos to one young fan while they
discussed highlights of the series, such as the game of
''quidditch,'' in which Harry and the other characters chase a
winged ball while flying on their magic broomsticks.
</P>
<P>
   ''His godfather gives him the best broom there is - the Fire
Bolt,'' recounted 7-year-old Patrick Reven of Lawrenceville.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's mother had taken him to buy the book earlier Saturday,
at the Princeton Barnes and Noble. A Harry Potter fan for the past
year, Patrick was especially thrilled to also get one of the
store's Harry Potter giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got glasses!'' a set of thick plastic glasses just like the
orphan wizard's, Patrick said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a 30-something couple without children eyed the

<HEADLINE> With Quakes, Nicaraguans Rough It  </HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASAYA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Residents of this central Nicaraguan
province camped on the streets outside their homes Saturday,
terrorized by a string of earthquakes that have demolished homes
and left at least five dead.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller quakes continued Saturday and more are expected in the
coming days, said Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies.
They follow Thursday's magnitude 5.9 quake, which killed four
people, and a magnitude 5.2 temblor that killed a 4-year-old boy
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of earthquakes shook the country on Friday alone, and the
largest of them, centered about 30 miles west of the capital,
Managua, shattered scores of homes. The boy died in the town of La
Ceibita when a wall of his home collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported that about 2,000 people's homes were
damaged or destroyed by the nerve-shattering series of temblors. In
one of the worst-hit towns, Valle de la Laguna, 79 houses were
destroyed and 1,000 others damaged in Thursday's quake, said Lt.
Col. Mario Perez Cassar, the head of Nicaragua's civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people were injured when the quakes sent tiled roofs
raining down on the occupants of mainly stone and adobe houses in
the region. Many of the injured were being treated at Masaya's
Hilario Sanchez hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some towns were cut off when boulders tumbled down volcanic
slopes that surround the Apoyo lake near the quake's epicenter,
cutting off roadways. Army helicopters were used to ferry out the
injured.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a dozen towns and villages, residents afraid to go
back into their homes slept on the streets early Saturday even as
rain pelted down. Improvised shelters were set up in schools and in
tents on public property to house those afraid, or unable, to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't dare go back into our restaurant, because we're
afraid it could tumble down on top of us,'' said Dora Tellez, who
operates an eatery overlooking the Apoyo lake.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, 1972, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake shook Nicaragua,
destroying its capital and killing more than 10,000 people.

<HEADLINE> More than 1 million techno fans dance in Berlin streets  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) - More than 1 million people danced to the booming
beat of techno music Saturday at the annual Love Parade, turning
central Berlin into a sea of sweaty bodies, shaggy pink outfits and
shrill whistles.
</P>
<P>
   High-spirited youths from across Europe and beyond jammed the
route through the Tiergarten park for the world's biggest techno
rave street party, uniting behind its theme of music as a peaceful,
globe-spanning force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cool, it's outrageous and everyone is having a good
time,'' said Andrew Lin, a 21-year-old from New Jersey who dropped
in on the party during a European trip.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they fell short of their goal of attracting 1.7
million people to Berlin. But there was a simultaneous parade for
the first time in Leeds, England, to underline this year's motto of
''One World, One Love Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 truck-drawn floats pumped out pounding beats as
traffic ceded to a mass of bobbing orange- and green-haired youths,
often in the skimpiest attire, clustered around the landmark
Victory Column on the axis leading to the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter what country you come from,'' said Dutchman
Bern Schneidisch, 20. ''We all party.''
</P>
<P>
   With beer and party drugs fueling much of the action, the
''parade for respect, tolerance, communication between peoples and
love'' also had its usual glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they detained at least 22 people for selling illegal
drugs, mainly ecstasy. Medics helped some 600 of the ''ravers'' who
had collapsed by mid-evening - though the trend was lower than last
year because temperatures barely reached 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   During the Love Parade, a fire broke out in a subway train,
leaving about 30 passengers suffering from smoke inhalation. The
train with 350 people aboard had stopped at a station when the
smoky blaze broke out, sending passengers fleeing into the street.
Authorities were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   But the party mood prevailed as many ravers headed off for a
long night in Berlin's techno clubs after the parade.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the aftermath by cutting down on garbage, city
officials required drink sellers in the party zone to charge a
deposit for beverage cups for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one sign that the event has come a long way since
its 1989 debut as a public birthday party for Love Parade founder
Matthias Roeingh - better known as DJ Dr. Motte - and 150 friends
on western Berlin's main shopping boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Now the parade has corporate sponsors, pumps $125 million into
the local economy and has copyrighted its name.

<HEADLINE> Judge rules state is to blame in crash that killed family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A state judge has ruled that the state's
failure to repair a patch of Thruway is to blame for a crash that
left a family dead.
</P>
<P>
   One defense attorney in the case says the road hazard continues
today.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that dangerous ruts in the westbound lane of the
toll road near Lancaster were documented four years before the 1995
accident that killed Paul and Deborah LaMendola and two of their
four children. The judge said state officials knew about the
problem and failed to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the same dangerous conditions exist today near milepost
414.2, said a lawyer representing the LaMendolas' surviving
children and relatives who brought the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They still have done nothing with that road to correct the
problem, and the same thing could happen again because it's still a
dangerous situation,'' attorney Francis M. Letro told The Buffalo
News.
</P>
<P>
   A Thruway spokesman declined to comment on the claim Friday,
citing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice John M. Lane agreed with the
lawyers' contention that water had collected in the rutted
pavement, causing the LaMendola vehicle to hydroplane and strike a
disabled dump truck parked on the side of the Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who heard the case during a nine-day trial as a court of
claims judge last January, found the Thruway authority liable for
the Oct. 5, 1995 crash. A second trial will now set damages the
authority must pay.
</P>
<P>
   Lane ruled the authority's ''failure to inspect and maintain''
that section of road ''was the proximate cause of the accident that
devastated the LaMendola family.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed LaMendola, 39, a contractor; his wife, 35, an
interior decorator and United Way ambassador; their son Nicholas,
10; and daughter Chesa, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Orphaned by the crash were Lauren LaMendola, now 11, and Paul
Jr., now 10, who live with their late father's brother, Buffalo
attorney Lee LaMendola, and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Letro and attorneys Kathleen Martin and Joseph A. Fiorella sued
the Thruway on behalf of the three surviving LaMendola children,
including Paul LaMendola's daughter, Marie, 22, by his first
marriage, and Paul LaMendola's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Violette, an Albany spokesman for the state attorney
general's office, said the decision will be reviewed with Thruway
Authority officials before deciding on an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lane stressed that other westbound drivers who witnessed the
crash confirmed LaMendola was driving within the speed limit just
before the 5 p.m. accident.
</P>
<P>
   Lane found that the LaMendola car ''went out of control'' and
skidded into the truck because of hydroplaning that prevented
LaMendola from controlling his car's wheels to avoid the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses recalled the ''wall of water'' that shot over the roof
of the LaMendola vehicle just before the crash. The judge called
the conditions a deadly ''soup bowl.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Presummit Negotiations Set  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will begin
two days of presummit talks here on Sunday to soften up the tough
issues that must be resolved to conclude another historic Camp
David accord.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and senior U.S. mediator
Dennis B. Ross will assist in the talks, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators will discuss the agenda as well as the issues,
which include the future of Jerusalem and how much territory Israel
will transfer to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   As the host, though, President Clinton is expected to set the
pace at the summit, which he will open Tuesday morning at the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin mountains.
</P>
<P>
   So determined is the administration to limit disclosure of the
Camp David deliberations the Israeli and Palestinian delegations
were advised not to bring cellular telephones with them to the
secluded retreat.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat, chuckling, said it really did not make a
difference. He said his delegation had made a presummit visit to
the area and found the cellular telephones did not work among the
mountains of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat are due to arrive separately late Monday at Andrews Air
Force Base in Morningside, Md., and go directly to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat plans to bring a delegation of 50 to the summit,
including Palestinian leaders, lawyers, and technical staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the delegates will be representatives from the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a political faction that in
the past rejected peace efforts with Israel. Other factions from
the so-called Palestinian rejectionist camp declined Arafat's
invitation to accompany him to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Jerusalem looms as the potential deal-breaker, but
Barak is seeking a compromise that would involve changing the
boundaries of the city. The Palestinians' day-to-control of areas
of Jerusalem would be expanded to incorporate some Arab suburbs.
Israel, at the same time, would absorb some Jewish settlements on
the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat has his eye on east Jerusalem as the capital of a
Palestinian state. And the projected state would encompass
virtually the entire West Bank and Gaza, more territory than Barak
has indicated he would relinquish.

<HEADLINE> Ruckus Society leads activist training in preparation for GOP convention </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The line of 20 people in the basement of a
local meeting center were only pretending to blockade a hotel where
a National Rifle Association meeting was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Half the group linked arms and talked about the evils of guns.
The other half pushed, tried to slip through the human chain and by
the end were yelling insults about ''freaks with too much free
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is just one of the ways activist-trainer Ruckus
Society teaches people how to plan effective and media-friendly
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to prepare you to do something that can really
change the world,'' Ruckus trainer Jim Ace told about 20
participants Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the year after 40,000 people flooded Seattle for the World
Trade Organization meetings, civil activism has entered the public
spotlight in a way not seen since the 1960s. Thousands of college
students fill the ranks of demonstrations carrying colorful
puppets, pulling full-sized floats and forming human blockades in
front of police lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruckus Society is one of the big reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkley, Calif.-based group has trained more than 2,500
people since it was founded in 1995. Many people say Ruckus'
teaching clinics last summer were the reason protesters were so
organized in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ruckus plans at least two weekend-long sessions in Philadelphia
and Los Angeles before this August's conventions, and dozens of
Ruckus alumni are holding smaller sessions nearly every day the
rest of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people from around the Northeast attended this
weekend's session targeted to poor and minority people taking part
in demonstrations. Instead of teaching effective ways to stop
loggers or how to climb a billboard, the sessions focus on legal
rights, ways to react to police aggression and how to prepare
TV-ready sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   About half the participants were black or Asian, and all but a
handful were less than 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts that might cause a person to be targeted in everyday
civil life are the same facts that might target a person during a
protest: discrimination because of race, or sexual orientation or
gender,'' said Amadee Braxton, 29, with Philadelphia Direct Action
Group. ''We need to become better at (demonstrating).''
</P>
<P>
   In the hotel-blockade scenario, several activists said they felt
scared that their adversaries - who pretended to be NRA officials,
hotel workers and police officers - would respond with physical
violence or even use weapons. At one point, two women linking arms
fell backward onto plastic chairs when a pretend hotel worker
charged the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the '60s when we faced opposition, I never feared too much
physical response. Now, I'm worried someone might have a weapon,''
said Zak Abul-Raheem, 59, of Philadelphia. ''That's how much things
have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the exercises, trainers advised activists to be more
talkative - asking questions of the observers or explaining the
purpose of the blockade - to help avoid violence. Other ''calming''
techniques include smiling, relaxing your arms and shoulders and
holding your palms open, all of which help calm police and angry
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   When facing police, trainers recommending starting
conversations, asking officers' names and looking police in the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like if I have a personal connection with a person,
then that person is less likely to beat or mace me,'' said Ace, the
former program director for Ruckus who has been active in civil
disobedience and demonstrations for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruckus training session continues Sunday with lessons on
forming blockades and ways to sit or lock arms to avoid being hurt
while being arrested. An afternoon-long seminar is planned on
making puppets, planning street theater and constructing other
political art that is attracts attention and makes a statement.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro: No Independence Yet  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Montenegro's president on Saturday
restrained lawmakers bent on seeking independence from Yugoslavia,
suppressing a challenge to Slobodan Milosevic and signaling that
the tiny republic will not be goaded into a new war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's leader, Milo Djukanovic, demonstrated that he
controls independence forces in the smaller of Yugoslavia's
republics, halting an escalation of tensions that followed
constitutional amendments pushed by the government of Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   After an all-night debate, Montengrin lawmakers decided to
ignore the constitutional changes, but declined to go further and
call for a referendum on splitting with the Yugoslav federation.
Other republics of former Yugoslavia that have made that move found
themselves at war with Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those other republics, however, Montenegro under
Djukanovic has already moved away from Belgrade without violence,
winning many of the trappings of a sovereign state, such as a
separate currency, police force and virtual control of the nation's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, Serbia's information minister and Milosevic
ally, Aleksandar Vucic, threatened that the central government in
Belgrade will ''take measures to protect (Yugoslavia's)
constitutional order'' after Montenegro's parliament rejected the
amendments made in the federal capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Vucic was not specific, but said he was ''convinced that this
will happen.'' He also blasted Montenegro's defiance as ''legal
nonsense''
</P>
<P>
   With much to lose -- and little to immediately gain by such a
declaration -- Djukanovic stopped radical pro-independence lawmakers
from provoking Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Medojevic, an independent analyst based in Montenegro,
described the parliament's reaction as ''purely defensive'' and
described it as being part of a ''Gandhi-like struggle'' against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic is raising the stakes,'' Medojevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, for his part, may use higher tensions to continue to
blame Milosevic for the economic ills in Montenegro, Medojevic
said.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's prime minister Filip Vujanovic said he was pleased
that Montenegro ''has protected itself from the destructive federal
authorities.''

<HEADLINE> Parents of special ed students irate over school yearbook omission  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOWELL, N.J. (AP) - After seeing special education students at
Howell Middle School North slighted in the school yearbook for a
second straight year, their irate parents are trying to prevent a
repeat next year.
</P>
<P>
   The school's 2000 yearbook has no individual photos of nine
children in a class for developmentally delayed students, although
they are shown in a small class photo after the individual
eighth-grade pictures. Another special education student is not
pictured at all, with no explanation for the absence, and none of
the candid photos of students in informal activities include any
special education pupils.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the yearbook put individual photos of all the
special education students at the end, rather than alphabetically
among their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really an injustice. It's unfair to them,'' Kathy
DeSimone, the mother of a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome, told
The Asbury Park Press for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're kids like any other kids. The fact that it takes them
longer to learn or that they don't do things exactly the same way
doesn't mean they should be'' treated differently, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When her daughter, Ashley, first brought home the yearbook, they
scoured it for the eighth-grader's photo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kept checking and checking,'' DeSimone recalled. ''I
couldn't believe that they could have forgotten her.''
</P>
<P>
   The one group photo of special ed students in the yearbook ''was
like the typical, inappropriate picture you would have seen 20
years ago,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Angry parents complained to Meredith Markov, president of the
school's special-education parent advisory council, and brought the
issue up at a recent Board of Education meeting, saying they want
to prevent a similar insult next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many said that special education students, particularly the 288
in the district who spend the entire day in self-contained classes
with just one teacher, feel a greater need to fit in than other
students.
</P>
<P>
   Board president Valerie Rosenberg told them the district will
order a reprint with the students' individual photos included, but
it will only be distributed to the special ed students.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the student body will keep the yearbooks they
already have because most have collected classmates' signatures in
them.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Vonsover, the district's assistant superintendent for
special needs students, apologized for the mistake. But Rosenberg
said the cost of reprinting all the yearbooks would be better spent
on guest lecturers on diversity issues.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Denise Schwartz said she's concerned this could occur
a few years down the road, when her nine-year-old daughter moves
from special education classes at Aldrich Elementary School to the
middle school.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my perspective, my daughter is developmentally delayed
but not a vegetable,'' Schwartz told the newspaper. ''She has
feelings, she is very social, and she wants to be a part of the
school system, to be involved in things, to have friends. She is a
regular kid.''

<HEADLINE> Fourth Harry Potter book follows first three in fine form  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It just might be time to rethink that whole
''Harry Potter is a children's book'' theory. Letting an 8- or
9-year-old read the fourth volume in author J.K. Rowling's series
right before bedtime might not be the best way to insure untroubled
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there haven't been frightening events in the first
three books; the reader first meets the hero in ''Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone'' after his parents are murdered, and he comes
close to dying in ''The Chamber of Secrets.'' But ''Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire,'' (Scholastic, $25.95), marks a definite
transition as Rowling sets the stage for a future battle between
good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth in the seven-book series about a teen wizard and his
years at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, ''Goblet
of Fire'' has everything that made the first three Potter books so
successful - Rowling's absorbing blend of humor, charm, wit, and a
hefty dose of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But readers will be able to tell this is a different, darker,
story from the first page.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous books, Rowling started by talking about Harry
and his life with the mean and non-magical Dursleys, relatives who
took him in after the evil wizard Lord Voldemort killed his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the tale begins in another little town, where
residents still dwell on the horrible deaths of the Riddle family
50 years earlier. For those readers who remember, Riddle was Lord
Voldemort's original name.
</P>
<P>
   The wizard - in hiding since an earlier failed attempt to kill
Harry - makes his presence felt in the first pages of volume four.
</P>
<P>
   There's a plot afoot to bring Voldemort back to full power, one
that requires blood and death, preferably Harry's. An evil minion
at Hogwarts is in place to help the wizard get his hands on young
Potter when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, meanwhile, leaves the hateful Dursleys to join wizard
friend Ron Weasley and his family at the Quidditch World Cup finals
(think ballgame on broomsticks). After team Ireland wins the
wizarding sport, chaos breaks out when Voldemort's former
supporters make an appearance, signaling the dark lord's imminent
return.
</P>
<P>
   Once back at Hogwarts, Harry is entered in a dangerous magical
competition between his school and two other wizard schools. He
survives, but someone else doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   And Harry ends up temporarily in Voldemort's clutches, although
the evil wizard's plan doesn't go quite as he had hoped. The author
leaves us with a shadow of things to come, as Harry and those
around him take the first steps toward another showdown with the
suddenly more powerful Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Rowling has written a fast-paced story full of
surprises. Just when the traitor at Hogwarts seems obvious, it
turns out to be someone else. When death strikes, it's a shock.
Readers might think they know who's on what side and what they're
after, but don't be too sure. Rowling is really good at turning
smoking guns into red herrings.
</P>
<P>
   She also puts a wealth of detail into her writing. Some of those
details tie up loose ends. Want to know what happened to Oliver
Wood, Harry's Quidditch captain, after he finished Hogwarts? He's
been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Why have there
been explosions coming out of Fred and George Weasley's room for
years? They've been inventing things and they want to go into
business.
</P>
<P>
   Other details reflect how Harry and his friends are growing up.
In Professor Sprout's herbology class, they have to collect a
foul-smelling pus that turns out to be a great remedy for acne.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling also seeds plot points that are likely to flower in
future books. There's something happening between Ron and Hermione
Granger. Clumsy, timid Neville Longbottom's parents have been
cursed into insanity. Someone recommends Harry consider a career
hunting down evil wizards.
</P>
<P>
   There's almost too much detail, and sometimes it seems Rowling
was just squeezing everything in that she could. The death she
planned comes without warning, with no setup at all, and almost
everyone seems to have some kind of secret coming to light. But she
manages to keep a tight enough rein to keep the plot from
faltering.
</P>
<P>
   It can get a little overwhelming to keep track of all the little
tidbits she throws in. But Rowling has said book four is central to
the series, and that she had to get a lot of information into it to
make sure the rest of stories fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   So, how long until book five?

<HEADLINE> Police: Man kills, shoots at troopers, then commits suicide  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONEIDA, N.Y. (AP) - A man shot and killed a woman he suspected
of tipping off his estranged wife about his hide-out for his child,
then shot at troopers in a high-speed chase before apparently
killing himself, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   William Harvey Lapoint, 28, of Westmoreland, near Utica, died
Saturday following the night's violent journey from Utica to
western Madison County 32 miles away, state police said. State
police said Lapoint, in the midst of a custody dispute but not with
the child during the two-hour spree, is suspected in the homicide.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer shot his weapon when Lapoint aimed his rifle
under his chin and pulled the trigger, but the preliminary
investigation indicates the suspect died from his own shot,
according to state police.
</P>
<P>
   No one was available at Lapoint's home to comment by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the child, who is less than a year old, is staying
with family.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal began around 10 p.m. Friday when the body of Dana
Knapp, 20, was found on a Utica street. She was a friend of
Lapoint's wife and he may have been enraged that Knapp might have
revealed where he was hiding in Utica with his child, Trooper James
Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   Utica police later said the baby may only have been one issue at
work in the shooting. They were still interviewing people and would
not elaborate on possible other motives.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight, Trooper Edward Marecek stopped the red
Ford Mustang in Lenox, 27 miles west of Utica. Marecek said Lapoint
was driving erratically.
</P>
<P>
   As the trooper approached, he said Lapoint raised a rifle and
fired one round in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper returned fire and the suspect raced west along Route
5.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later Lapoint stopped the car and took several more
shots through his rear window.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper took cover. Lapoint fled again in the car.
</P>
<P>
   As Lapoint reached Chittenango, village police officers Matthew
Crowley and Andrew Costello headed him off, while Marecek closed in
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustang veered to a side road, then over a lawn and into the
woods where it bogged down, unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Lapoint ran with the rifle into the woods with the three police
officers chasing close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Lapoint was found sitting against a small tree with the
barrel of his weapon under his chin, threatening suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several commands to drop the weapon, Lapoint fired one
shot, killing himself instantly, troopers said. At that point, one
of the officers shot his gun.
</P>
<P>
   State police said Lapoint died of the single self-inflicted
shot.

<HEADLINE> Pottermania! 'Goblet of Fire' arrives to much fanfare  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It was the literary equivalent of the Beatles at
Shea Stadium as thousands upon thousands of kids queued up coast to
coast Saturday for the much-anticipated, wildly-hyped return of boy
wizard Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   In libraries and online, in bookstores big and small, copies of
''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' were flying out as fast as
they were found by readers anxious for the series' fourth
installment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the biggest night in book selling,'' said Joe
Lamere, assistant manager at the Book House in Albany, where
hundreds of copies were sold after the store opened at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   How desperate were Potter fans for the new book?
</P>
<P>
   The Shepherd family of Little Rock, Ark., came to Manhattan for
a vacation. But before they did any sightseeing, before they
boarded a boat for a cruise around the island, Linda Shepherd had
to take her 11-year-old son Wade to pick up his Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got 734 pages to read,'' an enthusiastic Wade said
outside the Barnes &AMP; Noble on Fifth Avenue. His mom added that Wade
couldn't wait to get started: ''He's crazed. He started reading it
on the line in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lines were not uncommon, particularly at the bookstores that
opened specially at midnight to serve anxious readers at $25.95 a
pop. The publisher tried to ensure that no one would be
disappointed: the first printing in the U.S. and England totaled a
staggering 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Goblet of Fire'' was guaranteed to make a fistful of dollars:
advance orders via two major Internet booksellers stood at more
than 700,000, making it a best-seller before a single book was
sold. FedEx Home Delivery, in a deal with Amazon.com, delivered a
quarter-million of the books Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the younger crowd, one Harvard Square bookstore in
Cambridge, Mass., laid out a spread of candy and jelly doughnuts.
Coffee was available for the parents who were dragged along.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Beatles were coming to town, we wouldn't have been more
excited,'' said Kelly Boler, who brought her 8-year-old son Simon
to the Curious George Goes to Wordsworth bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   For Simon, the bespectacled Harry is John, Paul, George and
Ringo rolled into one; he says that he's already read book two,
''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Bev Frank of Beulah, N.D., made the 140-mile roundtrip to
Bismarck in order to snag two copies of the book - one for her, and
one for her 9-year-old daughter Karsen. The road trip was her
second choice; Frank had wanted to stay overnight in a Bismarck
hotel rather than do it all in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have, but my husband is a farmer and I had to feed
him last night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clarita, Calif., 12-year-old Katie Guarente made a
stunning admission: she prefers the Potter books to - gasp! -
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're interesting and suspenseful,'' said Guarente, who was
one of more than 100 children standing in line at midnight when the
books went on sale at a local Border's bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   All the youthful bookbuyers there received a special treat - a
lightning bolt stamped on their forehead in honor of the scar
sported there by Harry Potter, the teen wizard whose adventures are
at the center of the books.
</P>
<P>
   The Pottermania was so great that it spread to the earlier books
by author J.K. Rowling. The first three Potter books held spots 2-4
on the Amazon.com best-seller list, and occupied three places on
The New York Times' top 15 best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowling's native England, the interest was every bit as
intense as across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has not been so much interest about a book release in
this store since Monica Lewinsky came to do her book signing,''
said Sam Watson, a bookstore manager in Newcastle upon Tyne.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't want to plunk down the cash for the new book
still wanted to get their hands on it. At the New York Public
Library, more than 900 copies were purchased and spread around the
five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of them were reserved long before ''Goblet of
Fire'' was put on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Pearson, a sixth-grader, waited more than two hours to get
his copy at a Barnes &AMP; Noble in Rockford, Ill. After getting his
copy, the youth said it would be no problem to finish the thick
tome.
</P>
<P>
   ''No problem,'' he said. ''If I just keep on reading, I could do
it in two days.''

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students, Hard-Liners Clash  </HEADLINE>
By HASSAN SARBAKHSHIAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Police fired bullets and tear gas Saturday
at rioters who smashed bus windows and shouted slogans against
Iran's Islamic government in the latest outburst of political
unrest here.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming ''death to the clerical government,'' the rioters
burned bundles of hard-line newspapers, shattered shop windows and
damaged the shutters on downtown businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and authorities blamed the eruption on hooligans
trying to stir up trouble after clashes between supporters and
opponents of democratic reforms. At least a dozen people were
injured and scores were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The violence started Saturday outside Tehran University during
demonstrations marking the first anniversary of a bloody police
raid on a university dormitory. It overshadowed student groups'
peaceful commemorations of the July 9, 1999, pre-dawn raid that
left one student dead and triggered the widest unrest since the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Office for Fostering Unity, the largest pro-reform student
group, was quick to disavow the rioters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The demonstrators were not students,'' the group said in a
statement. ''(Students) had nothing to do with this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble followed months of tension between pro-democracy
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami and rival hard-liners who
have closed down pro-reform newspapers and arrested presidential
allies in a bid to roll back the immensely popular reforms.
Students are among Khatami's strongest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday began with nonviolent gestures commemorating last
year's raid. Representatives of the Office for Fostering Unity
visited the homes of leading jailed reformers, writers and
political activists and gave their families flowers as a gesture of
solidarity, group member Nima Fateh told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our response to violence is offering flowers. We seek to
promote the culture of tolerance and respect for opposing views in
our society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But police arrested a number of students at a demonstration
outside the dormitory, saying the gathering took place without
Interior Ministry permission, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported. It gave no other details.
</P>
<P>
   Also, vigilantes attacked an earlier demonstration by students
chanting slogans in support of reform and political freedoms.
Witnesses said police did not intervene as the vigilantes punched
and kicked students in the face. No severe injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The situation degenerated later in the day. Hundreds of people,
many armed with rocks and chanting ''death to dictators,'' fought a
vicious battle against dozens of hard-line vigilantes armed with
rocks and chains. The vigilantes were chanting slogans supporting
hard-line supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many people were injured in fighting between
the two groups, but at least a dozen people were seen being driven
away in private cars, most with head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders fled the scene after police moved in and fired tear
gas, but some 5,000 people soon gathered to watch the brawl from
balconies, pedestrian bridges and sidewalks. Police fired into the
crowd when rioters turned on them.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tumult outside the Tehran University campus in the
capital's downtown district, it was not clear if police were firing
live ammunition or rubber bullets or whether anyone was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people soon began rampaging through area streets,
damaging shops and smashing bus windows. Witnesses saw dozens of
people arrested, thrown into police cars, vans and trucks that kept
pouring into the district. Forces of the Basij volunteer militia
that supports the hard-liners also roamed the streets on
motorcycles and in vans, wielding clubs and working alongside
police.
</P>
<P>
   State-run Tehran television, which is controlled by the
hard-liners, said the rioters were ''hooligans and agitators that
were dispersed by the police forces.'' Witnesses said the rioters
apparently were not students with specific political demands.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, thousands of riot police were roaming the
again-quiet streets around Tehran's Revolution Square. Shattered
glass, sticks and stones littered the area. In the chaos, someone
had lost a shoe in middle of a street.
</P>
<P>
   For months, President Khatami and his allies have appealed for
calm in the face of hard-line agitation that has included the
arrests of supporters. In remarks published Saturday, Khatami had
warned of a social ''explosion'' if criticism was quashed by force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong to expect the people to do as we tell them, and to
suppress them if they don't,'' he said in comments marking the
anniversary of the July 1999 raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''People must be permitted to speak freely and criticize their
government because if they are not allowed to so this, public
dissatisfaction will eventually lead to an explosion,'' Bahar
newspaper quoted Khatami as saying Thursday during a tour of
central Iran.

By The Associated Press	   Showers and thunderstorms streamed across the upper
Mississippi
Valley and Great Lakes on Saturday and also stretched along much of
the Gulf Coast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A band of stormy weather extended across central Minnesota and
through Wisconsin into Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest storms in Minnesota came during the night, with 4
to 8 inches of rain around the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. One man
drowned in suburban Eagan when high water in a ditch carried him
into a culvert, police said. Some roads were washed out and
basements were flooded.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Green Bay collected 3.88 inches of rain early in
the day, with estimates of 5 inches in the northeasterain part of the
state, and high wind knocked down trees in parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some homes have water in their basements and some cars stalled
in water on roads'' in Wisconsin's Brown County, sheriff's
dispatcher Jean Humlicek said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of those storms, scattered showers and some locally
heavy rain moved through North Dakota into northerain Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   Showers and storms also were possible during the night from
Illinois through Indiana and Ohio into Pennsylvania and New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm, humid air over the Gulf of Mexico helped kick off
thunderstorms during the afterainoon along the coast from the easterain
tip of Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama into much
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorms
warainings for parts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, radar showed scattered showers developing rapidly
during the afterainoon across wide sections of New Mexico, Arizona,
Utah and Colorado, in addition to parts of southerain Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a few showers were scattered over parts of easterain
New York and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A few light showers moved through parts of Oregon, easterain
Washington and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a
moraining low of 34 at Truckee, Calif., to a midday reading of 97 at
Hattiesburg, Miss. The combination of temperature and humidity made
it feel like 115 at Biloxi, Miss.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hostages Get Supplies  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Boxes of food, a birthday cake, and
other supplies were delivered Saturday to 20 mostly foreign
hostages who have been held by Muslim rebels for weeks in the dense
Philippine jungle, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There was still no indication of when leaders of the extremist
Abu Sayyaf group might free their captives. Some have been held as
long as 76 days.
</P>
<P>
   A German journalist and a group of 13 Christian evangelists were
the latest to be taken hostage. Local officials said Saturday that
the people who kidnapped Andreas Lorenz of Der Speigel magazine
have received $2,270 for his early release, but that report could
not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations led by Robert Aventajado, an aide of President
Joseph Estrada, were suspended early last month after the rebels
increased their demands, which include a ransom demand of $1
million for each of the 20 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf kidnapped three Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos
on April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort and brought them to Jolo
Island, part of Sulu province, about an hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   One Malaysian was released last month in what government
negotiators described as a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Wee Dee Ping, who helped win the release of the
Malaysian, said the remaining Malaysian hostages may be released
sooner than the others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government negotiations are ongoing to secure the release of
all the hostages, but there are indications the Malaysians could be
freed ahead of the others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Abdusakur Tan, governor of southern Sulu province,
sent a cake for German Marc Wallert, who was being held captive
along with his mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   The German and Malaysian governments also sent boxes of food,
including instant noodles, bottled water and canned goods, for the
captives.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential press secretary Ricardo Puno said Friday that the
hostages appeared to be relatively safe and faced no immediate
threats. But he said the dispute among the rebels over ransom
payments could delay the hostages' release because of the
difficulty of reaching a consensus in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more violent of two Muslim
rebel groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The larger rebel group, meanwhile, put up heavy resistance to
government troops advancing toward their headquarters in the
southern Philippines, the military said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrillas damaged two army tanks
with rocket-propelled grenades but suffered casualties Friday night
as the military cleared a network of bunkers and trenches near the
rebel stronghold, Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   One marine soldier was killed and 15 army troopers were wounded
late Friday before the guerrillas retreated toward Abubakar, a
sprawling 24,700-acre community with farms, schools and a rebel
military academy on the main southern Philippine island of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been bombarding the rebel stronghold with air
force bombers, helicopter gunships, and mortars since last week and
before the lapse of the June 30 deadline set by Estrada for
substantive progress in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has said he will extend the deadline for a peace deal
only if the rebels abandon their secessionist goal and halt
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group has rejected Estrada's condition and has not
recognized the deadline for the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Kids Line Up for 'Harry Potter'  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the literary equivalent of the Beatles at
Shea Stadium as thousands upon thousands of kids queued up coast to
coast Saturday for the much-anticipated, wildly hyped return of boy
wizard Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   In libraries and online, in bookstores big and small, copies of
''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' were flying out as fast as
they were found by readers anxious for the series' fourth
installment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the biggest night in book selling,'' said Joe
Lamere, assistant manager at the Book House in Albany, where
hundreds of copies were sold after the store opened at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   How desperate were Potter fans for the new book?
</P>
<P>
   The Shepherd family of Little Rock, Ark., came to Manhattan for
a vacation. But before they did any sightseeing, before they
boarded a boat for a cruise around the island, Linda Shepherd had
to take her 11-year-old son Wade to pick up his Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got 734 pages to read,'' an enthusiastic Wade said
outside the Barnes &AMP; Noble on Fifth Avenue. His mom added that Wade
couldn't wait to get started: ''He's crazed. He started reading it
on the line in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lines were not uncommon, particularly at the bookstores that
opened specially at midnight to serve anxious readers at $25.95 a
pop. The publisher tried to ensure that no one would be
disappointed: the first printing in the U.S. and England totaled a
staggering 5.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Goblet of Fire'' was guaranteed to make a fistful of dollars:
advance orders via two major Internet booksellers stood at more
than 700,000, making it a best-seller before a single book was
sold. FedEx Home Delivery, in a deal with Amazon.com, delivered a
quarter-million of the books Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the younger crowd, one bookstore in Harvard Square
in Cambridge, Mass., laid out a spread of candy and jelly
doughnuts. Coffee was available for the parents who were dragged
along.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Beatles were coming to town, we wouldn't have been more
excited,'' said Kelly Boler, who brought her 8-year-old son Simon
to the Curious George Goes to Wordsworth bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   For Simon, the bespectacled Harry is John, Paul, George and
Ringo rolled into one; he says that he's already read book two,
''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Bev Frank of Beulah, N.D., made the 140-mile roundtrip to
Bismarck in order to snag two copies of the book -- one for her, and
one for her 9-year-old daughter Karsen. The road trip was her
second choice; Frank had wanted to stay overnight in a Bismarck
hotel rather than do it all in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have, but my husband is a farmer and I had to feed
him last night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clarita, Calif., 12-year-old Katie Guarente made a
stunning admission: she prefers the Potter books to -- gasp! --
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're interesting and suspenseful,'' said Katie, who was one
of more than 100 children standing in line at midnight when the

</P>
<P>
   All the youthful bookbuyers there received a special treat -- a
lightning bolt stamped on their forehead in honor of the scar
sported there by Harry, the teen wizard whose adventures are at the
center of the books.
</P>
<P>
   The Pottermania was so great that it spread to the earlier books
by author J.K. Rowling. The first three Potter books held spots 2-4
on the Amazon.com best-seller list, and occupied three places on
The New York Times' top 15 best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowling's native England, the interest was every bit as
intense as across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has not been so much interest about a book release in
this store since Monica Lewinsky came to do her book signing,''
said Sam Watson, a bookstore manager in Newcastle upon Tyne.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't want to plunk down the cash for the new book

   ''No problem,'' he said. ''If I just keep on reading, I could do

<HEADLINE> Leftist Youths Protest Haider Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Far-right Austrian leader Joerg Haider came to a
seaside resort in northern Italy Saturday to be honored at the
town's city hall, sparking a clash between youths and police.
</P>
<P>
   Local communist politicians joined scores of youths in a march
to the town hall in Jesolo, Italian news agencies reported. Police
officers stood guard as Haider entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters began trying to knock down barriers set up around the
building and police responded by swinging their clubs, the AGI and
ANSA news agencies reported. Protesters also threw stones and dirt
at police, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
   A youth leader, Luca Casarini, was quoted as calling Haider's
visit ''a provocation organized by the mayor of Jesolo and by
reactionary forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the European Union has been imposing sanctions
against Austria because Haider's far-right Freedom Party is in the
Austrian government coalition. Haider has praised certain aspects
of Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Austria announced that it will hold a referendum to
show popular anger over the EU sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Renato Martin, who invited Haider to receive the keys to
City Hall, used to belong to the conservative, autonomy-seeking
Northern League political party. But he abandoned the League last
year in an apparent attempt to form an extreme right-wing movement,
according to local political observers.
</P>
<P>
   ANSA quoted the mayor as saying he was ''not embarrassed by the
invitation to Haider,'' but that ''the European countries that have
decided to impose sanctions against Austria should be embarrassed
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet minister for EU policy in Italy's center-left
government, Gianni Mattioli, called the mayor's invitation to
Haider a ''grave and mistaken act.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Haider dismissed the protest that greeted
him, saying ''I saw only a couple of communists who have nothing
else to do.'' He also brushed off recent French and German
proposals for Europe's future, calling them ''old-school models.''

<HEADLINE> Zedillo: Support Opposition Leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President Ernesto Zedillo made an
unprecedented call Saturday for Mexicans to close ranks and support
the incoming administration of opposition president-elect Vicente
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should support those who will assume the presidency on Dec.
1, because they should have the best conditions to start their
administration with efficiency and for the good of all,'' Zedillo
said during his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has had to weather criticism in his own party, which
ruled Mexico without interruption for 71 years, for quickly
recognizing Fox's victory in the July 2 elections. Activists of his
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, said he didn't do enough
to support his party and claimed he moved too quickly to
congratulate Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to shrug off the critics, saying ''of course the
competition was hard and passionately fought, but that's what
democracy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the opposition Democratic Revolution Party said
it would turn down Fox's offer to form an alliance or reach
strategic accords on how to transform the government after 71 years
of PRI rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to participate in the government of Vicente
Fox,'' the newspaper Reforma quoted party president Amalia Garcia
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Revolution, Mexico's largest leftist group, finished
a disappointing third in the presidential and congressional
elections. Fox has said he would like to choose his cabinet members
from among all political parties.
</P>
<P>
   During his radio address, Zedillo said he was proud of the role
he played in reforming Mexico's electoral laws to ensure more fair
balloting after decades in which the PRI won elections often marred
by accusations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased to have fulfilled this commitment and this duty
toward the cause of democratic advancement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo downplayed isolated street scuffles that broke out this
week in disputes over the vote results in several communities on
the outskirts of Mexico City, saying ''the country is working
normally, with a climate of social peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called on the PRI and other parties to work
constructively in the opposition, saying they had ''a great
responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Failed Missile Test Raises Doubts  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest setback for the Pentagon's missile
defense project -- its second failed intercept in three tries --
raised new doubt Saturday whether President Clinton will approve a
quick push for a national anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide in several weeks whether to
stick with the current Pentagon timetable of building a missile
defense for use as early as December 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we will have to take into account as we look
at the technical feasibility of this program,'' said P.J. Crowley,
a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president awaits the secretary's analysis and
recommendation and will make a decision on deployment later this
year,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The failure early Saturday suggests to some analysts that the
Pentagon needs more time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Logically, you do regroup after something like this and you
don't go forward with the existing schedule,'' said Anthony
Cordesman, a defense specialist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   A critic was blunter: ''It's hard to see how they can recommend
a deployment decision of a missile system that doesn't work,'' said
Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ''I think the test failure should and
will mean the president will not announce a deployment decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket took off as scheduled from Kwajalein Atoll at 12:40
a.m. EDT Saturday, about 21 minutes after the target missile was
launched 4,300 miles to the east at Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif. But the warhead-busting ''kill vehicle'' failed to separate
from the booster rocket, so it never activated the sensors it uses
to hunt down its target.
</P>
<P>
   The interceptor passed harmlessly by the target, and few of the
critical technologies of missile defense got put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the failure was so unexpected that the three-star
Air Force general in charge of the project told reporters minutes
afterward that it was ''not even on my list'' of potential
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   The blame was placed on the booster rocket, made by Lockheed
Martin Missiles &AMP; Space. It was supposed to release the kill
vehicle from atop its second stage exactly 2 minutes and 37 seconds
into flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said immediately after the test that the kill
vehicle did not release because the booster failed to send the
required electronic signal. An updated analysis later Saturday
cited an additional ''anomaly'' -- the rocket stage carrying the
kill vehicle began to ''tumble slowly'' after it made a flight
maneuver designed to keep the rocket within the confines of the
missile range.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said other features worked as expected, including
the high-speed computers commanding the mission, the in-flight
communications links and the target-tracking radars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government and industry program officials will conduct a
thorough review of the test data to determine the reason for the
anomalies and any other test objectives that were or were not
met,'' the Pentagon said. That will take at least several days.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million test was the third attempt at an intercept and
the second to fail. The first failure, in January, was blamed on
moisture inside the kill vehicle that prevented it from using
heat-seeking devices to ''see'' its target.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's test was plagued with problems from the start. The
launch from Vandenberg was delayed by two hours because engineers
discovered weak batteries powering the electronic signals that are
sent from the missile to ground controllers to pinpoint where the
anticipated intercept occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Mylar polyester balloon sent aloft with the
target missile from Vandenberg to act as a decoy never inflated,
Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish said. The Pentagon said Saturday that
preliminary indications showed that a prototype high-powered
''X-band'' radar on Kwajalein Atoll did distinguish between the
mock warhead and debris from the malfunctioning decoy.
</P>
<P>
   The decoy was meant to simulate the kind of evasive measures an
attacking country like North Korea might use to fool a U.S. missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, supporters of missile defense are expected
to view the outcome as evidence the Pentagon needs more money for a
project already expected to cost at least $36 billion over the
coming 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said in an interview Friday that
Congress has made its intent clear by requiring that a national
missile defense system be deployed as soon as technologically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deployment decision should be positive,'' Cochran said.
''We should make a decision to deploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he had no doubt that Congress would approve
spending what it takes to build the system.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee, favors
Clinton's approach of pursuing a limited defensive system that
would protect only the 50 U.S. states. His expected GOP rival,
George W. Bush, supports a broader, more ambitious system designed
protect the United States as well as its allies.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of construction, if approved by Clinton, would
be for the X-band radar on Shemya Island in the Aleutians. It would
be the most powerful tracking and detection radar in the world.
</P>
<P>
   An initial set of 20 missile interceptors -- to expand by 100 by
2007 -- would be based near Fairbanks, Alaska, with the command and
control center at Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the questions of cost and technical feasibility, a U.S.
president will have to decide yet another sticky question: whether
to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which
explicitly bans national missile defenses. That choice likely will
be left to Clinton's successor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried to get Russia to agree to
amend the treaty to allow missile defenses. So far, the Russians
have refused. China also strongly opposes the U.S. missile defense
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, top generals said the failure showed that the system
does not work and would never completely protect the United States.

<HEADLINE> Student wrestler gets weekend jail time in racial assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - One of three former Binghamton
University students charged with beating an Asian student in an
attack characterized as racial was sentenced to eight weekends in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Richetti, 19, of Waverly, pleaded guilty in June to
attempted assault. Along with the weekends in jail, which started
Friday night, he received probation and was ordered to pay half of
19-year-old John Lee's uninsured medical expenses which amounts to
$2,600. Lee suffered a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities initially charged Richetti and two other members of
the university's wrestling team with gang assault in an early
morning attack on four Asian-American students Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Richetti was expelled. A second accused wrestler, Chad Scott,
18, has been suspended from the school for two years and still
faces a trial on an assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   The third wrestler involved in the incident - Christopher
Taylor, 20, of Seaford, Long Island - pleaded guilty to disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American groups have demanded that the U.S. Department of
Justice look into whether the attack violated federal civil rights
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say racial slurs were shouted during the attack. A
lawyer for Richetti, though, said the attack was fueled by alcohol,
not race.

Iranian Students, Hard-Liners Clash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Police fired bullets and tear gas Saturday at rioters
who smashed bus windows and shouted slogans against Iran's Islamic government in
the latest outburst of political unrest here. Witnesses and authorities blamed
the eruption on hooligans trying to stir up trouble after clashes between
supporters and opponents of democratic reforms. At least a dozen people were
injured and scores were arrested. The trouble followed months of tension between
pro-democracy supporters of President Mohammad Khatami and rival hard-liners who
have closed down pro-reform newspapers and arrested presidential allies in a bid
to roll back popular reforms.

AIDS Increase in U.S. Feared

   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Roughly 5 million Americans have sex and drug
habits that put them at a high risk of catching AIDS, according to new U.S.
figures, and experts fear an upsurge of the disease after a decade of stability.
While AIDS infections in the United States have fallen dramatically since their
peak in the 1980s, public health officials worry that complacency about the
disease has caused backsliding, especially among young gay men, that could bring
AIDS roaring back. ''I'm scared by the trends we are starting to see,'' Dr.
Helene Gayle, AIDS chief at the U.S. Centers for disease Control and Prevention,
said today.

parade for Italy's gay community. Police estimated the crowd at 70,000, while
the organizers claimed more than 400,000 and state TV guessed it was as many as
200,000. The parade marked the end of an international event opposed by the
Vatican, the Italian right, conservative Catholics and neo-fascists. The
opposition boomeranged and instead focused attention to discrimination against

forces readied extensive defenses today on the eve of the Orange Order march in
Portadown that has already ignited widespread street violence in Northern
Ireland. A rural Anglican church in Drumcree, north of the predominantly
Protestant town, is the midway point for the Orangemen's annual parade --
officially to commemorate local losses in World War I, but in practice a
demonstration of Protestant dominance that many Catholics resent.

<HEADLINE> British Premier Appeals to Marchers  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and senior Protestant leaders appealed to hard-line marchers
to avoid violence Sunday when police and soldiers block them from
marching through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces readied extensive defenses Saturday on the eve
of the Orange Order march in Portadown that has inspired a week of
street clashes in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this year's parade will pass off smoothly and lawfully,
and appeal to you and all your colleagues to do everything possible
to avoid tension and violence,'' Blair wrote to Portadown's Orange
chiefs in a letter made public late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Three schools -- two Catholic, the other an integrated
institution where Catholic and Protestant children studied together
-- were damaged early Saturday by arsonists in predominantly
Protestant towns north of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   And Protestant militants resumed rioting in the area at night,
hijacking and burning at least four cars and tossing homemade
gasoline and nail bombs at police armored personnel carriers.
Police said they arrested four suspected rioters and seized crates
containing about 170 gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the province's most senior Protestant church and
political leaders appealed to the Orange Order, the province's
once-dominant Protestant fraternal group, to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not consider violent protest is in any way appropriate
before or after attendance at the worship of Almighty God,''
Archbishop Robin Eames, leader of the Anglican church in Ireland,
said in his most strongly worded letter to the Orangemen of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   A rural Anglican church in Drumcree, north of the predominantly
Protestant town, is the midway point for the Orangemen's annual
parade -- officially to commemorate local losses in World War I, but
in practice a demonstration of Protestant dominance that many
Catholics resent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 Catholic hard-liners in the Garvaghy Road district
have tried to block the parade as it returns to Portadown through
their area.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, protesting that they are being coerced by
supporters of the Irish Republican Army, have refused to go home
through Protestant areas or to negotiate directly with the
Catholics. That position, along with intense Catholic rioting in
1997, has compelled British authorities to bar Orangemen from
Garvaghy Road since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A standoff between Orange crowds and police in 1998 ended only
when three young Catholic brothers died in an arson attack in
another town. Last year Orangemen and their supporters remained
largely peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, notorious Protestant terrorists recently paroled
from prison under terms of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord
have been prominent at the Portadown standoff. To the exasperation
of many Protestants, including Orangemen outside Portadown, the
town's Orange leaders have welcomed their attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence of paramilitary involvement at Drumcree and the
disgraceful exhibition of masked men firing shots in Portadown has
removed further any integrity this protest may have had,'' Eames
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Portadown Orangemen said they intended to disperse
Sunday after handing police a letter of protest at the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   But they appealed for Orangemen across Northern Ireland to mount
four-hour street protests Monday as part of a continuing campaign
to force a march down Garvaghy Road -- and to disband a
government-appointed Parades Commission which sets restrictions on
controversial parades.
</P>
<P>
   Breandan MacCionnaith, the former IRA prisoner who leads the
Garvaghy Road protesters, predicted ''mayhem and possibly murder on
the streets ... as a result of the Orange Order's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant
party who rose to prominence by championing the Portadown
Orangemen's right to march in 1995, said the time had come for
direct talks between the Portadown factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be so much better if the (Portadown Orange) district
could represent itself directly rather than go through
go-betweens,'' said Trimble, an Orangeman who today leads Northern
Ireland's joint Protestant-Catholic administration -- a
power-sharing experiment that many Orangemen oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from past struggles to contain Protestant mobs at
Drumcree, police and army commanders have assembled an array of
defensive measures.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police in flame-retardant uniforms, soldiers in armored
personnel carriers, surveillance planes and helicopters with
searchlights, and high-powered water cannons on loan from Belgium
have been used in recent days to keep angry Orange crowds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, commander of the province's
predominantly Protestant police force, said his officers would
allow Orangemen to engage indefinitely in peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   He said nighttime violence -- the hijacking and burning of cars,
gasoline-bomb attacks on police, and stone-throwing at isolated
Catholic homes -- had eased since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is because people in the areas affected are
standing up and saying: 'We don't want this','' Flanagan said.

<HEADLINE> Man Kills Estranged Wife's Friend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONEIDA, N.Y. (AP) -- A man shot and killed a woman he suspected
of tipping off his estranged wife about where he had been living
with their child, then shot at troopers in a high-speed chase
before apparently killing himself, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The child, the focus of an ongoing custody dispute, wasn't with
him during the two-hour journey that began late Friday night,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   William Harvey Lapoint, 28, of Westmoreland died Saturday after
turning his gun on himself, state police said. He was suspected in
the death a few hours earlier of Dana Knapp, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp was a friend of Lapoint's wife and Lapoint may have
thought she had revealed where he had been hiding in Utica with the
child, Trooper James Simpson said. Her body was found late Friday
on a Utica street.
</P>
<P>
   Lapoint was about 30 miles west of Utica when he was stopped by
a state trooper just before midnight Friday for driving
erratically. As the officer approached his car, Lapoint fired with
a rifle, missing the officer, and then raced off, state police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers said that they found Lapoint in a wooded area where he
had abandoned his car and that as they approached him, he shot
fatally himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the child, who is less than a year old, is staying
with family.

<HEADLINE> Review: Potter Book in Fine Form  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' has
everything that made the first three Potter books so successful --
an absorbing blend of humor, charm, wit, and a hefty dose of
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But readers will be able to tell this is a different, darker
story from the first page of J.K. Rowling's new novel. It just
might be time to rethink that whole ''Harry Potter is a children's
book'' theory. Letting an 8- or 9-year-old read this right before
bedtime might not be the best way to ensure untroubled sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there haven't been frightening events in the first
three books. The reader first meets the hero in ''Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone'' after his parents are murdered, and he comes
close to dying in ''The Chamber of Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' (Scholastic,
$25.95), marks a definite transition as Rowling sets the stage for
a future battle between good and evil in this, the fourth offering
in a seven-book series about a teen wizard and his years at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous books, Rowling started by talking about Harry and
his life with the mean and non-magical Dursleys, relatives who took
him in after the evil wizard Lord Voldemort killed his parents.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the tale begins in another little town, where
residents still dwell on the horrible deaths of the Riddle family
50 years earlier. For those readers who remember, Riddle was Lord
Voldemort's original name.
</P>
<P>
   The wizard -- in hiding since an earlier failed attempt to kill
Harry -- makes his presence felt in the first pages of volume four.
</P>
<P>
   There's a plot afoot to bring Voldemort back to full power, one
that requires blood and death, preferably Harry's. An evil minion
at Hogwarts is in place to help the wizard get his hands on young
Potter when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, meanwhile, leaves the hateful Dursleys to join wizard
friend Ron Weasley and his family at the Quidditch World Cup finals
(think ballgame on broomsticks). After team Ireland wins the
wizarding sport, chaos breaks out when Voldemort's former
supporters make an appearance, signaling the dark lord's imminent
return.
</P>
<P>
   Once back at Hogwarts, Harry is entered in a dangerous magical
competition between his school and two other wizard schools. He
survives, but someone else doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   And Harry ends up temporarily in Voldemort's clutches, although
the evil wizard's plan doesn't go quite as he had hoped. The author
leaves us with a shadow of things to come, as Harry and those
around him take the first steps toward another showdown with the
suddenly more powerful Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Rowling has written a fast-paced story full of
surprises. Just when the traitor at Hogwarts seems obvious, it
turns out to be someone else. When death strikes, it's a shock.
Readers might think they know who's on what side and what they're
after, but don't be too sure. Rowling is really good at turning
smoking guns into red herrings.
</P>
<P>
   She also puts a wealth of detail into her writing. Some of those
details tie up loose ends. Want to know what happened to Oliver
Wood, Harry's Quidditch captain, after he finished Hogwarts? He's
been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Why have there
been explosions coming out of Fred and George Weasley's room for
years? They've been inventing things and they want to go into
business.
</P>
<P>
   Other details reflect how Harry and his friends are growing up.
In Professor Sprout's herbology class, they have to collect a
foul-smelling pus that turns out to be a great remedy for acne.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling also seeds plot points that are likely to flower in
future books. There's something happening between Ron and Hermione
Granger. Clumsy, timid Neville Longbottom's parents have been
cursed into insanity. Someone recommends Harry consider a career
hunting down evil wizards.
</P>
<P>
   There's almost too much detail, and sometimes it seems Rowling
was just squeezing everything in that she could. The death she
planned comes without warning, with no setup at all, and almost
everyone seems to have some kind of secret coming to light. But she
manages to keep a tight enough rein to keep the plot from
faltering.
</P>
<P>
   It can get a little overwhelming to keep track of all the little
tidbits she throws in. But Rowling has said book four is central to
the series, and that she had to get a lot of information into it to
make sure the rest of stories fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   So, how long until book five?

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Appeals to Marchers  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and senior Protestant leaders appealed to hard-line marchers
to avoid violence Sunday when police and soldiers block them from
marching through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces readied extensive defenses Saturday on the eve
of the Orange Order march in Portadown that has inspired a week of
street clashes in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this year's parade will pass off smoothly and lawfully,
and appeal to you and all your colleagues to do everything possible
to avoid tension and violence,'' Blair wrote to Portadown's Orange
chiefs in a letter made public late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Three schools -- two Catholic, the other an integrated
institution where Catholic and Protestant children studied together
-- were damaged early Saturday by arsonists in predominantly
Protestant towns north of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   And Protestant militants resumed rioting in the area at night,
hijacking and burning at least four cars and tossing homemade
gasoline and nail bombs at police armored personnel carriers.
Police said they arrested four suspected rioters and seized crates
containing about 170 gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the province's most senior Protestant church and
political leaders appealed to the Orange Order, the province's
once-dominant Protestant fraternal group, to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not consider violent protest is in any way appropriate
before or after attendance at the worship of Almighty God,''
Archbishop Robin Eames, leader of the Anglican church in Ireland,
said in his most strongly worded letter to the Orangemen of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   A rural Anglican church in Drumcree, north of the predominantly
Protestant town, is the midway point for the Orangemen's annual
parade -- officially to commemorate local losses in World War I, but
in practice a demonstration of Protestant dominance that many
Catholics resent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 Catholic hard-liners in the Garvaghy Road district
have tried to block the parade as it returns to Portadown through
their area.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, protesting that they are being coerced by
supporters of the Irish Republican Army, have refused to go home
through Protestant areas or to negotiate directly with the
Catholics. That position, along with intense Catholic rioting in
1997, has compelled British authorities to bar Orangemen from
Garvaghy Road since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A standoff between Orange crowds and police in 1998 ended only
when three young Catholic brothers died in an arson attack in
another town. Last year Orangemen and their supporters remained
largely peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, notorious Protestant terrorists recently paroled
from prison under terms of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord
have been prominent at the Portadown standoff. To the exasperation
of many Protestants, including Orangemen outside Portadown, the
town's Orange leaders have welcomed their attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence of paramilitary involvement at Drumcree and the
disgraceful exhibition of masked men firing shots in Portadown has
removed further any integrity this protest may have had,'' Eames
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Portadown Orangemen said they intended to disperse
Sunday after handing police a letter of protest at the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   But they appealed for Orangemen across Northern Ireland to mount
four-hour street protests Monday as part of a continuing campaign
to force a march down Garvaghy Road -- and to disband a
government-appointed Parades Commission which sets restrictions on
controversial parades.
</P>
<P>
   Breandan MacCionnaith, the former IRA prisoner who leads the
Garvaghy Road protesters, predicted ''mayhem and possibly murder on
the streets ... as a result of the Orange Order's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant
party who rose to prominence by championing the Portadown
Orangemen's right to march in 1995, said the time had come for
direct talks between the Portadown factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be so much better if the (Portadown Orange) district
could represent itself directly rather than go through
go-betweens,'' said Trimble, an Orangeman who today leads Northern
Ireland's joint Protestant-Catholic administration -- a
power-sharing experiment that many Orangemen oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from past struggles to contain Protestant mobs at
Drumcree, police and army commanders have assembled an array of
defensive measures.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police in flame-retardant uniforms, soldiers in armored
personnel carriers, surveillance planes and helicopters with
searchlights, and high-powered water cannons on loan from Belgium
have been used in recent days to keep angry Orange crowds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, commander of the province's
predominantly Protestant police force, said his officers would
allow Orangemen to engage indefinitely in peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   He said nighttime violence -- the hijacking and burning of cars,
gasoline-bomb attacks on police, and stone-throwing at isolated
Catholic homes -- had eased since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is because people in the areas affected are
standing up and saying: 'We don't want this','' Flanagan said.

<HEADLINE> 100 Techno Fans Detained in Berlin  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- More than 1 million people danced to the booming
beat of techno music Saturday at the annual Love Parade, turning
central Berlin into a sea of sweaty bodies, shaggy pink outfits and
shrill whistles.
</P>
<P>
   High-spirited youths from across Europe and beyond jammed the
route through the Tiergarten park for the world's biggest techno
rave street party, uniting behind its theme of music as a peaceful,
globe-spanning force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cool, it's outrageous and everyone is having a good
time,'' said Andrew Lin, a 21-year-old from New Jersey who dropped
in on the party during a European trip.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they fell short of their goal of attracting 1.7
million people to Berlin. But there was a simultaneous parade for
the first time in Leeds, England, to underline this year's motto of
''One World, One Love Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 truck-drawn floats pumped out pounding beats as
traffic ceded to a mass of bobbing orange- and green-haired youths,
often in the skimpiest attire, clustered around the landmark
Victory Column on the axis leading to the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter what country you come from,'' said Dutchman
Bern Schneidisch, 20. ''We all party.''
</P>
<P>
   With beer and party drugs fueling much of the action, the
''parade for respect, tolerance, communication between peoples and
love'' also had its usual glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they detained more than 100 people -- about a third
for selling drugs -- mainly ecstasy -- others for buying drugs, theft
or vandalism. Medics helped some 600 of the ''ravers'' who had
collapsed by mid-evening -- though the trend was lower than last
year because temperatures barely reached 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   During the Love Parade, a fire broke out in a subway train,
leaving about 30 passengers suffering from smoke inhalation. The
train with 350 people aboard had stopped at a station when the
smoky blaze broke out, sending passengers fleeing into the street.
Authorities were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   But the party mood prevailed as many ravers headed off for a
long night in Berlin's techno clubs after the parade.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the aftermath by cutting down on garbage, city
officials required drink sellers in the party zone to charge a
deposit for beverage cups for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one sign that the event has come a long way since
its 1989 debut as a public birthday party for Love Parade founder
Matthias Roeingh -- better known as DJ Dr. Motte -- and 150 friends
on western Berlin's main shopping boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Now the parade has corporate sponsors, pumps $125 million into
the local economy and has copyrighted its name.

<HEADLINE> Cops Foil Mexico Jail Escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police at a prison in southern Mexico caught
six workers building a fully lighted, 633-foot tunnel with a
ventilation system so that Colombian inmates could escape from the
steamy facility in comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Guards at the prison in Chetumal, on Mexico's Caribbean coast
near the border with Belize, at first thought they had uncovered a
primitive escape attempt, the Attorney General's office said late
Friday. Then they found it was anything but primitive.
</P>
<P>
   The men, apparently local construction workers, allegedly had
been hired by the Colombians to build a tunnel 5&AMP;frac12; feet high, and
2&AMP;frac12;
feet wide, complete with fans and electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not explain how the prisoners could afford to
hire the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Police caught the men July 1 as they worked on the tunnel
linking the prison to a nearby sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Police at first believed the workers themselves were fugitives,
but later charged them with aiding and abetting a prison escape.

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Police fired bullets and tear gas Saturday at rioters
who smashed bus windows and shouted slogans against Iran's Islamic government in
the latest outburst of political unrest here. Witnesses and authorities blamed
the eruption on hooligans trying to stir up trouble after clashes between
supporters and opponents of democratic reforms. At least a dozen people were
injured and scores were arrested. The trouble followed months of tension between
pro-democracy supporters of President Mohammad Khatami and rival hard-liners who
have closed down pro-reform newspapers and arrested presidential allies in a bid

his weekly radio address, broadcast live, Clinton said the Republicans'
alternative is ''a plan designed for those who make the drugs, not for the
seniors who need to take them.'' The president said the effort to pass a
prescription-benefit plan has bogged down in Congress because of a ''shameless,
scorched-earth campaign'' of television advertisements by the pharmaceutical

during Colonial times and was a defining part of its social life. The outline of
the theater was discovered three weeks ago by staff of the Colonial Williamsburg
historic site. Directors said the find fills one of the largest remaining gaps
in Colonial Williamsburg's re-creation of 18th-century life and could lead to a
reconstruction of multimillion-dollar proportions.

   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A sore left ankle forced Cleveland Indians third baseman
Travis Fryman out of the lineup and might force him to miss the All-Star game.
Fryman had to leave the Indians' 14-5 loss to the Cincinnati Reds today because
of pain and swelling in the ankle. X-rays found no fracture, but it's possible
he has a tiny crack in an ankle bone. Fryman will wait and see how it feels
tomorrow before deciding whether to pull out of the All-Star game in Atlanta.
Fryman was chosen as a backup for his fifth All-Star game.

<HEADLINE> WWII Memorial Fight Continues  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- To the surprise and anger of opponents, the
name and statements of a controversial Japanese American leader
have already been cast in stone on a national monument being built
to recognize Japanese Americans who fought in World War II or were
interned at desolate camps.
</P>
<P>
   During a slide presentation Saturday, board members of the
private foundation building the monument in Washington got to see
pictures of the work in progress, including one that showed a
concrete panel inscribed with the words of Mike Masaoka, who served
as field secretary for the Japanese American Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just found out today. I'm kind of blown away,'' said Rita
Takahashi, a San Francisco State professor of social work and one
of a handful of board members who have been leading a grassroots
fight to keep Masaoka's name and creed off the monument.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka, who died in 1991, has been criticized because during
the war he advocated complete cooperation with the government,
fought against redress and even suggested a suicide battalion of
Japanese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Masaoka also is seen as a hero for his postwar
accomplishments. He fought successfully for the 1952
Walter-McCarran Act that allowed immigrant Japanese to become
naturalized citizens, worked to win $1.2 billion in reparations for
camp survivors and helped found the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   For Takahashi and other opponents, however, the inscription of
Masaoka's words is another example of the disrespect they feel
they've been getting from a board they argue does not embody or
reflect the opinions of today's Japanese American population.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is among seven individuals whose quotations will appear
on the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, which is
scheduled to be dedicated Nov. 9. The monument will honor the
33,000 Japanese Americans who fought during the war, the 800 who
died, and tell the story of the120,000 forced from their homes into
inland camps.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the foundation's board voted 27-6 with one
abstention to include Masaoka's quotation: ''I am proud that I am
an American citizen of Japanese ancestry, for my very background
makes me appreciate more fully the wonderful advantages of this
nation. I believe in her institutions, ideals and traditions; I
glory in her heritage; I boast of her history; I trust in her
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the creed does not capture the rebellious spirit of
some Japanese Americans who lived through the war, and that Masaoko
is a reminder to many of decades worth of pain and anger, and not
worthy of the acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't oppose the expulsion of Japanese Americans on the
West Coast,'' Yerichi ''Kelly'' Kuwagama, a WWII sergeant, said
during a break in Saturday's daylong meeting. ''He told them they
should go peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi and others said they will keep up a letter-writing
campaign to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, and do whatever it
takes to get Masaoko and his remarks removed.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is the brother-in-law of Norm Mineta, a foundation
member who was recently nominated by President Clinton to become
the nation's 33rd Commerce Secretary and first Asian-American
cabinet member. Mineta, who was interned with his family for four
years during the war and went on to serve 20 years in Congress, did
not speak with reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka's backers note how widely respected and influential
Masaoko was in political circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only for what he did during World War II but after,'' said
board chairman and retired Rear Adm. Melvin H. Chiogioji. ''The
guns were facing us. And people were put in camps. They're blaming
him and none of it is his doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiogioji said the inscription plans were revised at least 11
times before the final version was approved by the board and the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that it was Masaoka, ironically, who first lobbied
Congress for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him,'' Chiogioji said.

<HEADLINE> Potential Vice Presidents Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- As the nation's governors gathered
Saturday to discuss America's role in the global economy, a matter
of raw ambition topped their hidden agenda: the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every state executive, Republican and Democrat alike,
sees the White House in his or her future. A handful actually has a
chance; Al Gore and George W. Bush are scanning statehouses for
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are 50 governors in attendance, there will 50
potential vice presidential candidates,'' joked Virginia Gov. James
Gilmore as the National Governors' Association opened its summer
meeting, a four-day blend of politics and policy.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Gilmore is one of several GOP state executives
thought to have an outside chance of landing a spot on the Bush
ticket, mentioned with the likes of Michigan's John Engler, Marc
Racicot of Montana, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Christie
Whitman of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials say Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Frank
Keating of Oklahoma are top-tier candidates, though each would
present Bush a political problem. George Pataki of New York, a
traditionally Democratic state, is also under consideration, senior
GOP officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, awarded the Bronze Star in Vietnam, would help Bush carry
this critical swing state. Oklahoma is expected to go Republican
with or without Keating, but the governor is Catholic, telegenic,
opposed to abortion and a former crime fighter -- all attractive
traits to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has just 18 Democratic governors from which
to choose, compared to 30 on the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis is a top contender to be Gore's
running mate, according to Democrats familiar with the vice
president's thinking. He would reinforce an image of seriousness
and readiness that Gore is trying to project, and could raise
millions of dollars for the party, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Party operatives also mention Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire,
James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, Tom Vilsack of Iowa and Gary
Locke of Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   But sources familiar with the deliberations say Shaheen may be
the only Democratic governor other than Davis with a serious shot.
Her stature would skyrocket if Bush had a woman nominated at his
convention, which begins July 31 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's convention in Los Angeles opens two weeks after the GOP
gathering. Leading Democrats are urging the vice president to
announce his selection a day or so after the GOP convention closes,
saying the tactic would rob Bush of some of the traditional
post-convention ''bounce'' in public polls.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota said Bush has told
him he wants a running mate who could ''run the whole ball of wax''
if something happened to the president. ''If that's the case, a
governor is the best pick because we're leaders of the executive
branch,'' Schafer said. ''While congressmen are policy-makers,
we're policy-deliverers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a two-term Texas governor with no legislative experience,
may opt instead for a running mate who fills a void on his resume.
Several lawmakers are said to be under consideration, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sens. Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, who could
give Gore fits in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Vietnam War veteran and an
ally of former Bush primary rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the budget expert who waged a
colorful but brief challenge to Bush and has been busy campaigning
for the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, though conservatives have
questioned his tax record.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida is under
serious consideration because polls show that Bush's brother, Jeb,
who is governor, has not sewn up the state for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes that putting Graham on the ticket could help him
win the state's 25 electoral votes -- dealing Bush a major blow -- or
at least force the Texan to spend more money than he planned in
Florida, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana would help Gore in the Midwest and is
thought by Gore to be an attractive prospect, sources say. Women's
groups, however, have questioned his commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt could help mend Gore's rift
with labor, but has said he is committed to winning back the House
and becoming speaker. Still, senior Democrats don't rule out the
possibility that the lawmaker from Missouri, a battleground state,
could find his way to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Richard Durbin of Illinois,
Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein of California are
also under consideration. Former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell is a top-tier prospect, and Gore aides outside the search
process are still touting former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Vanquished primary rival Bill Bradley won't get a spot on the
ticket, sources close to Gore say.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, head of Gore's search team, has asked
Democrats about Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Fannie
Mae chairman Franklin Raines, both of whom are black.
</P>
<P>
   Among the GOP governors, Keating's shoot-from-the-lip reputation
could be a problem. He angered some Bush aides during the GOP
primaries for comments attributed to him that seemed less than
loyal.
</P>
<P>
   At the governors meeting, Keating was in a light-hearted mood as
he dropped in for only a few hours on Saturday to meet privately
with his GOP peers. ''The only person more surprised than I by the
Frank Keating boomlet is George W. Bush,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge is opposed by powerful anti-abortion forces. Bush's allies
in the religious conservative community say the party's right wing
could stomach Ridge's abortion-rights views to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead in polls, Bush might not want to take the risk.

<HEADLINE> Ex-cop is dead after domestic argument and standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERKELEY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - After holding authorities at bay
for more than eight hours, a former Hudson County Sheriff's officer
was found dead inside his home.
</P>
<P>
   The siege, which ended at 11:30 p.m. on Friday when Paul Bourke,
40, was found dead inside, began about 3 p.m. when neighbors became
alarmed by a loud fight between Bourke and his wife and called
police. She escaped, but he barricaded himself inside.
</P>
<P>
   Officers from several nearby departments surrounded the house
and evacuated occupants of a half-dozen neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, after trying unsuccessfully to negotiate with
Bourke, police went inside the house and found him dead on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no apparent sign of a gunshot wound,'' Executive
Assistant Ocean County Prosecutor Gregory J. Sakowicz told The
Asbury Park Press of Neptune for Sunday's editions, adding that
when authorities entered the house, Bourke had been dead for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Sakowicz said an autopsy was scheduled Sunday at Kimball Medical
Center in Lakewood.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Bourke, a motorcycle enthusiast, was a former
Hudson County Sheriff's officer retired on disability. He had also
served as a corrections officer at Hudson County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the standoff, a man arrived on a motorcycle and
identified himself as a former co-worker and friend of Bourke.
Police allowed him to enter the cordoned-off area, but it was
unclear whether he was able to speak with Bourke.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Intensifies Diplomacy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jordan (AP) -- Jordan intensified its Mideast diplomacy Saturday,
meeting with Palestinian and Israeli leaders ahead of their
upcoming summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak arrived in Jordan late
Saturday and immediately went into talks with King Abdullah at the
Barakeh Palace on the outskirts of Amman. The media were not
allowed access.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Embassy spokesman Roey Gilad would say only that Barak
would brief Abdullah on his position regarding peace with the
Palestinians ahead of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also was scheduled to hold talks with President Hosni
Mubarak in Egypt on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib held talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza. The visit came hours
after Arafat dispatched a senior envoy to brief King Abdullah on
sticking points blocking a final peace accord with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Khatib told Jordan Television he had handed Arafat a letter from
Abdullah reiterating support for the Palestinians, including their
right to an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed that Jordan has ''vital interests'' in
Palestinian-Israeli final status talks especially on the fate of
refugees. Jordan is home to 1.5 million Palestinians displaced in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arafat flew to Cairo for discussions with Mubarak on
the summit. Before Arafat's arrival, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa warned that ''time is too precious to be wasted in view of
everybody's concern to reach a Palestinian-Israeli peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit, hosted by President Clinton, opens Tuesday at Camp
David, the same retreat where Israel and Egypt reached a peace
treaty in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Wide gaps still divide the Palestinians and the Israelis, who
differ over the fate of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, refugees
and the final size and shape of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is seeking to maintain the legacy of his late father,
King Hussein, in playing an active role in Middle East politics. He
has vowed to protect the peace treaty Hussein reached with Israel
in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Tie At State Farm Classic  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- The Iron Man, an Irishman and a fisherman
are tied atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the State Farm
Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Quigley, playing in his record 98th straight tournament,
shot a 5-under-par 67 Saturday to tie defending champion Christy
O'Connor and Leonard Thompson atop the leaderboard after two rounds
of the $1.35 million tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley made four birdies during a bogey-free front nine and
finished with six birdies for an 8-under 136. Although he's known
primarily for his Iron Man streak, the former club pro has won four
tournaments and nearly $4 million since joining the tour in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dana is tournament tested. He's not going to back off,'' said
Hubert Green, who shot a 67 to finish the round in a four-way tie
at 138. ''He doesn't have reverse in his game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, a native of Ireland, shot a 70 and Thompson had a 69.
All three leaders birdied 18.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was 1 over for the day before getting birdies on the
final three holes. Thompson, whose favorite hobby is fishing, had
his only bogey when his short par putt on No. 4 lipped the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nelson, ranked third on the money list, shot a 67 and is
tied for third at 138 with Walter Hall, Green and Jim Albus.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson got into contention with a three-birdie run beginning at
No. 3, then added three more birdies over the final five holes,
sinking putts of 30, 15 and 25 feet in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those days where I missed some I should have
made and made some I should have missed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Trevino, edged in the Super Seniors competition by Albus,
shot a 5-under 67 for a 139. He started the round eight shots
behind Jose Marie Canizares, but had six birdies while Canizares
fell out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think I had a shot after what (Canizares) did
yesterday,'' Trevino said. ''Now, if I shoot a hot round, I've got
an outside chance of winning. That's a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Canizares, coming off a course-record 64, had two double bogeys
and faded to 139 after shooting a 75.
</P>
<P>
   After opening with four straight pars, Canizares ran into
trouble on the par-5 fifth hole. His tee shot veered right and
landed behind three large rocks and a tree. He escaped that jam,
but his third shot cleared the green. He chipped 25 feet past the
pin, then passed the hole by three feet before missing again for a
double bogey that left him at 6 under.
</P>
<P>
   He tumbled farther down the leaderboard with a double bogey at
11.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's 5-foot par putt on No. 4 spun out of the cup, but he
rebounded with a 10-foot birdie putt on No. 5. Thompson and
O'Connor both birdied 9, leaving them tied with Canizares one
stroke behind Quigley at the turn.

<HEADLINE> WWII Memorial Fight Continues  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- To the surprise and anger of opponents, the
name and statements of a controversial Japanese American leader
have already been cast in stone on a national monument being built
to recognize Japanese Americans who fought in World War II or were
interned at desolate camps.
</P>
<P>
   During a slide presentation Saturday, board members of the
private foundation building the monument in Washington got to see
pictures of the work in progress, including one that showed a
concrete panel inscribed with the words of Mike Masaoka, who served
as field secretary for the Japanese American Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just found out today. I'm kind of blown away,'' said Rita
Takahashi, a San Francisco State professor of social work and one
of a handful of board members who have been leading a grassroots
fight to keep Masaoka's name and creed off the monument.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka, who died in 1991, has been criticized because during
the war he advocated complete cooperation with the government,
fought against redress and even suggested a suicide battalion of
Japanese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Masaoka also is seen as a hero for his postwar
accomplishments. He fought successfully for the 1952
Walter-McCarran Act that allowed immigrant Japanese to become
naturalized citizens, worked to win $1.2 billion in reparations for
camp survivors and helped found the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   For Takahashi and other opponents, however, the inscription of
Masaoka's words is another example of the disrespect they feel
they've been getting from a board they argue does not embody or
reflect the opinions of today's Japanese American population.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is among seven individuals whose quotations will appear
on the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, which is
scheduled to be dedicated Nov. 9. The monument will honor the
33,000 Japanese Americans who fought during the war, the 800 who
died, and tell the story of the120,000 forced from their homes into
inland camps.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the foundation's board voted 27-6 with one
abstention to include Masaoka's quotation: ''I am proud that I am
an American citizen of Japanese ancestry, for my very background
makes me appreciate more fully the wonderful advantages of this
nation. I believe in her institutions, ideals and traditions; I
glory in her heritage; I boast of her history; I trust in her
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the creed does not capture the rebellious spirit of
some Japanese Americans who lived through the war, and that Masaoka
is a reminder to many of decades worth of pain and anger, and not
worthy of the acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't oppose the expulsion of Japanese Americans on the
West Coast,'' Yerichi ''Kelly'' Kuwagama, a WWII sergeant, said
during a break in Saturday's daylong meeting. ''He told them they
should go peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi and others said they will keep up a letter-writing
campaign to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, and do whatever it
takes to get Masaoka and his remarks removed.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is the brother-in-law of Norm Mineta, a foundation
member who was recently nominated by President Clinton to become
the nation's 33rd Commerce Secretary and first Asian-American
cabinet member. Mineta, who was interned with his family for four
years during the war and went on to serve 20 years in Congress, did
not speak with reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka's backers note how widely respected and influential
Masaoka was in political circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only for what he did during World War II but after,'' said
board chairman and retired Rear Adm. Melvin H. Chiogioji. ''The
guns were facing us. And people were put in camps. They're blaming
him and none of it is his doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiogioji said the inscription plans were revised at least 11
times before the final version was approved by the board and the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that it was Masaoka, ironically, who first lobbied
Congress for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him,'' Chiogioji said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Action on Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused the pharmaceutical
industry Saturday of unleashing ''a shameless, scorched-earth
campaign'' aimed at killing his prescription drug plan for older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to act on his proposal, saying they
should reject election-year maneuvering and the appeals of
''reckless special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, broadcast live, Clinton said his
proposal to help senior citizens afford prescription drugs is
bogging down in Congress despite what he said was great support for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''One reason for this is clear,'' Clinton said. ''The
pharmaceutical industry has unleashed a shameless, scorched-earth
campaign to thwart the will of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said one ''industry-funded group calling itself Citizens
for Better Medicare'' has saturated the airwaves with
advertisements targeting the White House plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just this week we learned that drug companies have enlisted
more than 300 hard-gun lobbyists -- more than one for every two
members of Congress -- and paid them to do everything in their power
to block all meaningful reforms,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drug industry has already spent a combined $236
million on the advertising and lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the pharmaceutical industry is pushing a private
insurance program to deal with prescription needs but that the
insurance industry says such a plan won't work and they won't take
part.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to give it to the insurance companies; they have been
honest here,'' Clinton said. ''They have said the Republican plan
won't work. It's a plan designed for those who make the drugs, not
for the seniors who need to take them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So today I call on Congress to reject that approach and the
reckless campaign of narrow special interests and act together in
the public interest,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also renewed a standing offer made last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said that if Congress will agree to pass a plan that offers
affordable Medicare prescription drug coverage to all seniors and
people with disabilities, while protecting our hard-won fiscal
discipline, then I will sign a marriage penalty (tax) relief law of
equal size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislation passed by the House in late June would
extend drug coverage through government-subsidized policies sold by
private insurers. An alternative proposed by Clinton and supported
by most congressional Democrats would establish a standard,
government-run Medicare benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement responding to Clinton's radio address, Alan F.
Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America, said Clinton's plan ''will inevitably lead to
government bureaucrats deciding which medicines will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think those decisions should be made by doctors and
patients,'' Holmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare, on its website, said Clinton's
plan would force millions of seniors out of their private
prescription drug plans and into the government program.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for compromise this year are uncertain, but polls show
the issue is likely to be a priority for older voters in this
fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Clinton's plan would cost retirees about $312 a
year in premiums to get 50 percent off the cost of their
prescriptions covered until they collected a maximum of $1,000 in
basic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, typical drug coverage under the GOP plan would cost
beneficiaries around $720 per year in premiums and deductibles to
get 50 percent of their prescriptions paid for until they collected
a maximum of $1,050 in basic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic coverage to pay all drug costs would kick in if, in
a single year, a retiree's drug spending topped $4,000 under
Clinton's plan and $6,000 under the GOP plan.

<HEADLINE> Governors Open Meeting in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By PETER JACKSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- The National Governors' Association
opened its annual meeting Saturday with a burst of presidential
politics as Republican governors criticized Vice President Al Gore
as a promoter of ''the politics of false choice'' and Democrats
labeled Texas Gov. George W. Bush's record as ''less than
stellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore, the apparent Republican and Democratic
nominees for president, planned to attend the NGA meeting. But
there was no shortage of surrogates as the governors split into
partisan groups and held back-to-back news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who hold 30 governorships compared to 18 for
the Democrats, accused President Clinton and Gore of obstructing
GOP initiatives on jobs, health care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could we expect anything else from a Gore
administration?'' asked Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who is mentioned frequently as a
possible Bush running mate, faulted the Democratic administration
for politicizing the debate over prescription-drug coverage and
portraying it as an ''us versus them'' battle that pits senior
citizens against drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge called the strategy ''the politics of division and the
politics of false choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic governors huddled privately with Bill Daley, Gore's
new campaign manager, at a farm on the outskirts of State College,
before meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leadership is not a birthright,'' said Alabama Gov. Don
Siegelman. ''Just because you landed on third base doesn't mean you
can claim a triple.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris N. Glendening said Bush should not share
credit for the successes of Republican administrations in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot transfer accomplishments of some governors to a
less than stellar performance by the Republican nominee,''
Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, presidential politics also dominated the NGA's
opening news conference, where Ridge, Glendening and Gov. Michael
O. Leavitt of Utah tried to stress the more mundane policy concerns
that dominate the agenda for the 3&AMP;frac12;-day meeting. President Clinton
is scheduled to address the governors on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the issues that matter,'' said Glendening, citing
the increasing linkage between technology and economic growth, and
the importance of education in preparing young people for rapidly
changing future.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, a Democrat, will succeed Leavitt as NGA chairman
when the meeting concludes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the NGA opener, the focus was on Ridge and the ongoing search
for a running mate by his friend Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, who is midway through his second four-year term as
governor, offered stock responses. Yet he was hardly uninterested.
His staff offered reporters a CD-ROM containing 35 photographs of
Ridge from childhood through his Army years in Vietnam to his
inaugurations as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he'd like to run with Bush on the national ticket,
Ridge replied, ''I will work with Governor Bush in some capacity,
one way or the other after he is elected president of the United
States, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers feel Ridge, who supports the right of a woman to
choose to terminate her pregnancy, would hurt the GOP ticket by
driving away many conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge acknowledged that his party's platform is solidly
anti-abortion, but noted that plank has neither prevented
Republicans with conflicting views from getting elected or from
working together.
</P>
<P>
   Several governors have been mentioned as possible running mates
for both Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 5, Fusion 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Cobi Jones scored two of Los
Angeles' four first-period goals and the Galaxy held on for 5-3
victory over the Miami Fusion on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones scored twice within a minute in the first half, as the
Galaxy repeatedly ran past the Fusion defense to easy scoring
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Hernandez opened the scoring with a successful free kick
into the upper right-hand corner of the Miami goal at the 19th
minute. Los Angeles' other goals came as a result of breakdowns in
the Fusion defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Cienfuegos dribbled uncontested deep into the Fusion
goal area and found an open Sebastien Vorbe, who drilled in a shot
past Miami goalkeeper Jeff Cassar in the 31st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jones intercepted a pass inside the Los Angeles goal area and
was unmarked as he dribbled 50 yards to just outside the Fusion
penalty box, where he successfully converted on a 26-yard shot at
the 38th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jones barely had time to rest from his long run when Hernandez
fed him with a pass from the left wing and Jones drilled a shot
into the Miami goal at the 39th minute, giving the Galaxy a 4-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams scored Miami's first goal at the 66th minute. Five
minutes later, Jay Heaps took Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman's deflection off a shot by Diego Serna and scored inside
the 6-yard box to cut Miami's deficit to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Marshall's header off a crossing pass from Henry
Gutierrez beat Hartman at the 86th minute and pulled Miami within a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   However, one minute later, Galaxy reserve midfielder Peter
Vagenas scored to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the match, Miami traded forward Eric Wynalda to the New
England Revolution in exchange for defender/midfielder Ivan
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, the all-time leading scorer for the U.S. national team,
leaves Miami after an injury-plagued season. Since joining the
Fusion late in 1999, Wynalda scored three goals and had two assists
in 12 regular season games.

<HEADLINE> Co-Medalists Advance in Links Final  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABERDEEN, N.C. (AP) -- Russamee Gulyanamitta's most difficult
task this week in the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links
Championship has been getting her return flight changed.
</P>
<P>
   Gulyanamitta originally scheduled her trip back to Costa Mesa,
Calif., for Friday because she wasn't confident of going deep into
match-play competition in the USGA championship for players who
aren't members of private clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Her plans changed Saturday. Gulyanamitta rolled over Jamie
Vannoy of Carrollton, Texas, 5 and 4 at Legacy Golf Links to
advance to the title match against Catherine Cartwright, a
17-year-old rising high school senior from Bonita Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright beat Cindy Lee of Tempe, Ariz., 4 and 3 and will meet
Gulyanamitta in Sunday's 18-hole final. Both players were
co-medalists in 36 holes of stroke-play qualifying, shooting
4-under 140s.
</P>
<P>
   Gulyanamitta, playing in her first tournament in the United
States since arriving from Thailand a month ago, took control of
her match during the middle holes, carding four birdies in a
five-hole stretch.
</P>
<P>
   She rolled in a 30-putt on No. 10 and birdied all three of the
par 3s she played in the semis. In two rounds of stroke play and
five matches this week, Gulyanamitta has yet to three-putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to putt it close to the hole and it just went in,''
Gulyanamitta said of the long putt on the 10th hole that put her
3-up in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Gulyanamitta also got a huge lift from fellow player Angie Yoon,
who volunteered to caddie for her after being eliminated.
Gulyanamitta carried her own bag the previous few days of the
tourney while most players had caddies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have enough power to play any more,'' she said of the
decision to let Yoon carry the bag Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gulyanamitta, Cartwright made the turn at 2-up and was
never much in danger of losing her semifinal match.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very confident with my game now,'' Cartwright said. ''The
last three holes I played I started hitting the ball solidly for
the first time, so I am excited about (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   If Gulyanamitta, 24, wins, she'll be the oldest champion. No
player older than 22 has ever won the event.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, NCAA champion Jenna Daniels got knocked out
on the 19th hole by Vannoy, who made a 20-footer on the final hole
of regulation to prolong the quarterfinal match.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking I was going to top her,'' Daniels said
following Vannoy's clutch putt on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But moments later Daniels, the recent University of Arizona
graduate, was faced with a difficult downhill approach shot from
the rough at the first playoff hole, and hit the ball into a creek,
opening the door for Vannoy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have a great lie, I didn't have a great stance, but
you can't lay up in that type of situation, so I just decided to
swing away,'' Daniels said of her ill-fated 6-iron shot that found
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels made seven birdies in her round of 16 victory, but
managed just one against Vannoy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit a lot of great shots today. I putted extremely poorly,''
Daniels said. ''I couldn't get anything to drop, but you have those
days. I found myself being real tentative over my putts and when
you do that you aren't going to make many.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cops End Sharif Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By MUNIR AHMED
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- Police ended a nine-hour standoff with
the wife of deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif early Sunday
forcing her to drive to the family home outside the eastern Punjab
capital of Lahore, police Inspector Mohammed Riaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife, Kulsoom, kept police at bay for nine hours
refusing to leave her vehicle after a brief car chase through the
congested streets of Lahore that ended at an army compound. There
she remained with her three companions refusing to leave the
vehicle while police stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   For nine hours police tried to cajole the ousted prime
minister's wife into leaving the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she agreed to drive the vehicle to the Sharif family
compound in Raiwind, 10 miles outside Lahore. It's not clear what
persuaded Mrs. Sharif to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The drama began early Saturday when police surrounded Sharif's
home to prevent her from launching an anti-government march from
Lahore to Peshawar, 300 miles to the northwest. The march was
intended to protest the army government that overthrew her
husband's civilian government last October.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sharif told The Associated Press in a mobile telephone
interview from her vehicle that she would try to conduct the march
later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The champions of democracy and human rights have exposed their
real faces by arresting an innocent woman. But they cannot stop us
from our struggle for the restoration of democracy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted prime minister is in jail serving two concurrent life
terms on charges of terrorism and kidnapping. He also faces several
charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The military government banned marches and protest rallies
several months ago saying the first order of business was to get
Pakistan's failed economy working and the endemic corruption rooted
out before opening the door to public demonstrations that could
destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   Army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf has promised to restore
democracy to this poor nation of 140 million people within three
years in keeping with a Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday police conducted raids throughout the country
arresting as many as 260 Sharif supporters to prevent the march.
Barricades have been erected outside the Sharif residence where
scores of police have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sharif's supporters said there were more raids conducted
throughout the night Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All night long police raided homes of our supporters and are
now barring workers from assembling at Nawaz Sharif's home,'' said
Tehmina Daultana, a party worker and former Parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife, who was rarely seen in public when her husband
was in power, is now spearheading the anti-government campaign. But
deep divisions have emerged within the former ruling Pakistan
Muslim League party with some leaders expressing resentment over
her leadership.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Jet Lands in Cairo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A Libyan Arab Airlines jet landed Saturday
in Cairo, resuming flights between Libya and Egypt after an
eight-year hiatus due to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus 320 was carrying an aviation delegation and 11 other
passengers. The Libyan delegation was headed by Mohammed Issa,
secretary of the Popular Committee of Libyan Arab Airlines. The
airline will have 12 flights a week to Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were received at the VIP lounge by EgyptAir and
airport officials. Airline officials from the two countries were
holding talks before the Libyans' departure.
</P>
<P>
   Samir Imbabi, head of the EgyptAir Station's Service, said
EgyptAir's regular flights to Libya would resume Thursday. Egypt's
national airliner will have three flights a week to Libya, he said.
</P>
<P>
   International flights to and from Libya resumed in April last
year, after a seven-year U.N. ban, following the North African
country's handover of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of an
American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The bombing killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, just after the U.N. sanctions were suspended,
EgyptAir made a symbolic flight to Libya. The delay in resuming
regular passenger flights between the Arab neighbors has been
attributed to the need to better equip Libyan airports and to work
out a trade agreement.

<HEADLINE> About 1,000 Protest Miss. Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL PAYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOKOMO, Miss. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson led about 1,000
demonstrators Saturday in a march to the tree where a black
teen-ager died last month in a hanging that medical examiners ruled
a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, many carrying signs questioning whether
17-year-old Raynard Johnson was lynched, gathered outside his home
in Kokomo where he was found hanging from a pecan tree June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Two autopsies determined that the teen hung himself with a belt,
but Johnson's family and Jackson believe he may have been killed
for associating with white women in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not rest until those who committed this murder are
brought to justice,'' Jackson said Saturday. ''We reject the
suicide theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of law enforcement officers lined the streets of the
four-mile march route from the high school Johnson had attended to
his home, but other than heat-related illnesses there were no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the community of 1,000 about 90 miles south of
Jackson, Miss., have questioned whether the case is being
overblown. A new report released Friday by the state pathologist
reinforced earlier determinations that the death was suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to stir up trouble,'' said Terry Powell of
nearby Morgantown.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the protesters question whether Mississippi
authorities have done a thorough job. Jackson has set up a $10,000
reward and hot line to encourage people to come forward with
information, and he has asked Gov. Ronnie Musgrove and the U.S.
Justice Department to launch an investigation
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine what it would be like to be a black person
living here in constant fear of being lynched,'' said Dan Lutz, 22,
a Tulane University student who drove to the rally from New Orleans
with about 200 people. ''We're going to rally here for justice
against the systematic violence against black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors have said Johnson was a happy teen who would not
have committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of prejudice and hatred in Kokomo,'' said
resident Candace Brister, whose son Courtney attended the same
school as Johnson. ''It's time something is done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamie Mobley, whose 14-year-old son Emmett Till was killed in
Mississippi in 1955, supposedly for whistling at a white woman,
held hands with Johnson's mother, Maria, during the demonstration
and offered her support.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's father declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Versace Show Delivers New Twist  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Donatella Versace's show in a big space in the
Versace shop on Saturday was a new twist. Since the death of her
brother Gianni in 1997, she's been valiantly soldiering along as a
designer of sexy clothes -- the Versace trademark.
</P>
<P>
   This time she came up with clothes that are still sexy, but more
subtle. It looked as if real women, rather than sultry models,
could really wear this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Bicolor mink and fox coats show off the Italian love of good
furs and luxury. No politically correct complexes there.
</P>
<P>
   Uplifting colors like salmon and bright almond green gave spark
in beautifully fashioned vests for beige short skirts. A decollete
fitted white suit made a good impression in the Versace shop,
alongside some of the giant silk prints -- a Versace signature since
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The evening dresses in rust-orange, white or purple were
beautifully draped, and usually sequined or jeweled, often cut to
the navel or backless. Yet in the pleated silky fabrics, they
looked fine.
</P>
<P>
   The ostrich-feather little coats in almond green or burnished
copper were outstanding - cut to the knee in 1920s flapper style.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine-European Versace watcher Cindy Guzman said, ''It was
wonderful. Sexy, sexy, sexy.''

<HEADLINE> Hale Not Found, Lawsuit Dropped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- David Hale, the prosecution's key
witness in the Whitewater investigation of President Clinton's
business dealings, won't have to answer to an unrelated lawsuit
because the plaintiff couldn't find Hale to serve him with the
lawsuit by a mandated deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza dismissed the 1999
lawsuit against Hale because Marilyn Wallace, executor for the
estate of Carrie Floy Rickett of Little Rock, did not serve Hale
with the necessary legal papers within four months after the
lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Arkansas Supreme Court upheld Piazza's decision,
ruling that ''service of process was admittedly never made upon
appellee'' and that Hale's motion of May 26, 1999, to dismiss for
lack of service was proper.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused Hale of reneging on a 1990 loan from Rickett
for $94,834.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, a former judge and small-business lender, has a home
address in Shreveport, La., according to federal court documents.
But Friday, Dean Wallace, husband of Marilyn Wallace, said, ''We
looked for him everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Whitewater investigation, Hale claimed that Clinton
pressured him to make a fraudulent $300,000 loan from Hale's
federally backed lending institution, Capital Management Services
Inc. Clinton was then governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he testified for federal prosecutors in a trial
that resulted in convictions against then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and
former Clinton associates Susan McDougal and James McDougal. He
didn't repeat his claim that Clinton pressured him to make the loan
to Susan McDougal.

<HEADLINE> Knoblauch, Zeile Meet Yet Again  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just like many Mets and Yankees fans, Todd Zeile
and Chuck Knoblauch kept crossing paths Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch lined the first pitch of the doubleheader into center
field at Shea Stadium, only to be thrown out trying to stretch it
into a double. But he wound up on second and scored the first run
in the Yankees' 4-2 win because Zeile, the Mets' first baseman, was
called for obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the fourth, Zeile was called out for interfering with
the Yankees second baseman as he tried to field Jay Payton's
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either one changes the game,'' said Mets manager Bobby
Valentine, ejected for the first time this year after arguing the
first call.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very ironic that the same two guys could be involved in
two obstruction plays in the same game,'' Zeile said. ''It's almost
inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch clearly made a wide turn to avoid Zeile, and Yankees
first-base coach Lee Mazzilli immediately yelled to first base
umpire Robb Cook, claiming Knoblauch was impeded.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he makes the runner alter his course, that's obstruction,''
said crew chief Dana DeMuth, who ejected Valentine. ''There doesn't
have to be intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile couldn't believe Cook, a vacation relief umpire, made the
call.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mazzilli, the old codger that he is, helped talk him into
it,'' Zeile claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hit the ball and he was standing in my path,'' said
Knoblauch, who scored on Derek Jeter's double.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzilli said Zeile should have known better. But remember, this
is Zeile's first season at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you've been around and you're a veteran player, you know
what path the runner is going to take,'' Mazzilli said.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-inning meeting came after Zeile reached on a two-out
single. Payton's ball and Zeile got to Knoblauch at around the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just one of those strange circumstances,'' said Knoblauch,
involved in a famous obstruction non-call in the 1998 AL playoffs
against Cleveland. ''I'm just trying to follow the ball. He has to
run. Payton is a fast runner. I can't wait or I don't have a play
at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile and Valentine claimed the call was wrong because the ball
got by the fielder when the contact was made.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was obstruction on Knoblauch,'' Valentine said. ''The
ball passed him and he interfered with my runner. My runner should
have been on third base.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets walked into the visiting clubhouse at Yankee
Stadium, the TV set was showing Zeile explaining the Mets' version
of what should have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Players crowded on to watch Zeile being interviewed from two
hours earlier at Shea. Valentine stopped, too, and listened until
the interview was done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well said,'' he called out.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Mets Traveling in Style  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fourteen minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer afternoon, it can take two hours to get from Shea
Stadium in Queens to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But when you close two major highways and one of the city's
busiest bridges, put police cars and motorcycles ahead and behind,
travel in a Subway Series takes less time than three outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this all the time. They treat us good,'' Paul
O'Neill said after the Yankees zoomed home to the Bronx on Saturday
following their 4-2 win at Shea Stadium, the opener of baseball's
first moving doubleheader in 97 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just 48 minutes after the final out, the Yankees were showered
and back in street clothes, filling three buses parked beyond the
right-field scoreboard at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was open highway. When an unfortunate motorist
tried to pass the motorcade, he was pulled over faster than a
Mariano Rivera fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a presidential escort today, it seemed like,'' Andy
Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred fans cheered them as they left Queens, a few dozen
stood on overpasses of the Grand Central Parkway. Then, after they
went over the Triborough Bridge -- three news helicopters flying
overhead -- there were more fans cheering beside the Major Deegan
Expressway, some holding up signs.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:39 p.m, 62 minutes after the final out, they were outside
the big ballpark in Bronx, with 200 fans there to great their
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees were changing into their famous pinstripes,
the Mets were up in the Diamond Club at Shea Stadium, having an
early dinner, sushi included, with their families before their trip
to the Bronx. After the meal, there was this strange sight: road
grays hanging in their Shea Stadium clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like thousands of high school and college players, the
Mets put on their uniforms and got on the buses, already dressed to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a Legion game or something,'' said Todd Zeile, who
videotaped the trip with his camcorder. ''The fan reception was a
little different from legion ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets traveled, police didn't shut down the highways and
bridges -- they cleared only one lane. It took them 20 minutes, and
they walked in at 6:58 p.m., 70 minutes before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we went later in the afternoon,'' John Franco said,
trying to explain the second-class treatment.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets walked off their two buses -- with another for
family right behind -- there were about a thousand fans outside
Yankee Stadium, some chanting, ''Let's go Mets!'' others booing.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I signed here, one of the reasons was the passion of the
fans,'' said Zeile, who came to the Mets in December as a free
agent. ''This is something that raises the level of play, or should
test you as an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the major leagues saw anything like this, a tale
of two ballparks in one city, was Sept. 7, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the venues were Washington Park in Brooklyn and the
Polo Grounds in Manhattan, just across the Harlem River from where
Yankee Stadium was later built two decades later. The New York
Giants won 6-4 on the road before 9,300 on that Labor Day morning --
first pitch was 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Superbas -- as Brooklyn was known back before the Dodgers
nickname took hold -- won the afternoon game 3-0 when Henry Schmidt
pitched a four-hitter before 23,623.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of that day don't describe how fans transported
themselves from ballpark to ballpark -- trolleys and elevated trains
were available -- or even if they did.
</P>
<P>
   This time, fans had numerous choices -- subways (including John
Rocker's favorite, the No. 7 IRT), cars and even ferry boats. A
company even ran a promotion for 3,000 fans to travel gratis on the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who usually takes the No. 4 train from
Manhattan to the ballpark, knew about the program, but took the
team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's free travel if you show your two tickets stubs,''
the Yankees second baseman said kiddingly, ''but I don't have my
two ticket stubs. I'm sure that they're a lot of people going to
both games to say they went to both games.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea Stadium had been filled to the brim, 54,165, with slightly
more Mets fans in evidence. In New York, where traditions die
slowly if at all, Mets' fans still are considered by some to be
baseball nouveau riche, with only two World Series titles, unending
noise from jetliners landing at nearby LaGuardia Airport and that
garish flashing home-run apple in right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were America's team before there was an ''America's
team,'' the proud winner of 25 championships, whose field is
hallowed ground, containing monuments and plaques honoring many of
the sport's patron saints.
</P>
<P>
   Players have said the two-ballpark twinbill was an
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not just on fans, but on players, media, equipment managers,''
Knoblauch said. ''It's only fun if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Mets clubhouse, all wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   ''First problem of the day,'' Turk Wendell yelled out. ''I
brought two left shoes.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Misses Fourth Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez could be headed for the disabled
list after sitting out his second straight game Saturday night with
tendinitis in his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth game Gonzalez missed this week and seventh in
the Detroit Tigers' last 12. He missed three games last week with
soreness after fouling a ball off his ankle against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The injury isn't improving, manager Phil Garner said. The Tigers
likely will give Gonzalez the extended All-Star break to rest the
injury before deciding whether to place him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day it's looking like it's worse or better,'' Garner
said. ''I don't know (when Gonzalez will play). You got me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been a disappointment since he was acquired from
Texas in the offseason. Hitting .274 with 13 homers and 33 RBIs, he
rejected a trade to the Yankees last month and reaffirmed his
commitment to test the free-agent market this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are playing an interleague series against Milwaukee
this weekend, meaning Gonzalez would have to play the outfield
instead of being the designated hitter. Detroit lost 4-3 to the
Brewers on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Typhoons Kill 3 in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A typhoon that left a trail of death in the
Philippines pummeled eastern Japan on Saturday, killing three
people, flooding cities, snapping power lines and burying homes in
landslides.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling up Japan's Pacific coast, Typhoon Kirogi was
headed for Hachinohe, a city 300 miles north of Tokyo on Japan's
main island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Mito, northeast of Tokyo, trudged knee-deep through
torrents of muddy water that raced down streets and lapped
storefronts, TV footage showed.
</P>
<P>
   An 81-year-old man drowned after falling into a swollen canal
near Mito, police said. Another man, aged 30, was found floating in
a canal after his car veered off a wet road and hit a guard rail,
propelling him into the irrigation ditch outside Tokyo, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old boy also drowned after falling into a swollen river
near a park where he was playing with his father, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Philippines said Saturday that the death toll
there reached 42 from Kirogi and a second typhoon, Kai-tak, that
continued to dump monsoon rains on the country's northwestern
region. About 800,000 people -- up from 400,000 Friday -- crowded
evacuation centers in schools and government buildings, according
to the government disaster management agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and the National Disaster Coordinating Council
said another 23 were missing and feared dead, including six from a
boat that capsized Monday off the western coast of Luzon.
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard officials in the Philippines said four people died
and four were still missing after a fishing boat carrying 32 people
capsized Friday afternoon near Mindoro Occidental province. The 24
other passengers were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Kai-tak was headed Saturday for Taiwan and was located about 160
miles southwest of the southern tip of the island. Authorities
urged residents to evacuate several mountainous areas in central
Taiwan that were struck hard by a 7.6-magnitude earthquake last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains from Kirogi, which was packing maximum winds of
65 mph, flooded at least 300 homes in the Tokyo metropolitan area,
according to the Tokyo Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The typhoon knocked out power lines in several parts of central
Japan, with electricity cut to 20,000 homes for four hours, said
Soichi Takeguchi, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 domestic flights were canceled and some bullet
train and rail services in Tokyo were suspended, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm lashed the Izu island chain south of Tokyo early
Saturday before heading north to barrel into Japan's main island of
Honshu.
</P>
<P>
   The festival hall at a shrine and three homes were demolished by
landslides overnight on Kozushima, where 788 residents had been
evacuated. As skies cleared, officials lifted the typhoon
evacuation order for residents on the island, 95 miles south of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns remained that the typhoon season could jeopardize a
July 21-23 summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations. The
meeting is to be held on Okinawa island.

<HEADLINE> Tex. Appliance Co. Settles Sex Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An appliance rental company will pay $2
million in damages to job applicants who were asked questions about
their sex lives and religious viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Rent-A-Center Inc. will distribute the money to more than 1,200
of its employees and applicants as part of a lawsuit settlement
approved Friday by a San Francisco federal judge. The Dallas,
Texas-based company will stop administering the questionnaire as
part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees said they were required to answer 502
true-or-false questions as part of the psychological test that was
used to qualify new-hires and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The test included questions pertaining to the job applicant's
bodily functions and religious views. Other questions focused on
the applicant's sexual habits, including: ''I have never indulged
in any unusual sex practices'' and ''I am very strongly attracted
by members of my own sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, anyone who scored more than 12 deviations failed
the test and was ineligible for hire and promotions,'' attorney
Jeffrey Ross said. It was unclear what constituted a deviation.
</P>
<P>
   Ross represented several Rent-A-Center employees in the suit
filed in U.S. District Court last year. The test violated employee
privacy rights, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Rent-A-Center said the tests were merely used to
identify potential management candidates and results were not used
against employees.

over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Burks led off the fourth with his 10th homer, doubled and scored
in the fifth and had an RBI infield hit in the sixth. He's 6-for-8
the last two games with three doubles and is a career .389 hitter
against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Embree retired Fernando Vina with the bases loaded in the
seventh inning for the second straight game to preserve a 7-5 lead.
On Friday, Embree got Vina to ground into a double play, and on
Saturday he struck him out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have lost three in a row for the first time since
June 3-5 and their NL Central lead was shaved to seven games over
Cincinnati despite a 13-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   Each team was minus its biggest star. Mark McGwire, who has
decided to skip the All-Star Game to rest his sore right knee, sat
for the second straight game. Barry Bonds didn't start for the
seventh straight game because of a hairline fracture to the tip of
his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds struck out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth in his first
at-bat in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Garrett Stephenson (9-5) squandered a four-run
lead after three innings. Stephenson, whose start was pushed back
two days because of the flu, has lost five of his last six
decisions. He allowed six runs and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Estes (8-3) also struggled, allowing five runs -- four
earned -- and 10 hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston had two hits and two RBIs for the Cardinals.
Edgar Renteria, picked as McGwire's replacement, had two hits,
walked twice and scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston's RBI single off Felix Rodriguez narrowed the gap to 7-6
in the eighth. Robb Nen worked the ninth for his 17th save in 22
chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burks is batting .429 his last 23 games overall with five
homers and 17 RBIs. ... The Cardinals lead the majors with 146
homers, five shy of Seattle's 1999 record of 151 before the
All-Star break. ... The Cardinals have outscored their opponents
98-44 in the first inning. ... The Giants have outscored their
opponents 63-34 in the fourth. ... The Giants have won 7 of 11 on
the road after a 3-13 stretch. ... The Giants have outscored their
opponents 38-20 during the winning streak. ... A crowd of 47,227
was the Cardinals' 18th sellout this season and 10th in 11 games.

<HEADLINE> 5 Million Americans Risk AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Roughly 5 million Americans have sex
and drug habits that put them at a high risk of catching AIDS,
according to new U.S. figures, and experts fear an upsurge of the
disease after a decade of stability.
</P>
<P>
   While AIDS infections in the United States have fallen
dramatically since their peak in the 1980s, public health officials
worry that complacency about the disease has caused backsliding --
especially among young gay men -- that could bring AIDS roaring
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm scared by the trends we are starting to see,'' said Dr.
Helene Gayle, AIDS chief at the U.S. Centers for disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle presented the latest data Saturday at a briefing hosted by
the American Medical Association on the eve of the 13th
International Conference on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 40,000 Americans contract HIV each year, down
from the 100,000 new infections annually during the mid-'80s. The
improvement is attributed largely to safer sex habits and avoiding
dirty needles.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to see how many Americans still act recklessly,
the CDC analyzed findings from several large-scale surveys. Their
conclusion: Between 2 percent and 4 percent of the adult population
-- 4 million to 5 million people -- still put themselves at high
risk. This includes having six or more sexual partners annually,
having sex with someone known to be infected with HIV, engaging in
prostitution for drugs or money, having male homosexual contact,
using crack cocaine or injecting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle said the study did not attempt to learn whether this level
of risky behavior is increasing or decreasing, although there seems
to be evidence on both sides. For instance, condom use has
increased substantially since the 1980s, although only about 40
percent of unmarried people and 23 percent of drug users report
using them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, infection rates among gay men have
remained stable at between 1 percent and 4 percent. However, said
Gayle, ''We have seen troubling signs over the past year that we
fear could signal a resurgence of the epidemic among gay men.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the San Francisco Department of Public Health
reported a sharp increase in new HIV infections between 1997 and
1999. Also, gonorrhea and other sexually spread diseases have risen
recently in several cities among HIV-infected gay men.
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry that complacency about getting AIDS, fueled in
part by the availability of effective HIV treatments, may be behind
a return to risky sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive victories over HIV in industrialized
countries has been the use of AZT and other drugs to prevent the
spread of the virus from infected mothers to their babies during
birth. In the United States, only a few hundred babies now get the
infection this way each year.
</P>
<P>
   Many hope the same approach will slow the spread of HIV to
babies where this tragedy is common, especially in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Boehringer Ingelheim said it would offer its AIDS
drug nevirapine free to developing countries to help stop
mother-to-child spread of HIV. However, a study scheduled to be
released later at the meeting suggests this approach may not have a
big impact, because infected women can still spread the virus to
their babies through breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 1,797 pregnancies found that a combination of the
drugs AZT and 3TC cut the risk of transmission to newborns by more
than half. However, as babies caught the virus through breast milk,
the difference was nearly wiped out within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to look at how to make breast feeding safer,'' said
Dr. James McIntyre of South Africa's Chris Hani Baragwanath
Hospital. Possibilities include weaning babies after six months,
avoiding mixing breast milk with other liquids and giving anti-AIDS
drugs to nursing babies.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Warns Won't Increase Output  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Algeria's Oil Minister Chakib Khelil
said Saturday that OPEC will increase production only if there is
demand and the group is waiting to gauge the impact of a production
increase agreed to in June.
</P>
<P>
   Khelil was speaking at a two-day meeting of oil ministers from
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The meeting in Algiers was called to prepare for a heads-of-states
summit in Venezuela in September.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came just days after OPEC member Saudi Arabia said
it would push ahead with its plan to boost output if oil prices
fail to drop sharply in coming days. The world's No. 1 oil producer
signaled it would unilaterally pump an additional 500,000 barrels
of crude per day.
</P>
<P>
   Other top oil producers were caught off guard because the
decision came less than two weeks after OPEC agreed on an increase
of 708,000 barrels a day to try to force down prices, which have
been spiraling upward for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, a fractious group whose members have widely varying
interests, historically has tried to reach decisions by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, no other OPEC
members have enough surplus capacity to raise their production
levels quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis announced their intention to hike production after it
became clear that the increase agreed to in June was not enough to
drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers meeting in Algiers are expected to discuss
technology, environmental protection and the future role of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Qatar, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia.
Iraq also is a member but has not participated in recent OPEC
production pacts.

<HEADLINE> Author Gets Suspended Sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Egyptian author was sentenced Saturday to
a suspended six-month jail term for writing books that offend
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Salah-Eddine Mohsen's sentence is lenient; a conviction for
offending religion usually carries a sentence of up to five years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen was indicted, among other things, for writing that the
Quran, Islam's holy book, was outdated. But during the trial he
told the court that he was a believer and that he did not mean to
offend Islam or negate its basic tenets.
</P>
<P>
   Under Egyptian law, Mohsen can be immediately imprisoned for any
similar future offense.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen is not widely known, but has written several books,
including ''Trembling of Enlightenment'' and ''A Night Talk with
Heaven.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners Shortstop Sidelined  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez will miss Tuesday night's All-Star
game because of a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was knocked unconscious by Los Angeles Dodgers
shortstop Alex Cora when the Seattle star tried to break up a
double play Friday night. Rodriguez said Cora's knee hit him in the
earflap of his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really feel blessed, blessed more than ever,'' Rodriguez
said after being examined before Saturday night's game between the
Mariners and the Dodgers. ''The All-Star game suddenly becomes very
small. I'm more concerned about my health. I could have been out
for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's injury means that either Derek Jeter of the New York
Yankees or Boston's Nomar Garciaparra will start in Atlanta. Jeter
is good friends with Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, there will be other All-Star games in the future
for me,'' Rodriguez said. ''You take opportunities like this to
bless the man upstairs. My year could have been over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he still planned to be in Atlanta for the
All-Star game and hoped to watch it on the bench in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Believe me, the American League will be well represented at
shortstop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Pedegana, the Mariners' team medical director, said
Rodriguez has a Grade II concussion, which can cause memory loss
and requires a longer recovery time. Rodriguez won't be able to
play for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 24, also has an injured right knee, but Pedegana is
not sure how serious it is and won't know for several days.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that Rodriguez will have to undergo
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee if he has a torn meniscus
cartilage, Pedegana said. If that happens, he would be sidelined
for 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners doctors don't know how serious Rodriguez's knee injury
is. Rodriguez said, ''Right now, my knee's a little sore.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's game, Rodriguez went down on the Safeco Field
infield and stayed there motionless for several minutes before
trainers helped him up and off the field. An ambulance took
Rodriguez to Providence Hospital, where he spent the night and
underwent neurological tests.
</P>
<P>
   He was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the most part, I was very knocked out,'' said Rodriguez,
who said it was the first time in his life he had ever been knocked
out.
</P>
<P>
   He was a quarterback at Westminster Christian High School in
Miami, where he graduated in 1993. After his concussion, he said he
acted in a bizarre manner in the training room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I was calling audibles in the training room,'' he
said. ''I told Chuck Armstrong (the team president who was in the
room) to go out for a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedegana said Rodriguez, one of baseball's brightest young
superstars, would be make the cross-country flight to Atlanta for
the midsummer classic. Rodriguez said he planned to leave for
Atlanta after Sunday's game between the Mariners and the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners and the Dodgers will finish the first half of their
season against Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second straight year Rodriguez has missed the
All-Star game. He wasn't chosen to go last season because
Garciaparra and Jeter had such strong first halves, while he missed
32 games in April and May after cartilage surgery on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   He played in the 1996-98 All-Star games.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the AL West, the Mariners were just glad Rodriguez's
injury wasn't as serious as it first appeared. Initially, there was
concern among the crowd of 45,206 that Rodriguez had suffered a
neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked pretty bad from the collision,'' trainer Rick
Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were concerned,'' said manager Lou Piniella, who moved
Carlos Guillen from third base to shortstop to replace Rodriguez.
Guillen was in the starting lineup at shortstop Saturday night for
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   After walking with the bases loaded to force in a run, Rodriguez
was determined to stop Cora from completing a double play that
would end the Mariners' fifth. After fielding Edgar Martinez's
ground ball, Cora was just as determined to step on the bag and
throw to first to get two.
</P>
<P>
   Cora leaped in the air, and that's when his knee came in contact
with the hard-charging Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alex plays hard. He always has,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gives everything for his team. That is what he's all
about,'' said Cora, younger brother of Joey Cora, who used to be
Rodriguez's second-base partner in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, who stayed in Friday night's game, came into the Mariners'
dressing room before Saturday night's game to talk to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alex was very concerned about me and I was concerned about
him,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's game, Rodriguez was leading the majors in
runs scored with 84 and was seventh in the AL with a .345 batting
average. He had 24 home runs and 78 RBIs.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Vernon Debo, an advocate for the
mentally disabled in Missouri, died Thursday of a heart attack. He
was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Debo never took a dime for his lobbying efforts. In January, he
appeared at his 59th consecutive opening of the Missouri General
Assembly, urging legislators to increase mental health funding.
</P>
<P>
   Debo's work as a mental health advocate began in 1940 after his
son Tommy suffered brain damage during birth. Tommy died four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Debo helped parents form the Missouri
Association for Retarded Citizens, one of the first groups of its
kind. Parents sought sheltered workshops and tax breaks to pay for
programs for the mentally retarded, including housing, recreation
facilities, skills training and respite care.

</P>
<P>
   His 50-year career in education included serving as president of
Atlanta University, a historically black school now known as Clark
Atlanta University, from 1967 to 1979.

   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- William David Kingery, known as the
father of modern ceramics, died Friday of a heart attack. He was
73.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery won the prestigious Kyoto award in 1999, a $400,000
Japanese prize given for significant contributions in advanced
technology, basic sciences and creative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery, a University of Arizona professor who had taught at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helped bring the
12,000-year-old craft of ceramics -- the production of bricks,
china, pottery and glass from natural materials -- into the age of
modern technology. Kingery pioneered methods for using ceramics in
aerospace and electronics engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Kingery's research into why and how ceramics are formed led to
the use of ceramics in virtually every area of modern technology,
including oxygen sensors, fuel cells and a wide variety of
electronic components.

<HEADLINE> Stockwell Day To Head Canada Party  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A socially conservative ex-preacher was elected
Saturday to head a new political party aimed at unifying Canada's
right-wing and toppling the governing Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   Stockwell Day, 49, received more than 60 percent of the vote by
members of the Canadian Alliance in his runoff election against
former Reform Party leader Preston Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Day's convincing victory makes him the new head of the official
opposition in Parliament and the likely main challenger for the
prime minister's office in the next federal election, expected next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The result continued a rapid rise to national prominence by Day,
the former treasurer of the Alberta provincial government. It also
ended Manning's dream of taking the western-based protest movement
he launched 13 years ago to the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Alliance, which formed in March and immediately
began its leadership campaign, hopes to unify the old Reform Party
with the Conservative Party, which last governed Canada in the
1980s and early 1990s. The alliance is hoping to build a
center-right bloc capable of beating the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier round of voting, Day won 44 percent and Manning
got 36 percent. But since neither got more than 50 percent, the
runoff was held Saturday, with more than 200,000 members of the
Canadian Alliance eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   With 91,560 votes counted Saturday night, Day had 58,086 for 63
percent to 33,474, or 37 percent, for Manning, with the trend
carrying in every region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A tame campaign turned negative toward the end, with Manning and
his supporters accusing Day's organization of intimidation tactics
such as letters threatening political retribution for backing
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, though, Manning supporters -- sensing the
outcome -- called for unity and continued support for the party.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance was inaugurated in March when Manning's old Reform
Party, a western-based movement that grew to become the official
opposition in Parliament, joined up to form the major support base.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien of the Liberal Party says he
intends to run for a third-straight term in the next national vote,
which he plans to call within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party, in power since 1993, has dismissed the
Alliance as little more than a repackaged version of the Reform
Party, which failed to win a single seat in Parliament in eastern
Canada in the 1997 election.

<HEADLINE> Episcopalians OK Lutheran Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Episcopal Church leaders approved a historic pact
Saturday with the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, voting to
create an alliance in which the churches will share clergy,
sacraments and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church's House of Deputies, made up of 832 priests
and lay people, overwhelmingly approved the agreement Saturday, one
day after it won approval from the other chamber of the church's
legislature, the House of Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the 5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America approved the alliance last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It enables our two churches to work together in a shared
mission to our broken and hurting world,'' said the Very Rev.
Donald Brown, co-chairman of ecumenical relations for the 2.4
million-member Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both our communions will be living into reality Jesus' prayer
that all his followers might be one,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   While they differ in style, the Episcopalian and Lutheran
churches in the United States share similar patterns of worship and
of regional organization.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the sharing of clergy will help congregations in parts
of the country where one is church is strong while the other has a
thinner presence. In New England, for example, there is a single
Lutheran synod and one Lutheran bishop, while the Episcopal Church
has seven dioceses and a dozen bishops. Across the much of the
upper Midwest, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, which takes effect Jan. 1, also includes a compromise
involving the Episcopal ordination of bishops, who are installed in
a laying-on of hands by three predecessor bishops from a line
believed to stretch back to Christ's apostles.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will allow Lutheran clergy to serve in Episcopal
churches without such ordinations. New Lutheran bishops, however,
would have to go through an Episcopal ordination to serve in an
Episcopal church.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
Frank Imhoff, said there is some opposition to the pact among
Lutherans who for centuries have been wary of authority and church
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   It may prompt some Lutheran congregations to leave the church,
said the Rev. Lowell Almen, secretary of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, but he stressed that much of the opposition to
the pact comes from a misperception of the alliance as a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't mean either church body is losing responsibility
for its own internal life or giving up its own history,'' he said.
''Perhaps those histories will be enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major issue facing Episcopal Church leaders during their
10-day national convention, which began Wednesday, is the blessing
of same-sex unions. The church legislature is expected to consider
it next week.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal being discuss would codify the church's unofficial
policy of allowing each diocese to decide whether to ordain
homosexuals and bless gay relationships. Another proposal suggests
the church develop rites for couples who live in monogamous,
committed relationships but do not get married.
</P>
<P>
   A delegate to the convention resigned after he scattered salt --
a traditional method of battling the devil -- under the tables of
openly gay and lesbian delegates and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials announced Saturday the Rev. Nelson W. Koscheski
resigned as a delegate from the Diocese of Dallas after the
''salting'' brought the church's House of Deputies to a halt Friday
for prayers and songs of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Koscheski was on his way back to Texas Saturday and was
unavailable for comment, the church press office said.

   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Roughly 5 million Americans have sex and drug
habits that put them at a high risk of catching AIDS, according to new U.S.
figures, but public health officials worry that complacency about the disease
could bring it roaring back. ''I'm scared by the trends we are starting to
see,'' Dr. Helene Gayle, AIDS chief at the U.S. Centers for disease Control and
Prevention, said today at an American Medical Association briefing on the eve of
the 13th International Conference on AIDS. Currently, about 40,000 Americans
contract HIV each year, down from the 100,000 new infections annually during the
mid-'80s.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Man in Mexico's Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Los Angeles businessman apparently has
become the first person living outside Mexico to be elected to the
Mexican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Varon Levy, 42, a member of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, appears to have won a congressional
seat through proportional representation, though his party lost the
historic July 2 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any challenges to final vote results released Friday,
Varon Levy's election will be formally confirmed next week. He
would take his seat when Congress convenes Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 seats in Mexico's Congress, 300 representatives are
elected directly. Another 200 are assigned to various parties based
on the percentage of votes they receive in the election for the
lower house, or Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Varon Levy was listed by the PRI on its slate of proportional
candidates. He appears to be high enough on the list to receive one
of the approximately 50 seats garnered by the PRI through
apportionment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a breakthrough. I am going to be in the trenches fighting
for Mexicans living abroad,'' Varon Levy said, adding that he plans
to commute between Los Angeles and Mexico City for the Tuesday
through Thursday congressional sessions.
</P>
<P>
   This year was the first time any party ran an expatriate Mexican
as a candidate for Congress -- in part because the estimated 7 to 10
million Mexicans living in the United States have only recently
become a potential constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms passed in 1996 gave expatriate Mexicans the right to
vote in Mexican elections, but no absentee ballot procedure has yet
been approved; they can vote in Mexican border towns, but those
polling stations do not have enough ballots for them.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Mexicans living in the United States, Jose Jacques
Medina of Los Angeles and Raul Ross of Chicago, also were running
for Congress as apportionment candidates. But their leftist
Democratic Revolution Party did not appear to have won enough votes
to give them seats.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party (PAN) won
the presidential race, breaking the PRI's 71-year hold on the
office. The PAN also gained its first plurality in the Chamber of
Deputies, though the PRI still dominates the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   According to final vote counts, the PRI will have 209 seats in
the 500-seat lower house. The National Action Party, together with
the allied Environmentalist Green Party, will have 223; the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party will have 52 (61 with an allied party),
the remainder going to three small groups.
</P>
<P>
   Varon Levy ran unsuccessfully for the Mexican Congress in 1997
and has served as the PRI's president in Los Angeles. He has been a
legal resident of the United States since 1978 and graduated from
California State University, Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Varon Levy said his goals as a congressman will include
improving the lives of Mexicans in the United States. He wants to
allow them to vote outside of Mexico and to create 25 additional
congressional seats that would go to deputies elected by Mexicans
living abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - On the day the New York Yankees and Mets turned
back the clock to 1903, Dwight Gooden flashed back to his glory
days of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching from the very mound he once owned, Gooden celebrated
his return to the big leagues with a Subway Series win as the
Yankees beat the Mets 4-2 Saturday in the opener of baseball's most
unusual doubleheader in 97 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the day turned out was more than I could have
expected,'' Gooden said. ''It seemed very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden threw five effective innings and Tino Martinez homered
and drove in three runs as the Yankees won at Shea Stadium. The
second game was to begin about 3&AMP;frac12; hours later at 8:15 p.m. EDT at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first double-ballpark doubleheader in the majors
since Sept. 7, 1903, when the New York Giants played the Brooklyn
Superbas, later the Dodgers. Both road teams won that day in games
at Brooklyn's Washington Park and the Giants' Polo Grounds - a year
later, New York city's subways opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have greedy ideas right now. We'd like to win two,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   This one was wild from the start. After one pitch, there already
had been a rare obstruction call, an argument, the ejection of Mets
manager Bobby Valentine and an announcement the Mets were playing
the game under protest.
</P>
<P>
   With Gooden (3-3) good enough, the Yankees beat the Mets for the
second straight day. The Yankees increased their lead in the
cross-town series to 10-6, and won their fourth in a row overall.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the sellout crowd of 54,165 immediately headed for Game
2. For fans, it would take about one hour to ride the No. 7
Flushing train, change at Grand Central Terminal and catch the
uptown No. 4 Lexington Avenue line to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 fans looked to get an early start - they watched from
a subway platform from beyond the right-field fence, perhaps drawn
by the promise of free tokens, which normally cost $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, their bats and bags packed in an equipment truck,
left less than an hour after the game. They rode a bus back over
the Triborough Bridge to their park, taking about 14 minutes. A
closed-off entrance to the Grand Central Parkway sped their path.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had lunch at the Diamond Club at Shea while waiting for
the clubhouse attendants to do laundry, then were to change into
their road uniforms and bus to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, traded by Houston and cut by Tampa Bay earlier this
season, pitched at Shea for the first time since June 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular players in Mets' history, Gooden faced
his former team for the first time. The Yankees signed him to a
minor league contract on June 11 and promoted him before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden received a warm standing ovation when he came out to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to expect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, the 1985 NL Cy Young winner who helped the Mets win the
1986 World Series did not throw as hard as he once did, struggling
to reach 90 mph with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden gave up two runs and six hits, keeping the Mets
off-balance with off-speed stuff. He struck out one and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was sort of a surreal sight to see him on a Mets mound with
a Yankee uniform,'' Mets first baseman Todd Zeile said. ''There's
been a lot of strange things the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 20th save.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (3-4) fell behind 2-0 in the first inning.
Martinez's solo home run in the sixth made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch led off the game with a hit to center field and
was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double.
</P>
<P>
   But first base umpire Robb Cook ruled that Zeile had gotten in
Knoblauch's way, and awarded him second.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine sprung from the dugout and engaged all four umpires in
an argument, tracing Knoblauch's steps in the freshly raked dirt.
Replays showed that Zeile, though he never touched Knoblauch, stood
in his path and made him take a wide turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''His stride was intact the whole way,'' Valentine insisted.
''It's improper interpretation of the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine eventually was ejected, for the first time this year,
by crew chief Dana DeMuth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bobby was under the thinking that there has to be contact.
There does not,'' DeMuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Zeile and Knoblauch met again in the fourth. Zeile
was called out for interfering with the Yankees second baseman as
he tried to field a grounder.
Notes: Bernie Williams' 17-game hitting streak was stopped. ...
Roger Clemens was to start the nightcap for the Yankees against
Glendon Rusch. ... Gooden won 157 games for the Mets from
1984-1994, second on the team's career list behind Tom Seaver's
198. Gooden has 191 career wins. ... Gooden won at Shea for the
first time since April 16, 1994, when he beat Houston.

<HEADLINE> Piazza hit in helmet by Clemens, leaves game  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Mike Piazza was hit in the helmet by Roger
Clemens' fastball Saturday night and sustained a slight concussion
that forced him to leave the second game of the Mets-Yankees split
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The beaning came in the top of the second inning at Yankee
Stadium. In the bottom half, the Mets' Glendon Rusch hit Tino
Martinez in the backside with his second pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez calmly took his base as plate umpire Doug Eddings
warned both teams against further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was examined by Yankees team Dr. Stuart Hershon at the
ballpark and taken to a hospital for X-rays. The All-Star catcher
was listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who had homered in three straight games against Clemens,
was sent sprawling by an 0-1 pitch to start the inning. Two
trainers and Mets manager Bobby Valentine rushed from the dugout to
tend to Piazza, and Clemens walked toward the plate for a closer
look.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza stayed on the ground for a minute, was helped up by a
trainer and walked to the bench. Several of the Mets moved to the
top step of the dugout, and coach John Stearns seemed particularly
animated.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco entered as a pinch-runner and stayed in the game as
the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, elected to start at catcher for the NL in Tuesday
night's All-Star game, is 7-for-12 lifetime against Clemens with
three homers and a double.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had three hits and drove in three runs at Shea Stadium
earlier in the day as the Yankees won 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez was hit, Eddings went to the mound to talk to
Rusch. Valentine, ejected after one pitch of the opener, waved his
arms while arguing with crew chief Tim Welke, but remained in the
game. Yankees manager Joe Torre came out to talk with Eddings.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 4, Twins 1  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kris Benson outdueled Eric Milton in a matchup
of two of the majors' top young starters and the Pittsburgh Pirates
beat Minnesota 4-1 Saturday night -- the Twins' seventh straight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young homered as the Pirates matched their season high by
winning their fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   If their teams had better records, this might have been a
premier pitching matchup: Milton (8-4), who pitched a no-hitter
last season, against Benson (8-6), the winner of eight of 11
decisions since an 0-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   Benson was better this time, twice working out of jams by
getting batters to ground into double plays while limiting the
Twins to Corey Koskie's solo homer leading off the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, starting three days later than normal because of a bout
with the flu, gave up four hits, struck out five and walked two in
8 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams got two outs for his 12th save in 13
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Since his poor start, which saw him yield seven homers in his
first four starts, Benson has settled down to become one of the
NL's most consistent starters. He has a 2.44 ERA in his last 14
starts, pitching at least into the seventh inning in each of those
starts, and has yielded two earned runs or fewer in 10 of those
starts.
</P>
<P>
   He has been especially effective in Three Rivers Stadium, giving
up only 11 earned runs in his last 65 1-3 innings there -- a 1.51
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Young helped get Benson started, hitting a solo homer -- his 12th
-- in the second. The Pirates made it 2-0 in the fourth on Wil
Cordero's leadoff double, his eighth hit in four games, and Brian
Giles' RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, the only Pirates player to start all 85 games and an NL
All-Star, has been in a mild slump, hitting .200 with six RBIs in
his previous 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Koskie's homer, his fifth, cut the Pirates' lead to 2-1. But the
Pirates scored twice in their half of the fifth without the benefit
of an extra-base hit. Benson started it with a single, his fifth
hit of the season, and Mike Benjamin was hit with a pitch ahead of
Jason Kendall's bases-loading single.
</P>
<P>
   Benson scored as Cordero grounded into a double play, and
Benjamin came home on Milton's wild pitch with Giles batting.
</P>
<P>
   Milton, who grew up about three hours from Pittsburgh in State
College, Pa., yielded four runs on seven hits in six innings in his
second career start in Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins threatened in the seventh, putting runners on first
and third with one out, but Benson got Marcus Jensen to ground into
an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Twins are 3-8 in interleague play. ... Twins relievers
have surrendered 39 homers in 89 games. ... Young's homer was the
Pirates' ninth in four games. ... Pirates OF John Vander Wal has a
career-high 45 RBIs before the All-Star break. He had 41 RBIs last
season. ... Pirates RHP Jose Silva, who starts Sunday, is 0-6 as a
starter since May 19, 1999. ... The Pirates also won four in a row
May 29-June 2.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 6, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- David Wells became the majors' first 15-game
winner, and Raul Mondesi hit a three-run homer to power the Toronto
Blue Jays to a 6-3 win over the Montreal Expos on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (15-2) won his eighth straight decision to become just the
second pitcher since 1988 -- following Pedro Martinez last season --
to reach 15 wins before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the likely All-Star game starter, allowed five hits and
three runs in seven innings to stop Montreal's three-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi hit his 22nd homer as Toronto scored four in the fourth
to chase Tony Armas Jr. (4-6). Jose Cruz Jr. hit his 20th homer in
the seventh as the Blue Jays became the first team in major league
history to have four hitters with 20 or more home runs before the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi recorded 10 of Toronto's 12 outfield putouts in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Wells struck out three and walked three. He has walked just 18
batters in 128 1-3 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch pitched the last two innings for his 20th save in 24
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Armas retired the first nine batters before walking Shannon
Stewart to lead off the fourth. Homer Bush singled and Mondesi hit
his 22nd homer to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado doubled off the left-field wall and, one out
later, Darrin Fletcher hit an RBI single to make it 4-0 and chase
Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal scored twice in the bottom half on RBI grounders by
Chris Widger and Mike Mordecai to cut the lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Lira, who relieved Armas, hit his first career homer
leading off the fifth to draw Montreal to within one at 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz hit a solo homer off reliever Anthony Telford to put
Toronto ahead 5-3 and added an RBI double in the eighth off Scott
Forster.
</P>
<P>
   Armas allowed four hits and four runs in 3 1-3 innings. He
struck out two and walked one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wells is 14-1 since splitting his first two decisions of
the season. ... Wells won a career-best nine straight in 1998 with
the New York Yankees. ... Delgado (28) and Tony Batista (24) also
have at least 20 homers for Toronto. ... The major league record
for putouts by a right fielder in one game is 11, shared by many
and most recently accomplished by Armas' father, Oakland's Tony
Armas on June 12, 1982. The record for putouts by any outfielder in
one game is 12. ... Mondesi also had 10 putouts for Los Angeles on
Sept. 25, 1995. ... ... SS Alex Gonzalez missed his second straight
start with a strained right groin. ... LF Rondell White didn't
start after leaving Friday's game with a strained right hamstring
following the sixth inning. ... Lira got a curtain call from the
crowd of 17,420 following his home run.

By MELISSA MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tamika Whitmore tied a season high with 17
points as the New York Liberty beat the expansion Miami Sol 63-51
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson added 14 points as the Liberty (10-9) moved above
.500 for the first time this season. Whitmore finished 7-for-8 from
the field for New York, which shot 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips had 10 points and seven rebounds for the Liberty,
winners of a season-high three straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Manning and Marlies Askamp led Miami (6-12) with eight
points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   New York outscored the Sol 20-10 in the final eight minutes.
Reserve Becky Hammon, who finished with 11 points, scored eight in
the run, and Johnson added seven.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by four at halftime, New York went on an 8-1 run behind
Whitmore's six points for a 39-28 lead with 15:59 remaining. Miami
closed within 41-37 on Debbie Black's 3-pointer, two baskets by
Askamp and two free throws by Kisha Ford with 8:27 left.
</P>
<P>
   New York extended the lead to 54-41 on a 13-3 run, capped by
Hammon's two free throws. But Miami scored six points in 40 seconds
on two baskets by Katrina Colleton, and a steal and layup by Ford
to trim the lead to 56-47 with 1:18 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Colleton and Black added seven points each for the Sol, who were
outscored 34-22 in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   After New York shot 5-for-6 to open the game, Miami took its
first lead, 12-11 on Manning's turnaround jumper at 14:38.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon's 3-pointer gave New York a 22-19 lead, but Milena Flores
responded a 3-pointer. Neither team could get more than a
three-point lead until Whitmore made a free throw for a 31-27
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   New York shot 54 percent in the first half behind Whitmore's 11
points on 4-for-4 shooting.

Episcopalians, Lutherans OK Pact
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Episcopal Church leaders approved a historic pact today with
the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, voting to create an alliance in
which the churches will share clergy, sacraments and strategy. Leaders of the
5.2 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America approved the alliance
last year. ''It enables our two churches to work together in a shared mission to
our broken and hurting world,'' said the Very Rev. Donald Brown, co-chairman of
ecumenical relations for the 2.4 million-member Episcopal Church.

Americans at High Risk for AIDS
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Roughly 5 million Americans have sex and drug
habits that put them at a high risk of catching AIDS, according to new U.S.
figures, but public health officials worry that complacency about the disease
could bring it roaring back. ''I'm scared by the trends we are starting to
see,'' Dr. Helene Gayle, AIDS chief at the U.S. Centers for disease Control and
Prevention, said today at an American Medical Association briefing on the eve of
the 13th International Conference on AIDS. Currently, about 40,000 Americans
contract HIV each year, down from the 100,000 new infections annually during the
mid-'80s.

Gore on Offensive Against GOP

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore ripped into the GOP-led House and Senate
as a ''do-nothing-for-people'' Congress straitjacketed by special interests. He
challenged Republican presidential rival George W. Bush to spur lawmakers to
act. ''America could be just one phone call away'' from HMO reforms,
prescription drug benefits, environmental protections and a minimum-wage
increase, Gore said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press. The vice
president spoke by telephone from Air Force Two as he and wife Tipper headed for
''time to ourselves'' at a lakeside cabin near his family home in Carthage,
Tenn.

Gay Pride Celebration Ends
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- World Pride 2000 ended with a flourish today as tens of
thousands marched to the Colosseum in what amounted to a victorious coming-out
parade for Italy's gay community. Police estimated the crowd at 70,000, while
the organizers claimed more than 400,000 and state TV guessed it was as many as
200,000. The parade marked the end of an international event opposed by the
Vatican, the Italian right, conservative Catholics and neo-fascists. The
opposition boomeranged and instead focused attention to discrimination against
gays.

   TOKYO (AP) -- A typhoon that left a trail of death in the Philippines
pummeled eastern Japan on Saturday, killing three people, flooding cities,
snapping power lines and burying homes in landslides. After traveling up Japan's
Pacific coast, Typhoon Kirogi was headed for Hachinohe, a city 300 miles north
of Tokyo on Japan's main island of Honshu. Residents of Mito, northeast of
Tokyo, trudged knee-deep through torrents of muddy water that raced down streets
and lapped storefronts, TV footage showed.

Piazza Beaned in Head by Clemens
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza was hit in the helmet by Roger Clemens' fastball
the first time he came to the plate tonight, and forced to leave the second game
of the Mets-Yankees split doubleheader. The beaning came in the top of the
second inning at Yankee Stadium. In the bottom half, the Mets' Glendon Rusch hit
Tino Martinez in the backside with his second pitch. Martinez calmly took his
base as plate umpire Doug Eddings warned both teams against further trouble.
Piazza was taken to the hospital for X-rays. There was no immediate word on
Piazza's condition.

<HEADLINE> Prefontaine Inducted Into Run Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Steve Prefontaine, the former Oregon track
star who died in an auto accident in 1975, was inducted into the
National Distance Running Hall of Fame on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Prefontaine won seven NCAA titles and once held every American
record from 2,000 to 10,000 meters. He died at the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Salazar also was inducted along with nine-time New York
Marathon winner Grete Waitz and the late Clarence DeMar, a
seven-time Boston Marathon winner.
</P>
<P>
   Prefontaine was represented by his sister, Linda Prefontaine,
who spoke of his continued impact on today's young runners, on
those who admired him years ago and the convicts who built a
memorial to him in gratitude for his work with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve's greatest gift was not that he ran faster than the
competition or that he pushed himself past the pain threshold to
set American records,'' Linda Prefontaine said. ''It was that he
created and inspired determination and a will to succeed in
16-year-old high school girls who weren't born when he died, and
future fathers who will teach their sons about the fire within, and
prisoners in penitentiaries who might grow to understand honesty,
humility and integrity and change their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar won the New York Marathon three times, setting a world
record of 2:08.13 in 1981, and also won the 1982 Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Waitz, a top sprinter and then a world-class middle distance
runner in her native Norway, became an international star after
reluctantly entering her first marathon in New York in 1978 and
winning in world-record time.
</P>
<P>
   DeMar, an early long-distance running innovator who first won
Boston in 1911, was represented by his son, Robert DeMar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame also presented its George Sheehan Memorial
Award to Bert Rosenthal, the longtime Associated Press track and
field writer.

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Adrienne Johnson had 18 points and Nykesha
Sales scored all 16 of her points in the second half as Orlando
beat the Seattle Storm 64-53 Saturday night, the Miracle's fifth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle cut Orlando's lead to 46-42 on a basket by Simone
Edwards with 7:23 remaining. However, the Miracle pulled away with
an 11-2 run that made it 57-44 with 3:08 left. Seattle did not get
closer than 11 points the remainder of the game as the Miracle shot
69.6 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-15) shot 39.6 percent from the field en route to its
10th loss in 11 games. Edwards, a reserve, led the Storm in scoring
with 18 points as the starters shot just 10-for-27 from the field.
Only one other Seattle player, Sonja Henning, reached double
figures in scoring with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando (12-6) hit 13 of 16 free throws and also got nine points
and nine rebounds from Taj McWilliams. Cintia Dos Santos added 10
points. Johnson and Sales were a combined 11-for-13 from the field
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Each team started slowly with Orlando shooting 30.4 percent in
the first half and Seattle 29.6 percent. Orlando led 24-21 at
halftime despite missing its first nine shots to start the game.
The Miracle didn't make a field goal until Elaine Powell hit a
running jumper at the 12:23 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle made one of its first nine shots.

<HEADLINE> Bad News for Bosox Crawford, Nixon  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Rookie surprise Paxton Crawford figured to stay
with the Boston Red Sox longer. Right fielder Trot Nixon hoped to
be back sooner.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, the Red Sox sent Crawford back to Pawtucket of
the International League despite excelling in his first two
major-league starts.
</P>
<P>
   And Nixon, on the disabled list with a hamstring injury, had to
leave a Gulf Coast League game in Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was to return to Boston to have his condition
re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not going to be able to keep playing down there,''
Williams said. ''He had to come out of that game today because of
his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, now in his seventh pro season after being drafted in the
first round, established himself as an everyday contributor last
year when he hit .270 with 15 homers.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he was better, batting .292 with eight homers in 64
games. And he was fielding well before going on the disabled list
June 27 with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a ninth-round pick in 1995, got his chance when Pedro
Martinez went on the disabled list June 29 with a strained oblique
muscle in his left side. He's scheduled to come off it to pitch
Thursday against the New York Mets in Boston's first game after the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have to spend a month or two in Pawtucket, that's fine,''
Crawford said. ''I know I'll be here sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford allowed two earned runs in 5 1-3 innings in a 7-2 loss
to the Chicago White Sox in his debut July 1. He was even better
last Thursday when he got his first major-league win. He allowed
one run and six hits in seven innings of an 8-7 victory over
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid did fine,'' Williams said, but ''we have these other
pitchers to start after the break and he has to continue to start,
too. This will allow him to pitch, hopefully, next Thursday'' for
Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was sent down even though starters Pete Schourek and
Jeff Fassero have struggled. But Williams said, ''he came up for
Pedro and Pedro's coming off'' the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, 22, was 7-8 with a 4.08 ERA for Double-A Trenton last
season. He took his demotion in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think my heart rate went up one single beat'' when
Williams gave him the news after Saturday's 5-1 loss to Atlanta.
''You can't say much. Your wish is my command so I'm out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I got my first two big-league starts out of the way. I'll hope
for the best and keep on pitching.''

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Rushia Brown scored 24 points to lead the
Cleveland Rockers to an 80-59 victory over the Charlotte Sting on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting (3-15), who lost nine consecutive home games before
beating Miami 76-60 Wednesday, led 15-10 with 11:36 left in the
first half after a 12-foot jumper by Tiffany Travis.

play by Brown, and the Rockers (9-8) never trailed again.

   Chasity Melvin scored 16 points for the Rockers, who led 41-34
at halftime and hit 15-of-20 field-goal attempts in the second
half. Cleveland shot 60 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting, who shot 34 percent from the field, were led by
Andrea Stinson's 18 points. Rhonda Mapp added 14.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 13, Orioles 4  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Andy Ashby pitched eight strong innings as
the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Baltimore Orioles 13-4
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell, Mike Lieberthal and Rob Ducey each had three RBIs
to lead the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (4-7), pitching for the first time at Veterans Stadium
since getting into a shouting match with a fan as he was exiting a
game on June 28, allowed three runs -- one earned -- and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby struck out two and walked two to win his second straight
start as scouts from at least seven teams watched him. Ashby is
likely to be dealt before the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby allowed a pair of two-out unearned runs in the first, then
retired 11 in a row. He did not allow a hit after the first until
Delino DeShields singled to lead off the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mercedes (3-4) lasted three innings in his first start
since April 27. He allowed nine runs -- six earned -- and six hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took advantage of Mercedes' wildness and an error
to score five runs on two hits in the first.
</P>
<P>
   After Mickey Morandini singled with one out, Bobby Abreu and
Scott Rolen walked on eight pitches to load the bases. Morandini
scored when Lieberthal reached on an error by DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell walked to force in a run and tie it at 2. Ducey's single
made it 4-2 and a sacrifice fly by Alex Arias gave the Phillies a
5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell hit a two-run double in the third and Lieberthal added a
two-run double in the fourth. Burrell has 33 RBIs in 40 games since
being called up from Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, booed after allowing a run that made the score 11-3, had
two hits, including a RBI single. He has more hits (five) and RBIs
(five) than wins (four).
</P>
<P>
   The two-time All Star was acquired from San Diego in November to
solidify the rotation, but has been a disappointment. He's allowed
three runs or fewer in just six of his 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   His strong desire to test the free agent market after the season
has forced the Phillies to try to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Among those watching Ashby on Saturday were scouts from the New
York Yankees, New York Mets, Atlanta, Toronto, Cleveland, Arizona
and Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark's leadoff homer in the ninth off Steve Schrenk made
it 13-4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Phillies honored the 1950 pennant winning Whiz Kids
before the game. ... Burrell is 5-for-6 with 12 RBIs with the bases
loaded. ... The Phillies got hits from every starter except Doug
Glanville, who struck out four times. ... Lieberthal took over the
team lead with 53 RBIs, surpassing Rolen. ... Philadelphia can win
its seventh straight series with a victory Sunday. ... The Orioles
are 11-6 against the Phillies since interleague play began.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Western Ideal edged Dragon Again by
a head Saturday night in the $615,000 William Haughton Memorial
Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Western Ideal, a 5-year-old driven by Mike Lachance and trained
by Brett Pelling, matched his career best of 1:48 3-5 in pacing's

</P>
<P>
   ''My horse fought the whole stretch,'' Lachance said. ''At the
top of the stretch I thought I'd win by a couple lengths, but he
(Dragon Again) kept coming, it was a great duel.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Yankees-Mets, 1st Ld-Writethru,900  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Day, night. Queens, Bronx. It made no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees win. Yankees win.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden and Roger Clemens teamed up to shut down the Mets,
and the New York Yankees swept baseball's most unusual doubleheader
in 97 years by identical 4-2 scores.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez homered and drove in three runs in the opener at
Shea Stadium, then Chuck Knoblauch hit a three-run homer to win the
nightcap at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won for the third straight time in the Subway
Series, and took their fifth in a row overall. Mariano Rivera saved
both games, ensuring the World Series champions would head into the
All-Star break in first place in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everything went against the Mets - including the
traffic - as they failed to gain even a split in the split
twinbill.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine was ejected after the first pitch
of the day for arguing an obstruction call. He played the game
under protest.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Mike Piazza was hit in the helmet by Clemens' fastball
and sustained a slight concussion. He wound up in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And Knoblauch's game-turning homer escaped left fielder Lenny
Harris' glove. It ended up over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first double-ballpark doubleheader in the majors
since Sept. 7, 1903, when the New York Giants played the Brooklyn
Superbas, later the Dodgers. Both road teams won that day in games
at Brooklyn's Washington Park and the Giants' Polo Grounds - a year
later, New York city's subways opened.
</P>
<P>
   After the opener, many in the sellout crowd of 54,165 at Shea
immediately headed for Game 2, which drew 55,821. At both parks,
loyalties were divided.
</P>
<P>
   For fans, it took them about one hour to ride the No. 7 Flushing
train, change at Grand Central Terminal and catch the uptown No. 4
Lexington Avenue line to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 fans looked to get an early start - they watched from
a subway platform from beyond the right-field fence, perhaps drawn
by the promise of free tokens, which normally cost $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, their bats and bags packed in an equipment truck,
left less than an hour after the game. They rode a bus back over
the Triborough Bridge to their park, taking only 14 minutes. A
closed-off entrance to the Grand Central Parkway sped their path.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had lunch at the Diamond Club at Shea while waiting for
the clubhouse attendants to do laundry, then changed into their
road uniforms and rode a bus to Yankee Stadium. A police escort
helped, but none of the highways were cleared for them.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (6-6), hit hard throughout his career by Piazza and the
Mets, struck the first blow in the second game, which began 3&AMP;frac12;
hours after the opener ended.
</P>
<P>
   He hit Piazza in the helmet leading off the second inning, and
the slugger immediately crumbled to the ground. He was down for
about a minute and helped to his feet, and walked to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was taken to a hospital for further tests and was listed
as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half of the inning, Glendon Rusch (6-7) hit Tino
Martinez in the backside with his second pitch. With tension
running high, Martinez calmly walked to first base and plate umpire
Doug Eddings warned against further trouble. There wasn't any as
the Yankees increased their interleague series lead over the Mets
to 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo hit RBI singles in the Mets
fifth. In the bottom half, Scott Brosius singled home a run and
Knoblauch launched a drive that was in Harris' glove until he hit
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens went 7 1-3 innings, and Rivera pitched the ninth for his
21st save. Rusch struck out a career-high 10 in a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching from the very mound he once owned, Gooden (3-3)
celebrated his return to the big leagues with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, traded by Houston and cut by Tampa Bay earlier this
season, pitched at Shea for the first time since June 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular players in Mets' history, Gooden faced
his former team for the first time. The Yankees signed him to a
minor league contract on June 11 and promoted him before the game.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, the 1985 NL Cy Young winner who helped the Mets win the
1986 World Series did not throw as hard as he once did, struggling
to reach 90 mph with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden gave up two runs and six hits, keeping the Mets
off-balance with off-speed stuff. He struck out one and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (3-4) fell behind 2-0 in the first inning.
Martinez's solo home run in the sixth made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch led off the game with a hit to center field and was
thrown out trying to stretch it into a double.
</P>
<P>
   But first base umpire Robb Cook ruled that first baseman Todd
Zeile had gotten in Knoblauch's way, and awarded him second.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine sprung from the dugout and engaged all four umpires in
an argument, tracing Knoblauch's steps in the freshly raked dirt.
Replays showed that Zeile, though he never touched Knoblauch, stood
in his path and made him take a wide turn.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 6, Devil Rays 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins overcame a season-high four
errors to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-5 on Saturday night when
Esteban Yan walked Preston Wilson with the bases loaded in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the Devil Rays came back from a 4-0 deficit to take a 5-4
lead in the eighth, reliever Rick White (3-5) gave up a leadoff
single to pinch-hitter Mark Smith which started the Marlins'
two-run winning rally.
</P>
<P>
   After Dave Berg and Luis Castillo walked to load the bases, Mark
Guthrie came on. Mark Kotsay hit a one-hop smash to third base that
Vinny Castilla couldn't handle for an error that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Yan came on and got ahead of Wilson 0-2 before
throwing four straight balls to give Florida the 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth to pick up his major
league-leading 27th in 30 chances. Bubba Trammell hit into a
game-ending double play with runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reached base four times, on two hits, a walk and a hit
batsman and drove in two.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had gone ahead 5-4 when Braden Looper (3-1) threw
a wild pitch that allowed John Flaherty to score.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo had three hits, including two doubles, and scored two
runs to help Florida take a 4-0 lead after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the four errors and a run-scoring passed ball helped Tampa
tie the game at 4 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins left fielder Cliff Floyd made a throwing error and
booted a single for back-to-back errors in the sixth, allowing
Gerald Williams to score on Miguel Cairo's single.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive walks loaded the bases, Ricky Bones came on
and got Castilla to pop out to third. However, Mike Lowell's throw
to Bones, who was covering third, got loose and Cairo scored to
make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Martinez singled to start the seventh, and went to third
on pinch-hitter Jose Guillen's infield single that Luis Castillo
threw away. Cairo's sacrifice fly made it 4-3. Guillen scored the
tying run when catcher Mike Redmond mishandled a called-strike
three to Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee's RBI double in the fifth made it 3-0 and knocked out
Tampa starter Steve Trachsel, his shortest outing in his last eight
starts. Alex Gonzalez added an RBI single to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel allowed 10 hits and four runs in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd had a sacrifice fly in the first and Wilson added a RBI
single in the third to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Trachsel hit two batters in the first two innings after
plunking only four in 107 1/3 innings entering the game. ... Tampa
Bay SS Felix Martinez appeared to twist his right ankle when he
tripped over the second-base bag while faking a pickoff play. He
remained in the game. ... Trachsel allowed a season-high 10 hits
for the third time in 19 starts this season. ... Castillo had two
doubles and a single by the fourth inning for his third consecutive
three-hit game - the third time in his career he has pulled that
off.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Television judges who act like comedians while
presiding over petty disputes are among the dangers to the nation's
court system, said the judge receiving an American Bar Association
honor on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The law is not something to belittle, retired Louisiana Supreme
Court Justice Revius Ortique said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is so important for us to maintain the dignity of the court
system and not allow groups to deprecate the judiciary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortique, 75, discussed dangers to the court system in his
acceptance speech for Saturday night's presentation of the Thurgood
Marshall Award, the ABA's highest civil rights honor. The award was
presented in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ortique's career has spanned more than 50 years as a labor
leader, lawyer, state representative, judge and public servant
appointed to posts by five presidents.
</P>
<P>
   His topic did not surprise colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael Cassimere Jr., a University of New Orleans history
professor, remembered Ortique's instructions to young activists who
set out to integrate public accommodations in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He told them to act properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He stressed that if we were successful in desegregating lunch
counters and snack bars with no difficulty, it would be easier to
go to the next step,'' said Cassimere, who at the time was
president of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People's Youth Council.
</P>
<P>
   For Ortique, son of a Southern Pacific Lines messenger who never
graduated from high school but vowed his four children all would go
to college, there was always a next step.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime service on Army tribunals gave him a taste for the law.
In the 1950s, he and Louisiana Federation of Labor leader Victor
Bussie worked to integrate local unions. As a private lawyer in the
late 1950s and early 1960s, Ortique represented workers in landmark
civil rights cases involving equal pay for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first black judge on Civil District Court, and in
1992 he became the first black elected to the Louisiana Supreme
Court. He is now chairman of the New Orleans Aviation Board and an
alternate U.S. delegate to the United Nations, his most recent
presidential appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic and two Republican presidents named him to
posts ranging from a commission investigating campus unrest to the
board overseeing the Legal Services Corp., which represents poor
clients.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, without law on the books as support,
persuasion was the only weapon available to activists such as
Ortique, said Bussie, the labor leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was excellent,'' Bussie said. ''Not only was he a great
speaker, he honestly and sincerely believed what he was saying, and
that makes a big difference when you are trying to persuade
people.''

US Officials Worry Over AIDS Resurgence
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- While AIDS infections in the United States have
fallen dramatically since their peak in the 1980s, public health officials worry
that complacency about the disease has caused backsliding -- especially among
young gay men -- that could bring AIDS roaring back. ''I'm scared by the trends
we are starting to see,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, AIDS chief at the U.S. Centers
for disease Control and Prevention. Gayle presented the latest data Saturday at

parade for Italy's gay community. Police estimated the crowd at 70,000, while
the organizers claimed more than 400,000 and state TV guessed it was as many as
200,000. The parade marked the end of an international event opposed by the
Vatican, the Italian right, conservative Catholics and neo-fascists. The
opposition boomeranged and instead focused attention to discrimination against

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to correct slug  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Fourteen minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer afternoon, it can take two hours to get from Shea
Stadium in Queens to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But when you close two major highways and one of the city's
busiest bridges, put police cars and motorcycles ahead and behind,
travel in a Subway Series takes less time than three outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this all the time. They treat us good,'' Paul
O'Neill said after the Yankees zoomed home to the Bronx on Saturday
in the middle of their 4-2, 4-2 sweep of the Mets, baseball's first
moving doubleheader in 97 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just 48 minutes after the final out in the opener at Shea, the
Yankees were showered and back in street clothes, filling three
buses parked beyond the right-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was open highway. When an unfortunate motorist
tried to pass the motorcade, he was pulled over faster than a
Mariano Rivera fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a presidential escort today, it seemed like,'' Andy
Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred fans cheered them as they left Queens, a few dozen
stood on overpasses of the Grand Central Parkway. Then, after they
went over the Triborough Bridge - three news helicopters flying
overhead - there were more fans cheering beside the Major Deegan
Expressway, some holding up signs.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:39 p.m, 62 minutes after the final out, they were outside
the big ballpark in Bronx, with 200 fans there to great their
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees were changing into their famous pinstripes,
the Mets were up in the Diamond Club at Shea Stadium, having an
early dinner, sushi included, with their families before their trip
to the Bronx. After the meal, there was this strange sight: road
grays hanging in their Shea Stadium clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like thousands of high school and college players, the
Mets put on their uniforms and got on the buses, already dressed to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a Legion game or something,'' said Todd Zeile, who
videotaped the trip with his camcorder. ''The fan reception was a
little different from legion ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets traveled, police didn't shut down the highways and
bridges - they cleared only one lane. It took them 20 minutes, and
they walked in at 6:58 p.m., 70 minutes before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we went later in the afternoon,'' John Franco said,
trying to explain the second-class treatment.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets walked off their two buses - with another for
family right behind - there were about a thousand fans outside
Yankee Stadium, some chanting, ''Let's go Mets!'' others booing.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I signed here, one of the reasons was the passion of the
fans,'' said Zeile, who came to the Mets in December as a free
agent. ''This is something that raises the level of play, or should
test you as an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the major leagues saw anything like this, a tale
of two ballparks in one city, was Sept. 7, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the venues were Washington Park in Brooklyn and the
Polo Grounds in Manhattan, just across the Harlem River from where
Yankee Stadium was later built two decades later. The New York
Giants won 6-4 on the road before 9,300 on that Labor Day morning -
first pitch was 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Superbas - as Brooklyn was known back before the Dodgers
nickname took hold - won the afternoon game 3-0 when Henry Schmidt
pitched a four-hitter before 23,623.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of that day don't describe how fans transported
themselves from ballpark to ballpark - trolleys and elevated trains
were available - or even if they did.
</P>
<P>
   This time, fans had numerous choices - subways (including John
Rocker's favorite, the No. 7 IRT), cars and even ferry boats. A
company even ran a promotion for 3,000 fans to travel gratis on the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who usually takes the No. 4 train from
Manhattan to the ballpark, knew about the program, but took the
team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's free travel if you show your two tickets stubs,''
the Yankees second baseman said kiddingly, ''but I don't have my
two ticket stubs. I'm sure that they're a lot of people going to
both games to say they went to both games.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea Stadium had been filled to the brim, 54,165, with slightly
more Mets fans in evidence. Yankee Stadium drew a sellout, too:
55,821.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where traditions die slowly if at all, Mets' fans
still are considered by some to be baseball nouveau riche, with
only two World Series titles, unending noise from jetliners landing
at nearby LaGuardia Airport and that garish flashing home-run apple
in right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were America's team before there was an ''America's
team,'' the proud winner of 25 championships, whose field is
hallowed ground, containing monuments and plaques honoring many of
the sport's patron saints.
</P>
<P>
   Players have said the two-ballpark twinbill was an
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not just on fans, but on players, media, equipment managers,''
Knoblauch said. ''It's only fun if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Mets clubhouse, all wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   ''First problem of the day,'' Turk Wendell yelled out. ''I
brought two left shoes.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers 8, Padres 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro and David Segui homered,
and Rick Helling pitched seven strong innings as the Texas Rangers
beat the San Diego Padres 8-1 Saturday night for their fifth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (10-7) allowed just one run and three hits to help the
Rangers move to .500 (42-42) for the first time since June 10. He
struck out seven and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who drove in the game-winner with a 10th-inning single in
Friday night's 5-4 victory over the Padres, had three hits and two
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's two-run blast in the seventh extended the Rangers'
lead to 8-1. Luis Alicea also had three hits and reached base four
times for the Rangers, winners of eight of their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   The slumping Padres have lost six of their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got first-inning RBI singles off rookie Adam Eaton
(1-1) from Palmeiro and Segui. Eaton walked Luis Alicea and Dave
Martinez to lead off the game, and both came around to score.
</P>
<P>
   Texas made it 4-0 in the second on consecutive triples by Alicea
and Martinez, and Rusty Greer's run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Segui led off the third with a homer to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego broke through in the fifth on Kevin Nicholson's triple
and Eric Owens' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, who had no-decisions in six straight starts, allowed five
runs and 10 hits over six innings. He struck out two and walked
three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmeiro has 23 homers this season and 384 for his career,
one behind Dwight Evans for 37th on the career list. ... Ivan
Rodriguez wasn't in the Rangers starting lineup. The All-Star
catcher was rested by manager Johnny Oates. ... The Rangers'
winning streak is their longest since a seven-game stretch in May.
... The Padres are 1-7 in interleague play this season. ... Texas
has at least two doubles in each of its last 12 games.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 11, Dodgers 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- With All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez sidelined
by a concussion, the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Dodgers
11-0 Saturday night as Aaron Sele won his fourth straight start.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (11-3) won for the ninth time in his last 10 decisions,
Edgar Martinez had his 87th RBI and his 100th hit, and John Olerud
hit a three-run homer, a 417-foot shot to center in the third
inning that gave the Mariners a 4-0 lead. Olerud added a two-run
double in seventh to give him five RBIs for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Sele pitched seven scoreless innings, giving up three hits and
four walks, while striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who was struck in the head by Dodgers shortstop Alex
Cora's knee Friday night, will be out of action for a week and will
miss starting in the All-Star game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 1-0 lead in the second off rookie Eric Gagne
(1-5) on Joe Oliver's infield hit. After Olerud's eighth homer of
the season, David Bell added a sacrifice fly in the third to make
the score 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Mariners made it 9-0 on Martinez's RBI
double, Carlos Guillen came in on a wild pitch by reliever Jamie
Arnold, a sacrifice fly by Jay Buhner and Bell's RBI infield
single.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne gave up eight runs, seven hits and four walks in 3 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rodriguez was hospitalized for the night while trying to
break up a double play on Martinez's ground ball. Martinez,
Seattle's DH, is not quick down the first-base line. ''It was
tough,'' Rodriguez said before the game. ''Edgar is not exactly
Carl Lewis.'' ... Mike Cameron returned to center field for the
Mariners after missing two games because of a stiff right knee.
After going 1-for-14 in a four-game series against Anaheim, Cameron
was 0-for-2 with two walks. ... Martinez, whose RBI total is a
franchise high before the All-Star break, lost his 88th RBI when a
fan reached out of the seats along the left-field line and grabbed
his double, keeping Guillen from scoring. The fan was ejected. ...
Bell, the Mariners' third baseman, flipped over the railing into
the Dodgers' dugout when he attempted to catch Cora's foul ball in
the seventh. ... Olerud matched his career high with five RBIs.
He's done it five times. The last time was Aug. 22. 1999, vs. St.
Louis while with the Mets.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza was hit in the helmet by Roger
Clemens' fastball Saturday night and sustained a concussion that
forced him to leave the second game of the Mets-Yankees split
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza will miss Sunday's finale of the four-game series, Mets
spokesman Jay Horwitz said, but may be able to play in Tuesday's
All-Star game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine claimed the beaning was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ''My player who's had pretty good success against their pitcher
got hit in the head,'' he said. ''I've seen him hit guys in the
head before.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he wanted to pitch inside, but said the beaning was
accidental and left him shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to hear he's all right,'' the pitcher said. ''It was
supposed to be in. I wanted it to be belt high.''
</P>
<P>
   The beaning came in the top of the second at Yankee Stadium. In
the bottom half, the Mets' Glendon Rusch hit Tino Martinez in the
backside with his second pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez calmly took his base as plate umpire Doug Eddings
warned both teams against further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's part of the game,'' Rusch said. ''You need to do what
has to be done. I obviously didn't want to do what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to back Martinez off, not hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got away from me,'' Rusch said. ''Obviously, I didn't want
to put a guy on in a 0-0 game.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was examined by Yankees team Dr. Stuart Hershon at the
ballpark, then taken to the Hospital for Special Surgery and
examined by Dr. John Coronna, who had X-rays taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a little bit groggy,'' Hershon said. ''He appeared to
be stable. But I felt it best that he be seen for some
precautionary tests. ... In these situations it's best to take
precautions. But I think he will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who had homered in three straight games against Clemens,
was sent sprawling by an 0-1 pitch to start the inning. Two
trainers and Valentine rushed from the dugout to tend to Piazza,
and Clemens walked toward the plate for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza stayed on the ground for a minute, was helped up by a
trainer and walked to the bench. Several of the Mets moved to the
top step of the dugout, and coach John Stearns seemed particularly
animated.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco entered as a pinch-runner and stayed in as the
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, elected to start at catcher for the NL in Tuesday
night's All-Star game, is 7-for-12 lifetime against Clemens with
three homers and a double.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had three hits and drove in three runs at Shea Stadium
earlier in the day as the Yankees won 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez was hit, Eddings went to the mound to talk to
Rusch. Valentine, ejected after one pitch of the opener, waved his
arms while arguing with crew chief Tim Welke, but remained in the
game. Yankees manager Joe Torre came out to talk with Eddings.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the beaning was accidental, claiming the Yankees
wouldn't want to stir up the Mets after winning the first two games
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game has changed quite a bit,'' Torre said. ''My first
time around the league, I was thrown at many times, just to see how
I'd respond to it. That was part of the game. It's no longer part
of the game.''
