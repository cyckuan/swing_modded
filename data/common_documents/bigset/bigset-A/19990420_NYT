 &HT;    Children's bodies found; illing suspected
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTTO, Texas _ The bodies of two small childrn _ apparent
homicide victims _ were found in a shallow creek near a cemetery
late Monday afternoon, according to Williamson County Sheriff Ed
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's investigators do not know the identities of the
children, both of whom had visible injuries and seemed to be about
3 or 4 years old, Richards said. Richards would not describe the
children's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things at the scene I cannot discuss,'' Richards
said.
</P>
<P>
   No children matching either of their descriptions have been
reported missing in the area, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have none reported that fits this at all,'' Richards said.
Several other Central Texas law enforcement agencies also said they
had no unsolved reports of missing pre-school children.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the children had only been dead ``a short
while'' and that the deaths were not accidental, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was an accident, you'd think someone would have reported
it by now,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had anything like this in a while,'' he said.
``It's very disturbing when any person appears to be murdered,
especially when it's small children. Hopefully, someone can call
and tell us about two children who are missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators do not believe the dead girl is either of the
girls reported missing recently from the Irving and Fort Worth
areas, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   The dead girl could match the description of Cristy Ryno, a
3-year-old from Irving reported missing on Saturday, Richards said,
adding it was ``very unlikely'' they are the same person.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department issued a statewide bulletin describing
the children and has been in touch with authorities investigating
Ryno's disappearance. Members of the Irving Police Department and
FBI agents may be in Williamson County today, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple walking along Brushy Creek near County Road 137
discovered the children's bodies shortly before 5 p.m. and reported
the discovery at Hutto City Hall, said Mel Yantis, Hutto city
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty upset,'' Yantis said. ``She and her husband
were out just walking along the creek apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocky creek bed where the bodies were found is about 100
feet from the county road, down a rough path that leads to a steep
dropoff, which bottoms out at a gravel bank. The children were in
about six inches of water near the bank of the roughly 35-foot-wide
creek, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The area is surrounded by corn fields and a few scattered farm
houses. The Hutto Cemetery also is nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common place for people to stop and go down to the
creek,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies were taken to Condra Funeral Home in Taylor, and an
autopsy is planned for today at a location that had not been
determined as of Monday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators received one call concerning the dead children
Monday night, ``but it did not pan out,'' Richards said.

 &HT;    Inside game lifts Rockets to win
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Rockets lost one of their best players Monday, but
for one night, at least, they were able to duck the fallout from
the absence of Othella Harrington, who will miss the remainder of
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Using their strong inside game to open up the perimeter for
three-pointers, the Rockets defeated Seattle 120-113 at the Compaq
Center. Charles Barkley scored 25 points, including 13 in the
fourth quarter. Hakeem Olajuwon added 24 and Scottie Pippen scored
22.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (27-14) hit 13 of 27 three-point shots. Sam Mack
provided the bulk of the treys, making seven of 11 to score all 21
of his points from behind the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, the Rockets' top reserve and fourth-leading scorer,
will miss a minimum of two weeks after undergoing surgery Monday on
his left foot to drain a bacterial infection. The infection is
under a soft corn in Harrington's foot and was the result of a cut
between two toes that did not properly heal.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the 6-foot-9-inch Harrington was more than
negated by Seattle having to play without third-leading scorer Vin
Baker, who has a sore right knee. Baker is no defensive star, but
he is 6 feet, 11 inches, and the Sonics could have used his height
inside, where Olajuwon, Barkley and Pippen dominated the game. When
Seattle tried to help inside on Barkley and Olajuwon, they passed
the ball outside for three-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   Detlef Schrempf led Seattle with 28 points, five more than Gary
Payton, who also had 15 assists. Dale Ellis scored 22.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who would be a strong MVP candidate if the Sonics were
better than 19-22, had no impact during the first half, when
Houston took a 56-45 lead. He missed all eight of his shots,
scoring only on a pair of free throws. Payton extended his streak
to nine missed shots early in the third quarter, then he suddenly
went to work, scoring 17 points in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed by only five late in the third quarter, but
Mack hit consecutive three-pointers to provide some separation.
Barkley then held Seattle off in the fourth quarter, scoring 10
straight points.

BRAVE YOUNG MEN STOP RUNAWAY CAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Johnny Lara and his two buddies felt fortunate to
come across famed hot rod enthusiast Louis Senter as he worked on
his flashy yellow 1923 Model T roadster, the same one as on the
cover of Hot Rod magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Senter said Monday he's actually the fortunate one: The
1,300-pound hot rod rolled on top of him while he was talking with
the three _ and they managed to pull him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would have kept going with me under it. I was
lucky that the boys were there,'' said Senter, a burly 78-year-old
who escaped with only a broken right ankle and injured left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The trio _ Lenny Trujillo, 16, Lara, 18, and Roland Gomez, 29 _
said anyone would have had the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, anybody would do it. If I would have been the one under
the car, he would have done it,'' said Lara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary because there were cars coming in the
opposite direction and they had to swerve,'' Lara recalled. ``I
thought he was hurt really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   To thank the trio, Senter plans to give them a session about how
to build hot rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really very nice. I'll give the kids a little
talk,'' said Senter, who has built three Indianapolis 500 racers
and displays his street rod in shows and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred about 9:10 p.m. Friday on a street in
suburban Reseda when Senter's car stalled on the way home from a
car show. While working on the car, the rod rolled backward over
him, pinning him to the ground and crushing his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started right on me. It started rolling backward and I
tried to run to turn the key off, but the left front wheel caught
me. Next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground,'' Senter said.
</P>
<P>
   The three had been at a church sleepover nearby and were playing
football when the flashy car captured their attention. Minutes
after they began talking to him, the car jolted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the car just turned on and went in reverse.
The man tried to hold the car back, but it dragged him,'' said
Trujillo, a Reseda resident.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez and Trujillo found the ignition switch under the dashboard
and turned it off. ``He had so many switches on his car. I finally
switched the right one off,'' said Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed the car forward and Rolando helped him up,''
Trujillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Senter later realized that he had inadvertently knocked the
vehicle in gear before turning on the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Senter said he has learned a lesson: He will
install the safety switch he's been meaning to install for years on
his street rod.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thompson, a parishioner at International Missionary Church
who was working with a youth group at the time of the accident,
also lauded the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sets an excellent example. Not everyone gets
involved. I think they acted without any regard for their own
safety. They acted on impulse, and I'm proud of them,'' Thompson
said.

   Rep. Hall nominated for Nobel prize
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy R. Gaffney
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A fellow lawmaker and two foreign officials have
nominated U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) for the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time in as many years that Hall has been
nominated for his efforts to reduce world hunger and promote
humanitarian concerns. He's one of 136 candidates for the prize, a
Hall aide said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those nominating Hall is Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., who
also nominated Hall last year. The others are Tsutomu Hata, a
former Japanese prime minister and current member of parliament,
and Hussain Muhammad Ershad, former president of Bangladesh and
current parliament member.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who learned about the nomination from the Norwegian Nobel
Committee, said the three nominated him separately. The committee
will announce the winner in October.
</P>
<P>
   Hata noted Hall's efforts to reduce hunger in North Korea, and
Ershad was familiar with Hall's efforts to reduce suffering in
Bangladesh after it was swept by terrible floods, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall worked in the Peace Corps and has promoted humanitarian
causes since he began serving in Congress in 1979. He was chairman
of the former House Select Committee on Hunger and chairs the
Congressional Hunger Center .
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 25 million people in our own country who are
hungry,'' Hall said. ``Overseas, you've got 1 billion people who
are malnourished.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, John Hume and David Trimble won the peace prize for
their efforts to end the conflict in Northern Ireland. Other
recipients have included Mother Theresa, Martin Luther King Jr.,
Albert Schweitzer, and presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' Hall said. ``I really don't deserve to
be in that kind of company, but I'm not complaining.''

L.A. SCHOOL TO SHED GANG-TIED NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Blythe Street Elementary School doesn't print
sweat shirts or bumper stickers with its name for a simple reason:
A notorious gang uses the street's name, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's opposed to having their kids walk around with a
gang name on their T-shirts,'' parent Sandra Cervantes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So now parents and teachers at the quiet campus in suburban
Reseda are working to rename the school and started canvassing the
community for suggestions. They plan to select the winner with a
public vote this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Students aware of the reputation of the gang whose home turf is
several miles to the east welcome the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me scared, because I think that a gang member is
going to come to the school and do something to us,'' said Vanessa
Castillo, 9.
</P>
<P>
   The 450-student campus is not even close to the stretch of
Blythe Street in Panorama City where the gang operates. The school
lies several miles to the west, tucked among pine trees on a
secluded strip of Blythe in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is so bad on the gang-occupied section of Blythe
Street that residents there have proposed changing the street's
name, trying to rechristen part of the street Amber Way.
</P>
<P>
   Parents at Blythe Street Elementary have talked about renaming
the campus for years, Cervantes said. To make sure it finally
becomes a reality, they formed a name-change committee with some of
the school's staff members and started asking the community for
suggestions earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Students, parents, teachers and administrators have until April
30 to pitch new names. The committee then will research the
suggestions, narrow the field to perhaps five finalists and ask the
community to vote for its favorite in June. Any proposed change
must be approved by the Los Angeles school board to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The source of inspiration for a new name can be most anyone or
anything, Cervantes said. Well, anything positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking it should be the Mr. Castro School,'' said Juan
Gomez, 9, explaining that Castro is his homeroom teacher. ``He
helps us learn math and reading. He's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Cruz, 11, suggested naming the school after Harriet
Tubman. Other students would rather take the name of their favorite
television star, Cervantes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we want the teachers to work with students on
selecting names,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Angeles schools rarely switch names, they will
occasionally take on a new identity to honor a local hero.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Board of Education is scheduled to vote on
whether 102nd Street School in Watts can become the Florence
Griffith-Joyner School and on whether Crenshaw's Dublin Fundamental
Magnet School can rename itself after former Mayor Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Julie Korenstein said she's not aware of another
school switching identities out of concern that crime had tarred
its original name. But if parents believe the change would help
shield students or boost pride in the school, she said, she would
support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever needs to be done to protect the children, it's a good
thing,'' she said.

COULD HARRIS HAVE HANDLED RODMAN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Dennis Rodman and Del Harris barely passed each
other in the Forum hallway on their respective ways in and out of
the building Feb. 23. Rodman was hired the same day Harris was
fired, and at least one person who knows Rodman well believes
that's where the problems began.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls assistant coach Frank Hamblen, who became close to
Rodman in his three seasons with the Bulls, was consulted by
Harris, an old friend, before the Lakers signed Rodman. Hamblen
thought Rodman would be a good fit for the Harris-led Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But then Harris was dismissed and Kurt Rambis was promoted to
rookie head coach status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't a good situation, as it turned out,'' Hamblen
said, ``I thought Del would be there _ a veteran coach who would
have had a better handle on the team. The Lakers made so many
changes, it turned out not to be a good situation. I just don't
think there's much leadership out there.... Dennis ended up being
the show, which wasn't a good situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bull, Ron Harper, added his voice to the chorus of NBA
insiders who believe the 38-year-old Rodman is through playing
professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to see that happen,'' Harper said of Rodman's
termination last week. ``I thought he would last at least until the
season was through.... I guess I'm kind of shocked, but then again,
I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq on top: Not that he cares, but Shaquille O'Neal regained
the lead in the NBA scoring race for the first time since early
this season. Philadelphia's Allen Iverson scored just six points
Sunday, dropping his scoring average to 26.1, behind O'Neal's 26.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he gets it,'' O'Neal said. ``He's working hard, he's
playing hard. Whoever gets it, I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal repeated his general philosophy on scoring titles, MVP
trophies and all other nonchampionship honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mean's nothing to me. Just winning,'' he said. ``Right
now my team ain't winning, so nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: The revolving door on the Lakers' training room
spun again Monday. Rick Fox, nursing a sore right knee suffered
during his 24-point performance Saturday at Utah, did not dress for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper, who missed the Utah game with a sore right foot,
was in uniform Monday but was held out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes just as the Lakers got a relatively healthy Glen
Rice back from a bout with tonsillitis.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a coach feel a bit insecure about his
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go home with peace of mind, I know that,'' Rambis
said.

 &HT;    Ohio filmmaker shows latest effort at L.A. festival
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every filmmaker dreams of connecting with an
audience. Dayton, Ohio-area director Ed Radtke made people laugh
and moved many to tears with The Dream Catcher , a locally produced
drama that had its world premiere Sunday afternoon at the fifth
annual Los Angeles Independent Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The sold-out premiere at the Directors Guild of America Theater
on Sunset Boulevard drew the likes of pioneering independent film
director Paul Bartel ( Eating Raoul ) and Academy Award-winning
actress Marisa Tomei. The emotionally involving film, largely shot
in Ohio's Miami Valley, was acclaimed for its subtle direction,
strong performances and stunning cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of praise was remarkable,'' said producer Steven
Bognar of Yellow Springs, Ohio. ``People were gushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Bork, a transplanted Beavercreek, Ohio native who won
recent Emmy and Golden Globe Awards as a writer-producer of Tom
Hanks' HBO series, ``From the Earth to the Moon ,'' called Radtke's
film powerful and compelling from beginning to end. ``I was in
tears at the end, as was the person next to me, who didn't know the
filmmaker and had never seen the film,'' Bork said. ``I guess the
highest praise I could say is it makes me wish I was back in Ohio,
part of this group of filmmakers and working with them. It's
humbling. It's so good it's truly humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright State University Theatre Department chairman W. Stuart
McDowell, wiping tears from his eyes in the lobby after the
screening, said the film is exceptional. ``I'm so proud of them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomei, who won an Oscar for My Cousin Vinny , praised the film's
cinematography, as well as its honesty. ``There were no lies in
anything _ the acting, the writing, the way it unfolded,'' she
said. ``It was just really honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Catcher is a road drama about two delinquent
teen-agers who hitchhike from Dayton to Reno, Nev. Freddy (Maurice
Compte) is faced with becoming a teen-aged dad and is searching for
his own father, recently released from prison. Albert (Paddy
Connor) is a youthful runaway en route to Reno, where his mother
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty personal,'' Radtke, 36, told the festival
audience. ``By the time I was 18, I was a convicted felon and a
father.'' Like his characters, the Japanese-American Bellbrook
native hitchhiked and hopped freight trains. He said the film was a
way to deal with his past and move beyond it. ``I thought it would
be a wonderful backdrop for a story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radtke earned an NEA Filmmaking Production Grant and a
Guggenheim Fellowship, which became the initial financing for the
film, and used a predominantly local crew.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making the trip from Dayton were producer Julia
Reichert and editor Jim Klein, both Wright State film professors;
film-score composer Georgiana Gomez; and casting director Alison
Kennedy Maier. Radtke was also joined by his parents, Jim and
Kazuko Radtke of Bellbrook; his brother, John; and his
screenwriting partner, Marc Nieson of Minneapolis, Minn. ``He's
gone too far not to share this with him,'' Nieson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's premiere was the first time Radtke and company saw the
film projected in its entirety. The fifth and final reel didn't
arrive until Friday from the film-processing lab in New York City.
Unable to screen the film beforehand, Radtke and Bognar partially
unspooled each reel on Sunday afternoon to ensure that each was
numbered correctly. ``I think it's just a matter of nervousness,''
Reichert said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Catcher premiered with opening titles but only partial
end credits, because of problems with the crawl. ``The print is
still going to be wet,'' Radtke said on Sunday morning. ``It's the
reality of the process. We haven't seen the film ourselves and have
been busting our butts to get it done and get it done well.'' The
credit sequence will be completed by Thursday in time for the
film's New York premiere at the Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Independent Film Festival opened last Thursday
with the world premiere of Phil Joanou's romantic comedy, Entropy ,
starring Stephen Dorff, Lauren Holly, Hector Elizondo, Bono and U2.
It closes tonight with the premiere of George Hickenlooper's The
Big Brass Ring , a political drama adapted from an Orson Welles
screenplay, starring William Hurt and Miranda Richardson. The
festival was expected to draw 25,000 people, with film distributors
chief among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular festival is unique in that because it's in Los
Angeles, so many of the buyers are actually here, so it makes our
jobs a little easier because the right people might actually be
attending,'' said Ira Deutchman, the producer's representative who
would negotiate the sale of Radtke's film. ``Whereas if you to
smaller, regional film festivals, as much of an honor it is to be
in them, you may not have the buyers there. So it's the best thing
about it and it's also the most nerve-racking thing about it,
because all the distributors will be there ... for better or for
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who see it are important to the future of the
film,'' Radtke said.
</P>
<P>
   The director and producers met with Deutchman for 1 hours
Saturday night to discuss strategy and assuage nervousness. He
advised them to be modest in their expectations. ``We're not going
to sell the film (Monday) night,'' Reichert said. ``That's just not
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's premiere was most likely attended by lower-level
distribution executives who would report back to their superiors.
The best gauge of the screening's success would be ticket requests
for the second showing Monday night. No calls for tickets would
indicate that the distributors were not advising their higher-ups
to see the film; an influx of industry requests would imply
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the overwhelming response to the premiere, the
filmmakers were cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you hope for,'' Deutchman said. ``Get a crowd in
there to see it and get that kind of reaction. Step one
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the film was beautiful,'' said Bognar, basking in
the accolades that immediately followed. ``I feel very thrilled to
see it as it should be seen, and I need a beer.''

EDMONDS OUT FOUR MONTHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO -- Jim Edmonds, whose talent on the baseball field is
matched only by his penchant for injuries, has decided to have
surgery on his right shoulder and will be out through the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels center fielder arrived at Edison Field Monday morning
planning to take batting practice in front of hitting coach Rod
Carew, and if all went well, he would make the trip with the team
to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But the shoulder, which has bothered him for the past four
years, wouldn't allow Edmonds to swing a bat and he finally decided
to have the arthroscopic procedure, which will repair a torn labrum
and ``tighten up the shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum will perform the surgery
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried a variety of avenues, via medication and therapy,
to treat the shoulder,'' Yocum said. ``The surgery should allow for
full return of arm strength, but we will know more following the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minimum amount of recuperation time should be roughly four
months.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Edmonds will have surgery is only the latest in a
career filled with aches and pains. Before this season, Edmonds had
been placed on the disabled list three times during his five year
career, not to mention the numerous times he has missed a game or
two at a time because of an injury. And it continued just before
the start of this season, when Edmonds was placed on the disabled
list April 4 because of a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   It was later revealed that Edmonds aggrevated his shoulder
lifting weights only three days before the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds shoulder has been a source of pain for the past four
years because of the way he plays, diving for balls and crashing
into outfield fences. But he has ``kept it real strong for the last
year-and-a-half by lifting weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he said he considered having surgery during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have got it done last year probably,'' Edmonds said
during the Angels season-opening series. ``I just didn't want to
have surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's a reality, and the Angels seemed to have settled
their dilemma of what to do with too many outfielders. Garret
Anderson is the center fielder, Tim Salmon is the right fielder and
Darin Erstad will move back to left from first base once Mo Vaughn
returns from his ankle injury. Vaughn is due back Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' Angels pitcher Chuck Finley said when informed of the
news on Edmonds. ``We've got to move on, we can't worry about that
stuff. Nothing shocks us anymore. We're a good team, we'll move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the absence of Vaughn and Edmonds, the Angels are
also without starting shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who is recovering
from surgery to repair a broken bone in his left forearm. He's
expected back around the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worry about not only Edmonds' injury, but everyone,''
Angels pitcher Shigetoshi Hasegawa said. ``If we stay healthy, we
can win. If everybody stays hurt we're not going to win. We learned
that last year. Still, we can win right now, and Mo Vaughn's coming
back.''

EDITORIAL: DEFINING `DISABILITY' DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 20:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade after it was enthusiastically signed into law by
President Bush, the Americans with Disabilities Act faces a major
review by the Supreme Court. Over the next two weeks, the justices
are to hear four cases that will help define the true dimensions of
the law. The court's role should be to reaffirm the nation's
commitment to fair treatment of people with some kind of physical
or mental impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow the court will take up the first of the cases,
involving two Georgia women diagnosed with mild retardation, mental
illness and brain damage. Georgia is challenging a sound appellate
court decision that held that the act, and a 1991 regulation
designed to carry it out, forbid the states to segregate
individuals in an institution when a small, supervised group home
would be medically and socially more appropriate. Some 58 former
state commissioners and mental health directors from 36 states,
including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have filed an
amicus brief, urging the court to reject Georgia's ``alarmist
claims'' about the fiscal impact of requiring an end to unnecessary
segregation of the mentally disabled. By following that wise and
humane advice the Court would honor the law's language and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The three other cases are employment disputes that raise another
basic question. Are people whose conditions can be medically
corrected so that they can function normally considered
``disabled'' and thus entitled to protection under the statute? One
case involves a truck driver whose high blood pressure is
controlled by medication. A lower appellate court, viewing his
condition in its medicated state, held that he was not a person
with a disability and thus not entitled to sue his employer for
discrimination in dismissing him. In another similar case, twin
sisters were denied jobs as pilots because they did not meet a
United Airlines requirement for uncorrected vision. The same
appeals court in Denver barred a lawsuit because their correctable
vision was not a disability. In the final case, a lower appellate
court in San Francisco went the other way, finding that a truck
driver who sees out of only one eye but whose brain has compensated
for the deficiency was disabled and therefore entitled to sue the
employer that dismissed him.
</P>
<P>
   The court in these cases will not reach the ultimate issue of
whether these individuals were ``qualified'' for the jobs or were
appropriately rejected because their impairment interfered with
their ability to do the job. But its decision as to whether a
disability should be assessed in its ``mitigated'' or uncorrected
state will have profound implications for civil rights. At first
blush, it may seem absurd to find that nearsightedness and
hypertension are ``disabilities'' entitled to anti-discrimination
protection. But the legislation calls for an expansive
interpretation, and for a very good reason. What would be truly
unfair would be for the Court to rule that people with corrected
impairments are too disabled to hold a particular job but not
disabled enough to bring suit under the Disabilities Act to show
they were improperly rejected.

MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON QUALITY OF L.A.   LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in first graf refers to Tuesday.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shifting his top priority to quality of life in
the neighborhoods, Mayor Richard Riordan will propose today a $4.2
billion budget for 1999-2000 that expands tree trimming, street
resurfacing, alley closures and removal of abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the city's improving economy, the mayor's
budget also seeks to hire more police officers and firefighters,
lengthen library and pool hours, and eliminate a swimming fee for
kids 17 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've done from our first year, our budget is
goal-oriented,'' Riordan said Monday during an interview with Daily
News editors and reporters. ``Depending on what goal you want,
whether it's a safer L.A. or more parks or library services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that every part of our city feel the benefits
of a growing economy and safer city. My budget invests significant
new resources in neighborhoods in need.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a theme stressed more often by the mayor in recent
months, particularly as crime has continued to decline and the
economy has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said she welcomed Riordan's
ideas, but wants to scrutinize the funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the sound of a lot of what is being highlighted,'' she
said. ``To be fair I have to see where the money is coming from and
what is being curtailed to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of that improving economy, Riordan's budget again
proposes no new taxes, is $87 million bigger than the present
budget and has no deficit to cover _ a first in the six years he
has been in office. Most of the increase over the current budget is
going for salaries.
</P>
<P>
   And Riordan said he is proposing the largest reserve fund in
city history at $60million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city's credit rating recently improved to AA,
and bond houses took Los Angeles off a negative watch in place
since the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor credited the improving economy _ in particular the
housing market and higher property taxes _ with providing more
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While he is emphasizing quality-of-life improvements, Riordan
said he is not abandoning public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan calls for 157 new police officers beyond the
number needed to replace those who retire or leave for other
reasons, bringing the force up to its highest level of 9,900.
Federal funds are available to pay most of the cost of hiring more
than 700 officers for three years, and Riordan said he intends to
take advantage of the program in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the mayor is calling for expanding the anti-gang Community
Law Enforcement and Recovery program around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Police Department represents the largest share of the
budget _ some $1.3billion _ the mayor has set aside $500,000 to
conduct its first full financial and management audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if things are being run well, you want to look to see
where the money is going,'' Riordan said. ``There may be programs
that started 20 or 30 years ago and are no longer needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's interesting,'' said Greg Nelson, press deputy to
Councilman Joel Wachs. ``I don't think that has ever been done. We
always tend to be supportive of audits, especially of large
departments, where there is the potential for greater efficiency
and cost savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan also pointed out that the budget covers $96 million of
the $100 million cost of those officers hired under federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows those who doubted if we would be able to afford to
pay for the officers that we can,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also calls for continued expansion of the Los Angeles
Fire Department, with 126 recruits. Riordan said this will make up
the loss of some positions and also reduce the need for overtime
pay to firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also adds money for two new basic life support
ambulances and to upgrade existing helicopters and purchase a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   On the quality-of-life issues for rundown neighborhoods, Riordan
said he is providing money to step up enforcement on nuisance and
abandoned properties.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the city will speed up its efforts on closing alleys that
have become havens for gangs and drug dealers, create an unlawful
detainer unit in the City Attorney's Office to take action against
criminal tenants, and expand the Department of Animal Services to
deal with stray and dangerous dogs around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded hours at libraries, pools and parks are also seen as a
way to help neighborhoods in need, Riordan said. In particular, he
cited dropping the swimming pool fee to open access to more kids at
a cost of $800,000 this coming year.
</P>
<P>
   One area that could generate controversy with the City Council
is a Riordan proposal to use the $300 million the city is to
receive in its settlement of a lawsuit with the tobacco industry to
make sidewalk repairs and come in compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members had criticized this proposal in the
past, saying the money should be used for health-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   However, Riordan remained confident his approach would be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major complaints that all of us as city officials
receive are about the condition of the sidewalks,'' Riordan said.
``I think the council has come to realize that at least some of
this money can be used for sidewalk repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he also expects to have a battle with council
members over a proposal he is making regarding the use of money
from the Special Parking Revenue Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Council members want to restrict the mayor's ability to use the
funds for purposes other than parking.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which now is at an estimated $26 million, is generated
by parking meters and is to be spent only in the City Council
district in which the meters are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a need for parking facilities throughout the city,
only those districts that have have meters receive project
funding,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   He is proposing a change to allow the funds to be used
throughout the city on parking projects in a list to be developed
on priorities. Also, he is suggesting that those projects that are
more than 2 years old be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he is also girding for a potential battle over his
proposal to eliminate the $1 surcharge on building permits to cover
the cost of one-stop construction centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, the fee was needed to pay for these centers,''
Riordan said. ``We don't think it's needed now.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy could come because the trust fund is now
administered by a City Council-appointed committee that wants to
remain in operation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes $4 million to continue the city's
efforts to deal with the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in as good as shape as anyone,'' Riordan said. ``We've
done some tests and run-throughs and there were no serious
problems.''

IT'S A NO-WIN SITUATION FOR CELTICS
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-CELTICS-PACERS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL HOLLEY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could have reshuffled it, remixed it, revised it, and even
replayed it. Nothing would have changed the final result of
Pacers-Celtics Monday night at the FleetCenter. Really, there was
nothing complicated about it.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a one-sentence summary? Try this one: The Pacers had
the right men in uniforms while the Celtics had the wrong men in
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Or this: The Pacers' major injury was to Sleepy Sam Perkins,
while the Celtics were missing Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson, and
Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of that inevitably led to this: A 120-104 Pacers
win, their 27th of the season, before 18,352.
</P>
<P>
   It would be surprising if anyone left the building shaking their
heads, wondering where it all went wrong for the Celtics. That's
because the problems were obvious. In this case, it had very little
to do with words and phrases such as ``rebounding,'' ``transition
defense,'' and ``defensive rotations.'' The updated Celtics
glossary includes words such as ``sprain,'' ``pull,'' ``spasm'' and
``underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The last entry is necessary because the Celtics probably will
not be favored to win for the rest of the season, especially if
Walker is out for the year, as Rick Pitino believes. And then there
are the back and leg injuries for Mercer and Anderson,
respectively, injuries that may keep them out until at least the
end of the week. If that weren't enough, Dana Barros may be out,
too, after suffering a groin injury Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of that, the Celtics did the ``Hoosiers'' thing for
the first half. They trailed by 4, the most entertaining halftime
deficit they've had this year. It's not often that you can see a
68-64 halftime count in today's NBA, especially when you consider
that it was just over a week ago that the Celtics scored 67 points
in an entire game. But that dose of the NBA's golden age _
generally recognized as the 1980s _ wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the situation we were in, we played very well,'' Pitino
said. ``It's just that they're a much better basketball team. We
played them tough, but we ran out of players and gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce was one of the available players. He sat for a total
of four minutes. When he wasn't sitting, he was resetting his
career highs in points (30) and assists (6). He also had 12
rebounds. When the Celtics weren't looking to him, they went to
Vitaly Potapenko. The center promptly made Rik Smits look like an
inexperienced summer camper. Potapenko had 26 points and 16
rebounds and got Smits (4 points, four rebounds) into foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to keep most fans in their very expensive seats
beyond the third quarter, when the Pacers took control. It was even
enough to inspire Pitino to say, ``Having all these injuries is a
major plus for our basketball team'' because it allows players a
chance to see what Potapenko can do on offense. But there wasn't
enough talk and hope that would translate into a win.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had their own fashion catwalk going at the end of
the bench, reminiscent of the Lost Celtics of 1996-97. Walker,
crutches by his side, still found time to talk trash with Jalen
Rose. Mercer tried to keep his back loose and Anderson stretched
out his right hamstring. On the court, the Celtics tried to run
with the older Pacers, but even that didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of works to our favor,'' Reggie Miller said of the
tempo, ``because we can spread out the floor and we've got a lot of
good shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   Based purely on the numbers, Miller is correct. He led seven
double-figure scorers with 23 points. Chris Mullin had 21, Dale
Davis had a double-double (10 points, 12 boards), and Antonio Davis
had 17 off the bench for Larry Bird, who is now 7-0 against his
former team. After the game, Pierce was asked if he thought the
Pacers were the best team the Celtics have played. He paused for
about two seconds and said yes. Potapenko was asked about the
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice but to play,'' he said. ``No one else
is going to play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans in the arena seemed to sense that attitude from the
hustling Celtics and jumped behind them. The building was a
different place (i.e. no boos). And those NBA fans watching the
telecast via TNT were probably impressed with the Boston effort.
But there was never any suspense about the winner and the loser. If
the Celtics' injuries linger, that most likely will be the case for
the rest of the season.

COMMENTARY: THE EDIFICE THAT PIERPONT MORGAN BUILT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The English art critic Roger Fry, who perplexed what might have
been a straightforward relationship with Pierpont Morgan, once
wrote that Americans ``have a desperate desire to get at real
things . . . they jump at enlightenment.'' Even so, Fry and his
fellow critic Bernard Berenson had deeply ambivalent feelings about
Morgan and his art collecting, feelings that had as much to do with
commerce _ the marketing of art _ as they did with esthetics.
Berenson, being as kind as he was able, could only say, ``It seems
Morgan's desire now is to re-value the masterpieces of Italian art.
The worst of it is he will succeed. The fact that he liked a
picture will probably be remembered for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembered, of course. Morgan will never be just a line in the
provenance of a painting or illuminated manuscript. He was too
dominant, too omnivorous a collector for that. But beyond some
threshold in time, which we have already crossed, the fact that
Pierpont Morgan liked a picture tells us something meaningful only
about Morgan and his era, and not about the picture. His influence
has been almost wholly absorbed, and his collections have long
since become the foundation on which other collections were built.
The marketplace itself has blurred his significance, if only
because we now attribute the Fragonards at the Frick Collection,
for instance, to the eye of Henry Clay Frick and not to Morgan, who
bought them for his London house in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Strouse's impressive new biography of Morgan reassembles
the separate dimensions of Pierpont Morgan. When added together,
those dimensions make a man who is still as large as history. But
with one exception, Morgan's artistic holdings have been as widely
dispersed as his financial holdings. That exception, of course, is
the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan, which was completed in
1906. Morgan used it for only seven years before his death in 1913,
but he spent so much time there that it came to be known to his
business partners as the uptown branch of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., which
was located at 23 Wall Street. When he died, it was still Morgan's
library, but 75 years ago this spring it was chartered, according
to his wishes, as a public institution _ given, that is, by his son
to the City of New York.
</P>

   Even 20 years ago, when I worked there, you could still feel
among some of the staff at the Morgan Library an air of family
retainership, though the last direct link with Morgan _ his
flamboyant librarian, Belle da Costa Greene _ died in 1948. The
library is now decidedly a public edifice, and as it has expanded,
it has nearly encircled the original building designed by Charles
McKim. But if you stand on 36th Street, halfway between Madison and
Park avenues, and consider only the library Morgan knew, or wander
through its interior, from the West Room _ Morgan's study _ across
the Rotunda and into the East Room, you can see that in this place
Morgan disguised his towering energy with a uniquely scholarly
serenity, the atmosphere of a very different life than the one he
actually lived.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fry was right. Americans do have a desperate desire to get
at real things. As Ms. Strouse observes, Pierpont Morgan always
believed he was acting in the best interests of this nation,
whether he was consolidating railroads or helping to retire the
Civil War debt. Given the pressure of his business and the sheer
number of real things that Morgan collected, he could not have
known many of his books and manuscripts intimately. That is a task
he left to his successors, who are us. &QL;

CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION SEES FAILURE, TRAGEDY ON KOSOVO TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Washington) _ After a weekend visit to the region surrounding
war-ravaged Kosovo, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas said
Monday that he saw mostly failure and heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Failure was seeing that the bombing of Serbia has achieved none
of NATO's goals, including an end to the killing and deportation of
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Heartbreak was meeting Kosovo refugees, like a 12-year-old boy
and his 2-year-old sister who were forced from their homes by
police in ski masks and separated from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked what he needed, he said a shower and some medicine
for his sister's sore throat,'' Roberts said. ``People were
standing in line for four hours for an apple, a half-loaf of bread
and some tuna fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty members of Congress made the trip, including Rep. Karen
McCarthy, a Missouri Democrat from Kansas City, and Sen. Sam
Brownback, a Kansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts expects Congress this week to support President
Clinton's request for $6 billion for military and relief supplies
and that Republicans will seek more money to pay for supplies and
equipment obtained from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   He supports both expenditures but does not favor use of NATO
ground forces unless their mission is clear. As a former Marine,
Roberts said he thinks a military campaign can't succeed without
both air and ground attacks.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy and Brownback also voiced concern Monday about the
Serbian campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy wondered if Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic could
be deterred in his quest to rout ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I'm not sure that this man is rational
at this point or if air strikes alone will work,'' McCarthy told
federal union workers at the Bolling Federal Building in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope within the next few days or a week or two, we can have
a better sense of the engagement that will be necessary to bring a
halt to the ethnic cleansing and the fatalities going on in that
region,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback told students at Shawnee Mission East High School in
Prairie Village he opposes sending U.S. troops into combat in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is the potential of us getting involved in a
long-term, very difficult and costly conflict with a great deal of
U.S. bloodshed,'' he said. Troops should only be used as a
peace-keeping force in a negotiated settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that despite the problems so far, he and the other
delegates agreed that NATO has to see it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no alternative but to escalate the air campaign and
hope and pray it's successful,'' said Roberts, a member of Senate
committees on armed services and intelligence. ``Quite frankly, I
have serious doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has failed in its goal of stopping the killing and
deportation of ethnic Albanians, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those objectives have gone sour,'' said Roberts, who
went from military briefing rooms to muddy fields of refugees. ``In
my view, the situation is worse in each and every case.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the chief goal should be removing Milosevic from
power and putting him on trial as a war criminal. Only that would
bring a reasonably quick end to the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can kill this snake one inch at a time or we can do it with
one blow,'' Roberts said. ``The American people need to be told
there will be no refugees returned as long as Milosevic and the
Serbs remain in power.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO and the United States continued to say that air power
would succeed, Roberts said the Serbian campaign was ill-advised
and remains flawed in that it is being overseen by NATO rather than
by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the targets are being selected by the 19 nations of
NATO,'' he said. But NATO is now so involved that to back off the
air campaign would undermine the credibility of NATO and the United
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback, Roberts and U.S. Sens. Kit Bond and John Ashcroft of
Missouri, also Republicans, voted last month against starting the
NATO bombing. Bond and Ashcroft continue to question the purpose
and direction of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that seeing 20,000 of the Kosovo refugees in
Macedonia was ``a paradox of enormous irony'' because of the
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beautiful spring day, snowcapped mountains, green valleys
and human tragedy,'' Roberts said. ``Tent after tent (was) swollen
with broken and anguished families. The night before, there was
four inches of rain and some people slept in cold and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he talked to an elderly man wearing a stocking hat
and a pair of shoes he retrieved from a dead friend. Serbs took his
life savings of 50 marks, burned his home and killed his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fierce determination,'' Roberts said, ``he grabbed me by
the shoulders, and said, we believe in God, we believe in NATO and
we believe in America.''

COMPUTER TRADE SHOW THIS YEAR IS LESS COMPUTER, MORE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Chicago) _ If there is any question about how much the Internet
is changing our lives, the answer lies here at Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest technology and computer trade show isn't
anymore. It's still big, all right. But it's become the world's
largest (begin ital)Internet(end ital.) and technology trade show.
Computers? Well, they must be around here (begin
ital.)somewhere(end ital.).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only a couple of computer makers even bothered to buy
booth space at Comdex Spring '99, which is expected to draw 80,000
computer professionals this week.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``eBay,'' the popular online auction site, is being
thrown around a lot more than ``Compaq,'' ``Dell'' and ``Gateway''
put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC industry is seeing the focus move away from it and more
toward the Internet,'' said Aaron Goldberg, principal analyst for
Ziff-Davis, the computer magazine publisher that organizes and runs
the Comdex show.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to look far to see how much that focus has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   IBM isn't showing off computers here. But IBM subsidiary
Catapult is showing off the latest version of its online employee
training system. Gateway didn't buy booth space, but online career
site Hotjobs.com did.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft is getting in on the action. The world's largest
software company is using Comdex to promote a new computer mouse
design. Among the improvements? The mouse has extra buttons to make
Web browsing easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is the emergence of the software companies
as the big dog and the hardware companies as the tail on the dog,''
said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a
Boston market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   So what hardware will consumers buy to get on the Net?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson predicted that by 2003 non-PC devices _ anything from
smart telephones to television set-top devices to small hand-held
devices _ would outnumber PCs on the Net. Currently, about 99
percent of Net access comes from PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But if the computer, er, Internet industry can't make money off
computers, where will the profit come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the money,'' Anderson told industry analysts and
reporters in an early morning briefing.
</P>
<P>
   And in this case, ``money'' is spelled ``e-commerce,'' the
industry's term for business done over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Geeks who used to brag about the speed of their microprocessor
and attend Comdex to see the latest hard drive now are attending
sessions on ``E-commerce technology options'' and ``Commerce,
creating a direct selling site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce will permeate what every vendor on the floor you
see today is doing,'' said Clay Ryder, chief analyst for Zona
Research
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just about everywhere you look in the sprawling
McCormick Place convention hall you see the e-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard about e-commerce, you've read about e-business,''
boasts Snickelways Interactive of New York. ``Now experience
e-profit.''
</P>
<P>
   At the door to the theater where Bill Gates, Microsoft's
chairman, delivered a keynote address Monday morning, /{Forbes/}
gave away copies of its April 19 magazine with the cover story:
``Getting rich at the speed of light.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gates, whose company shunned the Internet during its early
growth years hoping to create a network of its own, gave homage to
its growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year has been a year of incredible change,'' Gates
said in his speech, which drew an overflow crowd of more than
6,000, including some who lined up 2 1/2 hours early to get good
seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates noted that the PC industry was far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, over 100 million new PCs will be sold,'' Gates
said. ``It's a pretty amazing number when you think that every year
for the last five or six years people have said: `Well, this is the
peak, this is the most that could possibly ever be sold. We'll get
no more home penetration, no more business penetration.' And yet,
we go from record to record.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth will come in nontraditional devices that people will use
to get on the Net or to make their lives easier in other ways,
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 50-minute talk Gates focused not only on how important
the Internet has become but also on how important it (begin
ital.)will(end ital.) become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, for a lot of us here, we're already using the Internet
every day,'' Gates said. ``It's common sense that when we want to
buy things, when we want to organize a trip, we go out there to the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft chairman gave a 20-minute sales pitch for the
company's next computer operating system, Windows 2000. The system
is being tested now and is expected to be available next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 represents the biggest investment we ever made in
a Windows product,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and several Microsoft employees are in Chicago for Windows
World, a trade show that runs concurrently with Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, another operating system, Linux, is
challenging the Microsoft flagship product. Perhaps because of
that, Microsoft is running workshops at Windows World showing how
Microsoft products can do everything from protecting Web users'
privacy to helping them live a full ``Web lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The buzz around the trade floor is focusing on Linus Torvalds,
the developer of the Linux system. Although Linux has been around
since 1991, industry analysts said it now has enough support for at
least a small challenge to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Linux has 10 million users and accounted for more than 17
percent of all computer-server operating-system shipments last
year, according to International Data Corp., a research firm.

ADVERTISING AND BASEBALL: A GROWING CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE ROCK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Imagine this scene on a warm spring night
in Kansas City's future:
</P>
<P>
   Some 25,000 fans are settling in as the sun casts a glow against
(begin ital.)Kauffman Stadium at Sprint Park(end ital.). It's Gates
Barbecue Night, and leadoff hitter Carlos Beltran _ his uniform
tinged with the colors of H&AMP;R Block's corporate logo _ gets the
fans going with a home run to left field. The ball doinks off the
outfield foul pole, a pillar shaped and painted like a pencil that
doubles as advertising for Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran trots back to the dugout, disappearing under the Harley
Davidson logos emblazoned on the top.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario _ hypothetical and exaggerated _ could never
happen in this town, right? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a growing trend in the world of professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Prentice, the would-be buyer of the Royals who is awaiting
the approval of Major League Baseball, is not a man of Ewing
Kauffman-type wealth. Already, he has made clear his intentions of
increasing advertising revenues at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice, who says money-making tactics are ``just limited by
imagination,'' will explore the idea of attaching a corporate
identity to the name of the stadium in exchange for a healthy
paycheck. Billboards will likely become more prevalent as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out to my ballpark in Midland, there are signs
wherever it's tastefully possible to put signs,'' said Prentice,
who owns a Class AA minor-league baseball team in Midland, Texas.
``That's a source of revenue we have to tap into.''
</P>
<P>
   As player salaries skyrocket out of control, teams are exploring
all possible avenues of making a buck. A few examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Half of the league's 30 teams already have naming-rights
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pencil-shaped foul pole is no joke. The left-field pole at
Pro Player Stadium in south Florida, complete with fake lead tip,
also serves as advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _ League officials have, in recent months, even toyed with the
idea of putting corporate logos on player uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have been pursuing more and different ways to
increase revenues since Kauffman's death in 1993. But this is still
foreign ground for longtime fans, the ones who remember Royals
Stadium and its tri-vision advertising boards _ which fit snugly
into the outfield water spectacular _ but little else in terms of
commercial intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kauffman didn't want any advertising,'' said Royals' then-
and now- general manager Herk Robinson. ``If we went up to him and
said, `Mr. Kauffman, we can gross an additional $20,000 by putting
a big sign in left field,' he'd say, `Heck, no. This is a beautiful
stadium. I'll (begin ital.)give(end ital.) you the $20,000.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The outfield fence is now decorated with ads for Pepsi, Bud
Light and Price Chopper. A Ford ad peeks over the left-field wall,
joined by Master Card in right field. Viewers watching the game on
TV are fed a steady diet of rotating ads behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Royals officials won't disclose specifics of advertising
revenues. Since 1994, though, the team has tripled its input and
now makes millions _ though less than $10 million _ in advertising
and sponsorship revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those dollars add up,'' Royals vice president Mike Levy said.
``It spells business. You just can't get around it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice suggests that the amount of untapped advertising
revenue at Kauffman Stadium is ``upwards of $5 million, easily.''
</P>
<P>
   A year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal,'' Prentice said, ``is to try to increase it by a
healthy number each year that would be north of $500,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there are unused advertising avenues at the stadium.
Although Major League Baseball prohibits signage along the outfield
wall in dead center, gaping holes still exist that could command
six-figure billboard deals. And the current regime has found
advertising dollars in unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   An example: This season, for the first time, an ad for Farmland
Industries is embedded in the grass beyond the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Royals have resisted the temptation to open up the
dugouts to corporate logos. As Levy said, ``There are certain
sacred spots on a baseball field.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Houston Astros have displayed advertisements on the
inside back wall of their dugouts, just above players' heads, since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have a lot more advertising,'' Prentice said.
``Perhaps it won't be (on the dugouts). I have a sneaking suspicion
it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the enormous revenue potential from a naming rights
deal.
</P>
<P>
   When Detroit's Comerica Park opens next season, for example, it
will do so with an agreement that Comerica Inc. will write $66
million worth of checks in the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's an option we would hope to look at,''
Prentice said. ``But we haven't gone down that road at all.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential stumbling block, of course, is public reception to
renaming the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kauffman is the reason the Royals are here today,'' said J.T.
DeWitt, a fan from North Kansas City who attended Monday's game
with his wife and two children. ``I think the name should stay the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in today's world, it's probably a necessary evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fans in Kansas City remember the Kauffman name with a
bit of reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very respectful of that,'' Prentice said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint spokeswoman Laura Meyer said the company was approached
at least once, ``way back when they were looking for buyers for the
Royals,'' about any naming-rights interest but expressed none. As
for now, Meyer said, Sprint is probably not considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hall, a local civic leader and assistant to the chairman of
Hallmark Cards Inc., said his company also would have no interest
in attaching its name to the stadium. And he understands the
affinity that Kansas Citians have for the Kauffman name.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very difficult issue because of Mr. Kauffman and all
he did here,'' he said. ``On the other hand, our biggest issue is
how to keep the team here. And right now, the biggest problem we
have is revenue. Mr. Kauffman would be in favor of doing whatever
it took to keep the team in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of who would get the money from a
naming-rights deal. Would it go to the owner of the team, a la
Prentice, or the owner of the stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The Royals pay annual rent of $450,000 to the Jackson County
Sports Complex Authority, the agency charged with overseeing both
Kauffman and Arrowhead stadiums. Jackson County owns both
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect that the money would go to the county,'' said
John Friedmann, executive director of the authority. ``In turn, it
would end up with the team because the county would make
improvements at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, to my knowledge, that question has never been discussed
with the authority.''
</P>
<P>
   That, both sides agree, is a discussion for another time. Until
then, Prentice will continue to explore that and other potential
sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at it from a fan's point of view,'' Prentice said.
``But I'm also looking at it from an investor's point of view. I'm
looking at the team's long-term viability.''

A DISTURBING TREND FOR L.A. TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If your eyes have been stinging lately, maybe even
watering a bit, blame the air quality in Southern California. The
Pollutant Standard Index has risen to hazardous levels, the Los
Angeles basin reduced to a miasmatic mess by all the impurities
spewing forth these days from our professional sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. sports scene grew ever more polluted Monday with the
discharge of Larry Robinson, the Kings' coach for the past four
years. Robinson was a breath of fresh air _ a class act in an
increasingly corporate world _ so it figured he'd be driven from
L.A. by a cold wind just like Del Harris and Eddie Jones and Loy
Vaught before him.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, with personnel only an IHL coach could love, finished
11th in the Western Conference standings, a year after being swept
in the first round of the playoffs by St. Louis. Say this for the
franchise; as sorry as it is now, it gave L.A. sports fans its last
great adrenaline rush. That would be its Stanley Cup runner-up
finish in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers haven't won a playoff game since 1988. The Lakers
have wandered around lost in the desert since their last appearance
in the NBA Finals, in 1991. It's telling that of all the L.A.
sports franchises, only the Clippers are living up to their past.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos awoke Monday to find their four local sports teams
with a combined record of 71-100-5. It's not enough that mediocrity
has settled over the L.A. sports scene like a blanket of smog,
suffocating all of our sunshiny scenes. For so many years the
Lakers and the Dodgers seemed above the fray, their family-owned
operations veritable beacons for other franchises. But now, instead
of defining the times, the Lakers and the Dodgers simply reflect
them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the O'Malley reign, the Dodgers exuded class. Now they're
just plain crass. The difference is perhaps best exemplified by the
rubbish recycled by first-year general manager Kevin Malone. Malone
has engaged his counterpart to the south, Kevin Towers, in the kind
of trash-talking that used to be anathema in Chavez Ravine. We'd
like it better if Malone would stop gloating about the World Series
until the Dodgers at least get there. Until then, he should give
the Padres, who did advance to the Fall Classic last year, their
due.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers general manager Jerry West is as quiet these days as
Malone is contrary. Sadly, the franchise that brought us Showtime
has been commandeered by its capricious owner, Jerry Buss, for a
joyride that you just know is going to end badly (we're already
seeing the first skid marks).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, under Buss' directive, pursued troublemaker Dennis
Rodman, only to banish him after 23 games for doing nothing more
than living up to every bit of his bad-boy reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's behavior, however erratic, was at least consistent with
his recent past. Sadly, the same could not be said for the Lakers,
soldiers of fortune masquerading as troubleshooters. The truth?
They got rid of Rodman because their record wasn't good enough, not
because his behavior wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   If that sullied chapter in L.A. sports didn't cause a certain
tightening in the chest of any respectable fan, along came
Robinson's termination. You didn't need designer shades to see that
one coming.
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure how much more Robinson could have been expected
to coax out of a team that had one of its most productive forwards
(Glen Murray) on the injured list for seemingly forever and one of
its most promising defensemen (Aki Berg) on another continent the
whole season as a result of a contract impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Kings had too few players with pride equal to
their bulging salaries. In another city, say Montreal, a few of
them would have been ``run out of (town) the way they played,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the main thing we Angelenos pride ourselves on is
doing things differently. So we chase away coaches and front-office
personnel, if we have to, and give the pampered athletes a wide
berth. No wonder we can't see the sunshine for the haze. &QL;

MAN FACES PRISON FOR FISHY CRIME
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hoe Jin Soon tried to bring $140,000 worth of
``lucky'' fish into the country from Malaysia, but none of the good
fortune rubbed off on him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon pleaded guilty Monday to importing an endangered species
into the United States, and he could go to prison for as long as a
year, then be deported to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents nabbed the 31-year-old at Los Angeles
International Airport, where he was carrying plastic bags filled
with fish of the endangered arowana species. The fish were about 6
inches long but will grow to about twice that length.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the carnival and win a fish _ that's what it
looked like,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney William Carter said about
the packaging, ``except there were 35 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest reflects a recent rise in trafficking in endangered
species. There have been busts for importing sea turtle eggs,
snakes and ground-up bear gallbladders _ all in the last six
months, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon was arrested March 12, when he was caught holding a
suitcase filled with arowana fish, which are displayed in large
tanks by owners who consider them lucky to possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Chinese or Asian restaurants, you'll see a big,
ugly prehistoric-looking fish,'' Carter said. ``That's the
arowana.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said Soon is a Malaysian resident who flew frequently to
the United States to sell exotic fish.
</P>
<P>
   The seized fish will stay in the United States at a research
facility in Denver, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson told Soon he probably will be
deported after his prison term is over. He is scheduled to be
sentenced June 28, and Carter said he will spend six to 12 months
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is the largest port by volume ``in terms of both
lawful and unlawful (wildlife) traffic,'' said Larry Farrington,
senior resident agent for the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegal importation of wildlife is big business,'' Farrington
said. ``Arowanas, in particular, we see fairly regularly, but this
case stands apart from others because of the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrington, a 22-year veteran with the agency, said jail time
for wildlife-related offenses has become more common in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be under the Smokey the Bear category,'' Farrington
said. ``Just buy a fishing license or pay a $25 fine.''

PRESSURE BUILDS FOR NEW STUDY ON ROCKETDYNE FIELD LAB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Legislative pressure intensified Monday on
the state Department of Health Services over its handling of health
concerns linked to rocket fuel and radioactive material research
conducted at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators said they would push for funding of a
long-sought community health study that won legislative approval
last year but was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   And Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Encino, accused the department
of being so cozy with the company that it withheld critical
information and worked against a community advisory panel
overseeing a worker health study at the 50-year-old facility in the
hills between Chatsworth and Simi Valley northwest of downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency officials ``weren't interested in people's
health. They were protecting (Rocketdyne),'' said Kuehl, who last
week released a more than year-old study that had found high
incidences of lung cancer among residents living in neighborhoods
around the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, researchers at the University of California, Los
Angeles, released the second part of their worker health study,
showing unusually high rates of cancer among Rocketdyne workers who
had contact with the toxic chemical hydrazine, used in rocket fuel.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials defended their role, as did Rocketdyne
officials, saying they have established an unprecedented forum for
public input into the UCLA work, and have been working to secure
the best possible public health study of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our department does not obstruct or work to obstruct the
results of the studies,'' said Dr. Robert Harrison, chief of the
Occupational Health Surveillance and Evaluation branch of the
department, which has been overseeing the UCLA study of Rocketdyne
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would point to the record,'' Harrison said. ``We
have, I think through all those steps, ensured we had the best
science that would be free from influences from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the health department will come under
scrutiny today in the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, which is
expected to call for a full investigation of the agency's handling
of tobacco-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne spokesman Dan Beck said the company's record is clear
about operations at Santa Susana. It wants to get answers for its
workers and neighbors, and has not put undue control over the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a cozy relationship between Rocketdyne and DHS,''
said Beck. ``I reiterate the fact _ that there is ... a close
relationship between DHS and Rocketdyne is inaccurate. It's just
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over health hazards at the 2,600-acre field lab were
first raised in 1989 when the Daily News reported that toxic
contamination was found in soil at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   A massive federal cleanup of the site is now under way, and the
Department of Energy last year awarded the facility's new owners,
Boeing, a $148.5 million contract to complete cleanup work by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's initial worker health study, released in 1997, showed
higher cancer rates among employees exposed to radiation at the
lab, which no longer conducts nuclear research.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and community activists have pressed for a health
study of surrounding residential areas, which they had been told in
the early 1990s would be considered if a worker study showed health
problems among employees at the lab that conducted rocket and
nuclear testing for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a commitment that was made,'' said state Sen. Cathie
Wright, R-Simi Valley, who was among a trio of local legislators
who helped secure the UCLA study and the community advisory panel
that has been monitoring the research.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said the health department had successfully urged Gov.
Wilson last year to veto $150,000 in funding for the community
health feasibility study. She said Gov. Gray Davis has put the
renewed funding request in his upcoming budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to end this issue and put it to bed, and it's
done and over with, then (they need) to go forward with the next
step,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   DHS officials did not return phone calls for comment on whether
the department had played a role in vetoing the funds last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wright added that Rocketdyne, which has questioned the UCLA
study and pledged to conduct its own series of worker and community
studies, should allow a community study without company influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost the support of the community when it took all
this time to get to this point,'' Wright said. ``It would have to
be independent from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne said they supported calls for a community study, and
only want to be assured they have ``a place at the table,'' Beck
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our facility, our employees,'' said Beck, adding that the
community residents are its neighbors. ``We should be a part of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills, called on the
Legislature to consider urgency funding that would bypass the
traditional budget sessions now under way in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health Services has estimated that the next
step, which would determine how to proceed with a community health
study, would cost $300,000 more than is earmarked in Davis' budget.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who also has been working with
federal agencies to resolve questions about the health of workers
and residents living near the field lab, said Monday that recent
developments have only heightened her concerns.

LAKERS GET WELL AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Cocky, confident, egotistical. Those were the Lakers
of February.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate. Deflated. Those were the Lakers who returned to the
Forum on Monday _ a three-game losing streak hanging over them like
a thick, brown haze over the San Fernando Valley in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games to go in a season teetering on the edge of disaster,
the Lakers needed something, anything to boost their self-esteem,
if not their playoff seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation? Yes, Kobe Bryant admitted, the Lakers felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't wanna drop three in a row, you don't wanna drop four
in a row,'' Bryant said before the Lakers avoided a season-worst
losing streak with a 117-102 victory over Vancouver. ``Right now,
because we only have nine games left, you definitely want to get
this win. We've got three tough games coming up (at Portland, San
Antonio and Houston).''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off double-digit losses at Utah and Portland, the Lakers
figured to be due for a blowout of their own against the Grizzlies,
who had just one win in 20 road games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers trailed at halftime 60-56, their flowing
offense offset by yet another defensive disaster. Vancouver shot 56
percent in the first half, led by offensive outbursts from the
likes of Tony Massenburg and Felipe Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   It took coach Kurt Rambis busting up a white, plastic clipboard
during a third-quarter timeout and a solid round of boos from the
home crowd before the Lakers put together a solid run.
</P>
<P>
   Down by six points late in the third, the Lakers put together a
9-2 run _ with seven points from rookies Tyronn Lue and Ruben
Patterson _ to take an 81-80 lead heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The expected rout wasn't far behind. The Lakers opened the
fourth with a 15-4 run, led by Shaquille O'Neal and Patterson, to
increase the lead to 12. The stubborn Grizzlies, who already upset
the Lakers in Vancouver earlier this year, clawed their way back.
With Lopez and Massenburg again leading the charge, they cut the
lead to 98-94 with 4:07 to go.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal and Glen Rice started another run and held off
Vancouver's final charge.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with a game-high 35 points. Rice added 18, and
Bryant and Robert Horry added 17 each. Lue scored a career-high 15,
capped by a couple of gutty drives to the hoop (he was fouled both
times) late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Massenburg led Vancouver with 28. Lopez finished with 23.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 16-point loss at Utah, the Lakers took Sunday
off to clear their heads. It was a welcome mental break, Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to get away from things a little bit, just
think about things, think about individually what we all can do to
get this thing back together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's relaxed, instead of being all uptight,'' Bryant
said. ``You have no choice but to be uptight under the
circumstances, because you're only human. But it's how you get used
to it and how quickly you get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing left to do was erase all memories of the prior
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but you have to do it,'' he said. ``That's
something that we've kind of been doing all year. And as the year
went on, we found ourselves getting better at it, because you don't
have a choice. That's what you have to do.''

DODGERS OUTCLASSED BY BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget about the postseason failures that will
always be the asterisk on the Atlanta resume. When the rest of the
National League wants a barometer, they measure themselves with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson spoke of that. So did general
manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Dodgers' first chance to measure themselves produced
nothing but raised eyebrows and loads of head-shaking. They didn't
even do enough to gain consideration of being a notch on the
Braves' measuring stick, bowing 11-3 in a gruesome display Monday
night at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (7-7) have lost three of four, and were taken to
task by Braves right-hander John Smoltz in the opener of the
three-game series. Each of Atlanta's starters had at least one hit
as the Braves pounded out 18 hits for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Raul Mondesi homered for the Dodgers, his
league-leading sixth of the season. Todd Hundley and Dave Hansen
also hit solo homers for L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers starter Carlos Perez never gave Johnson a
chance to show confidence in the lefty into the seventh inning,
where he'd given up four runs in each of his first two starts. The
train wreck came much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Perez didn't make it out of the fourth inning, giving up six
runs on eight hits in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Robinson Checo, the middle reliever the Dodgers
received from Detroit in the Dave Mlicki trade Friday, had an
equally rough time in his debut, getting tagged for five runs on
eight hits in 31/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: The Dodgers' Eric Young led off the first
with a single, stole second, moved to third on a pop out and stayed
there. It was an extension of the Dodgers' weekend series in San
Diego, when they went 3 for 24 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   And against Smoltz (2-0), there aren't many chances to be had.
Heck, he is so good he can even hit. It was his single over
shortstop in the second inning that scored to start the onslaught.
It scored two runs and gave the Braves a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later Chipper Jones, who left the game in the sixth
with a rib cage strain, hit a solo homer and Perez began to
unravel. He walked Andruw Jones, balked him to second and then
threw a pickoff attempt into center field to move the runner to
third. Jones scored on Brian Hunter's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves knocked Perez (0-3) out in the fourth by stringing
together three hits with two outs. It began with Bret Boone's
infield single. Jones walked and Brian Jordan smacked a two-run
double to left, pushing Atlanta's lead to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're an improved ballclub,'' Johnson said before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hoping Checo could be their long reliever, and
to do that he must build arm strength. When he arrived in the
clubhouse in San Diego during the weekend, he said his arm was
strong enough to pitch two or three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson put that theory to the test, opting not to burn out the
bullpen. Checo breezed through his first 11/3 innings before
Atlanta's lineup got to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pushed their lead to 8-0 in the sixth when Boone hit
a two-run homer to right field.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it wasn't pretty, but it got worse in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter singled to lead off the eighth and scored on Walt Weiss'
triple into the right-field corner. Gerald Williams then doubled
and scored on Boone's single to give the Braves an 11-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the game did was afford Johnson the
opportunity to rest some of his starters. When the eighth inning
began, Tripp Cromer was in left, Jacob Brumfield in center, Jose
Vizcaino at second, Hansen at first and Rick Wilkins behind the
plate.

   SCI-MERCK-MANUAL (Undated) _ The first edition of the Merck
Manual, the venerable medical textbook first published in 1899, was
reissued this week in a commemorative centennial package along with
the 1999 edition. On seeing it, there is a surge of relief that we
have come so far. Back in 1899 a patient with asthma might well
have marched under doctors' orders directly to the tobacconist for
a cigarette: ``smoking is sometimes beneficial'' for this
condition, the manual reports. An alcoholic might have been dosed
up with opium, or sent off to suck an orange and drink a pint of

   SCI-PLANETARY-SYSTEMS (Undated) _ A major discovery announced
last week has given birth to a new field of science, the
comparative study of planetary systems. At last, after centuries of
speculation, often more fanciful than scientific, and recent years
of expectant searching, astronomers have found a family of planets
to compare the solar system with. They detected three large planets
_ two of them with masses much greater than Jupiter's _ orbiting
another solar-type star, Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light-years away.
Scientists confidently predict that this will be the first of many
similar discoveries. By John Nole Wilford.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
By the second quarter, with another lead slipping away, Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich called time out, looked away and
half-sighed, half-griped, ``Here we go.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the fourth quarter, SuperSonics coach Paul Westphal was
talking not about the Rockets on the other end of the Compaq Center
court but of the team 200 miles down I-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had blown most of another lead Monday night, and if
they refused to feel the pressure and horror of a recurring
nightmare, Seattle had visions of a Sunday in San Antonio to spur
it.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, there was no way the Rockets would permit
another rival to catch and crush them. Having vowed not to relive
that feeling, Charles Barkley took over, and the Rockets finally
put away the SuperSonics 120-113.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all NBA games, teams are going make a run,'' said Sam Mack,
who gave the Rockets 21 points on seven 3-pointers. ``The key is
keeping composure. It's how you handle it. In San Antonio, they
made their run, and we didn't handle it well at all. We did pretty
well with it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were, however, far from perfect. They led by as many
as 16 in the second quarter. By the third, the lead was down to
five.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets pushed it to 15 in the fourth. But with less than
three minutes left, and with the Sonics' Dale Ellis and Detlef
Schrempf matching Mack trey for trey, the edge was down to four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what happened in San Antonio,'' Westphal said. ``I
kept urging my guys to keep coming at them. I reminded them about
that. Plus, I coached Charles. I know he doesn't play as well with
a big lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Gary Payton and, of all people, Olden Polynice taunting
him with whatever they could come up with, Barkley stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   With the game on the line, Barkley had his hands on every
Rockets point for eight minutes. He passed outside either for 3s or
to the shot left open by the SuperSonics' double teams inside. He
sent passes downcourt for fast breaks. And with the Sonics
sufficiently burned by the post-and-pass part of the Rockets'
offense to call off their double teams and leave Polynice alone on
Barkley inside, Barkley destroyed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's pretty much our normal philosophy, isn't it?''
Barkley said. ``If they double me, I'm going to pass it. If they
don't double me, I'm going to go one-on-one. It's simple
basketball. I don't try to do too much. Bad players worry about
their numbers and averages. I try to take what the defense gives
me. I know how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' defense gave Barkley _ or he took _ pretty much
whatever he wanted. With the Rockets leading by nine, 92-83, he
scored their next 10 points, nailing a jumper, scoring on three
drives to the basket and forcing Polynice to foul him on yet
another move too quick to stop.
</P>
<P>
   His free throws gave the Rockets a 15-point lead. And even when
the Sonics closed within seven, Barkley took over again. He drove
to a four-footer and, when the Sonics went back to the double
teams, passed to Mack for another 3 and a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barkley was sensational,'' Westphal said. ``He picked us apart
with his passes when we doubled him and with his shots when we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.
And he and Mack were just two of four Rockets to top 20 points in
the team's highest output of the season. Hakeem Olajuwon had 24,
and Scottie Pippen totaled 22 with 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the SuperSonics playing without starters Vin Baker
and Billy Owens, that was almost not enough.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets have yet to master protecting a lead, Tomjanovich
was ready to settle for the hope that the concept might be about to
take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always sort of feel like that,'' he said. ``You always feel
that this is the day we're going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the lead back to double digits, 114-104, on Mack's
seventh 3-pointer with 1:48 left, the Rockets had to sweat out the
remaining moments. Schrempf hit a 3, and after an Olajuwon layup,
Payton drove for a layup that cut the margin to seven and gave him
23 points, 21 in the second half, to go with 15 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley missed a 3 for the Rockets, and when Ellis beat
the Rockets down the floor for an uncontested layup, the difference
was down to 116-111 with 1:04 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we've been in that situation, we continue to
panic,'' Olajuwon lamented. ``We were lucky making the big shot.
Yesterday's last shot (for the Rockets) rolled in and rolled out.
And that was the difference in the game. That's just tough luck.
Today, the shots went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did at least handle the last minute efficiently,
setting up Olajuwon for a dunk and, after Seattle's Don MacLean
missed consecutive 3s, a short jumper.
</P>
<P>
   And if they weren't quite giddy with a win they had to have, the
Rockets celebrated with a sigh of relief, having so recently
experienced the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a devastating loss for us,'' Pippen said. ``We
had a team down (23) points. We allowed them to get back too fast.
I don't see us handling it better. I think we get by at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize it's our defense. We let (the Sonics) score
68 points in the second half. You're not going to win too many
games (like that).''
</P>
<P>
   They got by on Monday, enough to leave Sunday behind.

WITH about six minutes left in the night when the NBA became an
honest-to-goodness entertainment product again, all Charles Barkley
needed was a pair of hip waders.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent the opening half of the fourth quarter baiting the
hook for Olden Polynice, spinning by him down on the left baseline
and coming out on the other side of the hoop for easy baskets or
wheeling across the lane and dropping in a soft fadeaway over those
long, outstretched arms.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the two teams returned to the floor from a timeout, Sir
Charles stood at midcourt, casting an imaginary fishing line in
Polynice's direction and smiling broadly while slowly reeling in
the big lunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olden was talking a lot out there,'' Barkley said. ``The first
time I went by him, he said I took advantage of him because he
wasn't loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the fourth time I went by him, I turned around and asked
him, `Are you loose yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Call this one: A River Runs Through It.
</P>
<P>
   Not just in honor of Polynice's defense, which was like trying
to catch water in a net. But for the way the Rockets and Sonics
tore up and down the floor on offense, spilling over the banks like
a spring flood, leaving the Laptop chimney deep in points.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know better, you might have thought you had
stepped into a time machine and been spat out in the '70s. You
expected to see bell bottoms and long sideburns and platform shoes
and hot pants.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, this couldn't be the modern NBA, where conservative
philosophies are too often passed off as great defense, where teams
hang on to the ball as if it were a miser's last dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There was running and shooting, plenty of it. About the only
things missing were Dr. J and Darnell Hillman and those
reach-for-the-moon Afros and the old red, white and blue ABA ball.
</P>
<P>
   In an ugly, ugly season, one in which the Chicago Bulls once
managed just 49 points and most teams couldn't drop the ball in the
basket if you sat them on the back of the rim, the Rockets beat the
Sonics 120-113.
</P>
<P>
   And to continue the nostalgia theme, 36-year-old Charles Barkley
again turned back the clock and played like a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists that
told the tale in the final box score. But to more closely
appreciate those numbers, you had to see the way he compiled them _
with quick moves, fancy steps and a grin he has been wearing lately
as a permanent part of his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just about being healthy and able to do a lot of
the old things like I used to,'' Barkley said. ``You won't hear me
going around saying that I'm back to the peak days of my career.
But there are times, there are moves when I know that my body is
strong and ready and I can do whatever I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off another collapse in San Antonio on Sunday, this was a
time when the Rockets had to jump right back into the pool full of
confidence and energy to show there were no lingering scars. They
did it with Scottie Pippen setting the pace with a 12-point first
quarter on his way to 22, plus 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with Hakeem Olajuwon posting 24 points and nine
rebounds and passing Jerry West to move into 11th place on the
all-time scoring list. They did it with Sam Mack stroking in seven
treys on his way to 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, and every time they needed a really big play,
they did it because Barkley was able to do it. Because after
suffering for more than a year with a hernia he sustained in March
1997, he was finally able to get back in shape and start the season
ready to take charge again. And even after he was sidelined for two
weeks this season after arthroscopic surgery on his knee, he has
regained his edge and his spark.
</P>
<P>
   He was like a cat toying with a mouse he plans to eat for supper
against the Sonics. When they committed themselves to coming at him
in the low block with the double team, he calmly zipped passes back
outside to Mack or Cuttino Mobley to nail 3s. When Seattle tried to
play him one-on-one, he simply spun like a buzz saw and chewed the
Sonics up with baseline moves.
</P>
<P>
   He can't do the things he did in Philly in the '80s or in
Phoenix in the early '90s. But he can still do the things to beat
you.
</P>
<P>
   Like shove aside Detlef Schrempf when the Sonics cut the lead to
108-104 to get a key offensive rebound and convert a critical
three-point play with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to talk about him as MVP,'' said coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. ``I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   He was challenged by his buddy Michael Jordan to get into shape,
and he has had his fuse lit by the enthusiasm of playing with
teammates he truly likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled to be back in shape,'' he said. ``I just
wanted to be able to say I had fun at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   And could still land the big one.

HORNETS BEAT NETS,120-113 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After meeting with Jayson Williams for
the first time since he suffered his season-ending leg injury, the
New Jersey Nets played with the vigor and the resolve that their
inspirational leader always displayed. But the spirit of Williams
was not enough against the rejuvenated Charlotte Hornets, who shot
down the hustling Nets to win by 120-113 on Monday night at
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams, who broke his right leg on April 1, watching from
the stands, the Hornets made 59 percent of their field goal
attempts, including 11 of 21 3-pointers, to torch a Nets defense
that was high on energy but low on effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Hornets' 3-pointers, including three by Chuck
Person, came in the fourth quarter, when Charlotte staved off a
Nets rally that saw them cut a 13-point third-quarter deficit to 1.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the eighth straight for Charlotte (20-20) and
moved it within one-half game of Cleveland (21-20) for the final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It also officially
eliminated the Nets (12-29) from playoff contention, though that
had been a foregone conclusion since March.
</P>
<P>
   Though disappointed with the loss, the Nets were glad they put
forth a solid effort in front of Williams. ``I'm almost positive
that Jayson's happy with the way that guys aren't laying down,''
said Stephon Marbury, who had team highs of 27 points and 13
assists. ``Because he's the type of guy that wouldn't lay down, and
he goes out and gives 110 percent, and I think he can see that
we're playing the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Phills led Charlotte with 23 points, Elden Campbell added
22 and Person scored 16. Keith Van Horn followed Marbury with 26
points and 9 rebounds, Scott Burrell added 17 points, and Jamie
Feick, Williams' fill-in, scored a career-high 17 and matched his
career high in rebounds with 15.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was injured in a collision with Marbury in a game
against the Atlanta Hawks, was his usual fun-loving self, despite
being in a wheelchair with his leg in a brace.
</P>
<P>
   He joked about everything, saying that his first thought after
being injured was getting up so as ``not to get stepped on by Mrs.
Marbury,'' who ran on the court to see if her son was all right.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury is no laughing matter. Dr. Russell Warren, the
orthopedist who performed the surgery, told Williams last Monday
that his chances of returning to the National Basketball
Association were ``hit or miss,'' said Sal DiFazio, Williams's
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worried,'' said DiFazio, who sat beside Williams, the
Nets' president, Michael Rowe, and General Manager John Nash at a
makeshift pre-game news conference in an arena corridor. ``But
Jayson's convinced in his mind that he will make it back. Dr.
Warren said hit or miss last week, but we spoke to him today and I
think was more hit than miss. What Warren told me was that this is
an injury that you see in motorcycle accidents, not on basketball
players. It was very unusual the way it happened because it
hyperextended, fractured and rotated all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The fracture in Williams' leg is 8 to 10 inches long and runs
from the knee cap down the tibia. He underwent four hours of
surgery on April 2, when bone was grafted from his hip to his leg
and five screws and a metal plate were inserted. He also had torn
cartilage repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 31, will have to remain in a bed, in a wheelchair or
on crutches for 8 to 10 weeks. Six weeks after that, he could be
playing basketball. Williams said his goal is to be walking after
seven weeks and he has drawn encouragement from the fact that he is
a couple of weeks ahead of the doctor's schedule in terms of the
degree to which he can extend the leg.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Refugees arriving in Macedonia from Kosovo
are increasingly reporting rapes and killings by Yugoslav forces,
international observers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving in recent days from the area around Gnijlane
in southeastern Kosovo have related stories of summary executions
and of a mass grave in the area they passed through, said an
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the European group have been interviewing
refugees to try to document reports of atrocities against the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, if true, would represent a worsening of the
situation for civilians fleeing to Macedonia, the official said.
``In particular in the last three to four days, we have had stories
of summary executions,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Albanian refugees have flooded in from Kosovo over
the last few days, in a second wave of mass expulsions conducted by
Yugoslav forces. This wave appears to be slower than the first, in
which 50,000 refugees were forced out in 48 hours, but may prove
more deadly, the European official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is slower, and more systematic,'' he said. ``We are now
getting reports of mass graves, which is an indication that it is
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   After surging over the weekend, the flow of refugees out of
Kosovo slowed dramatically Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first wave of refugees here, largely from Pristina, the
Kosovo capital, and the city of Urosevac, there was only one report
of young men being separated and taken away, a European official
said, and most of the young men from Pristina were allowed to
leave. But reports that men are being separated from their families
and not allowed to leave with them are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The early refugees had reported killings by Serbian security
forces, but in small numbers. ``I had the impression that in the
first wave they did not have time'' to commit systematic killing,
the European official said of the Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   European officials said that in seven interviews recently,
including one with an alleged victim, refugees had reported rapes
by Yugoslav troops or police personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In the other six cases, the refugees said they had witnessed
rapes. One described a rape and the brutal killing of the victim.
Another described seeing the rapes of several women by soldiers or
members of the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   The European group has a team of 50 observers working in refugee
camps and villages in Macedonia, interviewing and trying to
document reports of human rights abuses. Another 77 are working in
Albania. The officials said the team members are being meticulous
in gathering documentation and trying to double-check the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence will be offered to the tribunal at The Hague,
Netherlands, that is prosecuting Balkan war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One European official, who is preparing an internal report
documenting the level of atrocities, described the situation in
Kosovo as ``absolutely lawless,'' with reports of abuses by
Yugoslav civilians as well as soldiers and police personnel. The
official said there were very few reports of police or army
personnel or Serbian friends offering help or protection to Kosovo
Albanians who were threatened with violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one report, a person was reported to have been killed for
refusing to leave for the border, the European officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the office of the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees said Monday that they feared that Yugoslav forces were
again preventing tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians from fleeing
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After a wave of 30,000 refugees poured out of Kosovo during one
24-hour period last weekend, only several hundred refugees from
Kosovo crossed into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro on Monday,
the refugee agency officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all seems very ominous,'' said Kris Janowski, a spokesman
for the office of the high commissioner. ``Before there were tens
of thousands of people who were terrified and fleeing, and now
you've got this invisible curtain that has descended where no one
crosses.''
</P>
<P>
   The few refugees who did manage to arrive in Macedonia reported
seeing Yugoslav forces blocking Albanians from leaving Kosovo.
Systematic attacks on Albanian villages, which refugees said were
intensifying last week in southeastern Kosovo, were now being
carried out against Albanian villages near Pristina, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Adem Kacori, a bus driver who arrived here Monday with his
8-year-old son, said five villages north of Pristina _ Barijlevo,
Milesevo, Leban, Prugovce and Ovenovac _ had been burned by
Yugoslav forces in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Two refugees from the Pristina area reported seeing villages
burning around Pristina during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees continued to describe nightmarish scenes inside Kosovo.
One of the refugees said the body of a man who was shot dead in
front of her home in Pristina lay in the street for four days
because no one dared venture outside to retrieve it. Her sons, she
said, were terrified by the thunderous concussions of NATO bombs
and the endless rifle fire from Serbian paramilitaries.

POLICE COMMISSIONER DEFENDS FRISKING POLICY BEFORE A PANEL OF
SKEPTICS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a City Council hearing punctuated by testy
exchanges, Police Commissioner Howard Safir provided his most
detailed portrait yet of the department's Street Crime Unit on
Monday and defended the unit from allegations that it stops people
because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing _ which was called to scrutinize the unit after four
of its officers shot and killed Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 _ centered
on discussions of race, police procedures and the department's
guidelines for stopping people and patting them down for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Diallo shooting _ and after many
refusals _ Safir gave the racial breakdown of the 362-member unit:
82 percent white, 3 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic and 1
percent Asian. Women make up 9 percent of the unit. Safir has said
that he plans to transfer 50 more minority officers to the unit,
which patrols many neighborhoods that are mostly black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon S. Leffler of Queens, the Democratic chairman of the
Council's Public Safety Committee, asked why steps were not taken
to increase the unit's racial diversity before the Diallo shooting.
He pointed to a July 1996 memorandum by Sandra M. Marsh, then the
department's deputy commissioner for equal employment opportunity,
urging the department to do something about the lack of women and
minority group members in four special units, including the Street
Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that he had referred the memo to a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that 50 street crime officers _ or 13.5 percent of
the current squad _ had fired their weapons before coming to the
unit. Seven were involved in fatal shootings, 10 in shootings that
caused injuries. Questions about the shooting history of the unit's
officers were raised because three of the four officers in the
Diallo killing had been in shootings before. Most officers on the
force never fire their guns.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the hearing centered on the department's tactics for
stopping and frisking people, which are the subject of state and
federal civil rights inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said an analysis of the reports filled out by officers who
stopped and frisked people had led him to believe that they did not
unfairly single out black and Hispanic people. But he said that the
number of reports filled out may not accurately represent the
number of people stopped and frisked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racial and ethnic distribution of the subjects of
stop-and-frisk reports reflects the demographics of known violent
crime suspects as reported by crime victims,'' Safir said.
``Similarly, the demographics of arrestees in violent crimes also
correspond with the demographics of known violent crime suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Several council members challenged him, saying that they
believed that members of minority groups were unfairly stopped.
Mary Pinkett, a Democratic Council member from Brooklyn, drew an
analogy to the pass laws in South Africa under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were somewhere that someone thought you didn't belong,
they could ask for your pass,'' she said. ``In New York City, in
the United States of America, it was considered customary not to
ask for that kind of identification unless you were committing a
crime. Now, what I've been told is that people will see you and
say, `Where are you going? What are you doing here? Why are you
here? Have you identification?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing grew heated when Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge,
Democrat of Manhattan, spoke. ``I am asking if you cannot find a
different way of reducing crime or keeping the crime statistics low
without threatening people's civil liberties,'' she said. ``And
that, I believe, is what's happened with the Street Crime Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir shot back, ``Is that, `When did I stop beating my wife?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eldridge replied that the people who elected her were
interested in the issue, ``and I resent your lack of respect and
your outrageous comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Christine Quinn, a Democrat from Manhattan's West
Side, added, ``And I don't think domestic violence is anything to
joke about, commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said: ``Your suggestion that we do racial profiling is not
true. What we do is we take the victim's description of the
perpetrator, and that's what we use to look for perpetrators.''

CNN, PETER ARNETT AGREE TO PART 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weeks of steadfastly refusing to comment on the status of
Peter Arnett, its onetime leading foreign correspondent, CNN said
Monday that it had reached a financial settlement with Arnett that
would end his 18-year career at CNN.
</P>
<P>
   No specific terms of the deal were disclosed; Arnett had two and
a half years remaining on a five-year contract with the network.
Both sides said the agreement was amicable.
</P>
<P>
   The situation leading up to the settlement was not amicable.
CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, had shut down all previous
attempts at initiating settlement talks, aiming for a date in July
when an option in Arnett's contract would allow the network to
dismiss him without any further payment, Arnett said.
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives refused to say Monday why the network had changed
its strategy and agreed to settle with Arnett. But on Monday,
Arnett, who had previously avoided speaking publicly about his
status at CNN, discussed his displeasure with how CNN was treating
him. He said the network had stopped giving him assignments and had
refused to work out a settlement of his contract. ``I don't think a
journalist of my reputation should be in limbo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's agent, Richard Liebner, was able to conclude the
settlement agreement with Tom Johnson, the chairman of CNN, Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN issued a terse news release calling the settlement ``an
understanding that will bring Arnett's 18-year service to an
amicable conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Johnson said CNN was ``grateful for Peter's
contributions to CNN and we wish him the very best in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same statement, Arnett said, ``I've had a long and
wonderful relationship with CNN and have been proud to be part of
this great news organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett became CNN's most recognizable correspondent after he
reported the American bombing of Iraq during the Gulf War, live
from Baghdad, in 1991. That was the highest moment in CNN's
history, and transformed it into a fully credible competitor of the
news divisions of CBS, NBC and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Arnett also took part in what became CNN's lowest
moment, when a report in June called ``Tailwind,'' which contended
that American forces in Vietnam had used the lethal nerve gas
sarin, was found to be so unsupported by the facts in a subsequent
in-house investigation that CNN retracted it and apologized to the
public for having aired it. Two producers were dismissed and a
third resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, who had been the chief correspondent for the report,
defended himself by saying he did virtually no work on the report,
and received a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   While his job was saved at that time, the network has used him
just once since the retraction last July. He was never called to
take part in CNN's coverage of the war in Yugoslavia despite his
experience. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his coverage of the
Vietnam War for The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett will be free to seek other jobs in television, an
associate close to him said Monday. But he may try to work as a
writer instead.

RAMBIS' OUTBURST SPARKS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Cocky, confident, egotistical. Those were the Lakers
of February.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate. Deflated. Those were the Lakers who returned to the
Forum on Monday _ a three-game losing streak hanging over them like
a thick, brown haze over the San Fernando Valley in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games to go in a season teetering on the edge of disaster,
the Lakers needed something, anything to boost their self-esteem,
if not their playoff seeding.
</P>
<P>
   They got it with a 117-102 rout of the Vancouver Grizzlies but
not without the usual struggle.
</P>
<P>
   A shattered clipboard did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by a half-dozen points midway through the
third quarter when coach Kurt Rambis focused all his frustrations
on an 8-by-14 piece of white plastic, blasting it into pieces
against the Forum hardwood. The Lakers got the message, gaining the
lead by the end of the quarter and sending it into double digits by
early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was like, `Did he just do what we think he just
did?''' Robert Horry said of Rambis' clipboard abuse. ``You see we
took over after that. We played a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   It started with defense, the Lakers' source of many a loss over
the last four weeks. Though they allowed Vancouver 56 percent
shooting and 60 points in the first half, and surrendered 100-plus
points for the fourth straight game, the Lakers gave themselves a
passing grade for improved defense. The Grizzlies ended up shooting
47.5 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really happy with the way our guys improved tonight,''
Rambis said. ``You could see their activity, you could see guys
stunting, you could see guys trapping. They were in the right place
most of the time, though they still got some offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the first half, when the Grizzlies seemed to score at
will, it was not for lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hitting shots with hands in their faces,'' Rambis
said. ``I wasn't displeased with the defense in the first half....
We were doing the right things most of the time. They hit some
tough shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense has rarely been the Lakers' problem, but that was
improved as well. They hit 53.5 percent of their field goals and
dished out 30 assists, led by eight from Kobe Bryant, who scored 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led six Lakers in double figures, with 35. Glen
Rice scored 18 and the bench did the rest _ Robert Horry (17
points, 12 rebounds), Tyronn Lue (15) and Ruben Patterson (11) all
scored season highs.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies Patterson and Lue led the late third-quarter charge that
regained the Lakers' lead and they kept it up in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just go out and play hard, it's a lot of innocent
energy,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off double-digit losses at Utah and Portland, the Lakers
figured to be due for a blowout of their own against the Grizzlies,
who had just one win in 20 road games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's day off let them clear their heads of Saturday's loss
to the Jazz. The only thing left to do was erase all memories of
the prior week with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but you have to do it,'' Bryant said. ``That's
something that we've kind of been doing all year. And as the year
went on, we found ourselves getting better at it, because you don't
have a choice. That's what you have to do.''

THE GREAT ONE A SUPERSTAR WITHOUT THE AIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While speaking to school kids, service clubs and
journalism students, the question is inevitable: Who's your
favorite athlete?
</P>
<P>
   I'm always evasive, because a) I don't have one; b) if I did,
disclosure would reveal a bias, and c) I'd also have to explain why
somebody's hero isn't my favorite, which inevitably leads to some
truth-telling most sports followers don't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Once in awhile, however, the question is more sharply defined:
Who's your favorite interview?
</P>
<P>
   That one's easy.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gretzky shows up in Seattle about as often as a parking
space downtown, his choice might sound surprising. The absence of
the National Hockey League here makes Gretzky a distant sort of
exotica, a little like, say, penguins or the British royals.
</P>
<P>
   He used to show up in Victoria, however. For years, one of his
old clubs, the Los Angeles Kings, held training camp in musty old
Memorial Arena. Aside from the odd exhibition game in Tacoma,
Victoria might be as close as Gretzky would come, and the ride to
Vancouver Island is a tad more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   So 10 years ago I called the Kings for Gretzky's schedule,
jumped on the Clipper and figured when I got blown off for the
interview, at least I'd be somewhere besides the Tacoma Dome
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Timing turned out to be good, on two counts: Gretzky had just
begun training with the Kings after his controversial departure
from Edmonton in what was then known as the Trade of the Century,
and almost nobody else was there.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the Kings' cramped, stinky locker room after
practice, and almost everyone was gone except Gretzky, who was
pulling on cowboy boots that I knew would just have to be left
behind if he expected to get a table anywhere in LA.
</P>
<P>
   No entourage. No PR flacks. No toothless teammates. No hovering
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' he said brightly _ speaking first, which remains
unprecedented in my superstar-interview history.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger, I explained myself, apologized for my lack of
appointment, and just before blaming my mother for having me, he
said, ``Sit down. What's on your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon a 45-minute conversation followed that went from the
obvious topics of the trade and hockey's future, to American
politics, the NBA, Seattle's absence from the NHL and why it is in
Southern California that fire season follows mudslide season by
about a week.
</P>
<P>
   I waited for him to glance at his watch. Instead, I ran out of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious he was concerned about what Canadians were
feeling about his departure that he helped arrange, since it
symbolized what was happening throughout the Great White North _
anyone or anything that made good, went south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout my career, I've been worried about what people said
or thought,'' he said. ``But for the first time, I decided to do
what's best for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conferred with my wife and parents, and a couple of close
friends. Even they thought I would stay in Edmonton. This time, I
thought I would do something for Wayne Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   Selfish as it sounded, Gretzky felt compelled to explain himself
honestly, a characteristic that served him at least as well as his
stick handling.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that his departure to LA was bigger than
him. The NHL's financial survival depended on selling the game to a
larger American market.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom became apparent. When he spoke, the NHL had 21 teams.
Now it has 27, with newcomers mostly in the prosperous Sunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of that can be credited to Gretzky's move, but there's
not an NHL fan who won't tell you the presence of the game's best,
most artful player in a major market was the most significant
development in assuring hockey's place in North American sports.
</P>
<P>
   Wrenching as was the trade, Canadian hockey fans even 10 years
ago seemed to understand. A couple of days before in Victoria, the
old arena was packed with 5,400 fans who cheered him lustily,
without rancor, during an exhibition game. The feeling followed him
throughout one of sports' most stupendous careers.
</P>
<P>
   The logic and inevitability of Gretzky's move was apparent, as
was the trust and respect hockey fans had for him, apart from
adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond his numbers, perhaps the most remarkable thing about
Gretzky's 20-year career is that no one in these skeptical times
had anything bad to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   Even upon his departure, Gretzky knew he couldn't go out a
champion, as did Michael Jordan. So he let it be known a few days
ahead that his career was over, allowing a mutually fulfilling
tribute that was neither drawn out nor maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   Greatness is a difficult enterprise to manage. There is no
manual on how, and to whom, to say yes and no. While the
impossibility of pleasing everyone is well-known, the ability to
care about how one's conduct impacts others is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was an exit, or an interview, or rewriting sports
history, Gretzky demonstrated how to be great beyond one's gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The man's final score was not a goal, but an assist.

PLAYOFFS IN DOUBT AS SONICS FALL THREE GAMES UNDER .500

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Detlef Schrempf thought he had defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   He had played Houston forward Charles Barkley tough all night.
So when Barkley received the ball in the paint with the Rockets
clinging to a 108-104 lead, Schrempf bore down for a stop.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, though, tossed Schrempf aside on his way to the hoop.
The whistle blew as Barkley scored. Then he converted the
three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence may not sum up the Sonics' season, but it did put
the finishing touches on Monday night's 120-113 loss at the Compaq
Center.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Schrempf has yet to look at the standings this season.
The once-formidable Sonics _ the NBA's last undefeated team at 6-0
_ have been pushed aside. And no matter what they do, they can't
escape that sinking feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Down to their last nine games, the Sonics find themselves tied
with Sacramento for the eighth and final playoff berth in the
Western Conference. The Kings defeated the Los Angeles Clippers
Monday for their second straight victory while the Sonics lost
their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   At 19-22, Seattle is three games under .500 for the first time
this season. One of the teams ahead of them, the 22-20 Minnesota
Timberwolves, visit KeyArena Wednesday night in a must-win game for
the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Houston earned its victory Monday. When Barkley wasn't punishing
the Sonics with three the hard way down low, the Rockets were
lighting up the Sonics with conventional treys.
</P>
<P>
   Houston made 13 of its 27 3-point attempts, including two big
ones that kept the Sonics at bay down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Barkley burned Schrempf with 2:14 left in the
game, Sam Mack drained a 3-pointer to put the Rockets ahead 114-104
and the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is a battle,'' said Schrempf, who led the Sonics
with 28 points and 13 rebounds. ``We can't beat anybody big the way
we're playing. ... So I never look at the standings. Otherwise I'd
be disappointed because I've never seen us anywhere but the top
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics played their fifth game in six nights. They won just
one of those games _ an overtime affair at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not into it right now,'' Sonics point guard Gary Payton
said. ``Hopefully, we'll be ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   If they make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sacramento, the Sonics also must hold off the
Golden State Warriors, who were idle Monday but gained ground
because the Sonics lost. At 18-22, the Warriors are just a
half-game behind the Sonics and Kings.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person had a positive attitude after Monday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying hard to find something to complain about,'' Sonics
coach Paul Westphal said. ``We're playing hard and giving a good
effort. ... If we can play that well, we can make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Westphal's crew led only once in this one. Schrempf
scored a layup for the game's first basket. From there, it was an
uphill battle for the Sonics, who could never get over the Rockets'
pile of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Sonics won the rebounding war, 45-37. Forget
about their 51-percent shooting and mere 13 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With forward Vin Baker sitting out because of a sore right knee,
the Sonics could not match up with Barkley or Hakeem Olajuwon. Both
players forced the Sonics to double-team the post.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Sonics doubled down, Barkley and Olajuwon found
open jump shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason our rotations were a little slow,'' guard
Hersey Hawkins said. ``But you have to give them credit. They
knocked it down whenever they were open.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Rockets team that missed 22 of 27 3-point
attempts in a 101-84 loss to the Sonics April 4 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had wide-open looks,'' Sonics reserve Dale Ellis said.
``It was a simple game, inside out, for them. They made the shots.
You're not going to contest every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics avoided a slow start and stayed close to the Rockets
in the opening period. But they dug a big hole in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Houston extended a 34-29 first-quarter lead to 16 points by
exploiting the Sonics' weak interior defense with hard drives to
the basket and deft low-post offense from Barkley and Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics turned the ball over eight times in the second
quarter and trailed 56-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Payton helped erase an 11-point deficit in the third quarter and
sparked the Sonics' last run of the period _ a 7-1 spurt _ that got
the Sonics within 84-79 heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0-for-8 in the first half for just two points,
Payton was all but unstoppable. He hit eight of his 10 field-goal
attempts in the third quarter and scored 17 points in the period.
Payton's outburst came on a variety of moves, and mostly with
Houston rookie Cuttino Mobley defending him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to get after it,'' said Payton, who collected
21 of his 23 points in the second half. ``But it still wasn't
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics kept fighting back throughout the game. They nearly
overcame a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same story for us,'' Schrempf said.
</P>
<P>
   A precarious one.

DODGERS NO MATCH FOR BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget about the postseason failures that will
forever be an asterisk on Atlanta's resume. When the rest of the
National League wants a barometer, they measure themselves with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson spoke of that. So did general
manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   And in their first chance to measure themselves Monday night,
the Dodgers produced nothing. They didn't even do enough to gain
consideration of being a notch on the Braves' measuring stick,
bowing 11-3 in a gruesome display at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Atlanta's starters had at least one hit as the Braves
pounded out 18 hits for the game. The onslaught came a day after
the Braves scored 20 runs against the Rockies in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never pretty when your pitching isn't good and their
pitching is good,'' Johnson said. ``It's almost as if they knew
what was coming. You'll make a good pitch and they'd hit it hard.
There's not a whole lot to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (7-7) have lost three of four after being taken to
task by Atlanta right-hander John Smoltz in the opener of the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we had that feeling in '88 or '89, we looked at the
top teams and wondered what it would take to get there,'' Smoltz
said after tossing six innings of one-run ball. ``The bottom line
for us any time is it really doesn't matter who we play. We don't
look at any series we play as bigger than another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers do, or did, if only from the perspective of wanting
to prove worthy of challenging the Braves six months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this was game 14 of 162, that may still happen. But
the Dodgers have immediate issues to deal with, including what's
wrong with starting pitcher Carlos Perez. He may have pitched
himself out of his next start after being racked for six runs and
eight hits in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and pitching coach Charlie Hough are deciding what spot
in the rotation will be skipped because of off days Thursday and
Monday. After collapsing in the seventh inning in each of his first
two starts, the shortest outing by a Dodgers starter this season
may be enough to bump Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is deciding between Perez (0-3, 8.31 ERA), Darren
Dreifort (2-0, 2.25) or Ismael Valdes (1-0, 4.12).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to figure how the guy pitched,'' Johnson said. ``The
guy who hasn't pitched well more than likely is going to miss a
start. At this point, it might be Carlos.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Perez not pitch well, he didn't exhibit much
confidence or awareness on the mound. He yielded a two-run single
to Smoltz (2-0) in the second inning and came unnerved in the
third. Chipper Jones, who left the game in the sixth with a rib
cage strain, hit a solo homer to give the Braves a 3-0 lead. Andruw
Jones then walked, Perez balked him to second and his attempted
pickoff went into center field to move the runner to third. Jones
scored on Brian Hunter's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves knocked Perez out in the fourth. It began with Bret
Boone's two-out infield single. Chipper Jones walked and Brian
Jordan smacked a two-run double to left as Atlanta went ahead 6-0.
Perez should have been backing up home, but instead was in front of
the plate and cut off the relay throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave up eight hits and I believe all eight were on
off-speed pitches,'' Hough said. ``It tells me he wasn't real sharp
or they were just dead sitting on it. He was a little high with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a debacle kind of night, the only salvageable thing for the
Dodgers were solo homers by Dave Hansen, Todd Hundley and Raul
Mondesi, who is tied for the league lead with six.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Robinson Checo, the middle reliever the Dodgers
received from Detroit in the Dave Mlicki trade Friday, had an
equally rough time in his debut. Johnson tried to save his bullpen
from burning out, so Checo was tagged for five runs on eight hits
over 31/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone feels like they're doing a wonderful job, that's
where problems exist,'' Dodgers second baseman Eric Young said.
``We know we can all do better.''

U.S. WINERIES FLOURISHING IN OVERSEAS EXPORTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. wine exports have rocketed more than 1,400
percent in the past 12 years, the industry reported Monday, with
California vintners accounting for 90 percent of those sales.
</P>
<P>
   Exports rose 20 percent last year alone, to $537 million. Wine
Institute President John De Luca predicted another big increase
this year and said export sales could hit $1 billion within five
years. Exports now account for 12.5 percent of the industry's
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing the results at the Wine Institute's annual Washington
luncheon, De Luca also noted that China has promised to slash its
wine import tariffs from 60 percent to 20 percent over five years
if the Clinton administration agrees to support China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca attributed the booming exports to a rise in worldwide
consumption of more expensive premium wines. The United Kingdom has
become the largest market for California wines, accounting for a
quarter of U.S. wine exports. Sales there rose 32 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Second in line is Japan, with exports there rising 101 percent
last year to $93 million, followed by Canada, with $91 million in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. winemakers now rank fourth in the world in wine production.
</P>
<P>
   California vintners said the export growth is all the more
remarkable given high overseas wine tariffs and heavy government
subsidies to European winemakers. They said they are continuing to
battle for lower tariffs and are also making a new effort at
cooperating with their European counterparts to keep wine from
being used as a bargaining chip in international trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent banana trade dispute between the United States
and the European Union, winemakers on both sides of the Atlantic
asked their governments not to draw them into the dispute, De Luca
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to both governments with a message that the wine trade
should not be used as a bargaining chip involving corn brooms,
poultry or bananas or anything else,'' De Luca said.
</P>
<P>
   The winemakers said they are also continuing to attack what De
Luca described as domestic interstate trade barriers _ a peculiar
holdover from Prohibition _ which give states unusual regulatory
controls over alcohol marketing. These include state monopolies
that restrict retail liquor sales and bans on wine sales in food
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may well indeed make faster progress overseas'' than
against interstate trade barriers, De Luca said. The industry has
been negotiating mini ``trade agreements'' with each state, ``as
though dealing with a foreign government,'' De Luca said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sales have become the biggest domestic issue for
winemakers, particularly small vintners who have trouble getting
their wines distributed to major wholesalers and retailers and rely
heavily on direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen states have long prohibited out-of-state direct
shipments to consumers _ including tourists who visit wineries and
want to send home a case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, became alarmed by the growth of such
shipments, particularly the potential for minors to order alcohol.
Hatch has introduced legislation to allow states to sue in federal
court to stop wine shipments that violate state marketing laws or
are purchased by minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent that modern technology has opened the door for
abuse,'' Hatch said at a hearing he held in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch has promised to work on a compromise with California
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, to improve ``certification and
verification'' of Internet sales to make sure they comply with
state regulations.

First-round playoff previews 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 1. Dallas Stars (51-19-12) vs. 8. Edmonton Oilers (33-37-12) Season
series: Stars won, 3-0-1 The Stars' symptoms: Sure, Derian Hatcher
will miss the first five games of the playoffs with a suspension,
but the Stars are a tougher team because of it. Hatcher's hit sent
a message to the NHL, and his absence will require his teammates to
take up the slack against an Oilers team that is promising a
physical series. The Stars need to dominate to prove they've
stepped up their playoff intensity from last season. The heart: The
veterans. There is a hunger here that stretches from Guy Carbonneau
to Ed Belfour to Brett Hull. The brain: The Stars' playoff hopes
revolve around Belfour's ability to handle pressure in goal. The
Stars play low-scoring hockey, so the pressure will be there almost
every game. The prognosis looks good if: Belfour is a rock, Hull
adds some scoring punch, the Stars luck out on injuries, and the
players keep their hunger for the Stanley Cup. The Oilers'
symptoms: This is one interesting dog. The Oilers aren't sure if
they want to keep coach Ron Low, yet they play best when he's cocky
and letting them run. They went to the trouble of picking up
talented defensemen Janne Niinimaa and Roman Hamrlik last season
and already don't like them. And still they went 6-3-1 down the
stretch. The Oilers have speed and grit, but the big question is
whether Tommy Salo can replace Curtis Joseph (now in Toronto) in
goal. The heart: Doug Weight. The gritty goal scorer still drives
the bus. Despite a knee injury, he has to be good for them to win.
The brain: Todd Marchant. As difficult as it is to say, the yappy
little forward has his finger on the pulse of the team. And they
respond to him. The prognosis looks good if: The Oilers rough up
the Stars, and the Stars' power play doesn't respond to the
challenge. But with leading goal scorers Bill Guerin and Josef
Beranek out at least two games with injuries, the Oilers might not
be able to score.
<TEXT>
<P>
   2. Colorado Avalanche (44-28-10) vs. 7. San Jose Sharks
(37-26-19) Season series: Avalanche won, 3-1 The Avalanche's
symptoms: No team has more raw offensive talent on the top end than
the Avalanche, which boasts Peter Forsberg (97 points), Joe Sakic
(96 points) and Theo Fleury (93 points). And they put all three
together on the same line at times! The Avalanche has skill, a
fantastic goalie in Patrick Roy (32-19-8, 2.29 goals-against
average) and an underrated defense (Adam Foote and Sandis Ozolinsh
are All-Stars). However, they get frustrated by muck-it-up teams
and could face three in a row (the Sharks, Red Wings and Stars).
The heart: Roy. His cockiness is alarming, but it's also a show
that he could be getting ready for something special. The brain:
Fleury. People can't get past his 5-foot-6 height and gap-toothed
grin, but this is one hockey player who rises to every occasion.
The prognosis is good if: Roy doesn't slip and the Avalanche
doesn't try to win every game, 5-1. The Sharks' symptoms: Lying in
wait in San Jose could be the West's giant killers. The Sharks play
a physically demanding, mentally demanding style that forces
opponents to take hits, play cautious and wait for a chance at a
2-1 victory. Along the way, opponents have to put up with the
annoyance of chippy players Bryan Marchment, Mike Ricci and Owen
Nolan and maybe the most annoying arena for an opponent: the Shark
Tank. The heart: This team has no clear leader, and that could be
its biggest problem. The brains: Recently acquired center Vincent
Damphousse gives the Sharks an air of offensive legitimacy. Not too
much, though; they rank last among playoff teams in scoring at 2.4
goals per game. The pieces come together if: Nolan doesn't try to
kill everyone on the ice, Marchment doesn't try to kill everyone on
the ice and Ricci doesn't try to kill everyone on the ice. Oh, and
either Mike Vernon or Steve Shields will have to save the team in
net.
</P>
<P>
   3. Detroit Red Wings (43-32-7) vs. 6. Anaheim Mighty Ducks
(35-34-13) Season series: Red Wings won, 3-1. The Red Wings'
symptoms: Face it, that deadline-day scared you. Detroit appeared
dazed by Stanley Cup hangover and a injury spate that seemed to
drain the heart out of the team. But adding Chris Chelios, Wendel
Clark, Ulf Samuelsson and Bill Ranford in a span of three hours
changed everything. The Red Wings had offensive depth and improved
it. And now the defense _ featuring Chelios, Samuelsson, Nick
Lidstrom, Larry Murphy, Aaron Ward and Todd Gill _ is as good or
better than the Stars' defense. Not one Red Wings player has played
over his head this season, and that's a scary thought heading into
the playoffs. The heart: Steve Yzerman. Captain Courageous is just
a darned good hockey player every night. The brain: Coach Scotty
Bowman has had a hand in nine Stanley Cups and knows how to tweak
his players and an opponent. The prognosis looks good if: They play
sound hockey and goalie Chris Osgood doesn't make too many
mistakes. The Ducks' symptoms: They are a fun team to watch ... and
a fun team to play against. There's good reason: They're all about
offensive chances and the splendor that is Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne. The Ducks frustrate teams that are undisciplined, like
Phoenix, but they grind to a halt against teams like the Stars and
Red Wings. Anaheim will have trouble moving the puck against the
Red Wings' trap and will likely have goalie Guy Hebert face even
more than his average of 32 shots per game. The heart: Selanne. His
47 goals and 60 assists speak to his skill. But even more
impressive is his love of the game. The brain: Kariya. He is like
Wayne Gretzky without emotion. He sees things in a different way.
The prognosis looks good if: Selanne, Kariya and underrated center
Steve Rucchin fight through the Red Wings' forwards, then through
the Red Wings' defense, then through Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix Coyotes (39-31-12) vs. 5. St. Louis Blues (37-32-13)
Season series: Blues won, 2-1-1 The Coyotes' symptoms: Does anyone
remember that this team was 24-11-7? That means since mid-season,
they have been below .500 at 15-20-5 _ ranking 19th in the league
over that span. Add to the mix the fact leading scorer Jeremy
Roenick will miss the playoffs with a broken jaw, and there's
little to like about this team's chances. The heart: Captain Keith
Tkachuk. He's obnoxious, loud and talented. Tkachuk had 68 points
in 68 games and was plus-22. He chipped in 151 penalty minutes just
for fun. The brains: Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin pushed this team to
the top early in the season but has been mortal since the All-Star
break. The prognosis looks good if: Role players such as Rick
Tocchet, Greg Adams and Robert Reichel start scoring goals and the
Coyotes learn not to self-destruct. The Blues' symptoms: Throughout
the season, the Blues have had one of the most confusing teams in
the NHL. They were strong offensively, great on special teams and
limited opponents to a league-low 22.3 shots per game. So why
couldn't they break .500? The problem turned out to be goaltending,
where the Blues missed injured No. 1 goalie Grant Fuhr and posted a
league-worst .887 save percentage. Since Fuhr has returned, the
Blues finished on a 5-3-2 run and appear ready to take the next
step in the playoffs. The heart: Al MacInnis. He should be the
clear winner of the Norris Trophy as the top defenseman this season
and is a threat to win any game with his thundering slapshot. The
brain: Forward Pavol Demitra. He has 37 goals and 52 assists,
picking up the scoring slack left when Brett Hull departed for the
Stars. The prognosis looks good if: Fuhr stays healthy. The veteran
is wearing down, and the Blues have absolutely no depth at the
position.
EASTERN CONFERENCE 1. New Jersey Devils (47-24-11) vs. 8.
Pittsburgh Penguins (38-30-14) Season series: Devils won, 4-1. The
Devils' symptoms: After getting off to a shaky start under new
coach Robbie Ftorek, the Devils have quietly overtaken the Eastern
Conference and come in with the top seed and the hottest road team
in NHL history (28-10-3). They finished the regular season on an
8-2 run and could win the Stanley Cup. The heart: Defenseman Scott
Stevens leads a group of no-names who have decent size, decent
speed and balanced scoring. None of them will be among the
finalists for any postseason award. The brain: Goalie Martin
Brodeur isn't shaken easily. The prognosis looks good if: The
balanced scoring of Petr Sykora (29 goals), Bobby Holik (27 goals),
Jason Arnott (27 goals) and Brian Rolston (24 goals) keeps up. The
Penguins' symptoms: No team has fallen faster than Pittsburgh. It
is a miracle that coach Kevin Constantine held them together; now,
there are rumors of bad feelings between Constantine and Jaromir
Jagr and the Penguins finished the season on a 2-7-2 run. The
heart: Jagr. He led the NHL in scoring (127 points) and should be
the Hart Trophy winner as regular-season MVP. The brain:
Constantine was heralded as a coach-of-the-year candidate before
the rift with Jagr. The prognosis looks good if: Everything is
perfect, Jagr goes crazy, Tom Barrasso is reborn in goal, and
Martin Straka, German Titov and Alexei Kovalev outscore everyone
else.
2. Ottawa Senators (44-23-15) vs. 7. Buffalo Sabres (37-28-17)
Season series: Senators won, 1-0-4. The Senators' symptoms: They
are a miraculous team, a bunch of young Europeans that have
overtaken the hearts of many Canadians. They have speed, strong
defense, good coaching and solid goaltending. What they might lack
is toughness and experience. The heart: Alexei Yashin. He had 44
goals and 50 assists this season, and he overturned the Senators'
applecart and helped bring in new management three years ago. The
brain: Stoic Jacques Martin is viewed by many as the best coach in
the NHL. The prognosis looks good if: The Senators play their
controlled game, get timely scoring and are able to work out an
unusual goalie split between Damian Rhodes and Ron Tugnutt. The
Sabres' symptoms: They are the most unpredictable team in hockey,
and quite possibly a real trap for the Senators. Two-time league
MVP Dominik Hasek has regained his form, and the Sabres love to
play a high-risk game knowing Hasek is backing them. The heart:
Captain Michael Peca. When he is on, he is the most complete player
in the league this side of Colorado's Peter Forsberg. Peca can
score (27 goals), get dirty and play defense. The brain: Hasek's
head is the turning point of this franchise. If he's on, they win.
If he's distracted, they fall. The prognosis looks good if: Hasek
is light's out, Peca and the band of 20-something goal scorers get
hot, and the Sabres find some semblance of defense.
3. Carolina Hurricanes (34-30-18) vs. 6. Boston Bruins (39-30-13)
Season series: Tied, 2-2-1 The Hurricanes' symptoms: This team
should be given credit for surviving hardship. The former Hartford
Whalers have to travel an hour to home games, play in front of
crowds of about 9,000 and are somewhat controversial because they
gained the third seed in the East by winning the weak Southeast
Division despite having the eight-best record in the conference.
That's likely too much to overcome. The heart: Arturs Irbe. The
former Stars goalie has dragged this team to a spot nobody thought
it could get to. The brain: Sami Kapanen. A Jere Lehtinen clone,
Kapanen has 24 goals and 35 assists, and plays great defense. The
prognosis looks good if: The hockey gods decide to play a joke on
the league and allow the Hurricanes to advance despite nobody in
Carolina caring. Ah, maybe a Carolina Cup finals before a sellout
of 11,000. The Bruins' symptoms: They are a young team looking for
an identity. They are a step ahead of a near miracle season last
year and two steps away from missing the playoffs two seasons ago.
But they have solid forwards, underrated goalie Byron Dafoe and Ray
Bourque, one of the best defensemen in NHL history. The heart:
Dafoe. The young goalie could finish in the top three in voting for
the Vezina Trophy for the best goaltender. His 32-23-11 record and
1.99 goals-against average are impressive. The brain: Bourque. A
five-time Norris Trophy winner as the league's best defenseman,
Bourque is in his 20th season and hasn't worn out. The prognosis
looks good if: Dafoe continues his acrobatics, and the line of
Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov and Dmitri Kristich finds its
groove.
4. Toronto Maple Leafs (45-30-7) vs. 5. Philadelphia Flyers
(37-26-19) Season series: Flyers won, 3-1 The Maple Leafs'
symptoms: They have gone from missing the playoffs last year to the
fourth seed thanks to the addition of goalie Curtis Joseph and a
new philosophy. With Joseph in net, Toronto has become a
high-rolling, take-chances team that led the NHL in scoring with
268 goals (3.3 per game). The heart: Joseph. Cujo killed the Stars
two seasons ago and took out the Avalanche last season. He's not
afraid of anyone. The brain: Mats Sundin. Though soft-spoken,
Sundin has taken well to the role of captain. The prognosis looks
good if: Joseph is Cujo. The Maple Leafs' balanced scoring only
works if they have full faith that their goalie will stop almost
everything. The Flyers' symptoms: They did everything possible to
wrangle a chance at the Stanley Cup this season, and now many will
be surprised if they get out of the first round. The Flyers
continue to be the NHL's enigma. Eric Lindros has become a leader,
but a collapsed lung put him out of the playoffs. Mark Recchi had
returned home, but dizzy spells sidelined him late in the season.
John Vanbiesbrouck was a goalie with timing until he realized he
was wearing a Flyers uniform. The heart: Lindros is it, and he's
not there. Maybe Rod Brind'Amour can take over. The brain: John
LeClair. He's painfully quiet, but he's one of the top goal scorers
in the NHL the past five seasons. The prognosis looks good if: The
players stop hating coach Roger Neilson for his hard-driving ways,
Vanbiesbrouck finds a groove, and everyone picks up the slack left
by Lindros' absence.

SEEKING TO CHAINSAW THE MEDICINE WHEEL HISTORIC PRESERVATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Once
again, the drive for profit would invade sacred ground. A Wyoming
sawmill company has filed a civil suit against the U.S. Forest
Service for closing off a portion of the Bighorn National Forest to
harvesting timber. That portion of the national forest contains a
site sacred to many American Indian tribes, including the Crow,
Arapaho, Shoshone, Bannock, Blackfeet, Sioux, Plains Cree and the
Northern Cheyenne.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disputed area lies within the boundaries of the Forest
Service's Historic Preservation Plan for the Medicine Wheel
National Historic Landmark and Medicine Mountain. The Medicine
Wheel, an 80-foot-diameter circle with 28 rock spokes radiating
from a central, hollow cairn, is located atop the 10,000-foot
Medicine Mountain in Big Horn County, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Medicine Wheel and the mountain are considered sacred
to tribes and are a significant part of the cultural heritage of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For over six years, numerous diverse groups participated in
developing the Medicine Wheel preservation plan: the Big Horn
County Commissioners, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,
Medicine Wheel Coalition for Sacred Sites of North America,
Medicine Wheel Alliance, State Historic Preservation Office,
Federal Aviation Administration (which operates a long-range radar
facility located on Medicine Mountain), and Forest Service managers
of the Bighorn National Forest. They worked together to protect a
valuable cultural and spiritual resource.
</P>
<P>
   But trees must be cut for timber. So Mountain State Legal
Foundation out of Denver, which has an unfortunate tendency to see
the protection of American Indian sacred sites as a violation of
the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, filed suit for Wyoming
Sawmills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Bighorn National Forest includes more than a million acres;
approximately 40 percent of that acreage contains timber that can
be harvested. The land set aside for the Medicine Wheel Historic
Preservation Plan is a mere 18,000 acres, and less than 60 percent
of it is forested. It hardly seems necessary to go after timber
situated within a cultural landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed by Mountain States Legal Foundation alleges
that the Forest Service's Historic Preservation Plan for the
Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark and vicinity cancels
timber sales and timber harvesting for the ``sole purpose of
furthering Native American religions'' and ``to advance the
practice of Native American religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The four other claims made in the lawsuit allege that the Forest
Service did not follow federal guidelines when establishing the
Historic Preservation Plan. They are the obligatory, kitchen-sink
allegations found in most lawsuits. In a preservation plan that is
so complex, it is possible some federal guideline was overlooked.
It is clear the lawsuit hinges on the legal foundation's allegation
that setting up this historic preservation plan and closing off
portions of the forest to timber harvesting violates the
Establishment Clause: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medicine Wheel is the main feature in the preservation area.
But the surrounding acres contain various alignments of rocks, tipi
rings, travois trails, and caves used for tribal ceremonies. One
trail leads from the Yellowstone National Park over the Bighorn
Mountains to the Medicine Wheel. Although the origin of the
Medicine Wheel has been lost in antiquity, there is little doubt of
its ceremonial significance to American Indian tribes. Evidence
indicates that the area had been used by Indian tribes for nearly
7,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 20,000 visitors who came to view the Medicine Wheel
last year may have sensed the spiritual nature of this sacred site.
While there are non-Indians who scoff at the very notion of sacred
sites, it is deeply embedded in European tradition. There are
temples in Greece, Turkey and other parts of Europe that were built
over centuries, one upon another to glorify different deities. At
one site in Greece, a temple built to a goddess of fertility was
rebuilt to worship Athena, and much later rebuilt again to
celebrate the Virgin Mary. Those sites were recognized as somehow
sacred, somehow deeply spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   But the complex spiritual nature of Medicine Mountain and its
Medicine Wheel does not lend itself easily to such comparisons.
Many Indian tribal leaders regard Medicine Mountain as the
significant spiritual landscape and the Medicine Wheel as a
component of that landscape.
</P>
<P>
   How then, does a sawmill company, which must bid on timber sales
in national forests, lose if a small percentage of the total
acreage of the Bighorn National Forest is closed to timber
harvesting? And if there is a loss, what is it compared to the
preservation of sacred ground?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has lived near logging roads knows the dust and
noise, the whine and roar of truck engines. Anyone who has heard
chainsaws used to down trees knows the unrelenting buzz and brack
of steel against live wood. How is one to seek the spiritual with
the shrill screech of profiteering ringing in the soul? Where there
is no silence, there is no spiritual solace.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has walked in mountains anywhere knows the importance
of silence, the importance of feeling at one with the land we walk
upon, the importance of recognizing some essence beyond ourselves.
Silence allows us to explore that realm.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicine Wheel Historic Preservation Plan accommodates
American Indian religions, as it should. The plan does not prohibit
Wyoming Sawmills Inc. from making a profit from timber harvesting
in other areas of the Bighorn National Forest. There is no clash of
one against the other. And there is no Establishment Clause
violation here, only wise accommodation to the best in all of us _
a recognition that every culture's religious beliefs deserve
protection.

<P>
   Outside the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., the sights, sounds and smells are all of a seaside
paradise. Inside, in biologist William Fenical's lab, it's good-bye
to the sea's charms and hello to the disgusting and fascinating
world of creatures scooped from that ocean outside, ground up and
thrown at every frightening disease Fenical can think of.
</P>
<P>
   This is the medicine chest of the next millennium _ agar-filled
dishes, flasks full of brown nutrient broth and beakers bubbling
like omelets in hell's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   What's brewing in these potent pots? Stews of fungi and bacteria
that once lived in ocean sediments, rotting driftwood, weeds,
coral, sponges and grasses. Any one of these containers might
harbor a brand-new cancer drug or a compound to wipe out some of
the scariest viruses known to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy is to go to a place where life is diverse and
concentrated, such as a reef in the Caribbean. An environment rich
in sea life is more likely to yield varied specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sitting right there. It's diverse as hell. And it's
waiting for us.''

 By ROSIE MESTEL  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Outside the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., the sights, sounds and smells are all of a seaside
paradise. Inside, in biologist William Fenical's lab, it's good-bye
to the sea's charms and hello to the disgusting and fascinating
world of creatures scooped from that ocean outside, ground up and
thrown at every frightening disease Fenical can think of.
</P>
<P>
   This is the medicine chest of the next millennium _ agar-filled
dishes, flasks full of brown nutrient broth and beakers bubbling
like omelets in hell's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   What's brewing in these potent pots? Stews of fungi and bacteria
that once lived in ocean sediments, rotting driftwood, weeds,
coral, sponges and grasses. Any one of these containers might
harbor a brand-new cancer drug or a compound to wipe out some of
the scariest viruses known to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>

<P>
   &UR; THE DRACULA SYNDROME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Juan Gomez-Alonso has formulated an unusual medical
hypothesis, an explanation for the origin of vampire legends.
Stories of lusty, bloodthirsty vampires, says Gomez-Alonso, who
works at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, may have been inspired by
people suffering from rabies.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the connection to a rabies outbreak in central Europe
in the early 18th century, not long before stories of vampires
began circulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the symptoms, such as aggressiveness and
hypersexuality, would not have been seen as manifestations of a
disease,'' he says. ``Uneducated people could have thought all this
was the work of a malign being. Moreover, the bizarre rejection of
some stimuli _ odors, light, water and mirrors _ shown by rabid
humans must have been quite puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Gomez-Alonso, werewolves? As it happens, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A connection between rabies and the development of the
werewolf legend could be hypothesized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEXT: ROCKETS AT O'HARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle and its rockets are huge _ some 4.5 million
pounds at liftoff. About 85 percent of that weight is fuel.
Designed to work in a vacuum, the shuttle must carry not only fuel
but the oxygen to burn it. Because this is an inefficient way to
go, NASA engineers have recently tested an engine that gets some of
its oxygen on the run. Uwe Hueter of the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., says the engine could cut takeoff
weights in half.
</P>
<P>
   A spacecraft equipped with this engine would take off like a
rocket, Hueter says. But within minutes, incoming air would begin
to supplement liquid oxygen. Once the space craft hit 1,500 miles
per hour _ twice the speed of sound _ the liquid oxygen would shut
off completely and the engine would burn fuel mixed with air.
Operating like a ramjet, the craft would accelerate to about 10
times the speed of sound. When the air got too thin for the engine
to breathe, the ship would shift back to rocket mode to punch its
way into space.
</P>
<P>
   Recent wind-tunnel tests of the idea were a smashing success,
says Hunter, who plans flight tests in about four years. In the
long run _ about 15 years hence _ Hunter hopes the engine will be
matched with advanced materials under development at NASA to create
a vehicle nearly as inexpensive as a jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is that this would be a horizontal takeoff and
horizontal lander,'' he says. ``If we can keep the weight below a
million pounds, which is about what a 747 weighs, we could even use
existing airports.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWKING'S VISION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His body may be confined to a wheelchair, but the mind of
Stephen Hawking soars, grappling with the most profound mysteries
of the universe, from the birth and death of black holes to the
fate of the cosmos itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy A. Svitil, an editor for Discover magazine, recently
interviewed Hawking after he talked to a packed auditorium in San
Jose, Calif., about the future of science. The theoretical
physicist predicted the development of intelligent, self-aware
computers that could match the human brain, not to mention space
travel well beyond this solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Svitil asked: What are the biggest unsolved problems in physics
today?
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of everything,'' Hawking said _ the name physicists
give to the undiscovered laws that would unite all theories about
the universe, from quantum mechanics to Einstein's general theory
of relativity. ``We feel that we are near, but we never get there.
It always seems just over the rainbow's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties scientists face in tackling the
all-in-one theory, Hawking is certain the answer will come soon:
``My money is on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another enigma, he said, is ``understanding the origin of the
universe and why it produced the universe that we see.'' Too many
theories, he suggests, explain some of the things we see in nature,
but they can't be applied to all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmology is not science if it does not produce theories with
predictions that agree with what we observe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Svitil asked what Hawking thought of John Horgan's
recent book, ``The End of Science,'' in which the author argues
that all the fundamental problems of science have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking likes to give succinct answers because he is disabled by
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ and must
communicate by spelling out his words on a computer. His reply?
</P>

 &HT;    Barr drawing potential opposition
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If he had to decide right now, Wayne Garner says, he
probably wouldn't run against Rep. Bob Barr next year. But as he
took his leave from the job of state prisons chief last week, the
Democrat couldn't resist a poke at his potential Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure if the 7th District needs a congressman, Garner
quipped, because ``they've been without one for such a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Garner does decide to run against Barr, he'll have company.
Two months after the end of Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, it's
hard to say whether his raised profile will make Barr more
vulnerable in the next election. But it's clear the competition to
see who will oppose him is going to be a lot more spirited.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairman David Worley said seven or eight
people already have talked with him about the race. Among those
already putting together their campaigns are businessman Roger
Kahn, who recently sold out his interest in his company, Empire
Distributors; Floyd County police Chief Jim Free; and Chip Warren,
a former Atlanta policeman who is now vice president of the
International Brotherhood of Police Officers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Garner, former state Sen. Steve Langford, who ran
for governor last year, is being mentioned as a possibility, along
with Rep. Tracy Stallings and former Rep. Tim Perry. After getting
45 percent of the vote on a shoestring budget in last year's race,
Rome businessman Jim Williams also may be contemplating another
run.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme among the Democrats is that with Lockheed and
Dobbins vulnerable and textile jobs leaving the district, the
national attention Barr received over the past year hasn't helped
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in the country knows about our congressman,
but not too many know about the district,'' Free said.
</P>
<P>
   The large field of possibilities underscores one reason Barr
could be vulnerable. His district, which stretches from west Cobb
to the outskirts of Chattanooga, has a lot of Democrats in it,
including some powerful ones: Worley, Gov. Roy Barnes and House
Speaker Tom Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes quickly quashed the suggestion earlier this year that he
was looking for a Democrat to oppose Barr, but the governor doesn't
have to do much to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   As for Barr, he said he's had record attendance at town hall
meetings in his district over the past several weeks. At every
meeting, some voters thank him for his role in the impeachment, he
said, but the focus is now on ``other issues,'' including taxes and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who isn't interested in the race is former Rep.
Buddy Darden, who lost the seat to Barr in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever runs needs to know that the numbers in that district
are unfriendly at best,'' Darden said. ``They shouldn't think it
will be easy just because he ran so poorly the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't stop a lot of Democrats from trying, with Barr
looking more vulnerable and the prospects of raising money to run
against him much better than they were a couple of years ago.

 &HT;    `How's my driving' calls keep truckers in line, studies say
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Don't like my driving? Call
1-800-BUZZ-OFF,'' reads one bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   The joke has gotten old. But while the witticism aged, the
serious practice of inviting the general public to report on
truckers' driving skills has blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of trucks now sport ``How's my driving?''
decals with toll-free telephone numbers, requesting complaints _
and, sometimes, praise _ from motorists. Begun in the late 1980s,
the simple concept has boomed in popularity in recent years,
spurred by the proliferation of cellular phones and increasing
friction between cars and trucks on congested highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it effective? Without a doubt it is,'' said Joe Zingale,
executive vice president of Driver's Alert, a Lighthouse Point
company that was one of the first to get into the truck monitoring
business.
</P>
<P>
   The primary force driving the boom in toll-free truck tattle
lines is money. Commercial truck crashes bring not only property
damage, injury and loss of life, but the possibility of
multimillion-dollar court judgments. Insurance companies have taken
notice, even paying the cost of the programs in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, people just made a lot of jokes, but today it's
taken pretty seriously,'' said Zingale, whose company has pasted
decals on 300,000 vehicles nationwide and is one of the largest in
the country. ``A crash can be devastating, and you have to look at
anything that decreases that possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But some transport companies fear that monitoring decals send
the wrong message to those on the highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like advertising to the general public, `Hey, I have some
bad drivers and you need to watch out for them,' '' said Mike
Smith, safety manager of Palm City-based Armellini Express Lines,
which transports cut flowers from Florida to points all over the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we have professional, safe and courteous drivers and
they just don't need these decals on their trucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some truckers also believe ``How's my driving?'' decals draw
fake reports from competing truck drivers, or false complaints from
motorists who just don't like sharing the road with big rigs, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither state nor federal highway safety agencies have analyzed
whether call-in decals decrease truck-related crashes. But two
recent studies by insurance companies indicate monitoring programs
do have an impact on highway safety.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Hanover Insurance Co. of Worcester, Mass.,
compared 445 trucks in 11 fleets with and without decals, and found
that those with decals had 22 percent fewer traffic crashes.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Reliance Insurance of Philadelphia found that truck
fleets using monitoring stickers had a 35 percent reduction in
crash-related costs the year after they began using the program.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies now give discounts to businesses that
affix ``How's my driving?'' stickers to their vehicles. Reliance
pays the cost of the monitoring program and provides a discount on
the customer's insurance premium, said Tom Turansky, risk control
officer for Reliance Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as those trucks leave the dock, they're essentially
unsupervised,'' he said. ``But driving a heavy truck is like
operating a deadly weapon. Putting decals on trucks gives you an
additional tool to increase safety.''
</P>
<P>
   A truck monitoring program typically costs between $12 and $20
per vehicle per year, depending on the type of truck and the size
of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Major insurance companies began study truck monitoring two years
ago, said Dick Lea, president of FleetSafe, a vehicle monitoring
firm in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   FleetSafe guarantees a 10 percent reduction in crashes, or
customers can get their money back. So far, no one has taken them
up on the offer, Lea said.
</P>
<P>
   When someone calls to complain about a truck, the caller is
interviewed to determine what happened and whether the truck driver
was at fault. The caller typically must give his name and address,
Lea said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints are sent to the trucking companies immediately.
In addition, both Driver's Alert and FleetSafe compile and analyze
complaints to show trends among a company's drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The chief goal of the decal program is to identify unsafe
drivers before they get in a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the vast majority of truck drivers are safe
and careful drivers,'' said Rivers Buford of the Florida Trucking
Association. ``But you have a small percentage responsible for the
majority of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver who receives numerous complaints is usually
warned and given additional training to reduce the chances of a
crash in the future, Zingale said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually won't fire a driver outright for getting
complaints,'' Zingale said. ``The companies see it as an
opportunity to intervene and provide more education and training to
make that driver a safer driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Decals can also have a psychological influence. ``The decal
makes the driver think, `Hey, people are observing me all the
time,' '' Zingale said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint call-in stickers aren't just on big rigs. Driver's
Alert's customers include delivery vans, couriers, moving trucks _
``just about anyone who drives a vehicle on the job might want
one,'' Zingale said.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the decal system has even gone beyond the
trucking industry _ some worried parents of teenage drivers have
developed their own stickers, complete with home telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But in those cases, the phone call goes right to the young
driver's parents, and instead of being fired, the driver faces the
ultimate teen penalty: Being grounded.

 &HT;    Debate rages over future of the Holocaust's legacy
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the past 14 months, the director of
the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., was fired
when he objected to the museum being used for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of an influential magazine on Jewish affairs was
called ``brainless when it comes to the Holocaust'' for criticizing
the growing field of Holocaust studies.
</P>
<P>
   And scores of museum directors, curators and academics have been
accused of commercializing the memory of 6 million Jews killed in
the Holocaust to further political agendas and boost ticket sales
for an increasing number of Holocaust exhibits and museums.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century after the Holocaust, defining, owning
and placing it in context have become more complex and more
contentious issues than ever. As the last generation of survivors
enters their 70s and 80s, a debate within the Jewish community is
intensifying: Who will speak for the victims after the last
witnesses are gone? And what will they say?
</P>
<P>
   The questions are not new, but as American colleges and
universities study the Holocaust through a continually broader
variety of lenses, the debate surrounding it is intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say the Holocaust should be treated as a
sacred and distinctly Jewish event. Comparing the horror to
anything else is demeaning to the legacy, the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   But others say for the Holocaust to be fully understood, it must
be put into political context and interpreted through as many
perspectives as possible. One result of that argument: Dozens of
academic conventions pop up every year and hundreds of papers
deconstructing the Holocaust through feminist, environmental and
current geopolitical viewpoints are presented.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, conservative columnist George Will slammed the
growing industry of Holocaust studies in a column: ``As the
Holocaust becomes academicized, it becomes trivialized, reduced to
just another instance of injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an opinion piece that ran in newspapers across the
country last month, Gabriel Schoenfeld, the senior editor of
Commentary Magazine, accused many Holocaust museum and exhibit
curators and academics of ``treating the most shattering event in
modern history as a banality, or worse, as entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivializing tragedy
</P>
<P>
   ``As the generation of survivors passes from the scene, this
tragedy is up for grabs,'' Schoenfeld said last week from New York.
``There is a wide-scale trivialization being committed by people
who purport to be the custodians of their memory. In a way, the
Holocaust is being pigeonholed into the general trend of
victimization.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Feinstein, the acting director of the Center of
Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota, and
the man who called Schoenfeld ``brainless,'' said that
deconstructing the Holocaust through secular or feminist or even
environmentalist lenses is inevitable. The Holocaust did not just
happen to Jews, Feinstein said, it happened to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people out there who want to make (the
Holocaust) a sacramental, pseudo-religious event to remember the
victims,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whether we like it or not . . . the words `Holocaust' and
`genocide' have come to intersect.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the academic debate on the Holocaust, Feinstein sees
no basis for criticism: ``Anything that gives rise to a rational
discourse is good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it also can lead to charges that the memory of the 6 million
is being exploited. That's what Walter Reich accused state
department officials of doing when they invited Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to visit Washington's United States Holocaust Museum
last year during stalled Middle East peace talks. Arafat would have
been the first Arab leader to acknowledge the Holocaust, but Reich
did not want the museum to be used as a political tool to
jump-start the negotiations. Reich ultimately lost his job as the
museum's director.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors from 40 years ago would be amazed there is any debate
at all. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Holocaust was considered a
footnote to World War II. Even among Jews the subject was taboo.
</P>
<P>
   The silence began to lift in the '60s, first with the trial of
Adolf Eichmann in Israel in 1961 and then with the Six Day War in
1967. Through the 1970s and into the '80s, most high school history
books dedicated an average of one paragraph to the Holocaust,
Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change by the 1980s as Holocaust literature _
memoirs and histories _ began to be published en masse. Throughout
the '90s, Hollywood and foreign filmmakers, through movies like
Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful, brought stories of the
Final Solution to millions more.
</P>
<P>
   But as pervasive as the story of the death camps may seem, it is
not universally understood, argue those who support more memorials.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Weiss, a counselor who works with Holocaust survivors in
Palm Beach County, was training a group of about 25 nursing aides
last month _ mostly Haitian and South American women _ about how to
deal with problems they might encounter when taking care of
survivors. Suddenly, she realized she was getting a lot of blank
stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the group if they knew what the Holocaust was,'' Weiss
said. ``One girl raised her hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Education for understanding
</P>
<P>
   Educating people about the Holocaust and informing contemporary
debate about broader issues are important reasons to promote
Holocaust scholarship, said Devorah Dwork, the director of the
Center of Holocaust Studies at Clark University, the only school in
the country that offers a doctorate degree in the Holocaust. The
reason the American Civil War is understood today and will be
understood in 100 years is because of scholarship, Dwork said. The
same holds for the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now, given Kosovo, we couldn't be looking at a more
compelling argument for the experience of Holocaust scholarship,''
Dwork said.
</P>
<P>
   But how much is too much? There are 73 Holocaust centers
nationwide, and about 200 universities offering some sort of
independent Holocaust curriculum, according to William Shulman,
president of the Association of Holocaust Organizations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, several large American cities with
substantial Jewish populations have built memorials to the Jewish
victims of the Holocaust. A learning center opened in September in
New York and another is planned in Berlin. Hundreds of thousands of
people annually visit Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem. And more than 12 million have visited the United States
Holocaust Museum in Washington since it opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as the field of holocaust studies has grown and the number
of memorials has mushroomed, so has the fear that the Holocaust
will overshadow Judaism. There are plenty of museums dedicated to
Jewish death, a common complaint goes, but not so many dedicated to
Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, some rabbis believe, is to ritualize the
commemoration of the Holocaust like the festival of independence.
Passover is a ritualized ceremony celebrating the exodus of the
Hebrews from Israel about 3,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yom HaShoah, which is Hebrew for the day of the Holocaust, has
begun to do that. Started in 1951 in Israel, it comes a week before
Israeli Independence Day on the Jewish calendar. The most
traditional Yom HaShoah ceremony is the lighting of six candles _
one for each of the million killed _ as was done at a service at
the Jewish Community Center in West Palm Beach for about 130
survivors last week.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, opinions varied about the legacy of the
Holocaust. Several survivors said it does not matter through what
vessel the Holocaust is remembered, but that it is remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not important whether future generations remember me or
my father,'' said survivor Carl Willner. ``What is important is
that they remember the lessons and they remember that catastrophe
starts from very small beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Others applauded Steven Spielberg's project to videotape
survivors telling their stories for future archives. About 50,000
survivors have been videotaped so far. Many told of speaking at
schools to educate children. To them, the question of how the
Holocaust will be remembered is less an intellectual argument than
a matter of personal urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone says it didn't happen, as long as I am
alive, I am going to answer that it did happen,'' said Ed
Lefkowitz, in his baritone. ``And after I am gone, the people I
have told will be here and they will say it was so. Someone should
always know my story.''

 &HT;    Who failed Johnny? (Part Two)
 &HT;    (EDS: The following is the second part of a story initially
released three years ago. The first part moved Monday, April 19.)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Has society and the system failed Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   ``Back-to-Basics!'' ``The 3 Rs Rock!'' The slogans are
everywhere. Parents, politicians, and otherwise interested folks
are urging a return to old-time education. I can't argue with them;
it's the way I learned. But as today's
</P>
<P>
   teachers look around their classrooms they see Johnnys who can't
sleep nights because their parents' constant fighting and yelling
keeps them awake; Susies, whose moms have a succession of
frequently abusive live-ins; and best friends whose parents are
selling dope to the neighborhood kids.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do we convince Johnny and Susie that it's imperative to
memorize the multiplication tables? They're focused on surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Have school systems, in their dedication to students' rights,
gone overboard in the move to ``socialize'' their teen-agers? Is
the emphasis on sharing and celebrating differences leaving
schoolwork and study in the lurch? And what does ``facilitating''
mean, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In a society where newborns are being tossed into trashbins and
success is measured by acquisition, how do we make Johnny believe
us when we tell him he is important? Something more than a cipher
in a computer?
</P>
<P>
   Would it be surprising to learn that Johnny has become an
unwitting victim of society's rampant pessimism about everything
from job security to political leaders? What can we give Johnny to
believe in. What can we offer him as a long-term reward in return
for his academic labors?
</P>
<P>
   Schools can and do provide the skills Johnny will need for
lifelong learning. Critical thinking and problem solving are two of
them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of education is to train young minds to think _
not (ITAL) what (END ITAL) to think, mind you, but simply (ITAL)
how (END ITAL) to think. To be able to apply already learned
information to new situations and ideas _ to think critically and
to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been education's belief that in 12 short years it
might provide a student with all the answers _ with everything he
or she would ever need to know. We're far more realistic than that.
Our aim is to prepare them for post secondary education _ whether
it be academic, technical, or life, by offering a firm foundation
in the basics.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary on the times, schools now find themselves in the
business of teaching conflict resolution, so that Johnny and Susie
can learn to solve disagreements without resorting to mortal combat
or packing a ``Saturday night special'' in their lunchboxes.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Johnny? If it's not the teacher, the system, or
society causing Johnny to fail, then what is it?
</P>
<P>
   Have Johnny's parents failed Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, my Johnny is a lucky boy. He has two
parents, two sisters, and one brother, and they have always lived
together _ an uninterrupted biological family _ which eliminates
the single-parent rationale.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so where's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny works hard on the farm,'' his mother remarks by way of
chalking up one on the plus side of her son's slate. ``He's a good
boy and he helps his father.'' I nod in agreement; Johnny is a good
boy. I ask Mom if the family encourages Johnny to finish his
homework before he flops in front of the television for the
evening. Mom says Johnny never has any homework. I tell Mom that
Johnny's blowing smoke and suggest she get in touch with his other
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mom shrugs. Says she does her best but she works long hours.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Mom who Johnny's friends are. Are they achievers or
goof-offs? She's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   I mention peer pressure and the positive effects it can have on
kids like Johnny. I explain how on more than one occasion I've seen
persistent underachievers turned into acceptable scholars when they
begin ``hanging'' with a different crowd or get all goofy in love
with an honor student.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, peer pressure is a most effective means of turning a
teen around because he (or she) will do what it takes to
``belong,'' frequently withoutquestioning the wisdom of following
the crowd. Adolescence does not appear to be a time when objective
decision making is emphasized. Glands so frequently seem to get in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   Has Johnny failed Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   Of course he has. But why?
</P>
<P>
   There have been enough studies conducted on why Johnny and Susie
are failing, to fill warehouses. Most all of them, I'm sure, have
been carefully researched and painstakingly evaluated, but what
about results? What do we do with all of these facts and figures?
Where does education go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Simple; we keep trying. Educators know there's no roadmap to an
educational Utopia, no universal remedy to education's ills, but
that doesn't mean we're going to call in the scouts and abandon the
exploration. Johnny deserves better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny deserves an education.
</P>

 &HT;    Barr drawing potential opposition
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If he had to decide right now, Wayne Garner says, he
probably wouldn't run against Rep. Bob Barr next year. But as he
took his leave from the job of state prisons chief last week, the
Democrat couldn't resist a poke at his potential Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure if the 7th District needs a congressman, Garner
quipped, because ``they've been without one for such a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Garner does decide to run against Barr, he'll have company.
Two months after the end of Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, it's
hard to say whether his raised profile will make Barr more
vulnerable in the next election. But it's clear the competition to
see who will oppose him is going to be a lot more spirited.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairman David Worley said seven or eight
people already have talked with him about the race. Among those
already putting together their campaigns are businessman Roger
Kahn, who recently sold out his interest in his company, Empire
Distributors; Floyd County police Chief Jim Free; and Chip Warren,
a former Atlanta policeman who is now vice president of the
International Brotherhood of Police Officers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Garner, former state Sen. Steve Langford, who ran
for governor last year, is being mentioned as a possibility, along
with Rep. Tracy Stallings and former Rep. Tim Perry. After getting
45 percent of the vote on a shoestring budget in last year's race,
Rome businessman Jim Williams also may be contemplating another
run.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme among the Democrats is that with Lockheed and
Dobbins vulnerable and textile jobs leaving the district, the
national attention Barr received over the past year hasn't helped
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in the country knows about our congressman,
but not too many know about the district,'' Free said.
</P>
<P>
   The large field of possibilities underscores one reason Barr
could be vulnerable. His district, which stretches from west Cobb
to the outskirts of Chattanooga, has a lot of Democrats in it,
including some powerful ones: Worley, Gov. Roy Barnes and House
Speaker Tom Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes quickly quashed the suggestion earlier this year that he
was looking for a Democrat to oppose Barr, but the governor doesn't
have to do much to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   As for Barr, he said he's had record attendance at town hall
meetings in his district over the past several weeks. At every
meeting, some voters thank him for his role in the impeachment, he
said, but the focus is now on ``other issues,'' including taxes and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who isn't interested in the race is former Rep.
Buddy Darden, who lost the seat to Barr in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever runs needs to know that the numbers in that district
are unfriendly at best,'' Darden said. ``They shouldn't think it
will be easy just because he ran so poorly the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't stop a lot of Democrats from trying, with Barr
looking more vulnerable and the prospects of raising money to run
against him much better than they were a couple of years ago.

 &HT;    Thanks to former firefighter, power poles safe
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Flames roar from Homestead to Port St.
Lucie, Fla., but wooden power poles that should be tinder in their
path stand tall thanks to John Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett is the firefighter from Jupiter, Fla. who made national
news and a tidy profit by turning absorbent diaper gel into a
booming fire-shield business.
</P>
<P>
   His curiosity about how a pile of diapers remained uncharred
through a 1993 house fire led to the creation of Barricade, a
solution of water-absorbent polymers that sticks to just about any
surface and wards off flames.
</P>
<P>
   The company he founded sold about $250,000 worth last year,
working mostly out of his father's warehouse-garage. Among his
increasingly loyal customers: FPL, which has rushed spray crews and
pumper trucks to coat poles threatened by the region's wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works, absolutely,'' said Patrick Dennison, the power
company's distribution supervisor in charge of new products and
training methods. ``It's a tremendous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat still may damage poles beyond repair, but they don't
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier and safer to replace them when they're still
standing,'' Dennison said. ``You don't have transformers and wires
on the ground. And you don't have customers without power.''
</P>
<P>
   The company lost more than 800 power poles in the fires that
ravaged Flagler County last summer. Dennison heard about the
success Bartlett had there in saving 20 homes sprayed with
Barricade and asked if the gel could be used on poles.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of experimentation proved it was effective even when
sprayed on poles that are already burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crews would douse poles with water, water and more water,
and they'd still reignite,'' Dennison said. ``The gel let us
salvage them before they burned to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   FPL has five Barricade-filled pump trucks around the state.
Crews also carry back-pack sprayers.
</P>
<P>
   The gel works because the whitish solution that comes out of the
pumps is about 94 percent water, Bartlett said. He likens the
polymers to tiny water-soaked sponges that cling to each other as
well as to the surface they're sprayed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A power pole burns kind of like a cigarette,'' Bartlett said.
``Slowly and from the inside.'' The coating seals out fresh oxygen
and smothers the fire in the pole's core.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's company sent a crew to help FPL sprayers in Port St.
Lucie last week. Together, they saved about 100 poles, although 180
were already destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   They were too late to spray Barricade on the already ruined
homes. While a number of fire departments across the country keep
Barricade at the ready, St. Lucie County's isn't one of them, he
said. Martin County's is, but it wasn't there in time to use it.
</P>
<P>
   News of the fires has kept Bartlett busy answering calls from
fire departments and from homeowners. He sells a spray-it-yourself
kit that starts at $189, but enough gel to coat a house can bump
the cost to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Barricade sells for about $35 a gallon. It takes about five to
10 gallons to coat most houses. The household kit comes with a
sprayer. Fire departments don't need any special equipment,
Bartlett said, because standard pumper trucks can spray the
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   After an extended leave to get the company started, Bartlett,
44, has returned to work as a Palm Beach County firefighter. He
leaves most of the business decisions to new CEO David McIntosh,
former chief administrator of the Gunster Yoakley law firm.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has been aiming sales efforts overseas _ it
recently changed names from Fire Protection Inc. to Barricade
International _ and at the western U.S. Bartlett was in California
on a demonstration tour when the Port St. Lucie fires broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, they have fires every year,'' he said. ``Now it
looks as though Florida is catching up.''

 &HT;    Why a big refund is a bad idea
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we get to the good news about income taxes: Two out of three
taxpayers will get a refund on their federal taxes, averaging about
$1,563.
</P>
<P>
   It's a refreshing windfall, one that some people like so much
that they build it into their spending expectations every year.
</P>
<P>
   Two points need to be made: One, you shouldn't leave that much
money in Uncle Sam's account next time. Two, it's up to you to
decide whether this year's refund is a toy or a tool. You can party
or plan ahead, and either one will feel good.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Louis Harris survey shows that 23 percent of those who
expect a refund think that it will be more than $2,000. Those are
certainly people who don't mind leaving a lot of extra money with
Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The survey says that most Americans already plan to do something
fruitful with their refunds. About a third said they plan to save
or invest the money, another third said they will pay debts, and
only one in six said they will buy something.
</P>
<P>
   People get refunds, large or small, because they have too much
withheld for taxes from each paycheck. Bad idea. The surplus ends
up in a government account, rather than going to some purpose that
you select. Think about it this way: That was your money to start
with; you just let the government hold onto it for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that refund represents is an interest-free loan to the
government,'' said Larry W. Nichols, a certified public accountant
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At work, you can ask your payroll department to help work out a
more accurate estimate of how much you should have withheld. Or you
can call 1-800-829-1040, ask the IRS to send you Publication 919 or
Publication 505, and figure it out yourself.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's refund, there are a number of ways to feel good
by doing good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put it away for your future. Suppose you put $1,563 into an
individual retirement account, invest it in stocks and earn a 10
percent annual return. Your one-shot investment would grow to
$10,515 in 20 years, $27,273 in 30 years and $70,740 in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like a lot of cash, especially for the
shorter periods and especially because you will have to pay income
taxes on most or all of it when you withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
   But financial planners will tell you that the hardest part is
getting started. Most people feel proud when they've done the right
thing and rewarded when they see their investment grow. Another
factor is that the first step is the hardest _ once you've started
saving, it gets easier to take the next step.
</P>
<P>
   You might also put a refund away for some other specific goal,
such as buying a house or car, or for the kids' college education.
Believe me, it feels good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay off debts. ``When you have an opportunity to make a power
payment on your credit cards, you should take advantage of it,''
said Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of Atlanta. ``In the long term, reducing monthly interest
charges makes a tremendous difference in the total amount you
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Start an emergency fund. It's another thing that you can feel
good about _ knowing that you've got some grocery and rent money
set aside if things go bad. Sooner or later, everybody needs some
cash to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give it away. A charitable donation, even if it's only a
fraction of your refund, is bound to give you the warm fuzzies.
Family members or clergymen usually can suggest a favorite
beneficiary. Looking for just the right organization? Check out the
United Way's Web site (www.unitedwayatl.org/Issues/index.htm) or

 &HT;    In cyberspace, everybody's a comic
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with EMAIL-HUMOR-LIST.)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delete this if you've read it before: A guy logs on to
his computer, calls up his e-mail, and ...
</P>
<P>
   There's the joke about the Barbie head that was sent to the
Smithsonian for analysis as an archaeological discovery. One about
upgrading Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0. Top 10 lists on any subject
you can imagine. Bill Gates jokes. Smutty jokes. Bar jokes. Work
jokes. Photo, video- and sound-clip jokes.
</P>
<P>
   You've read them before. You may have read them dozens of times
before.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you hit the delete key as soon as you saw an ``FWD'' in
the subject line. Or maybe you forwarded them to your entire
address book.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, it seems, everyone's a comedian, but not
everybody is funny. How many times can you scroll through dozens of
such jokes before you come up with your own list: ``The Top 10
reasons I hate the forward button''?
</P>
<P>
   50 Fun Things to Do in an Elevator: No. 1. Make race car noises
when anyone gets on or off. No. 2. Blow your nose and offer to show
the contents of your Kleenex to other passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, somebody's reading. E-mailed jokes have spawned several
books, dozens of World Wide Web sites and millions of groans and
chuckles. The water cooler and fax machine? Just beta versions of
the ultimate joke-dispensing machine. If you're typing busily away,
who's to say that you're reading jokes instead of working (unless
your employer monitors e-mail)?
</P>
<P>
   The Top 2 reasons people love e-mail humor: It brightens up
their day, and it's a good way to stay in touch with friends. The
Top 2 reasons people hate e-mail humor: They see the same bad jokes
repeatedly, and it's an impersonal way for friends to stay in
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the trend toward communicating without
communicating,'' says Alice Kahn, co-editor of ``Your Joke Is in
the E-Mail: Cyberlaffs From Mousepotatoes'' (Ten Speed Press,
$7.95). ``It's like when you call someone and you don't really want
to talk to them, you just want to leave a message on the answering
machine and get credit for the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Such callers don't get credit anymore from Bill Orr, 27, a
Buckhead lawyer who set up the e-mail equivalent of call blocking
after a few months of humor spam. Anything sent from known
jokesters to him and at least one other person gets trashed,
courtesy of a filter he set up in his e-mail program. That way, he
doesn't have to read the jokes _ ``a bunch of crud,'' he calls them
_ and he doesn't have to offend friends by telling them to knock it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``An '80s Love Story''
</P>
<P>
   I was working part time in a five and dime. My boss was Mr.
Magee. He was 6-foot-4 and full of muscles and walked liked an
Egyptian, but I was happy to be stuck with him. One manic Monday,
while I was busy working for the weekend, I overheard him make a
careless whisper. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that one was really stupid when I got it, and I
thought it was stupid when I got it the next eight or 10 times,''
says Steve Knopper, a Chicago free-lance writer who compiles Yahoo
Internet Life's Forward of the Day joke site.
</P>
<P>
   Knopper receives dozens of such jokes daily. Usually uncredited,
they may be ``borrowed'' from such comedians as Steven Wright,
Jerry Seinfeld or Norm Macdonald, or from humor Web sites such as
the Onion. Sometimes it's tough finding one good enough to proclaim
Forward of the Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem funny at the time, then when I'm on deadline and
struggling to find one, they all suck,'' Knopper says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they're not all horrible. He's started joke chains himself,
sending copies of an Onion story about a blues singer to friends.
Six hours and several generations later, someone forwarded it to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wife 1.0''
</P>
<P>
   Last year a friend of mine upgraded Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0
and found that it's a memory hog leaving very little system
resources for other applications. ... He's finding that some other
applications such as PokerNight 8.3, BeerBash 2.5 and PubNight 7.0
are no longer able to run in the system at all....
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sutton, 30, of Duluth, Ga. lists Wife 1.0 as her
favorite e-mail joke, but there's only so much risque humor she can
take _ and none at work, please. She had just learned about her new
employer's e-mail monitoring policy when a friend forwarded a
sketch. Set up like the label of a vegetable can, it wasn't exactly
advertising greenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be asparagus, but it did not look like
asparagus,'' says Sutton. ``I thought I was going to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap lives on in cyberspace. Put-downs of both sexes
and off-color humor abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up a whole new world of sexual harassment via
computer,'' says Alice Gamble, 36, of Atlanta, who receives about
50 joke e-mails daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, who's your typical engineer, sends me jokes that I
would never expect him to,'' she says. ``I had some of the more
risque e-mails coming from some of my conservative friends. I'm not
sure what that's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble likes having a little humor pop up unexpectedly during
the day, so she sent lots of jokes after she got an e-mail account
last year. Now that the novelty has worn off, she's more selective.
</P>
<P>
   How many Microsoft engineers does it take to change a light
bulb?
</P>
<P>
   None. Bill Gates will just redefine Darkness as the new industry
standard.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the novelty of Internet humor never wears off.
For them, cyberspace is a limitless comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Loveless, 32, of Monticello, Ga. loves to receive jokes, and
keeps an archive of his favorites. It's at 667 and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, through a typo, his address was added to
someone's e-mailed humor list. The joke was cute, so Loveless wrote
back. Now he gets up to 20 e-mails a week from the guy.

 &HT;    He's the shock king of reality TV
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bruce Nash's philosophy on hooking
viewers is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a movie of the week, you've only got one shot to get 'em
and you've gotta get 'em good,'' says the man behind such TV
specials as When Good Pets Go Bad and World's Scariest Police
Shootouts. ``It's got to be compelling. The World's Deadliest
Whatever. Look right at the title. It says `Watch me!''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, viewers are doing just that. Nash's in-your-face
reality shows have become ratings gold for Fox, NBC and ABC. For
instance, Breaking The Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets
Finally Revealed drew more than 24 million viewers in November
1997, making it Fox's highest rated special ever. More than 18
million people watched pit bulls mauling kids and old ladies on
When Good Pets Go Bad. And World's Most Amazing Videos, NBC's new
Wednesday night reality series from Nash, is doing well, too.
</P>
<P>
   But critics hiss that such grisly shows _ fuel tank explosions,
mid-air jet collisions and navy crewmen being sucked into a jet
engine _ are nothing more than glossy ``shockumentaries'' that
don't belong on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's much different from people stopping at a
train wreck,'' says Meryl Marshall, chairman and CEO of the Academy
of Television Arts and Sciences. ``I don't believe it's the best
use of the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash, 51, who heads the Los Angeles-based Nash Entertainment,
dismisses his many detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do shockumentaries. We do non-fiction programming.
Hey, we're not going to cure cancer with what we're doing, but at
least we're trying to tell dramatic stories.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did a guy who grew up in West Palm Beach, graduated from
Forest Hill High School and Florida Atlantic University get into a
line of work like this?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Bruce Nash is an idea man. He reads everything. He
needs newspapers and magazines like the rest of us need air. He's
always hunting for the next hot trend. That special something he
can tweak, promote and turn into a jaw-dropping TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Nash keeps a pad of ideas in different rooms of his house as
well as one in his Los Angeles office. He keeps several hundred
ideas with him at all times and likes to come up with 10 new ones
each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding a new idea is what charges me up,'' says the boyishly
excited Nash, who pitches about one-third of his brainchilds.
``It's like treasure. It's more valuable than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash started out writing trivia books on such disparate topics
as Elvis, ghosts and baseball. Soon after, he began peppering
Hollywood with script ideas. After countless rejections, Hollywood
finally liked what it saw.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Nash was reading People a few years ago and
noticed that Volcano and Dante's Peak, two similar disaster movies,
were coming out at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a blurb, but I said, `I can capitalize on all the
promotion they're going to do with these two movies,''' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The result: World's Deadliest Volcanos, which aired on ABC. Not
only did Nash get ABC to pick up World's Deadliest Volcanos, the
determined TV producer convinced the network to give him a World's
Deadliest franchise. ABC has since aired World's Deadliest Storms
and World's Deadliest Sea Creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's knack for giving viewers what they want has been noticed.
Fox Family Channel has inquired about producing a cartoon based on
_ can you believe this? _ When Good Pets Go Bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about some pets that get all rough and tough when pushed
around,'' says Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBC may have publicly blasted Fox in the past for
airing such gross-out reality specials as When Animals Attack, but
after those garish shows started getting huge ratings, not only did
NBC stop bashing Fox, it even asked Nash to crank out specials for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can have Bruce work for us, there are less specials he
can do for Fox,'' boasts John Miller, NBC's executive vice
president of event programming. ``When you can't beat 'em, hire 'em
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Nash producing World's Most Amazing Videos for NBC,
which the network picked up for 13 episodes next season, he's also
producing You Asked For It, a '90s version of the '50s game show in
which people call in and ask for strange things they want to see on
TV, like lady sumo wrestlers and five-legged pigs. You Asked For It
is scheduled to air in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nash is also partnering with some of TV's heavy-hitters, namely
Ted Harbert, former chairman of ABC Entertainment and Warren
Littlefield, former NBC Entertainment President. Harbert is now a
producer at Dreamworks SKG and with Nash is developing Dates From
Hell, a one-hour anti-Love American Style comedy and The Ludermans,
a futuristic family sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV thrives on people like Bruce because TV eats up so many
ideas and Bruce is one of the best idea machines I've come
across,'' says Harbert, who has known Nash for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield is working with Nash on a wrestling sitcom for NBC.
``There will be people who don't like his work and the answer for
them is that's why there's Bassmasters is on cable. There are many
choices out there. If you don't like it, execute your free will not
to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many viewers watching Nash's shows?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce has a very keen sense of what makes the adrenaline rush
and what makes compelling visuals,'' says Tim Brooks, co-author of
The Complete Directory To Prime Time And Cable TV Shows. ``There's
been a lot of other syndicated stuff with the host lumbering around
at the beginning and telling you what you're going to see and the
re-creations were awkwardly cut into the middle of it. Bruce cut
out all that stuff. He said, `Let's cut right to the chase.' He
knows how close he can get to the edge without going over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash believes his shows are successful because they're
unpredictable. In a scripted, formulaic TV world, most dramas and
comedies are far from original.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this stuff, you don't know what's going to happen next. A
cop stops a guy for speeding and the guy pulls a gun _ what's going
to happen next? What's going to happen next?''
</P>
<P>
   It's also important, says Nash, that viewers already know that
no one dies.
</P>
<P>
   To put together a reality TV show, Nash relies on 50 staffers.
He says they comb video libraries, foreign news services, contact
news stringers, police departments, prisons, local TV stations, and
conduct massive Internet searches to find eye-popping footage. Nash
says clips normally cost anywhere from several thousand to a couple
of hundred thousand dollars. The most Nash ever paid for a clip was
$10,000. That was for Fox's upcoming The Road To Fame, a special
about what stars did before they got famous.
</P>
<P>
   Nash snared a brief clip of Tom Cruise and Heather Locklear
doing a screen test together for the 1982 TV series, The Powers of
Matthew Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extraordinary to have both of them so young in the same
clip, so the casting director held us up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nash is not your typical Hollywood insider. Nash was born in
Brooklyn, moved to Long Island when he was 4, then to West Palm
Beach at age 8. His mom was a teacher (she lives in Delray, Fla.),
his dad a jeweler (he died of a heart attack in 1984 at age 63.)
His grandfather was a butcher and lived next door to Nash's folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hardworking people and that's what I carried out
here (to Los Angeles),'' he says. ``I didn't have it made. I came
out here hungry, with the eye of the tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash's route to Hollywood was certainly unconventional. With a
B.S. and Masters in Criminology from Florida State, Nash was the
director of planning and research at the North Carolina Department
of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   But the imaginative TV trivia buff and wannabe author yearned
for something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to always write stories in elementary school,''
remembers Greg Nash, Bruce's 44-year-old brother who owns Nash
Jewelry in West Palm. ``When I was four, he made up stories about
pirates and left all kinds of treasure notes around the house. It
was like a little game for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Nash was so obsessed with entertainment and TV Guide (he'd
go to the library to read every issue), he wrote Tube Teasers, a TV
trivia book at age 25. Soon after, Nash quit his corrections gig to
pursue his dream of becoming a Hollywood writer. Nash has since
published 80 books on such subjects as pets, baseball and ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   But Nash wanted to write for TV. NBC finally bit when it bought
America's Best Kept Secrets. But Nash's big break came in 1994 when
ABC aired his Before They Were Stars, which topped the mighty
Murder, She Wrote in the ratings. Such mild reality specials as The
Secret World of Dreams and TV's All-Time Favorites soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, breaking free of the ``Shock King'' TV tag is a goal for
Nash. Reality shows, he points out, represent a small fraction of
what he wants to do. ``There's nothing wrong with what I'm doing, I
just feel there are other things out there for me to do that could
be my legacy,'' he says. ``I want to do sitcoms, dramas and movies.
You can only be so creative when you're doing real stories. And I
know I'm not going to win any prizes with this stuff.''

 &HT;    Courier hopes not to repeat '98 AT&AMP;T ChallengeBy Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second year in a row, Jim Courier will come to
the AT&AMP;T Challenge as the reigning U.S. Davis Cup hero. The former
world No. 1 only hopes it will be different this time.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Courier saved the American team with a five-set
victory over Marat Safin of Russia in the deciding fifth match in
the first round. Courier followed that up two weeks later by
winning a clay-court tournament in Orlando, his hometown. He
survived Michael Chang 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 in a final that exhausted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I went to Atlanta tired and lost in the first round,''
Courier said. ``I seemed to lose my momentum after that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his one-night stand on stadium court at Atlanta Athletic
Club, qualifier Marcio Carlsson beat him 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by an arm injury that had him pondering retirement,
Courier would win just three more matches through the U.S. Open. He
endured one stretch of five consecutive first-round losses and
plunged as low as No. 118 on the ATP Tour computer. He finished the
year No. 76, his first final ranking outside the top 30 since he
turned pro as an 18-year-old in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Courier is optimistic that 1998 was an injury-induced
aberration, just as 1997 was for Todd Martin. Courier's Davis Cup
teammate was shelved for seven months with an elbow ailment, but
now he's back in the top 10. Martin's elbow still gets sore, but
Courier's arm is fully healed. If he could just watch his step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rolled my foot in Memphis, Tenn. and tweaked my groin in
Australia, but my arm is no longer an issue,'' Courier said. ``Last
year, I was still trying to fiddle with my racket and my training
for my arm, to find out if I was going to be able to keep playing
or if I was going to have to hang it up. So, I don't have that dark
cloud hanging over me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most encouraging is that Courier is playing better now than he
did a year ago. Leading up to the match against Russia here last
year, Andre Agassi openly lobbied for U.S. captain Tom Gullikson to
bypass the slumping Courier for Jan-Michael Gambill. And while
Courier's victory over Safin was inspiring for its show of
willpower and clever strategy, it wasn't great tennis. The Russian
teenager led 6-0, 4-1 before Courier stared him into blinking under
the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   This month's triumph over Great Britain was another story
altogether. Courier faced two heavyweights in No. 7 Tim Henman and
No. 11 Greg Rusedski on an indoor surface tailored to the Brits'
fast games. Courier's warrior heart wouldn't be enough this time.
He had to play like the Courier who won the Australian and French
Opens six years ago. Courier defeated both 7-5 in the fifth set,
breaking each at love to clinch the epic battles that lasted two
minutes short of eight hours combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing here is that all the other players around the
world are aware of what happened, and they know I beat two good
players under really adverse circumstances,'' said Courier, ranked
No. 54. ``That goes a long way toward (re-establishing) the fear
factor. If I can get the fear factor back in the locker room, then
I can go back on the court already up a break against a lot of
guys. That carries a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier, 28, now can put his Davis Cup achievements on the same
mantel as his 58 weeks at No. 1 in 1992-93 and his four Grand Slam
titles. The U.S. is 13-0 when Courier is in the lineup. Courier's
latest heroics surpass the comeback against Safin and the clinching
wins in 1997 against Brazil (vs. Gustavo Kuerten) and the
Netherlands (against Jan Siemerink after trailing two sets to
love). Given a couple of weeks to think about it, Courier still
can't find anything that beats his Great Britain conquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the circumstances _ playing on foreign soil, playing
on not my best surface and playing two players ranked No. 7 and No.
11,'' Courier said, ``I don't have any better performances than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T CHALLENGE
</P>
<P>
   _ When: Monday through May 2 (qualifying rounds Saturday and
Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Atlanta Athletic Club, Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Patrick Rafter, Michael Chang, Jim Courier,
Jan-Michael Gambill, Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tickets: 404-249-6400.

 &HT;    Can faith, prayer heal mentally ill? Ohio doctor wants to know
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ People don't expect to see a yarmulke on their
psychiatrist's head, but Dr. David Rube says they're often
reassured at the sight of his. It tells them they are welcome to
talk about God here, even if they don't share his Orthodox Jewish
faith.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true in every psychiatrist's office, Rube (pronounced
``Ruby'') says. Many of his colleagues prefer to keep spirituality
as far from their practices as palm reading or spoon bending. ``The
history of psychiatry has been extremely secular,'' he says,
``taking the view that religion is something to be interpreted and
is a neurotic defense mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rube says psychiatrists often shut out their
patients' spiritual sides at a time when they're most likely to
surface. That's one reason he developed the course for residents at
that Wright State University School of Medicine that was awarded
nationally last week for incorporating spirituality into medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Rube isn't saying religion should always be a part of
psychiatry, just that it shouldn't always be excluded. His goal is
to reduce the common biases not only that doctors have against
discussing religion but also that churchgoers have against seeing
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If doctors in training are exposed to these practices and
views, hopefully they'll be more well-rounded when their patients
come in,'' says Rube. ``So when the subject comes up, the
psychiatrist isn't squirming in his seat and the patient doesn't
feel he can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the agnostic doctor should find the information useful, he
says, considering ``what we do in psychiatry is figure out ways to
help people open up doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow but growing acceptance that faith plays a role in
health is surfacing more and more in med school curricula, says the
National Institute for Healthcare Research, which presented the
Spirituality and Medicine Awards to seven schools. NIHR has
encouraged much of the research behind that acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs reflect the growing necessity within the
medical community to focus on all dimensions of patient care _ the
physical, emotional and spiritual,'' says Dr. Christina M.
Puchalski, NIHR's education director.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright State course will focus on Rube's specialty of
children and teen-agers as psychiatry director at The Children's
Medical Center. But research has associated faith with healing
across age groups as well as medical specialties. People who
regularly pray or attend religious services have demonstrated
better recovery rates from heart surgery, depression, orthopedic
surgery, drug addiction and hospitalizations in general among
people older than 60.
</P>
<P>
   One team of Swiss investigators even felt the need 2 years ago
to demonstrate statistically that ``being highly religious was not
a risk factor for neuroticism, as has been often taught in
psychiatric training programs,'' NIHR summarized.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between belief systems and anatomical systems is
still widely ignored by the medical establishment. In a survey of
doctors last year, only 9 percent thought faith might significantly
help patients deal with illness, compared with 40 percent of
hospital patients who said it helped them. In other studies of
seriously ill patients, more than nine out of 10 called prayer a
helpful coping mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why NIHR has found that people with mental
health disorders are more likely to turn to clergy than to
psychiatrists and psychologists combined. ``It's imperative that
those of us in the mental health community begin working more
closely with the clergy,'' says Dr. David B. Larson, the NIHR
president, who determined last year that only 2 out of 10,000
reports in psychology journals from 1991 through '94 even
considered clergy in their research.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly press-stopping news that people who get sick turn to
prayer. ``I see patients with schizophrenia, manic depression,
horrible diseases,'' Rube says. ``If they can find comfort from
whatever church, synagogue or mosque they attend, I encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites Alcoholics Anonymous as a rare but successful union of
religion with health care. The first three of its 12 steps for
shaking addiction involve relinquishing control to a greater Power,
which AA leaves to every individual to define.
</P>
<P>
   Any psych patient who grew up with strong Catholic or Jewish
influence knows that guilt is a place where religion and therapy
overlap, Rube says. Without understanding that religious
groundwork, a psychiatrist would have a hard time ``helping people
process what is the difference between appropriate guilt and guilt
that is irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Rube's two-semester course will cover such classroom topics as
the religious and educational fundamentals of Catholicism,
Christianity, Judaism and Islam; the spiritual needs of children
and of families with sick or injured kids, and the roles of
pastoral care and religious school counselors. Hospital chaplains
and religious school administrators will be among the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The second semester will take students out of the classroom to
schools, hospitals and hospitals' pastoral departments. ``The goal
is to assess firsthand how spirituality, religiosity, mental health
and academic issues are dealt with in a religious school setting,''
Rube said in accepting the award. One of the things students will
see firsthand there is the stigma that goes with being marked for
mental health treatment in a religious population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to understand the importance of being sensitive to
a belief system,'' Rube says. ``Whether it's Jewish or Catholic or
whatever, a lot of people find some sort of grounding helpful. As
psychiatrists, we need to know how we can work within that belief
system without being judgmental.

 &HT;    Can faith, prayer heal mentally ill? Ohio doctor wants to know
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ People don't expect to see a yarmulke on their
psychiatrist's head, but Dr. David Rube says they're often
reassured at the sight of his. It tells them they are welcome to
talk about God here, even if they don't share his Orthodox Jewish
faith.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true in every psychiatrist's office, Rube (pronounced
``Ruby'') says. Many of his colleagues prefer to keep spirituality
as far from their practices as palm reading or spoon bending. ``The
history of psychiatry has been extremely secular,'' he says,
``taking the view that religion is something to be interpreted and
is a neurotic defense mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rube says psychiatrists often shut out their
patients' spiritual sides at a time when they're most likely to
surface. That's one reason he developed the course for residents at
that Wright State University School of Medicine that was awarded
nationally last week for incorporating spirituality into medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Rube isn't saying religion should always be a part of
psychiatry, just that it shouldn't always be excluded. His goal is
to reduce the common biases not only that doctors have against
discussing religion but also that churchgoers have against seeing
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If doctors in training are exposed to these practices and
views, hopefully they'll be more well-rounded when their patients
come in,'' says Rube. ``So when the subject comes up, the
psychiatrist isn't squirming in his seat and the patient doesn't
feel he can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the agnostic doctor should find the information useful, he
says, considering ``what we do in psychiatry is figure out ways to
help people open up doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow but growing acceptance that faith plays a role in
health is surfacing more and more in med school curricula, says the
National Institute for Healthcare Research, which presented the
Spirituality and Medicine Awards to seven schools. NIHR has
encouraged much of the research behind that acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs reflect the growing necessity within the
medical community to focus on all dimensions of patient care _ the
physical, emotional and spiritual,'' says Dr. Christina M.
Puchalski, NIHR's education director.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright State course will focus on Rube's specialty of
children and teen-agers as psychiatry director at The Children's
Medical Center. But research has associated faith with healing
across age groups as well as medical specialties. People who
regularly pray or attend religious services have demonstrated
better recovery rates from heart surgery, depression, orthopedic
surgery, drug addiction and hospitalizations in general among
people older than 60.
</P>
<P>
   One team of Swiss investigators even felt the need 2 years ago
to demonstrate statistically that ``being highly religious was not
a risk factor for neuroticism, as has been often taught in
psychiatric training programs,'' NIHR summarized.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between belief systems and anatomical systems is
still widely ignored by the medical establishment. In a survey of
doctors last year, only 9 percent thought faith might significantly
help patients deal with illness, compared with 40 percent of
hospital patients who said it helped them. In other studies of
seriously ill patients, more than nine out of 10 called prayer a
helpful coping mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why NIHR has found that people with mental
health disorders are more likely to turn to clergy than to
psychiatrists and psychologists combined. ``It's imperative that
those of us in the mental health community begin working more
closely with the clergy,'' says Dr. David B. Larson, the NIHR
president, who determined last year that only 2 out of 10,000
reports in psychology journals from 1991 through '94 even
considered clergy in their research.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly press-stopping news that people who get sick turn to
prayer. ``I see patients with schizophrenia, manic depression,
horrible diseases,'' Rube says. ``If they can find comfort from
whatever church, synagogue or mosque they attend, I encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites Alcoholics Anonymous as a rare but successful union of
religion with health care. The first three of its 12 steps for
shaking addiction involve relinquishing control to a greater Power,
which AA leaves to every individual to define.
</P>
<P>
   Any psych patient who grew up with strong Catholic or Jewish
influence knows that guilt is a place where religion and therapy
overlap, Rube says. Without understanding that religious
groundwork, a psychiatrist would have a hard time ``helping people
process what is the difference between appropriate guilt and guilt
that is irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Rube's two-semester course will cover such classroom topics as
the religious and educational fundamentals of Catholicism,
Christianity, Judaism and Islam; the spiritual needs of children
and of families with sick or injured kids, and the roles of
pastoral care and religious school counselors. Hospital chaplains
and religious school administrators will be among the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The second semester will take students out of the classroom to
schools, hospitals and hospitals' pastoral departments. ``The goal
is to assess firsthand how spirituality, religiosity, mental health
and academic issues are dealt with in a religious school setting,''
Rube said in accepting the award. One of the things students will
see firsthand there is the stigma that goes with being marked for
mental health treatment in a religious population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to understand the importance of being sensitive to
a belief system,'' Rube says. ``Whether it's Jewish or Catholic or
whatever, a lot of people find some sort of grounding helpful. As
psychiatrists, we need to know how we can work within that belief
system without being judgmental.

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to this
advisory from The San Francisco Chronicle:
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION FOOD AND FEATURES EDITORS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The San Francisco Chronicle &LR; , whose articles are a part of The
New York Times News Service, is pleased to announce a new column,
``Learning to Cook,'' by well-known food writer Marion Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this food-savvy age, many people don't know how to cook.
Though supermarkets bulge with products unavailable just a decade
ago and TV cooking shows abound, many are embarrassed by their lack
of basic skills. For example, consider the divorced executive with
a recipe telling him to toss sliced apples in a bowl. He stood
across the room and threw in the pieces. Or the woman searching the
dairy case in vain for softened butter.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Cunningham, who has been called the modern Fanny Farmer
for her work in revising two editions of that famous cookbook,
offers solutions for these novice cooks through the column and her
new book, also called ``Learning to Cook,'' to be published in May.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the week of April 19, the San Francisco Chronicle
offers ``Learning to Cook,'' available regularly through The New
York Times News Service. The column, slugged
 &UR; BC-LEARING-TO-COOK-SFCHRON &LR; , will move on Tuesdays with a ``d''
dining-category code. If you have questions, feel free to call
Holly Ocasio Rizzo at The Chronicle, at (415) 777-8811.

   SOUTHERN PRIDE: ITALIAN CREAM CAKE: When Southerners celebrate
with a birthday party, holiday dinner, wedding reception or
graduation gathering, what is the cake of choice? Chances are, it's
Italian cream cake. Little is known about its origin _ except that
it isn't Italian, it contains no cream other than cheese and few
outside the South have ever heard of it. Yet this blond, moist,
three-layer cake is the pride of both home and commercial bakers,
from Texas to Georgia. (Includes one 4-column photo of original
cream cake and one 1-column photo of chocolate cream cake.)

Lawrence Wechsler recently noted in The New Yorker, Milosevic is a
classic fascist. His appeal is to a kind of fanatical Serbian
nationalism; he is popular; he has fused the historic sense of
Serbian victimhood with a cult of blood vengeance against
non-Serbs. (Includes one 3-column color photo of children refugees

   PRESERVING AMERICA'S HISTORY _ ON PAPER: The principles have

parchments they were written on that worry archivists charged with
taking care of three of the most important documents in American
history: the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the
Bill of Rights. Enter scientists at NASA's Langley Research Center.
A research team has used a laser to peer inside the glass case that
holds the original documents. Their work proves that protective

   NATO ANNIVERSARY: For four decades, NATO stood sentry at
Europe's eastern doorstep, poised to unleash massive tanks,
intercontinental bombers and, if need be, nuclear warheads to
thwart the military threat of the Soviet Union. Deterrence worked:
The Soviet Union collapsed. And yet, as the largest summit of world
leaders ever assembled gathers to mark NATO's 50th anniversary,
NATO is being tested by a symptom of its own success. (Will include

<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Pablo Cora was stretched out on the dull-gray
carpet, legs crossed, arms behind his head, mouth pursed in a hard
line of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Above him hung a naked 75-watt bulb. Beside him, in chairs and
on the floor, sat six young men of similar age and intensity, two
of them balancing scores on their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Around them swirled the airy, ancient harmonies of an old
Renaissance Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Words from the ``Agnus'' scudded along Tomas Luis de Victoria's
music, written four centuries ago for an ensemble of seven pristine
male singers. Back then, monks probably sang it. But at 6:15 on a
Thursday night in 1999, the voices belonged to the Concord
Ensemble, a luminous a cappella sextet (plus an extra countertenor,
for the occasion) from Bloomington, Ind., who were gathered in Troy
Savings Bank Music Hall to record their debut compact disc with
Dorian Recordings.
</P>
<P>
   They had just sung one portion of the Mass. Now, huddled around
two five-foot speakers in a spartan recording booth along with Tina
Chancey, their bristly, go-to producer, and Craig Dory, Dorian's
president, co-founder and droll engineering guru, they listened.
And listened. And listened some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last note...'' said Chancey, speaking to Cora. ``Too
sharp?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it sounds hard to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to sing,'' said Cora, like he meant it.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a long week of late-night recording sessions. Long
hours of singing in the hall. Long stretches of listening in the
booth. Lots of sharps to pull down, flats to push up, phrases to
shape and chords to nail. Lots of suggestions from Chancey, lots of
them. And lots of time spent sitting, standing and lying flat in a
10-by-12 hermetically sealed cereal box in the farthest reaches of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Way, way up, past the lobby, past the hall's main floor, past
the dress circle, past the balcony, past the gallery, at the top of
a broad staircase, hides the recording booth leased and occupied by
Dorian. If you didn't already know it was there, you'd never find
it. It's a low-profile operation.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said for Dorian Recordings, based in the
upstate New York city of Troy. The company now boasts one of the
biggest international profiles of any independent label in the
rarefied world of classical recordings. Only one other independent
company, Telarc, is bigger.
</P>
<P>
   But Dorian has built its business on being at once low-key and
high-profile, laid-back and ferociously competitive. It's known for
allowing its artists plenty of room, plenty of input. And it's
known for producing one gorgeous compact disc after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever been to a movie, and seen a scene that makes you cry?
Just all of a sudden you're crying with people on the (screen)?
That's what I want to bring to the music _ not the tears, but that
sense of emotion,'' said Dory, the articulate bear of a man who
co-founded the label with Brian Levine (Dory plus Brian equals
Dorian).

<P>
   ``We're not interested in working with artists who can't swell
up something inside of you. If they can't do it, we're not talking
to 'em. And on a recording, how successful I am as an engineer in
making a great record is how well I can put that emotion on tape
and have it played back for the listener. In other words, if you
get goose pimples or get choked up or you laugh, I did my job, and
the artists did their job.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dory, it's that simple and that complicated. A mathematician
with a musician's ear (he plays flute and sax), Dory was working at
Bell Labs in New Jersey when his wife, a violinist, joined a
chamber orchestra in the New York City area. Long interested in the
science of recording and long equipped with the gizmos to do it, he
started recording their concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Then he started recording other musicians' concerts. And as he
recorded, he figured out the recipe for a good disc how to make one
deliberately, rather than tempting fate with happy accidents. By
the late 1980s he had a regular gig recording the now-defunct
Cathedral Symphony of Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Levine, an executive at a Canadian children's
charity, was moonlighting as an agent for the organist Jean
Guillou. When Guillou performed a concert with the Cathedral
Symphony, Dory recorded it. That recording wasn't a keeper, but the
one that followed a smaller effort, featuring Guillou's solo work
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``That constituted our first recording,'' said Dory, ``for this
new label called Dorian.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levine remains in Toronto, where he handles the artists' end of
things: He sniffs out new musicians, maintains relationships with
old ones and takes charge of the programming for upcoming CDs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of it. In Dorian's plump catalog reside 250-plus
compact discs in three main genres: early music (loosely meaning
anything written before 1800), acoustic traditional music and, the
newest arrival by far, jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Dorian more than doubled its new releases from 23 last year to
50 this year. That compares to the 35 produced by the major label
BMG and the 60 by the hulking Sony.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years were tough ones for the classical-recording
industry: staffs were cut, revenues were down and returns were up.
(``It's tough to pay telephone bills with CDs,'' Dory said). Things
are looking better, but still a mere 2.3 percent of all American
record sales are classical-music purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In the pie of all recordings, the classics account for a
minuscule slice.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is the limited repertoire churned out by
most labels, which have drowned the market in new recordings of old
war horses. Even the most dedicated audiophile can only own so many
recordings of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Dorian has survived by
promoting neglected music _ long-lost medieval polyphony, for
instance, or music from the American Civil War and by focusing on
technical and artistic quality.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer chutzpah helps. In the middle of the industry drought,
while other labels were paring back their output, Dorian made its
plans to expand. It was a risky move but, as they saw it,
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a choice in this business: grow or die,'' Dory said.
</P>
<P>
   In Levine's words: ``You can be a moving target or a smashed
one.''
</P>
<P>
   One result is this year's fattened catalog. Another is its
embryonic jazz list, which the pair hope to christen with a few big
names (they won't say which).
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even scratched the scratch-and-smell for jazz
yet,'' Dory said. ``We're figuring out how we're gonna do it. We
have projects in mind, but we need more critical mass to launch a
label.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Levine: ``We're trying to bite off one enormously oversize
chunk at a time.''

<P>
   I recently asked Vaclav Havel about his admiration for the
American rock icon Lou Reed. He replied that it was impossible to
overstate the importance of rock music for the Czech resistance
during the years of darkness between the Prague Spring and the
collapse of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   I was just relishing the mental image of the leaders of the
Czech underground grooving to the sound of the Velvet Underground
playing ``Waiting for the Man,'' ``I'll Be Your Mirror'' or ``All
Tomorrow's Parties'' when Havel spoke again. ``Why,'' he asked me,
with a straight face, ``do you think we called it the Velvet
Revolution?''
</P>
<P>
   I took this to be an instance of Havel's deadpan humor, but it
was a joke of the sort that reveals another, less literal truth; a
generational truth, perhaps, because for popular music fans of a
certain age the ideas of rock and revolution are inseparably
linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say you want a revolution,'' John Lennon had sneered at
us. ``Well, you know,/We all want to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed with the passage of the years I had come to think of
this linkage as little more than youthful romanticism. So the
discovery that a real revolution had been inspired by rock music's
glamorous snarl was pretty moving. It felt like a sort of
validation.
</P>
<P>
   Because now that nobody smashes guitars or protests about much
any more, now that rock'n'roll is middle-aged and corporate and the
turnover of the leading mega-groups exceeds that of small nation
states, now that it's music for older people remembering their
salad days while the kids listen to gangsta rap, trance music or
hip-hop, and Bob Dylan and Aretha Franklin get invited to sing at
Presidential inaugurals, it's easy to forget the form's
oppositional origins, its anti-establishment heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rock'n'roll's rough, confident spirit of rebellion may be
one reason why this strange, simple, overwhelming noise conquered
the world nearly half a century ago, crossing all frontiers and
barriers of language and culture to become only the third
globalized phenomenon in history after the two World Wars. It was
the sound of liberation, and so it spoke to the free spirits of
young people everywhere and so also, of course, our mothers didn't
like it.
</P>
<P>
   After she became aware of my fondness for Bill Haley, Elvis and
Jerry Lee Lewis, my own alarmed mother began eagerly to advocate
the virtues of Pat Boone, a man who once sang a treacly ballad
addressed to a mule.
</P>
<P>
   But I was trying to imitate the curl of Presley's lips and the
swoon-inducing rotation of his hips, and I suspect boys everywhere,
from Siberia to Patagonia, were doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   What sounded and felt to us like freedom looked to the adult
world like bad behavior, and in a way both things are true.
Pelvis-wiggling and guitar-smashing are indeed liberty's childish
fringe; but it's also true, in all sorts of ways we have learned
much more about as adults, that freedom is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom, that ancient foot-tapping anarchy, the Dionysiac
antithesis of Pat Boone: a higher and wilder virtue than good
behavior, and, for all its spirit of hairy late-night rebellion,
far less likely than blind obedience and line-toeing convention to
do serious damage. Better a few trashed hotel suites than a trashed
world.
</P>
<P>
   But there is that in us which doesn't want to be free; which
prefers discipline and acceptance and patriotic local tunes to the
wild, loose-haired love-music of the world. There is that in us
which wishes simply to go along with the crowd, and to blame all
nay-sayers and pelvis-wigglers for rocking our comfortable boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't follow leaders,'' Bob Dylan warned in ``Subterranean
Homesick Blues,'' ``Watch the parking meters.'' Yet we continue to
want to be led, to follow petty warlords and murderous ayatollahs
and nationalist brutes, or to suck our thumbs and listen
quiescently to nanny states which insist they know what's best for
us. So tyrants abound from Belgrade to Mumbai, and even those of us
who are notionally free peoples are no longer, for the most part,
very rock'n'roll.
</P>
<P>
   The music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner
of conservative defense mechanisms. As long as Orpheus could raise
his voice in song, the Maenads could not kill him. Then they
screamed, and their shrill cacophony drowned his music, and then
their weapons found their mark, and he fell, and they tore him limb
from limb.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming against Orpheus, we too become capable of murder. The
collapse of communism, the destruction of the Iron Curtain and the
Wall, was supposed to usher in a new era of liberty. Instead, the
post-Cold War world, suddenly formless and full of possibility,
scared many of us stiff. We retreated behind smaller iron curtains,
built smaller stockades, imprisoned ourselves in narrower, ever
more fanatical definitions of ourselves _ religious, regional,
ethnic _ and readied ourselves for war.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the thunder of one such war drowns out the sweet
singing of our better selves, I find myself nostalgic for the old
spirit of independence and idealism which once, set infectiously to
music, helped bring another war (in Vietnam) to an end. But at
present the only music in the air is a dead march.

   I recently asked Vaclav Havel about his admiration for the
American rock icon Lou Reed. He replied that it was impossible to
overstate the importance of rock music for the Czech resistance
during the years of darkness between the Prague Spring and the
collapse of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   I was just relishing the mental image of the leaders of the
Czech underground grooving to the sound of the Velvet Underground
playing ``Waiting for the Man,'' ``I'll Be Your Mirror'' or ``All
Tomorrow's Parties'' when Havel spoke again. ``Why,'' he asked me,
with a straight face, ``do you think we called it the Velvet
Revolution?''
</P>
<P>
   I took this to be an instance of Havel's deadpan humor, but it
was a joke of the sort that reveals another, less literal truth; a
generational truth, perhaps, because for popular music fans of a
certain age the ideas of rock and revolution are inseparably
linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say you want a revolution,'' John Lennon had sneered at
us. ``Well, you know,/We all want to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed with the passage of the years I had come to think of
this linkage as little more than youthful romanticism. So the
discovery that a real revolution had been inspired by rock music's
glamorous snarl was pretty moving. It felt like a sort of
validation.
</P>
<P>
   Because now that nobody smashes guitars or protests about much
any more, now that rock'n'roll is middle-aged and corporate and the
turnover of the leading mega-groups exceeds that of small nation
states, now that it's music for older people remembering their
salad days while the kids listen to gangsta rap, trance music or
hip-hop, and Bob Dylan and Aretha Franklin get invited to sing at
Presidential inaugurals, it's easy to forget the form's
oppositional origins, its anti-establishment heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rock'n'roll's rough, confident spirit of rebellion may be
one reason why this strange, simple, overwhelming noise conquered
the world nearly half a century ago, crossing all frontiers and
barriers of language and culture to become only the third
globalized phenomenon in history after the two World Wars. It was
the sound of liberation, and so it spoke to the free spirits of
young people everywhere and so also, of course, our mothers didn't
like it.
</P>
<P>
   After she became aware of my fondness for Bill Haley, Elvis and
Jerry Lee Lewis, my own alarmed mother began eagerly to advocate
the virtues of Pat Boone, a man who once sang a treacly ballad
addressed to a mule.
</P>
<P>
   But I was trying to imitate the curl of Presley's lips and the
swoon-inducing rotation of his hips, and I suspect boys everywhere,
from Siberia to Patagonia, were doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   What sounded and felt to us like freedom looked to the adult
world like bad behavior, and in a way both things are true.
Pelvis-wiggling and guitar-smashing are indeed liberty's childish
fringe; but it's also true, in all sorts of ways we have learned
much more about as adults, that freedom is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom, that ancient foot-tapping anarchy, the Dionysiac
antithesis of Pat Boone: a higher and wilder virtue than good
behavior, and, for all its spirit of hairy late-night rebellion,
far less likely than blind obedience and line-toeing convention to
do serious damage. Better a few trashed hotel suites than a trashed
world.
</P>
<P>
   But there is that in us which doesn't want to be free; which
prefers discipline and acceptance and patriotic local tunes to the
wild, loose-haired love-music of the world. There is that in us
which wishes simply to go along with the crowd, and to blame all
nay-sayers and pelvis-wigglers for rocking our comfortable boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't follow leaders,'' Bob Dylan warned in ``Subterranean
Homesick Blues,'' ``Watch the parking meters.'' Yet we continue to
want to be led, to follow petty warlords and murderous ayatollahs
and nationalist brutes, or to suck our thumbs and listen
quiescently to nanny states which insist they know what's best for
us. So tyrants abound from Belgrade to Mumbai, and even those of us
who are notionally free peoples are no longer, for the most part,
very rock'n'roll.
</P>
<P>
   The music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner
of conservative defense mechanisms. As long as Orpheus could raise
his voice in song, the Maenads could not kill him. Then they
screamed, and their shrill cacophony drowned his music, and then
their weapons found their mark, and he fell, and they tore him limb
from limb.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming against Orpheus, we too become capable of murder. The
collapse of communism, the destruction of the Iron Curtain and the
Wall, was supposed to usher in a new era of liberty. Instead, the
post-Cold War world, suddenly formless and full of possibility,
scared many of us stiff. We retreated behind smaller iron curtains,
built smaller stockades, imprisoned ourselves in narrower, ever
more fanatical definitions of ourselves _ religious, regional,
ethnic _ and readied ourselves for war.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the thunder of one such war drowns out the sweet
singing of our better selves, I find myself nostalgic for the old
spirit of independence and idealism which once, set infectiously to
music, helped bring another war (in Vietnam) to an end. But at
present the only music in the air is a dead march.

ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKS NEED NOT TAKE THIS CRUISE

   ABOARD THE NORWAY _ Ozzie Smith, one of the greatest fielding
shortstops ever, patiently showed a 65-year-old baseball fan the
proper technique of fielding a grounder up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Carson, an all-pro middle linebacker who led the New York
Giants to victory in Super Bowl XXI, had a good time teaching a
60-year-old lady how to rush the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Weatherspoon, defensive player of the year the last two
seasons in the WNBA, encouraged a middle-aged father of five to get
lower and spread his arms and legs on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Mikita, a hockey hall-of-famer, taught children and adults,
male and female, the secret of a successful slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sports Illustrated Afloat cruise aboard the Norwegian
Cruise Line's Norway was rated an overwhelming success by both
passengers (some 1,500) and athletes (13 on the team).
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 5, seven-day sailing from Miami to St. Maarten, St.
John, St. Thomas and Great Stirrup Cay, Norwegian's private island,
highlights a unique corporate relationship worked out between
Sports Illustrated and Norwegian Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a post-mortem meeting with Sports Illustrated in New
York and we were both delighted with the cruise and the
relationship,'' said Nina Cohen, vice president of marketing for
the cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got feedback from the passengers and athletes and everyone
was positive. The guests were totally knocked out. They had such a
great time. They couldn't believe the accessibility of the
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all of the athletes enjoyed it. In fact, they all want to
do it again this year. They were so good interacting with the
passengers. They turned adults into kids. The adults were as giddy
as kids,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes had such a good time, it presents Norwegian Cruise
Lines and Sports Illustrated with somewhat of a problem. All the
athletes want to do it again so it will be difficult adding
different athletes for the 1999 Sports Afloat sailing, scheduled
Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes on the cruise were baseball players Darren Bragg, Dave
Mlicki, Smith and Don Mattingly; basketball players James Worthy,
John Havlicek and Weatherspoon; retired hockey greats Mikita and
Brad Park; retired NFL players Carson and Norm Bulaich; golf
instructor Larry Shaver; and Olympic gold medalist Al Joyner.
(Joyner's wife, the Olympic great Florence Griffith Joyner, died
before the cruise.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the courtship between Sports Illustrated and Norwegian
Cruise Line is relatively new, Norwegian has long been recognized
as the most sports-minded of the cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time my agent booked me on a sports cruise was in 1984,
and it was on this same ship,'' Worthy said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the line has had separate cruises featuring athletes
from the NHL, NFL, NBA, baseball and fitness. The Sports
Illustrated Afloat cruise becomes NCL's sixth sports-theme cruise
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cost of the cruise: Starting at $749 per person, double
occupancy. To book: Call your travel agent.

GRASS-ROOTS DIPLOMACY HELPS EASE TENSION WITH RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The toasts and speeches that attended a recent
reception for two visiting Soviet cosmonauts framed the dilemma
facing the American people and their government as the air war
against Serbian brutality in Kosovo is pressed.
</P>
<P>
   The event at the Albany International Museum was distinguished
for more than the first-ever visit to Albany of cosmonauts Alexei
Yeliseye and Evgenij Khrunov, a capstone for the Albany-Tula
Alliance. For seven years the alliance has fostered a relationship
between Albany and the Russian city, located 120 miles south of
Moscow, by establishing them as sister cities.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the roster of Americans participating in the
speechmaking so much as alluded to the war in Yugoslavia. As
considerate hosts, they undoubtedly avoided the subject on which
Russians and Americans are profoundly divided. Similarly among the
Russians, there was no direct word uttered on the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, the obligatory comment by one of the
Russians about the overriding necessity of maintaining world peace
collaboratively. The strong applause this most ordinary of comments
elicited seemed to reflect that the audience clearly appreciated
the poignancy of the real and present danger of not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Left hanging were the clashing understandings between most of
the Americans and the Russians of what collaboration implied and
what constituted peace.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian visitors refrained from speaking publicly
about the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia, in private their anger was
made known to certain people. They viewed the United States and its
NATO allies as making a reckless imperialistic power-grab,
inflicting suffering upon the Serbs, who don't deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, to most Americans, the NATO intervention is
humanitarian, undertaken to halt the killings, rapes and atrocities
visited by the Serbs upon the ethnic Albanians living in the
Serbian province of Kosovo. That viewpoint has to acknowledge that
the intervention itself accelerated the brutalization and
destruction rather than ending them. But standing powerlessly by as
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic carried out his ethnic
cleansing was not an acceptable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of the Russian and American viewpoints about what is
at stake in Kosovo plays out in a larger arena than what should or
should not be done there.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the American-led NATO action has given new life to
long-embedded resentment of America. Once again, as during the
decades of the Cold War, the United States increasingly is seen by
Russians as an ambitious enemy. The expansion of NATO eastward to
include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland was deemed a threat.
That perception was intensified by the feeling among Russians that
the United States is out to humiliate their country, no longer the
superpower it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground that has been gained in Russian-American
relations since the communists were overthrown and the Soviet Union
fell apart stands at risk. Even in defeat, communists retained a
large chunk of power in Russia, controlling the national
legislature. From that vantage, they are trying to impede Russia's
establishment of democratic institutions and the concomitant
liberalization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the communists have a potent new weapon in their fight, for
Russians across the board are as supportive of their government's
opposition to NATO's intervention as Americans are supportive of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmic issues as vast as Russian-American relations appear
beyond the capacity of ordinary people to influence. Where, then,
does that leave the work of the Albany-Tula Alliance and others
like it?
</P>
<P>
   Since late 1991, the Alliance has fostered a people-to-people
exchanges that has brought many cultural exchanges and Russians to
Albany to study and survey everything from health, economic and
business practices. People from Albany have visited Tula to share
their expertise and knowledge in different fields.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, both sides of the equation have been provided with
an insight into the other's rich culture. From this, each has come
to see the other in personal and direct human terms, and to
appreciate their mutual and their distinct qualities.
</P>
<P>
   It would be too much to expect that this continuing, direct
contact can deflect affairs of state which have been rubbed raw.
But they do remind us in a time of enormous stress and division,
that there are other dimensions in place in the country-to-country
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the Albany-Tula Alliance not only keeps us in
touch at a time of stress. It also points to its inherent
potentiality as a way to build up Russian-American contacts, so
that we may retain the chance to work ourselves up to a point of
greater mutual understanding.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ I always thought I would take stringent care
before putting the term ethnic cleansing into print.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered about news stories from the Balkans -- stories I
didn't cover myself -- and questioned whether it was justified to
describe long-running civil conflicts as something of broad
consequence, something that is the younger brother of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched thousands of Kosovar Albanians cross the border 10
miles from here. I've talked to them there, in the hurley-burley of
arrival and bureaucracy, of emotion, uncertainty and relief. I've
talked to other refugees here, hours after they've been processed
and found a spot to settle. And I've talked to still others of them
days afterward, once they've contrived a sparse routine of refugee
life.
</P>
<P>
   Having been in other wars and warlike conditions, I've turned
skeptical at finding how easily people can embroider details or
even stitch together entire episodes to make a tapestry of events
that authenticates their anger and hatred. I think they usually
believe what they have slowly manufactured, especially if they've
repeated it enough or heard like tales from compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   But here I have listened to scores of stories that don't deviate
from a standard base whether the bearers of them are new arrivals
still confused by what they've been through, or people who have had
time to ponder and reconstruct what they lived. The core stories
differ only in the degree of brutality wielded and suffering
withstood.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are embellishments, they don't disguise the
underlying facts: whole populations of villages, towns and cities
have been terrorized into leaving their homes, usually stripped of
their possessions and often without all the members of their
families.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened is indeed what the world calls ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The details are a bit squishy. Vague stories of Serbian
protagonists carrying out mass executions or wantonly strafing
villages with extended gunfire won't be verified soon, if ever.
Sometimes a refugee will finish such a story and then acknowledge
that he personally did not see the 200 people gunned down, but
somebody in another village told his friend about it.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that children are traumatized, feeble
grandparents hobble for days to reach safety, strong young men
driving tractors break into tears as they pull their wagons of
precious cargo -- their families and neighbors -- across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   These people have been through something bad.
</P>
<P>
   What is truly embarrassing to this listener is that sometimes
their stories get stale. There are so many that sound so similar.
Oh yeah, I've heard a couple dozen times about Serbs surrounding
the village and giving everybody 10 minutes to leave. Yeah, I know
about homes being burned and cars confiscated. So tell me something
new.
</P>
<P>
   I can snap myself to attention by looking straight into the eyes
that reflect sorely wounded spirits. Or something else will bring
me back to the consciousness that these people I'm talking to have
suffered horrible blows. And that decency demands careful
listening.
</P>
<P>
   A teardrop will usually do it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most heroic storytellers I encountered was a
61-year-old man (he looked about 10 years older) named Bajram
Citaku. He saw me talking to a fellow refugee about one of the
civilian convoys that had been bombed and clearly wanted to give
his version of the story. He offered that he could tell me much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Such eagerness usually hits my skeptic button, but I sat down on
the grass with him outside a refugee tent. He began by citing exact
hours that events transpired, from the morning his group left the
school where they had been collected for days by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, I thought, let's cut to the chase and describe the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did something unusual. He pulled out his reading
glasses, then retrieved from his jacket pocket a square of
cardboard covered with tiny handwriting. It was the back of a
cigarette box. Citaku had taken scrupulous notes on every stage of
the odious journey out of his country.
</P>
<P>
   He had a stack of these cardboards and periodically referred to
them. Times, places, dates. The numbers killed in six villages.
Names of the Serbian paramilitary commanders and of the Kosovo
guerrillas killed. We talked for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Citaku had hidden the precious cardboards in his shoe, walking
for three days on possibly the only written eyewitness account of a
shameful episode of modern history. Had any Serb en route seen him
secretly pull the papers from his shoe in order to add the latest
installment, he surely would have been shot on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is the sameness of this multitude of sad stories,
plus the rare cases of candor too solid to question, that make
clear what has been and still is happening in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   I feel perfectly confident to call it ethnic cleansing. Or maybe
something worse.
</P>
<P>
   POSTSCRIPT: I have discovered, yet again, the need for
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   After writing this article over the weekend, I ran into a fellow
journalist Monday morning who had looked up Citaku after I raved
about the quality of this man's information.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his notes, Citaku told my friend that he had seen
64 bodies at the site of the convoy bombing we had discussed, and
had watched Serb forces pile them five at a time into vans.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, I said. Citaku told me a few days earlier he had been
unable to count the bodies. There were no vans, no piles of fives
in his story to me. He supported the comments of other refugees in
the caravan who said they had seen between two and six dead people.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to his tent camp Monday morning to find him, but
other refugees said he and his wife had disappeared. They found an
Albanian family to stay with some miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Did he recover a memory? Find another card with his scribbles?
Hear news accounts putting the dead at 64, then add the flourish?
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible things are happening inside Kosovo, I know. And I will
be even less trusting in tracking down the details.

HIGH IN THE SKY: A WORLD WITHOUT WAR OR JERRY SPRINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My heart leapt when I read about a possible
parallel universe discovered a mere 44 light years away.
</P>
<P>
   According to scientists at San Francisco State and Harvard
universities, at least three planets similar to Jupiter and Neptune
have been spotted in orbit around a sun that astronomers named
``Upsilon Andromedae.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the probability is excellent that there are smaller
planets, like Earth, Venus and Mars of our solar system, also
orbiting Upsilon Andromedae. We just can't ``see'' them yet with
our limited star-gazing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, while it would come as no surprise to the late
``Star Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry, this discovery gives us
further reason to presume we are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because I'm an eternal optimist (or because I grew up
in the Midwest), but I can't bring myself to imagine another planet
out there with human-like life forms who have done a worse job of
things than we have.
</P>
<P>
   (Think about it: We've been around 70,000 years as a species and
have amassed no small number of peace-preaching deities. Our
technology is so advanced, we can implant healing atoms in the
human body or launch space cameras to map the Milky Way. But we're
still murdering one another in huge numbers over the same things we
always have: real estate, bloodlines, religion, or all three.)
</P>
<P>
   So, when I think of that possible parallel universe and a
parallel planet like Earth orbiting Upsilon Andromedae, I can only
envision a better world. Until we hear otherwise, I'm calling the
parallel planet ``Willoughby,'' after a paradisaical town in one of
my favorite episodes of ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   As I envision it, Willoughby is a world on which:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground for impeachment of the leader of a superpower _ if such
an entity still exists _ is not an extramarital affair but an
attempt to combat an insane, power-grabbing ethnic cleansing
campaign with an insane rain of aerial bombs on a messed up but
sovereign nation slightly smaller than Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   _ By virtue of being born, a Willoughby life form is guaranteed
healthful food, clean water, health care and shelter from the
elements forever. No exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirement for this universal care is the swearing
(and keeping) of a universal loyalty oath. It is based (what a
coincidence!) on Gandhi's declaration, ``There are many causes for
which I would die, but not one for which I will kill.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nothing runs via finite planetary resources. If it rolls,
hums, generates, flies, sails, plows, irrigates, computes, cools,
heats, lights or inspires Willoughbeans to shake their booty, its
energy source is the great Greek fraternity in the sky, Upsilon
Andromedae.
</P>
<P>
   _ Birth control is part of the brain chemistry of every
Willoughbean, female and male. If one person thinks,
``Contraception,'' during lovemaking, that's all it takes to block
that kick. When both folks think, ``Baby,'' the green light is on,
and Nature has her chance.
</P>
<P>
   Not a penny, let alone billions, is wasted on a war on drugs
because there are no illegal drugs on Willoughby. If life forms
choose to alter their consciousness, they are allowed to do so.
Oddly enough, not many do because unadulterated daily life on
Willoughby _ with clean air and water, universal peace, adequate
food and shelter and worry-free, guiltless sex _ is pretty damn
good.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is not and never can be a Jerry Springer.

   WATERTOWN, Mass. _ On the bedroom floor of their Watertown home,
on the living room couch, on chairs in the den, on mattresses
strewn on the sun porch, on foam pads and pillows and blanket piles
wherever there's a comfortable corner, Carla and Duncan Brown and
about two dozen of their friends sit cross-legged and casual, eyes
closed, for their peace offensive.
</P>
<P>
   These friends have come together almost every evening since the
beginning of April in response to the devastation in Kosovo. They
think they know how to stop the bombings and ease ethnic tensions
there: they meditate.
</P>
<P>
   And they are linked by the Internet with a group of about 90
Serbians in Belgrade trying the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that radio waves transmit sound over long
distances, they say their brain waves can radiate a form of energy
that is unusually calm and coherent, and helps dissolve the
stresses that cause war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undermining warlike tendencies,'' without the aggressors
even knowing it, said Laure Edwards, 43, a financial writer from
Natick who is an advanced meditator.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Watertown group has personal friends or family
members in war-torn Yugoslavia. But they have seen graphic film
footage of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, the world they knew
left behind them in shreds. And they have read touching e-mail
messages from Dragana Pejcic, a 38-year-old graduate student in
Belgrade who communicates with them through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is tired and exhausted from the daily air-raid
sirens, from going to the cellars and shelters during the night,
from listening to all kinds of (emotional) stories,'' Pejcic wrote.
``Monday, around 4 a.m., I woke up because the building was shaking
as if an earthquake hit us. . . . After that, we watched fire
everywhere. Terrible!''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Brown, 42, a computer network administrator, explained
the urgent concern that has brought the meditators to his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to go on with our normal lives knowing that
this is happening,'' he said. ``I'm upset by the suffering and
cruelty I see in Kosovo. The world is my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Kuhn, 49, a documentary archivist living in Pepperell,
said she was especially moved by stories of Serbian meditators
traveling across Belgrade, ``while bombs are coming down, to get to
a place where they can create a little island of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Pejcic, ``We meet in the home of Milija and Marija
Petrovic, (meditating) there during the day and sleeping in our own
homes at night. To get there, those who live on the other side of
the river Sava, in Belgrade's center, have to cross the bridge. And
because two bridges already have been bombed, with the threat of
further bombing increasing, many people hardly dare to come. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very painful to understand what's going on. We just know
what a solution is. And we work on that.''
</P>
<P>
   By meditating together, in Watertown as in Belgrade, the group
members say they are creating a more settled, restful environment
that is more conducive to rational decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   For Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic or NATO leaders to
really get the message, these meditators probably would need a much
larger group, they say. But perhaps they can help at least a few
people to shift their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing in Kosovo is because of all the differences people
see. A better answer is to help people see the commonalities, the
unity,'' said Peggy Gurnan, 54, who teaches mathematics at a middle
school in Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something intellectual or abstract,'' she said.
``It's a direct experience of connectedness.''
</P>
<P>
   These peacemakers practice an advanced form of Transcendental
Meditation. They say the technique allows their minds to settle
down so that they contact a field of natural energy and
intelligence, which they say some physicists call the unified field
of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Refining and softening this field in one place, they say, can
have a long-range ameliorating effect somewhere else. And doing it
together makes the effect more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   They know some observers will think their ideas absurd. But
history, they say, supports their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Brown, who wrote a Harvard dissertation on the subject,
said 43 studies have documented a link between this form of
meditation and reductions in conflict and negativity, including a
famous study of warfare in Lebanon published by Yale's Journal of
Conflict Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists who reviewed the work decided they had to publish
it,'' she said. ``They didn't believe it, but they couldn't deny
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her dissertation, Brown documented how most scientific
breakthroughs have been initially greeted by ridicule. People
laughed at the notion that radio waves could transmit sound over
long distances, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Other meditators added that those who preach nonviolence often
are viewed as weak or naive, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget how everyone thought the nonviolent techniques of
the civil rights movement were crazy,'' Kuhn said. This
(Transcendental Meditation) is a second-generation technique.''

 UNDATED: ... the mountain.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign for Tibet,
a human-rights-monitoring group, remembers one classic
Breashears-led climb. It took place on Black Dike, a White
Mountains icefall, during the winter of 1994-95. ``Most people get
up at dawn and are at the icefall at 8 o'clock,'' Ackerly explains.
``But David was up at 4 a.m. and the icefall at dawn. So we were
hiking before light in 20-below-zero weather. We finished the climb
at 9 a.m., and we were down by lunch. But David had wanted plenty
of time to deal with whatever might go wrong, although nothing did.
He's very practical. He thinks of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fanning sees his friend as a kind of misplaced 19th-century
character filled with old-fashioned virtues. ``He's the guy you'd
send to the furthest corner of the colonial empire to keep the flag
flying,'' he says. ``Because he'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Breashears doesn't have a life. On the
contrary, his intensity and curiosity have pushed him hither and
yon. True, much of what he likes to do takes place outdoors _
climbing the White Mountains in New Hampshire, for example, or
fly-fishing for striped bass. But he's also likely to whip up some
Mediterranean or Oriental food to go with a bottle of Chilean red
wine, crank up a Bruce Springsteen CD (or slip out to the opera),
or open a thick historical tome. ``He's easily comfortable in a
wider range of cultures than most Americans,'' says Andrew Harvard,
an attorney who has climbed with Breashears on a dozen or so
Himalayan expeditions. ``In that sense he's like an educated
European.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Breashears never seriously considered college, opting
instead to do his learning on the ledges high above Boulder, Colo.
``He didn't have a bike or a stereo when he was growing up,'' his
mother recalls. ``All he wanted to do was climb.'' For a young
misfit who didn't go to his senior prom or bother to have his
picture taken for the yearbook, climbing was a pathway to
excellence and self-expression. His first job in films, some 20
years ago, was as a gofer in a documentary about climbing. He has
since worked on an assortment of movies at a variety of levels _ he
shot footage for Sylvester Stallone's 1993 ``Cliffhanger'' _ and
has recently himself made films about such subjects as the Chinese
occupation of Tibet, the ways that high altitude affects the body
and mind, and the mapping and measuring of Mount Everest.
Breashears has been on Everest 11 times since 1981, usually with a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   He was there in May 1996, toting a 42-pound, $186,000 IMAX
camera toward the summit, when all hell broke loose. On a night
that still rattles with controversy, eight climbers in other
expeditions died when they didn't get down from the top of Everest
before both darkness and a serious storm hit. Camped at 21,300 feet
_ a perch where he had charcteristically decided to wait because he
liked neither the unstable weather nor the mountain's crowded
condition _ Breashears put the success of his own expedition in
jeopardy to assist survivors and to donate 24 precious oxygen tanks
to the rescue effort. Several days later, he and his party of four
other climbers inched their way toward the summit, past Rob Hall
and Scott Fischer, two guides who'd perished on that awful night
and whose frozen bodies were now part of an open graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the top of the world, Breashears used his bare hands
to load the final 500-foot roll of 65mm film into the camera _ by
far the heaviest single object that had even been slogged up the
slopes of Everest _ and finished a mountaineering movie that may
never be matched. (The Sherpa on the summit with him was Jamling
Tenzing Norgay, son of the first Sherpa to reach the top, in 1953,
who was an inspiration for Breashears's youthful climbing.)
Significantly, he had chosen not to film the earlier nightmare. Nor
had he turned his camera on the corpses of Hall and Fischer. ``He's
always had a clear view of how to behave on the mountains, and what
he did reflects that view,'' says Andrew Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually think of that expedition when I'm driving my car,
when there's nothing in front of me that has to be done,''
Breashears says. ``And when I do think of it, it's never, ever,
about being on top of Everest. It's about the sequence of events
that led to those deaths. And how awful it must have been for those
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a transitional moment for me. A watershed. For one
thing, I gained access to a part of my soul I'd built a wall
around. I felt real sadness over those deaths, the kind of sadness
I hadn't been able to feel when my father died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also made me feel more comfortable and more self-assured
about who I am. Giving up those oxygen bottles and not filmimg what
was happening . . . In those moments, I was the person I'd hoped I
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, I have less of a need to ask myself, `Can you do
it? Are you good enough?' I have less of a need to prove myself.
I'm less agitated and more calm. It's like letting steam out of a
pressure cooker.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but he's still David Breashears and he's still on the
run. There's the upcoming book tour, the Kilimanjaro film project,
the Sherpa cause. There's the dream of making a film archive of
Tibetan life. Sure, he'd like to climb just for the fun of it _
Look! No camera! _ but where's the time for it? He runs regularly
and works out at a local gym, but he frets that he's not in the
kind of shape that would allow him to make a quarter-inch finger
hold from an overhang. ``I would never have fathomed that could
happen,'' he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Everest? He talks about it like he might talk about a complex
relationship with another person, someone he loves but knows he
should avoid. He says he feels it's become a trophy mountain, its
high camps and fixed ropes too often overpopulated by folks who
have served no real climbing apprenticeship. ``The Everest
freeway,'' he calls the place, telling friends he'll never go back.
</P>
<P>
   And yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   He did return in 1997 to make ``The Death Zone'' for ``Nova,''
and still talks about the flutter he gets when he sees this dark
icon rising into the clouds. That's when he'll say, ``I've always
felt drawn to Everest, felt a tug.'' And that's when he'll say,
``I'm not finished there.''

INVESTORS CAN EAVESDROP ON COMPANY-ANALYST CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene McQuade, speaking from a crowded room at the Helmsley
Hotel in New York, came through loud and clear to anyone with a
computer wired to the Internet and the interest to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a little bit of shareholder democracy in action.
</P>
<P>
   McQuade, the chief financial officer at Fleet Financial Group,
was leading a routine quarterly conference with brokerage analysts
and institutional investors last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet can count itself among a small but growing number of
companies using the Internet to level the playing field for
individual investors when it comes to those conference calls, which
had always been private conversations with professional
stockholders. In these cases, individual investors can now listen,
but not ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has evolved so it can be done well and you're
comfortable with it,'' said McQuade.
</P>
<P>
   Conference calls are almost always dry, often tedious, and
sometimes useless. But top managers explain events and plans in
detail on those calls and stocks often trade up or down on those
comments while the conversation is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have it both ways. You can't trade on that
information and not expect the media and individual investors to
have access to it,'' said Louis Thompson, chief executive of the
National Investor Relations Institute in Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line traders are really going to start pushing the
envelope for real-time disclosure and real-time access,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies balk at the idea of permitting virtually anyone
onto their call, complaining that information could be
misunderstood. Many analysts worry the practice will turn a
sophisticated financial conversation into mush.
</P>
<P>
   But the convenient old excuse, that it was impractical to tie
many hundreds or even thousands of people into a telephone
conference call, is history.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies now offer services that put conference call
audio on Internet sites. The cost, usually around $800, is
inconsequential to most public companies.
</P>
<P>
   These corporate ``Webcasters'' have been in operation for about
two years, but few companies signed up before the middle of last
year. Since then, most say their rosters of corporate clients have
increased by more than 100 percent quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   V-Call Corp., a Philadelphia firm, specializes in live
conference audio available at no charge to anyone who registers at
its site (www.vcall.com). Free software to play audio is easy to
download from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   V-Call's list of registered users has grown from 33,000 in
January to 125,000 as of last week. It boasts a roster of more than
300 companies using at least some of its services.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate Communications Broadcast Network in Boston handles
audio for clients who want it posted on their own Internet sites,
and Broadcast.com Inc. of Dallas (www.broadcast.com) posts some
live corporate conference calls, along with commercial radio and
other kinds of audio.
</P>
<P>
   C-Call Corp. of San Francisco (www.ccall.com) uses the same kind
of technology but most of its corporate clients restrict access to
the same professional investors who used to dial into conference
calls by phone. It may turn out to be an intermediate step before
companies use the Web to transmit to retail shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get comfortable with the medium, it's easier to
transfer that out to the retail (investors),'' said Blake Hayunga,
a vice president for the public company group at C-Call. ``It
happens in pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference calls open to the public have attracted groups of
several hundred to a few thousand. Microsoft Corp. conference calls
are heard by more than 10,000 people, including employees.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies tend to Webcast their analyst conferences
more often than other businesses and attract a larger listening
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But more companies, including Fleet, have an increasing number
of individual shareholders, and they are giving all their investors
the same access to calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing,'' said Rob Adler, president of
Corporate Communications Broadcast Network. ``The Internet is
changing the way a lot of things are done.''

ALWAYS PLAY TIME FOR THE PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Celtics' bench looked pretty good Monday; they had
three starters in street clothes, all smartly attired. At the other
end of the court, Larry Bird had the same guys he's always had _ in
uniform, ready to go. It has been that way for two years.
</P>
<P>
   You can listen to Bird talk a lot about coaching, but one thing
he won't discuss is how well he deals with adversity and
roster-juggling. He hasn't had any. He's had to deal with tough
losses and a tough schedule, but he sees the same faces every day
and that is almost a miracle in this truncated season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers played their 42d game Monday. The top nine players,
all of whom are averaging at least 17 minutes a game, have missed a
total of five games, no one missing more than one. And of those
five games, two were non-injured absences; Jalen Rose was suspended
for a game for fighting and Mark Jackson missed one to attend his
father's funeral. The notoriously fragile Rik Smits missed his
first game Sunday _ because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable number in any season, let alone this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond imagination,'' Bird said of the season. ``I
thought it was going to be great, playing every day. But it's not.
We're on the road all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also is consistent with what Bird has seen since he took
over. Last season, for instance, five of Bird's top eight went
wire-to-wire and a sixth, Miller, missed one game because of a
suspension. Only Smits (nine games) and Dale Davis (the first four
of the season) missed more than one game.
</P>
<P>
   How do the Pacers do it? They don't know. There is a connection
between health and winning, more of a connection when talent is
added to the equation. But there's no accounting for the ankle
sprain that Antoine Walker suffered Sunday. It could have happened
to Miller or Davis or Jackson. It did happen to Antonio Davis _
obviously not as severely _ but he missed one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do anything different than anyone else,'' said team
president Donnie Walsh. ``I mean, we have a conditioning coach and
we try to pick stuff up early. I think it's a roll of the dice in
this business. I just knock on wood every chance I get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers do have three players on the injured list: Mark Pope,
Mate Skelin, and Fred Hoiberg. Even those guys are healthy. The
only legitimately hurt player this season is the maddening Derrick
McKey, who is trying to do the impossible: play himself back into
shape in a season with no time for practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he never played before,'' a sympathetic Bird
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana will say they need McKey for this or for that, but they
can do quite nicely without him. Smits is absolutely critical to
the club's success and he's been a constant ever since Dan Dyrek
started working on his feet. Miller, Chris Mullin, and Dale Davis
have started all 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' Dale Davis said. ``It gives you a chance to play a
consistent game and have a consistent year. Some of it is luck. But
a lot of it is how you go about training.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about minutes distribution, Davis said, ``It has an
effect. You play less, the less chance you have of getting hurt.
(Bird) has done a good job of rotating guys.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the experience factor. Dale Davis is the pup of the
litter and he's played seven seasons. The other four (Smits,
Miller, Mullin, and Jackson) all have played at least a decade.
They know how to take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around,'' Walsh said. ``But what amazes me is how
we've stayed healthy this season. With all those games in a short
period of time, that's when injuries occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Bird, ``We've been very fortunate. Overall, we've been
pretty healthy. The guys keep in shape. We also play a lot of guys,
so that helps. We try to keep their minutes down. I don't think
Reggie Miller needs to play 38 to 40 minutes a night (he plays
35.8).''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bird even pretended that Smits was a pre-game
concern. Asked before the game if Smits was going to play, Bird
said, ``I have no idea. If he's not out there, he's not going to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits was out there and he played. It's the Indiana way.

<P>
   KOSOVO-MEDIDATE (Watertown, Mass.) _ The group has come together

HARLEM TOURISM ADVOCATES SAY 'GET OFF THE BUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Larcelia Kebe began Harlem Your Way Tours in
1983, the thrust of her business was the ``Champagne Jazz Safari,''
which introduced outsiders to popular uptown New York nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of those clubs have closed down, these days Kebe's
most popular trips into Harlem take place on Sunday mornings, when
busloads of Europeans are brought into neighborhood Baptist
churches to hear the sounds of gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite brief glimpses of Harlem's churches _ and the
growing interest in its historic homes and cultural museums _
tourists for the most part are still viewing the neighborhood from
the seat of a bus. Tourism boosters want to put an end to this
``safari''-like industry, which, they say, shortchanges both
visitors and residents.
</P>
<P>
   The only way tourists will have a truly authentic visit to
uptown Manhattan, Kebe said, is if they get out and walk around.
``You don't get a feeling of a community otherwise,'' Kebe said.
</P>
<P>
   While noisy tour buses are a concern for some residents,
encouraging visitors to hit the pavement is important for economic
reasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, millions of dollars in federal, state and city
money are being used to improve streetscapes along historic and
retail corridors in Harlem and Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   About $4 million has been earmarked to renovate churches that
``are falling down structurally,'' said Alex Saavedra, program
officer at the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. And $250,000 is
being spent on preliminary plans for a national jazz museum. As
part of this ``heritage tourism'' plan, signs will be posted at the
southern edge of Harlem, which adjoins Central Park, to guide
pedestrians to points of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Row houses built in the early 20th century, during the Harlem
Renaissance, will be renovated, sidewalks will be spruced up and a
visitor's center will be built along 125th Street, Harlem's main
street.
</P>
<P>
   By combining improvements to uptown Manhattan's landscape with
financial assistance to restaurants and nightclubs, Saavedra is
optimistic that tourists will stay longer and spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   What really hurts local businesses, says Lloyd Williams,
president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, is the lack of
patronage from Harlemites. This summer, Williams and other business
leaders will begin a ``Discover Harlem'' campaign to ``retain the
disposable income of the community'' by marketing restaurants,
entertainment and cultural institutions to residents.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the economic benefits of sprucing up Harlem,
New York City Councilman Bill Perkins believes that, ultimately,
tourism can also have a positive impact on the ``currency of human
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in order for that to happen, he said, ``you have to give
people reasons to get off the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Persons, who heads the Harlem Historical Society, said
bolstering the arts and culture is a crucial step toward reviving
the neighborhood's economic vitality. He is planning the creation
of a Harlem Historical Museum, which he predicts could open as
early as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Persons brushes off the notion that increased tourism would
somehow impinge upon the lifestyle of local residents. As with any
popular tourist destination in the world, he said, Harlemites will
continue to patronize restaurants and clubs that visitors do not
even know exist.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is down throughout New York City, but the perception of
danger in uptown Manhattan has not necessarily waned. In fact, some
tourists are attracted to Harlem because they want to see the
poverty and crime that is often portrayed on television, said
Lauren Craniotes, who is overseeing a study of tourism in Harlem
for the Empowerment Zone. ``Obviously, that is not what we want to
promote,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When New York Apple Tours began offering ``hop on, hop off''
sightseeing tours throughout New York City six years ago, ``there
weren't a lot of people hopping off the buses in Harlem,'' said
Michael Alvich, vice president of sales and marketing. But that is
slowly beginning to change, he said, and the company recently began
offering walking tours to the 200,000 people it shuttles through
Harlem each year.
</P>
<P>
   Kebe, of Harlem Your Way Tours, said the atmosphere in uptown
Manhattan has been more relaxed in the past decade as a result of
reduced crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the muggers are downtown,'' Kebe noted. Ironically,
that could be a bad sign for Harlem. As Kebe pointed out, muggers
follow the tourists.

MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO: THE CAPUCHIN ART MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By RAMONA JENKIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd of 60 patrons of the National Arts Club on
Gramercy Park _ dressed in dark business suits and designer
cocktail dresses and wearing plenty of gold jewelry _ pushed their
way to the front of the room.
</P>
<P>
   They hoped to meet one of the painters whose works were on
display. The excited crowd gathered, closing in on the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   Like many artists this one was a private and delicate creature,
not used to being surrounded by strangers. She let our several
rhythmic high-pitched howls and jumped from the lectern into the
speaker's arms.
</P>
<P>
   She was, after all, just a monkey.
</P>
<P>
   The guests had just heard how little 7-pound, 6-year-old Ayla, a
brown two-toned capuchin monkey, and others like her have provided
companionship, independence and occasionally art for quadriplegics
through Helping Hands, a non-profit organization based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Capuchins are small, gentle and dexterous monkeys. They live to
be about 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   This makes them the perfect long-term companions for this group
of disabled people, most of whom are injured in early adult life,
said the program's director, Judi Zazula.
</P>
<P>
   On this night the proof of their dexterity was in the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   To the left of where Ayla clung to Zazula was a display of six
paintings _ the fruits of the monkeys' recreational labors and
their first New York show.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get a lot of monkey art out there,'' Zazula
said. ``It's also
</P>
<P>
   a way for people to give something so that it helps the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   The going price for an 8-by-10-inch piece of framed monkey art
is $100.
</P>
<P>
   Zazula, 43, said Helping Hands uses the artwork to raise money
to help get a monkey to someone else in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs about $25,000 to $30,000 to breed, raise and train
these monkeys and to follow them for life,'' Zazula said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200 monkeys in the program, she said.
</P>
<P>
   After oohing and aahing over Ayla the crowd moved toward the
table with the monkey masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   There were two paintings with small, green delicate monkey
footprints against a white background, as if little primates had
stepped in a container of paint and walked across the canvases.
</P>
<P>
   One abstract piece featured a few strokes of red, blue and
yellow that seemed to spin off from the center of the painting.
Another was a set of simple but elegant mauve brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The art program started in 1995 when a monkey sitting on
Zazula's lap started scribbling, she said. The little capuchin
seemed to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Zazula said she thought that if she gave them paints they might
make something worth framing. Soon the art program was in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are links between the personalities and the things they
paint,'' Zazula said.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't all paint and they're not all artists, said
Helping Hands' treasurer, Susan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many just scribble,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Besty Brewer, 40, has been breeding capuchins for Helping Hands
for the last five years at Southwick's Zoo in Mendon, Mass. She was
skeptical about the capacity monkeys have for art, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to anthropomorphize _ thinking that they know how
an animal thinks,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Capuchins have a large brain-to-body ratio and are very
intelligent, she said. But Brewer added that she had not witnessed
any of the monkeys or chimpanzees at her zoo initiating any art
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how much interaction they've had with
humans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Zazula agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One monkey has learned to paint with the brush in his mouth, the
way his quadriplegic companion does, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of what others think, Zazula gives the monkeys a set of
non-toxic paints when each monkey is placed with a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   The art is a way for the monkeys to express themselves, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just good fun and the fun starts and ends with
the manipulation of the medium,'' Zazula said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people appreciate it the way you appreciate your
child's art work,'' Zazula said. ``We think we have such unique
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the pieces were sold that night.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people were amused by the monkey art and some were
skeptical about its artistic value, but one of the guests, Jody
Widelitz, said he was impressed with its quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than a show I saw the other day at a SoHo
gallery,'' he said.

BIRDS AND BIRD NERDS FLOCK TO CENTRAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ANDREW GLAZER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It takes a lot to excite New Yorkers, but Bob
DeCandido enthralls his followers every Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two birds live right up on Woody Allen's building,'' he
said as he pointed to a five-foot nest built by a pair of
red-tailed hawks across an archway high on a concrete building on
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   DeCandido, an Urban Park Ranger based out of Belvedere Castle in
Central Park, leads a group of birdwatchers on bird safaris every
Sunday at 9 a.m. The birders, like the birds they observe, come in
a variety of sizes and shapes. On a cold Sunday morning, some
donned nylon Patagonia parkas and leather boots, while others wore
mink coats and hi-top sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Most New Yorkers don't realize this, but birds flying from
Canada to South America and back again like to layover in
Manhattan's Central Park. In the past decade, an increasing number
of birds have rested and nested in the park, drawing more than
10,000 binocular-bearing bird enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   DeCandido estimates that Central Park is a rest-stop or
permanent home to nearly 250 species of birds that feed off of its
berries, acorns and grains, and hunt its plentiful stock of rats,
mice, squirrels and small birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Park is an island of green surrounded by concrete,''
said Paul Kerlinger, a biologist and environmental consultant who
has studied Central Park's ecology. ``The birds migrating might
look down and see the only spot of green for miles around.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCandido is delighted to have the birds land in his backyard.
He clearly and patiently explains park biology while surefootedly
traversing muddy slopes and slippery rocks. With a green mesh
trucker's hat pulled low on his head and a forest green nylon
windbreaker, he has the basic appearance and demeanor of a park
ranger.
</P>
<P>
   But because he is an urban park ranger who grew up in the Bronx,
DeCandido has a manner of speaking that differs from his fellow
rangers in Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the way he described why more birds come to the park in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, people leave food around,'' he said. ``This
food attracts prey: rats, squirrels, pigeons, mice. The raptors
come into the park and it's like they're walking into a McDonald's
with no one at the cash register.''
</P>
<P>
   New York birds, like New York park rangers, have a distinct
urban edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This part of the park has some of the fastest and slimmest
pigeons thanks to the red-tailed hawks,'' said Dennis Geisel of
Manhattan, an amateur ornithologist and friend of DeCandido. Woody
Allen's feathered neighbors, usually hunters of less-urban
creatures like rabbits, field mice and small snakes, hunt pigeons
in Central Park. The fattest and slowest pigeons are usually their
victims.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk from the hawks' domain, a small cluster of pine
trees stands in a field of green grass. A man in his 60s swept his
battered pair of binoculars through the trees as his wife stood
impatiently beside him.
</P>
<P>
   DeCandido pointed out an eggplant-shaped silhouette with pointed
ears _ a long-eared owl. A young man passed by. ``Tell those people
down there he's in the tree to the right, because they're lost,''
DeCandido said.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, DeCandido met up with the couple and
discussed the owl. ``It has small talons, so it eats young rats and
small birds but not squirrels or bigger birds like pigeons,''
DeCandido explained.
</P>
<P>
   DeCandido said Central Park has become more desirable to birds
not only because there are fewer surrounding green areas for them
to land, but because the park's trees and shrubbery have matured. A
decade ago, park officials kept trees and bushes neatly groomed,
but rangers successfully lobbied for a more natural look. The dense
trees and thickets are more suitable for nesting.
</P>
<P>
   With the birds come the bird-watchers, who once attracted almost
as much attention as the brightest cardinal. But jaded New Yorkers
soon stopped noticing the urban naturalists wading through the park
while making strange whistling sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The socioeconomic group of people who live around Central Park
are the type of people who travel around the world to see nature,''
DeCandido said. ``They understand the attraction of nature. If they
saw us bowling, they'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stotz of the New York City Audubon Society said that
recently there have been territorial battles between birders and
dog owners who unleash their pets in areas of the park where birds
feed. The dogs chase and sometimes catch the birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some friction,'' Stotz said. ``You say, 'Could
you put your dog on a leash,' and people get incensed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stotz said, however, that most park visitors supported his
hobby. ``When I'm walking around with binoculars peering into
trees, people ask: 'Did you see this and this bird?' Sometimes they
point me to a bird. Other times it's their active imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all who make up Central Park's birding community believe
that once people see the variety of birds Central Park offers, they
will be hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see an owl or a hawk in their spotting scope,''
Kerlinger said, ``and it's like a light went off. A learning
experience right here in Manhattan!''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday-morning birder Sandy Shepps from Manhattan remembered one
such moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We once saw a night heron eat a baby mallard,'' she said. ``He
slurped it down like a piece of spaghetti!''

MALCOLM X MUSEUM SEARCHES FOR A HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By WILLIAM MURRAY  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK --The Malcolm X museum is an idea in search of a home.
Hundreds of photographs, audio recordings, ticket stubs and letters
from the assassinated black Muslim leader gather dust in boxes and
bins scattered around the country, all awaiting a permanent
repository.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have photographs of Malcolm X starting from 1954 when he
began his Muslim ministry here in Harlem, to the front pages of New
York City's six daily newspapers the day Malcolm was shot,'' in
1965, said Andy Owens, a member of the proposed museum's board of
directors. But despite several years of organizing, Malcolm X
devotees have been unable to gather the collection in a permanent
location.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Owens and eight other people organized a foundation
to honor the onetime prison inmate who became a hero of the black
Muslim movement and in recent years has achieved a new icon status
among young African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The group had always hoped a Malcolm X museum would be
established in the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination
34 years ago. A small area in the first floor of the Ballroom
houses a life-sized bronze statue, a mural and an etching depicting
Malcolm X, but the spacious second floor of the Ballroom is empty
and would work well as a museum, foundation members say. But the
city, which owns the onetime dance and concert hall and has allowed
it to open just six times over the past four years for special
occasions, has never provided a fulltime operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Sam Anderson said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration closed the site for a year to renovate a room
honoring Malcolm X's widow, but failed to provide the hoped-for
budget to pay for regular hours of operation. Giuliani's press
office directed all questions to the city's Economic Development
Commission, which did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has made it clear that it is not willing to give the
Audubon over to any organization unless it has the financial
resources to run it itself,'' said Michael Mowatt-Wynn, the curator
of the Audubon space where the statue, mural and etching are
displayed. ``The city has said it doesn't have the resources to
operate a the museum and so far no one has been able to pay for its
operation.'' He said it would take $300,000 a year to run a museum,
and organizers now are looking beyond city coffers for support. The
foundation plans to raise money on its own to build a new facility
in Harlem, but a specific plan has yet to be developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people on the board tried to have the Audubon
Ballroom as the museum,'' said Ghiuslaine Hermanuz, a board member
and an urban planning professor at City College of New York. ``Now
nobody is very sure about where it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New York politicians have joined the push to
commemorate Malcolm X's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time in the early '90s negotiating with the
Giuliani administration. The real issue was trying to reach an
agreement over whether the exhibit and museum would have an
operating budget,'' said Ruth Messinger, Manhattan Borough
President from 1989 to 1997 and Giuliani's opponent in the 1997
mayoral race. But some of the impetus waned with the 1997 death of
Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, who had been a prime organizer,
Messinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm X is credited with awakening black militancy and racial
pride in black America in the early 1960s. Harlem is where he
became famous for his sidewalk debates and attacks against white
racism. As chief spokesman for the Nation of Islam, he was among
the first leaders to articulate the anger felt by black Americans
about segregation and economic exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Museum organizers currently sponsor or conduct many Malcolm
X-related programs, such as a memorial this past February on the
anniversary of his death, at the Schomburg Center for Research in
Black Culture at 135th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a place to commemorate his spirit. The motivation is
to recognize the teachings of Malcolm X and the struggle for a
community for dignity and political strength,'' said Hermanuz.
``And it has not stopped. This museum,'' whatever its eventual
location, ``will not just be a place to keep things. It will be a
place of action.''

POOR TOWN NEAR CAPE CANAVERAL TRIES TO FIGHT OFF DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<P>
   OAK HILL, Fla. _ Off Route 1, not far from Daytona, a small road
leads east to Mosquito Lagoon, a sparkling expanse of deep blue
water where pelicans rest on old docks and a barrier island lies in
the distance under a mantle of shrub oak and palmetto grass.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the rest of Florida's Atlantic seaboard is ragged
with construction, no condominium complexes or hotels mark the
coastline here _ in fact, there are very few buildings of any kind
at all. Just a few fish camps line the lagoon where trailers, many
of them decades old and worn with time and salt water, look as
natural as the gnarled driftwood sticking out of nearby swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in one of Florida's poorest towns, a quiet, almost
bewildering tranquillity pervades.
</P>
<P>
   This peace is only occasionally interrupted with a violent
shudder and a sonic boom, the source of which lies some 30 miles
away. At the Kennedy Space Center, the Vertical Assembly Building
houses NASA's space shuttle. And when the multibillion-dollar
shuttle is wheeled out of its home and launched, the little town of
Oak Hill and all of its trailers shudder in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place really rumbles,'' said Jeaneen Clauss, 30, Oak
Hill's city clerk who works in the two-room city hall that shares
quarters with the five-member police department. ``The buildings
definitely shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Oak Hill was incorporated in the 1950's as a direct response to
the development of NASA's space program at Cape Canaveral, and back
then, ``the Cape'' as locals call it, promised bigger and better
things. The area's fishing industry had languished, the timber
industry was obsolete, but the infinite frontier of space inspired
great hopes. The sleepy town was swept up in the euphoria of
America's great ventures into space and optimism abounded along
with jobs. A map in the town hall announced Oak Hill as ``the
gateway to the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up, it was always the Cape, the Cape, the Cape,
the U.S, the U.S, the U.S.,'' said Donna Bennett, Oak Hill's mayor
and a third-generation resident. ``I was indoctrinated in that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the shaking and rumbling of the space shuttle
are nothing more than tangible reminders of the town's past _ a
time when the golden age of space travel consumed the town and
promised a brighter future. Now, Oak Hill is struggling to survive,
the unlikely site of a battle between new and old.
</P>
<P>
   For this tiny town of ``a thousand and a couple,'' as Clauss
describes it, the triumphs and tragedies of space travel are more
than events on the evening news. The town has revolved around the
Cape _ it has felt the giddy joy of its successes and a penetrating
sadness at its losses.
</P>
<P>
   Today Donna Bennett, a 51-year-old single mother, lives a few
steps away from the house where she grew up. And on a recent
afternoon, she walked through a small orange grove where her
parents produce enough fruit to pay town taxes and knocked on the
door. The power had just gone out and her father, Allen Williams,
sat shirtless in the dark. The walls of the concrete house were
lined with deer heads and turkey beards, the spoils of hunting in
the countryside around Oak Hill. On the floor rested an alligator
head and a sea turtle ``paw.''
</P>
<P>
   William's taxidermied artifacts are not the only trophies in his
house. Nestled among them are framed certificates honoring his
service at the Cape. One, from the U.S. Department of Defense,
recognizes his contribution to the Apollo 11 mission, the first
landing on moon. Another honors his service as a firefighter in
1956 when three astronauts were instantly killed after a flash fire
consumed a test rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were eating supper when we heard the bell,'' said Williams,
dolefully. ``We got there as fast as we could, but it was too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   The flash fire in 1956 was the first tragedy that rattled the
town's psyche. In 1986, Betty Bellamy, now Oak Hill's town
historian, was a grade school teacher. She had assembled her class
outside of the school to watch the Space Shuttle Challenger carry
the teacher Christa McAullife, the first civilian on a shuttle
mission, into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching with my class,'' Bellamy said. ``And there was
this little space-crazy boy, and he kept saying 'There it goes,
there it goes!' And then I thought, Oh my, something's wrong.'' As
most of America watched on television as the space shuttle
exploded, Bellamy's class saw the hurtling fragments of the craft
plunge into the ocean with their own eyes. ``The boy was taken to a
priest, and then a doctor,'' said Bellamy, shaking her head. ``He
almost had a nervous breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Pictured on Oak Hill's town seal, are an orange, a leaping fish
and a rocket, but all of the industries these symbols represent are
now gone. A deep freeze killed most of Oak Hill's orange groves in
the mid-80s, and several years ago a ban on gill net fishing shut
down what was left of the town's fishing industry. Then, the final
blow came as most of Oak Hill's residents were laid off from
service jobs at the Cape.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bennett is struggling to maintain the idyllic beauty of the
town she grew up in while staving off hungry developers who many
say are the town's only hope for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said, ``When Kennedy made his speech and said 'Ask not
what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your
country' I thought, 'What can I do for my town?'''
</P>
<P>
   For Bennett, the most important thing is fighting off a county
proposal to build a $10 million sewage plant in Oak Hill and
construct a town water system. (The town currently uses only
residential septic systems). If constructed, Bennett says, the
plant and the water system will drive up town taxes, making Oak
Hill unaffordable for many of its residents. But more important,
the added infrastructure would be a virtual green light for
developers, many of whom will not build in Oak Hill until a town
water system is in place.
</P>
<P>
   For a town that grew up in the shadow of one of the most
ambitious and technologically advanced projects in the world, where
rockets are launched into the nether reaches of space, septic
systems and sewage plants seem a mundane and somewhat odd
preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   But rockets and space shuttles have let the town of Oak Hill
down, and now these closer-to-earth concerns are of greater
importance.
</P>
<P>
   For people of Bennett's generation, the Cape still fascinates.
``I still go out and watch the launches,'' Bennett said. ``I still
remember the first time one went off. I felt like I'd been shot.''
But for Oak Hill's younger residents, rocket launches into space
are just another part of life.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's 14-year-old daughter, Shona Lee, has dreams of leaving
Oak Hill for New York City and a career in modeling. ``Her
generation grew up with it,'' Bennett said of the space program.
``For her it's like 'Oh, the shuttle's going up and the windows are
shaking again.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a clear day, when the shuttle takes off, it appears to arc
over the town itself. And days later, when the shuttle re-enters
the earth's atmosphere and approaches its landing strip, a sonic
boom rattles the town with shock waves. As the town staves off the
future, a rumbling shuttle from outer space remains part of its
rhythm.

</P>
<P>
   MONKEY ART _ Sixty patrons of the National Arts Club hoped to
meet one of the painters whose works were on display. The excited
crowd gathered, closing in on the lectern. Like many artists this
one was a private and delicate creature, not used to being
surrounded by strangers. She let our several rhythmic high-pitched
howls and jumped from the lectern into the speaker's arms. She was,
after all, just a monkey.
</P>
<P>
   BIRD WATCHERS _ Most New Yorkers don't realize this, but birds
flying from Canada to South America and back again like to layover
in Manhattan's Central Park. In the past decade, an increasing
number of birds have rested and nested in the park, drawing more
than 10,000 binocular-bearing bird enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   TV TURNOFF _ It has been called the ``idiot box,'' the ``boob
tube'' and a ``vast wasteland.'' On April 22, Esther Forrest is
calling it quits. As part of National TV-Turnoff Week, the
elementary school principal and her teachers at Public School 51 in
the Bronx will hand out signs for students to tape over the screens
of their TV sets. The signs are a reminder that the tube is
off-limits for an entire week. Seven whole days _ 168 hours.
</P>
<P>
   BRAIDERS _ The ancient tradition of hair braiding is being
threatened by the modern bureaucracy. In many states, hair-braiders
must go through up to 1,600 hours of training in order to receive a
cosmetology license _ training that can cost as much as $5,000, and
covers perming, tinting and use of chemicals, all skills that
braiders say they have little need to know. In some states,
especially California, Ohio and Texas, the cosmetology boards have
cracked down on unlicensed braiders. To protest what they view as a
draconian requirement, some braiders have taken the cosmetology
boards to court.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN MARKET _ On a recent Saturday, Betty Delacruz leaned
against a wall at the Knickerbocker Live Poultry Market and waited
for her two chickens and three quail to be killed, plucked, and
gutted. Now she shops, sometimes twice a week, at the
Knickerbocker, which for 62 years has catered to several immigrant
cultures in Brooklyn. Each has its own idea of what makes good
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   DISABLED SKIERS _ The world of disabled skiers is filled with
the same exhilaration, achievement and camaraderie that all skiers
share. For the disabled, however, it takes a little more to get out
on the slopes: more equipment (which costs a little more money),
more help from the able-bodied and more guts.
</P>
<P>
   HEAT PILL _ John Glenn has been on the pill. So have some
firefighters and deep sea divers. This pill is not a contraceptive,
Prozac or even Viagra. Researchers have been testing this product
to prevent heat exhaustion in firefighters. The three-quarter-inch
capsule monitors body temperatures of those who work in extreme
environments.
</P>
<P>
   MALCOLM X MUSEUM _ The Malcolm X museum is an idea in search of
a home. Hundreds of photographs, audio recordings, ticket stubs and
letters from the assassinated black Muslim leader gather dust in
boxes and bins scattered around the country, all awaiting a
permanent repository. ``We have ministry here in Harlem, to the
front pages of New York City's six daily newspapers the day Malcolm
was shot,'' in 1965, said Andy Owens, a member of the proposed
museum's board of directors. But despite several years of
organizing, Malcolm X devotees have been unable to gather the
collection in a permanent location.
</P>
<P>
   IN SHADOW OF NASA _ While most of the rest of Florida's Atlantic
seaboard is ragged with construction, no condominium complexes or
hotels mark the coastline here _ in fact, there are very few
buildings of any kind at all. Just a few fish camps line the lagoon
where trailers, many of them decades old and worn with time and
salt water, look as natural as the gnarled driftwood sticking out
of nearby swamps. Here, in one of Florida's poorest towns, a quiet,
almost bewildering tranquillity pervades.
</P>
<P>
   HARLEM TOURISM _ Popular trips into Harlem take place on Sunday
mornings, when busloads of Europeans are brought into neighborhood
Baptist churches to hear the sounds of gospel music. Yet despite
brief glimpses of Harlem's churches most tourists are still viewing
the neighborhood from the seat of a bus. Tourism boosters want to
put an end to this ``safari''-like industry, which, they say,
shortchanges both visitors and residents. They say the only way
tourists will have a truly authentic visit to Harlem is if they get
out and walk around.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betsy Hurley boasted to her father that she fell only
twice in her morning of skiing at Pico Mountain in Vermont. Robert
Ferrusi prefers speed to finesse, and avoids moguls. Al Fenton
stopped after one run, because the rain and fog made it tough to
ski.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary day of skiing in most ways, but take a closer look.
To get up after a fall, Hurley, 17, who has spina bifida, digs her
poles into the snow and rights her mono-ski _ a contraption that is
basically a bucket seat mounted on a ski _ often needing an
able-bodied instructor's help. Ferrusi, 38, a paraplegic, hoists
himself out of his wheelchair and streaks down the slopes on his
gleaming purple mono-ski as snowboarders stare in envy. Fenton, 65,
who has multiple sclerosis, has no feeling in his legs, and relies
on his sight to ``feel'' the topography of the slope, although on
this day it was too foggy to get an accurate read.
</P>
<P>
   The world of disabled skiers is filled with the same
exhilaration, achievement and camaraderie that all skiers share.
For the disabled, however, it takes a little more to get out on the
slopes: more equipment (which costs a little more money), more help
from the able-bodied and more guts.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of the able-bodied people who try skiing give it
up after one day. Not so with disabled skiers. ``The fact that a
person with a disability is here and ready to try this means that
they've already conquered a huge mental hurdle,'' said Jim
Hutchins, the program director of Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sport.
``The rest is downhill from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days a week, Hutchins _ a large man with a Santa Claus
kind of merriness _ is out on the slopes at one of several Vermont
ski resorts, teaching the disabled to ski. For $70 a day, a
disabled skier rents a mono-ski, gets a full-day ski lesson with
one or two instructors, and a lift ticket. In the past, Hutchins
could handle walk-ins, but so many people are interested in
mono-skiing now, that reservations are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchins is part engineer, part teacher and part cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, he and Hurley teamed up to coach Kip St.
Germaine, a new student, who became disabled as a result of an
accident. Hurley skied out in front on her mono-ski, St. Germaine
followed with Hutchins skiing behind him, holding onto the back of
St. Germaine's mono-ski. As the morning went on, Hutchins gradually
released his grip. By his third run down the mountain, St. Germaine
was skiing on his own. Most new skiers take much longer, as long as
an entire season of lessons. But St. Germaine is quite an athlete _
he is on the U.S. Disabled Ice Hockey team, which competed at the
Paralympic Games in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The bucket on Hurley's mono-ski has bumper stickers that read
``You Go, Girl'' and ``Brakes are for Wussies.'' She also
participates in downhill mountain biking, whitwater rafting and
horseback riding. Because of the spina bifida, she has no use of
her legs and little use of her hips. St. Germaine has use of
everything above his bellybutton. Of course, skiing is different
when only half of the body is available. ``We use our hips and legs
and knees'' to turn, said Hutchins, ``Kip uses his arms, shoulders
and torso.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Hutchins the engineer comes in. The bucket of the
mono-ski comes in three sizes, but Hutchins spends about an hour
customizing the fit to a skier's body with padding and duct tape.
The bucket seat of the ski must be snug, like an able-bodied
skier's ski boot, so the skier's movements can be directly
translated to the ski. The seat rests on a shock absorber, which
has to be adjusted to the skier's weight so that as the skier hits
bumps on the slope, the ski stays in contact with the snow. Five
straps, from ankle to chest, hold the skier on the mono-ski. Double
amputees need only two straps.
</P>
<P>
   A mono-skier also holds poles, called outriggers, much the same
way able-bodied skiers do. The top of the outrigger has Velcro
straps and a handle, and the bottom has a ski tip that can flip up
to dig into the snow when the mono-skier needs to push off or hop
onto a chair lift. Ferrusi is able to get on and off chair lifts on
his own, and so skies totally independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love life, I follow my passions, I don't sit around,'' said
Ferrusi, who owns his own mono-ski (the ``Mobile Master''). He is a
veteran, and the Eastern Paralyzed Veteran's Association paid for
his mono-ski and helmet, and sponsors races. The mono-skis cost
about $3,000, and are made by about six manufacturers in the United
States and abroad. Outdoor sports are nothing new to Ferrusi. He
was injured in a mountaineering accident in 1979, and since then
has skied competitively and also does other sports. It took him two
years to feel comfortable in a mono-ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first start out, you wipe out really hard, and it's
hard on your body and your morale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton has had multiple sclerosis for 35 years. He was an avid
skier in his 20s, before he developed MS. ``I was a quadriplegic,''
he said, describing how little use of his arms and legs he had when
the MS was most serious. Through exercise and therapy he got
himself back on his feet. After getting married, having four sons,
and spending many years watching them ski, he learned about
adaptive skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchins has worked hard to adapt a pair of skis to suit Fenton.
Because one of his legs is shorter than the other, Hutchins canted
one ski, and as a result Fenton's skis stay flat on the snow when
he skis. Hutchins also struggled to help Fenton squeeze his left
foot, which has no feeling and little muscle mass, into his ski
boot. On the slopes, Hutchins assists Fenton off the lift by
simultaneously lifting Fenton's arm up and pushing his bad leg
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``His instruction and encouragement have been fantastic,''
Fenton said. ``There are times when I've come down the bunny slope
and he says, 'That's the best I've ever seen you do!' And I feel
perfectly safe with him. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenton has skied with one son, but his dream is to ski with his
whole family. ``That would really be a delight,'' he said. ``All I
need is one time.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean the world to me.''

WHERE HAIR AND RED TAPE TANGLE, BRAIDERS FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By VIOLET LAW  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diane Bailey mashed a sunflower petal into a dab of
mellow orange hair honey and gently massaged it into her client's
bushy black hair. Then she pinched a tiny strand, split it, and
looped some synthetic hair around it. Instinctively, her fingers
danced in and out of the three strands, kneading, twisting and
locking it into a fine braid.
</P>
<P>
   A diva crimp, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braiding is a grass-roots tradition in Africa passed on from
mother to daughter,'' explained Bailey, 42, the master braider at
Tendrils, the salon she owns in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter knows how to braid, too.'' She looked sidewise at
6-year-old Kai, a pint-sized girl sporting dreadlocks. ``She even
tried to braid the dog's hair,'' Kai's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Braiding is common in the Caribbean, too. Tracy Willacey, 27, a
fourth-grade teacher in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, grew
up in Jamaica and spent every Sunday at her mother's knee having
her hair braided into cornrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braids meant that your parents took care of you and took pride
in you,'' Willacey said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Willacey has her hair braided every few months, paying
from $75 to $100 for a session that might last as long as 10 hours.
When she requests that extensions be tied to her own hair, she pays
an additional amount, $30 or so.
</P>
<P>
   But now, this ancient tradition is being threatened by the
modern bureaucracy. In many states, hair-braiders like Bailey must
go through up to 1,600 hours of training in order to receive a
cosmetology license _ training that can cost as much as $5,000, and
covers perming, tinting and use of chemicals, all skills that
braiders say they have little need to know. In some states,
especially California, Ohio and Texas, the cosmetology boards have
cracked down on unlicensed braiders. To protest what they view as a
draconian requirement, some braiders have taken the cosmetology
boards to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you define 'culture' in a bureaucracy?'' asked JoAnne
Cornwell, a hair-braider and associate professor of Africana
Studies and French at the University of San Diego. She is one of
the plaintiffs in the California lawsuit. ``The cosmetology board
is antithetical to the whole idea of developing a cultural art form
which is a self-expression to a specific group of people,''
Cornwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nathan Barankin, spokesman for California's Department of
Justice, which represents the cosmetology board, said that culture
was not the issue. ``The Department of Consumer Affairs and the
Board of Barbering and Cosmetology are required under law to
enforce the law'' on hair-braiders, he said.

<P>
   With help from the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law
firm in Washington, D.C., and the American Hairbraider &AMP; Natural
Haircare Association, a trade group, braiders have won exemptions
from the licensing requirement in Washington, D.C., Maryland and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that hair braiding is a cultural art and we have the
right to do it,'' said Sheila Everette-Hale, a Detroit-based
hair-braider who sued the state and won.
</P>
<P>
   The tenacity of the braiders _ predominantly women of African
descent _ who fight state licensing requirements to practice their
traditional craft has been matched by the assertiveness of their
clients. Over the past few years, many of them have braved
criticism by appearing in conservative workplaces in intricately
woven twists and crimps. They say the braided hairstyles provide
not only relief from the Eurocentric standards of straight-haired
beauty, but also affirm their African heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braids are part of the African-American culture, and the '90s
is a celebratory period of the African American culture,'' said
Mikki Taylor, beauty and cover editor of Essence, a magazine for
black women.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that these women are embracing hair braiding as
an essential part of their heritage, they are also testing
outsiders' understanding of their indigenous culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of hairstyle goes around the status quo,'' said
Marilyn Houlberg, an art historian and anthropologist who for more
than three decades has studied the sociology of hair and done
extensive fieldwork on hair-braiding in Nigeria and Haiti. ``That's
why it is seen as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that need not be the case. In New York State, Bailey,
co-founder of the International Braiders' Network, another trade
association, worked with the state to design a curriculum to cover
relevant topics in braiding, such as sanitation and detection of
scalp diseases. As a result, the lawsuit against the New York State
cosmetology board was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Willacey, the fourth-grade teacher, says she is confident the
hair-braiders pose no danger. She says she washes her braids about
once every week or two weeks, and uses a blow dryer to speed the
drying process. ``Braiding my hair is the best thing ever. I wake
up in the morning and I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday afternoon at Tendrils, three clients
relaxed in armchairs, bowing slightly while hair-braiders wove each
strand of their hair into a braid. A few other clients were pacing
the salon, waiting for their turns. A full-scale braiding typically
takes from eight to 10 hours, and will last three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when hairdressers wielded hot combs to
forcibly straighten the kinky hair of African-American women. While
many still undergo the laborious ritual of brushing their curls and
coils and applying chemical relaxers, more and more are discovering
the benefits of wearing their hair natural _ adopting the kind of
braids and locks whose style best suits their hair texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just re-defining what is beautiful to us,'' Bailey said.
``Our African-ness is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair-braiding can be traced back thousands of years to the
Egyptians and the Nubians, according to Carla Brown, a
hair-braiding instructor at York College in Queens who has
conducted research in hair braiding. She said that on a pilgrimage
to Cairo she saw engravings of pharaohs in braids and locks.
Hiddekel Burks, a Chicago-based master braider whose mentor hails
from Liberia, observed that even in today's Africa different styles
of braids are still used to signify different occasions.
</P>
<P>
   At Tendrils, patron Carol Thomas, 42, examined a display of hair
products while taking a break from her six-hour braiding session.
She said she did not care how much training her braider had so long
as her hair was well groomed. Her hair was half done, with a
delicate microbraid sprouting up from each diamond-shaped patch of
hair on the lower half of her scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braided hair makes me feel proud. You don't feel that you have
to reinvent yourself,'' Thomas said. ``Just be natural.''

GIVING UP THE TV HABIT, COLD TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been called the ``idiot box,'' the ``boob
tube'' and a ``vast wasteland.'' On April 22, Esther Forrest is
calling it quits.
</P>
<P>
   As part of National TV-Turnoff Week, the elementary school
principal and her teachers at Public School 51 in the Bronx will
hand out signs for students to tape over the screens of their TV
sets. The signs are a reminder that the tube is off-limits for an
entire week. Seven whole days _ or 168 hours.
</P>
<P>
   If last year was any indication, it will be harder for some
people than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids tell me they really wanted to do it, but that
their parents couldn't handle a week without television,'' Forrest
said. But in the end, she said that nearly everyone who
participates in the voluntary program learns something. Parents
reported that their children actually played together. Some picked
up books. Others ventured outside.
</P>
<P>
   The students and parents of P.S. 51 in the Bronx were among the
5 million who took part in last year's TV-Turnoff. And organizers
for this year's event estimate that children at 45,000 schools
across the country will again swear off their favorite cartoons,
movies and video games for the fifth annual TV-Turnoff Week, to be
held April 22-28.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks switching off the television for a week
is such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was boring,'' complained Leah Gonzalez, 8, of last year's
TV moratorium. ``I couldn't watch even one cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmate Andres Marin, 8, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me an opportunity to do something else,'' the
third-grader said. ``I listened to the radio, and I played with my
toys, and I went outside. If you give it a chance, it's not so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was boring,'' Gonzalez repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Hatmaker of the National Cable Television Association
sides with Gonzalez. Hatmaker argues that it is more important for
children to understand the media than to learn to live without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While parents should turn off the TV at times, we believe
there's a better and more constructive alternative than arbitrarily
turning off the set for an entire week: it's called critical
viewing,'' Hatmaker said. ``It's important to learn how to watch TV
as well as to make smart decisions about what and when to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatmaker recommends that parents talk to their children about
what they see on television and discuss the ways in which
television can be used to manipulate viewers.
</P>
<P>
   If they are like most parents, they will have plenty of
TV-watching experience to draw upon. TV-Turnoff Week founder Henry
Labalme said that the average American will have watched nearly
nine years of TV by age 65, on average of four hours a day. But the
Turnoff is designed to do more than force schoolchildren _ and
their suffering parents _ to stare at the wall when they could be
watching ``Seinfeld'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a huge decline in civic engagement in the last 25
years,'' Labalme said. ``Whenever people are home watching
television, they're not involved in their community. They're not at
the Kiwanis club or the Girl Scout meeting. They're not sitting on
the front porch, watching the neighbor's kids. When people give up
television for a week, they let the silence creep back into their
lives and they realize what's missing.''
</P>
<P>
   For some people, living without the television is already a way
of life. But those people are outnumbered 50-to-1 in America, so
they are often misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people find out I don't have a television, they look at
me like I stockpile weapons in my backyard,'' said Kate Alley, 26,
a manager for Bell Atlantic in Manhattan who has been TV-free for
almost four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I don't have a television, I get a lot more done,'' Alley
said. ``There's so little to be gained by watching TV. There's a
limited number of hours in a day, and I don't like to waste my time
as a passive participant where I sit and learn nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   TV-Turnoff participants take note: while other people are
watching ``World's Scariest Police Chases,'' Alley reads, goes for
walks, and keeps in touch with friends. When she needs to zone out,
she will look at magazines or listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is primarily a comfort food,'' said TV critic David
Wild, a senior editor at Rolling Stone. ``Certainly there are
people who become television gourmets. They're the kinds that watch
``Masterpiece Theater'' or the Discovery Channel. But these people
are always going to be the minority. The rest of us just use it to
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one person leading the monastic TV-free life
who is ready to give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was addicted,'' said Mark Lyons, 41, of his old television
habit. ``In fact, I'm still addicted. When I visit my parents, I
still have to be very careful to stay away from the television.
Otherwise, I'll sit there with the clicker all day and zone out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons, an assistant director of an advocacy group in
Washington, D.C., suspects the lack of a television has hurt his
social life. Lately, he has been pricing out a high-end system to
replace the 12-inch black and white set that was gathering dust in
the back of his closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking in the Sunday papers, where they have all
the ads for the sales at electronics stores, and I drool over the
27-inch Sony television sets and the state-of-the-art laserdisc
movie players,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know my fascination with television can get out of
control,'' he said. ``When I get this thing, you may never hear
from me again.''

TEMPERATURE PILL COULD SAVE FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By DOUGLAS STEINKE  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Glenn has been on the pill. So have some
firefighters and deep sea divers.
</P>
<P>
   This pill is not a contraceptive, Prozac or even Viagra.
Researchers have been testing this product to prevent heat
exhaustion in firefighters. The three-quarter-inch capsule monitors
body temperatures of those who work in extreme environments.
</P>
<P>
   Each CorTemp capsule contains a battery, a temperature sensor
and a transmitter that sends a signal to a computer monitor. The
capsules are produced by scientists at Human Technologies Inc., or
HTI, in St. Petersburg, Fla. They have been used almost exclusively
by NASA and in clinical tests so far.
</P>
<P>
   But the company hopes to start selling the pill to fire
departments in June, HTI spokeswoman Lindy Brounley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we would go to several of the firefighter conventions
and demonstrate the product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters can collapse or die from heat exhaustion,
especially in warmer climates. In Southern California, a
firefighter recently died from the condition while fighting a fire
in the woods, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Dennis Childress
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all carry water around with us all day and it's a big deal
for us to stay hydrated when we're out there,'' said Childress, who
also heads the health and safety committee of the California State
Firefighters Association. ``I wouldn't say we see a lot of heat
stroke, but we do see an awful lot of heat exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by excessive fluid loss, and heat
stroke is caused by the failure of cooling processes, such as
sweating. Heat exhaustion can often be treated by lying down in a
cool place and drinking water or fruit juice, but heat stroke
requires immediate hospitalization and can be fatal. Anyone can
suffer from the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Childress had not yet heard about CorTemp, which HTI calls the
``ingestible thermometer,'' effective for about three days. ``I
could definitely see it having an application,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, heat exhaustion is a serious issue, said Lt.
Kevin Malley, the fire department's director of human performance.
Malley himself suffered from the condition in 1987 while putting
out a fire in Harlem. Today his picture appears on a poster that
tells firefighters how to avoid heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just put out a fire and then you're out on the ground,''
he said. ``If you get out and live then you can laugh about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under New York's one-bottle rule, firefighters are allowed to
work until their first bottle of air is empty. This prevents them
from working in hot temperatures for more than 30 to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Malley said the New York Fire Department was doing pilot tests
with a number of different products designed to prevent heat
exhaustion. But, he said, ``We haven't ordered anything yet.'' He
would not say whether the department would consider using CorTemp.
</P>
<P>
   HTI bought the product's license in 1988 and started selling a
modified version to paper manufacturing companies, which mount the
device on machines to make sure the rolls of paper do not overheat.
Since 1989, the company has sold 15,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original use for the CorTemp product_ selling it to the
government_ was not profitable at all,'' said HTI President Bill
Hicks, adding that they are exploring other applications, perhaps
in the food industry.
</P>
<P>
   At $40 a pill and $2,500 for the monitors that display the
pill's signal, fire departments may not be able to afford the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd imagine the product would have to be significantly proven
before fire departments start putting aside that sort of money for
it,'' said Childress of the Orange County Fire Authority. ``It's
something that would really have to be worked in, because the
profession is very tradition-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   HTI's Brounley said the pill's price could fall to $12 each if
the company decides to mass-produce it. Currently, scientists must
use a microscope to make each pill in order to see its tiny
circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   Even at $40 a piece the pill may be useful to some fire
departments, said Jerry Knight, a former chief of the St.
Petersburg, Fla. fire department hired by HTI as a marketing
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't really be for the routine, day-to-day
firefighter,'' said Knight, who retired from the fire department in
1986. ``Where I believe it would be appropriate is with the
hazardous material teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters with those teams, Knight said, wear suits that
prevent perspiration and retain heat. Even when those firefighters
are not near a fire, their chances of suffering from heat
exhaustion are higher than usual when wearing the heavy clothing,
especially in the warmer, Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn White, a scientist and research coordinator for emergency
medicine at the Akron General Medical Center in Ohio, has conducted
three studies using the CorTemp pill.
</P>
<P>
   In one of her studies, which is published in an emergency
medicine journal, White found that the body temperature of
firefighters who were working in hazardous material suits in a
training session increased by nearly one and one-half degrees. An
increase of two degrees is considered dangerous, she said, noting
that firefighters would face higher temperatures in fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get really hot in those puppies really fast,'' she said,
referring to the hazardous material suits.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 to $40 dollars for the CorTemp pill isn't unreasonable,
White said, ``if you're saving someone's life.''

IT'S A NO-WIN SITUATION FOR CELTICS
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-CELTICS-PACERS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL HOLLEY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You could have reshuffled it, remixed it, revised it,
and even replayed it. Nothing would have changed the final result
of Pacers-Celtics Monday night at the FleetCenter. Really, there
was nothing complicated about it.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a one-sentence summary? Try this one: The Pacers had
the right men in uniforms while the Celtics had the wrong men in
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Or this: The Pacers' major injury was to Sleepy Sam Perkins,
while the Celtics were missing Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson, and
Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of that inevitably led to this: A 120-104 Pacers
win, their 27th of the season, before 18,352.
</P>
<P>
   It would be surprising if anyone left the building shaking their
heads, wondering where it all went wrong for the Celtics. That's
because the problems were obvious. In this case, it had very little
to do with words and phrases such as ``rebounding,'' ``transition
defense,'' and ``defensive rotations.'' The updated Celtics
glossary includes words such as ``sprain,'' ``pull,'' ``spasm'' and
``underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The last entry is necessary because the Celtics probably will
not be favored to win for the rest of the season, especially if
Walker is out for the year, as Rick Pitino believes. And then there
are the back and leg injuries for Mercer and Anderson,
respectively, injuries that may keep them out until at least the
end of the week. If that weren't enough, Dana Barros may be out,
too, after suffering a groin injury Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of that, the Celtics did the ``Hoosiers'' thing for
the first half. They trailed by 4, the most entertaining halftime
deficit they've had this year. It's not often that you can see a
68-64 halftime count in today's NBA, especially when you consider
that it was just over a week ago that the Celtics scored 67 points
in an entire game. But that dose of the NBA's golden age _
generally recognized as the 1980s _ wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the situation we were in, we played very well,'' Pitino
said. ``It's just that they're a much better basketball team. We
played them tough, but we ran out of players and gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce was one of the available players. He sat for a total
of four minutes. When he wasn't sitting, he was resetting his
career highs in points (30) and assists (6). He also had 12
rebounds. When the Celtics weren't looking to him, they went to
Vitaly Potapenko. The center promptly made Rik Smits look like an
inexperienced summer camper. Potapenko had 26 points and 16
rebounds and got Smits (4 points, four rebounds) into foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to keep most fans in their very expensive seats
beyond the third quarter, when the Pacers took control. It was even
enough to inspire Pitino to say, ``Having all these injuries is a
major plus for our basketball team'' because it allows players a
chance to see what Potapenko can do on offense. But there wasn't
enough talk and hope that would translate into a win.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had their own fashion catwalk going at the end of
the bench, reminiscent of the Lost Celtics of 1996-97. Walker,
crutches by his side, still found time to talk trash with Jalen
Rose. Mercer tried to keep his back loose and Anderson stretched
out his right hamstring. On the court, the Celtics tried to run
with the older Pacers, but even that didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of works to our favor,'' Reggie Miller said of the
tempo, ``because we can spread out the floor and we've got a lot of
good shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   Based purely on the numbers, Miller is correct. He led seven
double-figure scorers with 23 points. Chris Mullin had 21, Dale
Davis had a double-double (10 points, 12 boards), and Antonio Davis
had 17 off the bench for Larry Bird, who is now 7-0 against his
former team. After the game, Pierce was asked if he thought the
Pacers were the best team the Celtics have played. He paused for
about two seconds and said yes. Potapenko was asked about the
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice but to play,'' he said. ``No one else
is going to play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans in the arena seemed to sense that attitude from the
hustling Celtics and jumped behind them. The building was a
different place (i.e. no boos). And those NBA fans watching the
telecast via TNT were probably impressed with the Boston effort.
But there was never any suspense about the winner and the loser. If
the Celtics' injuries linger, that most likely will be the case for
the rest of the season.

CHILDREN AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might have been a scene from a family photo album. Wendy
Lonergan-Gillen's year-old daughter and preschool son were curled
up on the couch watching a video of their favorite lullabies. They
had just finished eating dinner with their parents and were
settling down before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   But what was going on in the family's suburban home that evening
in May 1995 was far from a portrait of domestic tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, within earshot of the children, the children's father
was beating their mother, holding her by the neck and pounding her
head into the top step.
</P>
<P>
   During the beating, which lasted several minutes, the
30-year-old mother was praying that the sweet lullabies downstairs
would distract the children and drown out the growing perversion of
their family's home life. Lonergan-Gillen, a waitress, had spent
most of her six-year marriage trying to diffuse her husband's anger
and violent outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to tell myself that (the children) were too young . . .
they were asleep, they couldn't hear it,'' she said. ``It was
easier to say all that. None of us wants to think our children are
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   While parents and others might think that children are not
seriously hurt by domestic violence unless they are physically
injured, researchers have arrived at a far different conclusion:
Children who see or even hear a parent being battered by someone
they love are as traumatized as children who themselves are beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole sea change emerging, looking at the
horrendous impact of trauma on children,'' said Dr. Bessel van der
Kolk, medical director of The Trauma Center in Brookline, Mass.,
who since the 1980s has studied post-traumatic stress disorder in
children. ``Resiliency is wishful thinking. It is emotionally too
hard to deal with the stories we hear from kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings are beginning to change the thinking of children's
advocates and those who work with battered mothers. What is
emerging is a growing sense of urgency that the needs of children
who witness violence must be addressed separately from those of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. There are about 43,000 Massachusetts
children who see violence at home every year, from shoving to
bloody beatings. Beyond those numbers, thousands of other domestic
incidents go unreported, and many of those are probably witnessed
by children.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the needs of youngsters who have witnessed violence will
not be easy. They often exhibit troubling behaviors, such as
tantrums, night terrors, bed-wetting, abuse of their mothers, and
talk of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The movement against domestic violence has long stood for
protecting and empowering women, but some advocates for battered
women acknowledge that the movement has done little more than offer
baby-sitting for their children. But specialists say the advocates
can no longer expect battered mothers alone to help their
youngsters cope with the sight, sounds, and aftermath of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very encouraging now to see the movement supporting
children and supporting women as parents, and recognizing the
vulnerability of families in the aftermath'' of violence, said
Carrie Pekor Jasper, director of Project We Can Talk About It, a
domestic violence clinic at the Children's Charter Program in
Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Like Children's Charter, The Child Witness to Violence Project
at Boston Medical Center is one of only a few centers in
Massachusetts that specialize in treating children who have
witnessed domestic violence. The project began in 1992 to help
youngsters cope with street violence, but within months, it changed
course as referrals for domestic violence streamed in.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the clinic has been a pioneer in developing methods
to help these children. Some of its approaches include play
therapy, drawing, and one-on-one counseling. Lonergan-Gillen's
children, who have not seen or heard from their father in almost
two years, are receiving therapy through the project.
</P>
<P>
   Still, efforts to help the children of domestic violence are
largely in the planning stages, and professionals say there is an
overwhelming shortage of specialized care. The scarcity is
particularly striking in light of a reported increase in domestic
violence in many cities even as overall rates of violent crime have
gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do offer effective help generally are experienced in
domestic violence work. ``One of the biggest dangers is when
clinicians don't understand the impact of domestic violence, and do
things like require the family and the batterer to meet together to
reconcile,'' said Nalina Narain, a senior policy analyst with Jane
Doe Inc., a Massachusetts coalition for battered women. ``When
there is battering, you just can't resolve a power relationship
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other miscues, as well. ``The common belief is
that if women leave, then everything will be OK,'' said Betsy
McAlister Groves, director of the Child Witness to Violence
Project, which sees about 125 families a year. ``But what we see is
that children's symptoms are quite persistent, and that they are
affected for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered women's shelters, the first line of defense for
troubled families, took in almost 2,000 youngsters last year, and
at least 28 of the state's 32 shelters now have child advocates, as
well as support groups for children, Narain said.
</P>
<P>
   The push to pay more attention to children has spilled over to
other arenas. Since last year, for example, judges have been
required to consider, in writing, the effects of domestic violence
when deciding custody cases and visitation issues. And, starting
this summer, the Massachusetts Department of Social Services is
slated to spend $630,000 on services for children affected by
domestic violence. Such children make up more than 60 percent of
its caseload.
</P>
<P>
   As awareness of the issue grows, schools and pediatric offices
might also play a more important role in identifying symptoms of
domestic trauma. In the past, these symptoms often went
unrecognized or were mistaken for other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Kolk, Narain, and others, for example, suspect a link
between the skyrocketing diagnoses of attention deficit disorder
and hyperactivity, and the apparent inability of many child
development specialists, teachers, and other professionals to
recognize post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Kolk's other findings about trauma in children suggest
there might be biological implications as well. ``Kids' biology
actually changes by witnessing (violence), by being terrified, and
having no one to calm them down. Kids can't do that themselves.
They totally rely on their caregivers for that. If it doesn't
happen, you get alterations in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issues are emotional or biological, the pain is
indisputable. Maria, a mother of three, was stalked, burned, cut,
and punched over several months by an ex-boyfriend _ horror that
was witnessed by her 5-year-old son. The child was overcome by
fear.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at her home, she said her decision
``not to share her private business'' ended when her son's
preschool teachers called her in for an emergency meeting last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told (the teachers) he didn't want to go home. He brought a
knife to school and told them, `I will kill myself. Mama is going
to die,' '' said Maria, 25, who asked that her real name not be
used. Her son was hospitalized for 10 days in December 1996, and
has been in therapy at Child Witness to Violence since January
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Maria's daughter, age 6, does not say much about what she saw
and heard, but Maria said she has been warned that signs of trauma,
such as acting out, could appear. As for her youngest son, now 2,
whom she had with her abusive boyfriend, Maria is unsure what to
expect. An infant, he was lying in his bassinet in her bedroom the
first time his father punched her. The baby was a late walker, slow
speaker, and still shrieks or fusses when she leaves his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they heard it,'' Maria said. ``I thought they
were heavy sleepers. But I never thought things would reach the
level of violence they did. I kept thinking it would stop.''

IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO COOL GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOE MIRABILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Bay area is one the regions of
the United States threatened by a rise in sea level from global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   So says the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental
think tank in Cambridge, Mass. How will the Bay area be affected
if, as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
says could happen, the sea level rises by as much as 3 feet?
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Oakland, Calif.-based research group
Pacific Institute, business and residential structures near the
shores of San Francisco Bay, valued at an estimated $48 billion,
will be threatened by a 3-foot rise in the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   This group estimates the costs of protecting these buildings
will be about $1 billion. Add another $1 billion to protect or
restore wetlands and to build protective structures and buy
equipment such as pumps, drainage systems and navigation locks.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance costs would run $100 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   A rising sea level also means a threat of saltwater incursion
into the Bay and rivers. In December 1997, the National
Environmental Trust, a Washington-based advocacy group, warned of
saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels miles into the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, from which two-thirds of the
population of California derives its fresh water. California cannot
afford to have its principal water supply threatened, especially
since the state's population (currently 33 million) is expected to
almost double by 2040.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ellen Mosley-Thompson of Ohio State University, a
glacier specialist, the rising sea level will be primarily due to
glacial and ice cap melting and the expansion of warming seas.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples are:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Southern Peru the rate of melting of the Qori Kalis glacier
from 1983 to 1991 was three times the pace of the previous 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ If present rates of warming continue, all glaciers in Glacier
National Park will be gone by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lewis Glacier on Mount Kenya has decreased in size by 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Ruwenzori range of mountains in Uganda, glaciers are in
severe meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bering Glacier, North America's largest glacier located in
Alaska, is retreating rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new wrinkle. Recent findings of severe thinning at
the southern and eastern edges of Greenland's ice sheet surprised
scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   If the melting on Greenland's icy borders continues, glaciers
won't be the sole contributors to rising sea levels. And if both
ice sheets start to go, meaning Greenland and Antarctica, it's a
new ballgame. A 3-foot sea-level rise will only be the start.
</P>
<P>
   Now add China to the mix. In December 1996, Bill Nitze, the
assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
noted that China, before 2050, may be producing as much carbon as
the entire world is producing now (more than 6 billion tons of
carbon annually).
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to get the Kyoto Protocol ratified by the U.S.
Senate. The Kyoto Protocol requires that industrialized countries
cut carbon emissions by the year 2012. While awaiting the
ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, this country and other
industrialized countries should be making plans for a general
mobilization to convert to green technologies to produce
electricity and to manufacture vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming is upon us, but we have the know-how to stop it.

AGENCIES SPLIT ON `DATE-RAPE' DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROSSE ILE, Mich. _ For 15-year-old Samantha Reid, it was a dose
of death, a poison allegedly delivered to her in the false
innocence of a fizzy drink.
</P>
<P>
   For 55-year-old Bob Cloud, it is daily salvation, a drinkable
solution to an ailment that threatens his livelihood and, at times,
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's killer and Cloud's savior is a drug known as GHB, a
chemical chameleon that has gained notoriety as a deadly
``date-rape'' drug, while also showing promise as a treatment for
the debilitating sleep disorder narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Those contrasting uses have resulted in a paralyzing faceoff
between two federal agencies over how quickly and how strictly to
control the drug, most commonly found as an odorless, colorless
liquid that depresses the central nervous system. Rapists use the
drug to render their victims unconscious. With narcoleptics, for
reasons of body chemistry that are still being studied, it seems to
have the opposite physical effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration is seeking fast action and
the toughest controls on GHB, hoping to classify it along with
heroin and LSD as a drug without any redeeming medical value,
carrying with it the heaviest possible penalties for manufacture,
distribution, and possession.
</P>
<P>
   But the Food and Drug Administration, eager to explore its value
to narcoleptics like Cloud, is still reviewing the drug. It is
expected to recommend a much less stringent control level for
illicit use, which would allow continued examination for beneficial
treatments. The FDA already has approved GHB for several drug
studies, effectively blocking the DEA from immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has entered the fray as well, with two pending bills
that reflect the competing interests. One seeks the strictest
federal limits on GHB, citing its reported involvement in at least
32 deaths since 1995 and dozens of alleged sexual assaults. The
other puts a priority on helping perhaps 100,000 people who suffer
from the worst symptoms of narcolepsy, specifically a condition
called cataplexy that causes sudden collapses in potentially
dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides have a point, but right now we're doing nothing to
close this loophole and regulate this drug on a federal level. I am
anxious to see some action, not only as a member of Congress, but
as a dad,'' said Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican
who, as chairman of a House Commerce subcommittee, convened a
hearing on the drug last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of federal action, states have passed a patchwork
quilt of laws and regulations. At least 20 states have outlawed GHB
largely because of its role in date rapes, but they have adopted a
wide range of approaches. Massachusetts has placed GHB in its most
dangerous illicit drug category, while Tennessee, for instance,
treats it as the equivalent of more benign drugs like Valium.
</P>
<P>
   Adding urgency to calls for a national approach is the fact that
several Internet sites promote GHB as a muscle builder, sexual
booster, sleep aid, age-fighter, and antidepressant. Several
Internet sites also offer a recipe for kitchen-sink chemists to
transform a related substance called GBL (gamma butyrolactone) into
GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate).
</P>
<P>
   Until the FDA issued a warning earlier this year, products
containing GBL were sold since the late 1980s at health food stores
nationwide as dietary supplements. Although those products are
supposed to be off the market, GBL can still be ordered via the
Internet, ostensibly for use as an industrial solvent.
</P>
<P>
   While federal agencies and lawmakers struggle with how best to
respond, the subtleties of the debate are lost on Judith Clark,
Samantha Reid's grieving mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think date-rape drugs like GHB should be in a class by
themselves, the highest possible class,'' Clark said in an
interview. ``With cocaine, marijuana, whatever, you have to want to
take those drugs. These can be slipped to you without you even
knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is just what authorities say happened to Clark's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, Reid and two other 15-year-old girls decided to test
the limits of their weekend curfews. They accompanied four young
men to an apartment on Grosse Ile, an affluent bedroom community 20
miles from Detroit that prides itself on its three golf courses and
three yacht clubs. With 14,000 residents and a nearly nonexistent
crime rate, Grosse Ile bills itself as ``Michigan's Safest
Community.''
</P>
<P>
   As midnight passed and the girls watched videos, police and
prosecutors say, their hosts mixed a potion of Mountain Dew, orange
juice, and a secret ingredient, either GHB or GBL.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Reid was dead from an apparent overdose,
authorities said. Her best friend, Melanie Sindone, fell into a
coma but later recovered. The third girl also drank the concoction
but was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four young men _ one 17, two 18, and one 25 _ has
been charged with three counts of poisoning and one count of
manslaughter. They face up to life in prison if convicted at a
trial expected to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Grosse Ile police Detective John Szczepaniak, who is overseeing
the case, said the men did not obtain the drug through the
Internet, but he declined to elaborate on the alleged source.
Attorneys for the men declined to comment other than to say their
clients are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, sitting outside a court hearing on pretrial
motions, Clark sat quietly, cradling a photo of her daughter. It
showed a brown-haired girl in a freshman basketball uniform, a
broad smile creasing her face. She was a fine athlete, played
trumpet, wrote poetry, and took special pleasure in watching old
couples who seemed to be in love, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray her death isn't made meaningless. I'm going to do what
I can to help get the drug banned for good,'' said Clark, a single
mother who also has an 18-year-old son. ``I know they talk about
using it for narcolepsy, but I think that's just a copout for the
big pharmaceutical businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 miles away, in Cincinnati, Bob Cloud has nothing but
sympathy for Reid's family. But he fears how he and fellow
narcoleptics would be affected if lawmakers and federal agencies
reacted emotionally to Reid's death and the deaths of others who
ingested GHB or GBL, some of them in search of an illicit high, and
some unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
   Although it can be used to put people to sleep, GHB _ under
controlled circumstances and doses _ appears to have something of
an opposite effect on narcoleptics, limiting the cataplexy episodes
that result from sudden surges of emotion, including surprise,
anger, and even happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Before he started taking GHB more than 16 years ago as part of
one of the earliest scientific studies, Cloud said, he suffered
potentially deadly bouts of cataplexy in which his muscles would be
temporarily paralyzed. He fell off docks into the water on several
occasions. One time, Cloud said, he fell down a department store
escalator, then lay motionless at the bottom as the moving stairs
hit his head over and over until someone pulled him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this drug, I live a relatively normal life,'' said
Cloud, a lawyer who has been married for 26 years and is the father
of two grown children. ``I am sure that without it, I would be on
disability. Or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of GHB as a narcolepsy treatment _ the only legal way to
obtain it is through clinical studies _ is being investigated by a
small Minnesota drug company called Orphan Medical, which calls its
product Xyrem. If GHB were classified as one of the highest two
levels under the federal Controlled Substances Act, as proposed by
the DEA, Orphan Medical would be forced to abandon its research,
said Vice President Patti Engel.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs, such as Ritalin, have been successfully marketed as
medicine despite having one of those illicit drug classifications.
But Engel said the potential market for narcolepsy drugs is so
small it would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirements around the manufacture, storage and
distribution (of drugs under those classifications) are so
extremenly onerous we could never afford to develop it, nor could
patients who need it ever afford to purchase it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Engel said one possible approach by federal authorities would be
a compromise under which GHB and related drugs like GBL would
receive a moderate classification for the purposes of research, but
carry the toughest possible penalties when used for illicit
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Reuter, associate FDA director for domestic and
international drug control, last week declined to say how long it
would take for the agency to decide how it wants GHB classified for
illegal use, saying only it would take a ``delicate balancing act''
between public health and public safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Clark said she will continue to press for a complete
ban on the drug, while Cloud will work to keep it available for
narcoleptics like himself. ``I wish they would recognize this is
our only hope for health,'' Cloud said. ``People can overdose and
kill themselves on aspirin, but we don't do away with it.''

COURT TO WEIGH MONEY'S ROLE IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After serving 22 years in the Georgia House of
Representatives, John White felt he had a strong chance to win a
state Senate seat in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed name recognition as the first black legislator to
represent southwest Georgia since Reconstruction and commanded a
loyal following among voters across the red clay farmlands of the
region. What White lacked was money.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent, Mark Taylor, spent $17 for every dollar White
produced. Using $90,000 of his own money to help finance a $270,000
campaign, Taylor blanketed the nine-county district with billboards
and television commercials. White raised only $16,000 from friends,
black social clubs and a few white supporters and relied on
hand-shaking to convey his message.
</P>
<P>
   White lost, yet in a way the battle continues. The election
became the genesis for a lawsuit designed to force public campaign
financing on Georgia, and after nearly two years of setbacks and
delays, White's allies who adopted his case will get a hearing next
month before a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit of the US
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the case could have national ramifications by
opening the increasingly costly political process to candidates
with little money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that private funding of campaigns systematically
excludes people of modest means,'' said Gregory Luke, an attorney
with the Boston-based National Voting Rights Institute. ``It's a
common theme around the country: People without a lot of money
can't participate in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress set up public financing for presidential
campaigns more than two decades ago, only four states,
Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont and Arizona, have taken steps to
provide funds for contests on the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The Voting Rights Institute, founded in 1994 and funded by
foundations, is handling the litigation for the Georgia NAACP,
which sought help following White's loss in a campaign that
involved racial overtones as well as lavish spending.
</P>
<P>
   White, in an interview, said he decided in 1995 that Taylor
``was not going to go back to the Senate without a challenge''
after Taylor served as the ``architect'' for a reapportionment plan
that White considered unfair. ``He reduced the black population in
our congressional district,'' White said, in an unsuccessful effort
to oust Representative Sanford Bishop, one of three black members
of Congress from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Although blacks account for about half of the population in the
state Senate district that extends from the city of Albany to the
Alabama border, ``Taylor swamped us with money,'' White said.
Taylor won, drawing 58 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, elected lieutenant governor last fall, did not respond
to a request to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, filed in August 1997, the plaintiffs invoke the
``equal protection'' provisions of the 14th Amendment and attack
what they describe as a ``wealth primary'' in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia sanctions and exacerbates the exclusionary operation
of wealth in state elections,'' the suit charges, noting that
expensive ``multimedia advertising has replaced traditional forums
of public debate,'' forcing candidates to amass tens of thousands
of dollars to buy TV and radio time.
</P>
<P>
   Citing statistics that show that victors in recent Georgia
Senate races raised an average of $56,530 and outspent the losing
candidates, the NAACP suit argues that ``access to wealth has
become a precondition of participation in electoral politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke, who will argue the case here May 18, said it is possible
for the plaintiffs to succeed without reversing the Supreme Court's
1976 landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo, which upheld the First
Amendment rights of a candidate to spend personal funds without
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't prevent Mark Taylor from doing anything,'' Luke said,
``but we can allow people of modest means to mount viable
campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeking to limit personal expenditures, the suit
suggests several court-ordered remedies _ ranging from state-issued
media vouchers to public funding _ ``to permit candidates to run a
competitive state Senate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn L. Allen, senior assistant attorney general, will
represent the state. ``The state didn't cause the disparity''
between rich and poor candidates ``and did nothing to promote it,''
she says. ``You can't prove it's the state's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature chooses to subsidize campaigns with public
funds, Allen said, ``they should be allowed to do so. But it should
not be mandated by the federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was dismissed without a hearing by a US District Court
judge last year, but the plaintiffs won a victory last month when
the 11th Circuit agreed to hear their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Founding Fathers tried to strike a balance'' when they
developed voting rights 200 years ago, said Luke. ``But so much has
changed in the last 20 years with the professionalism of politics''
and the high cost of consultants and TV time.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the system is changed, he said, politics will become an
exclusive preserve for the wealthy.

<P>
   Once he gets to know you a bit, David Breashears will begin to
reveal the bits and pieces of his unusual life, from a childhood
darkened by a violent father to his ambivalence about the
forbidding mountain to which his name has become tightly linked. He
will talk about growing up scrawny yet becoming a legendary scaler
of rock faces and icefalls. About a nomadic and relentless work
style that saw him log some 200,000 air miles last year alone. And
about summiting Mount Everest four times, the third in 1996, while
making a remarkable large-format IMAX movie and unexpectedly
finding himself witness to a stormy tragedy during which eight
climbers perished.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting in a noisy Boston restaurant recently, precisely
dissecting his toasted bagel with chive cheese and tomatoes, the
43-year-old climber-cum-filmmaker is reduced to quoting Yogi Berra
in self-summation. Breashears carefully folds his narrow hands and
leans across the small table. His metallic-blue eyes peer straight
ahead. ``When you come to a fork in the road,'' he declares evenly,
``take it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has. Frequently. Next month, Breashears will embark on
an 18-city tour to promote ``High Exposure,'' an autobiography that
chonicles his diverse climbing life. (The book was aided in no
small measure by Jeff Long, a Colorado outdoor writer.) Once
something of a young cult figure among the rock-climbing dudes of
the Rockies, Breashears later became the first American to twice
summit Everest and the first person to transmit live images from
the mountain's 29,028-foot peak. He has made an assortment of
documentaries and won four Emmy awards. These days he is earnestly
working to aid the Nepalese Sherpas who make Himalayan
mountaineering possible, while planning another IMAX movie, this
one about Mount Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that last month, a poster advertising his slide
presentation at the University of New Hampshire, for which he was
paid $8,500, according to one of the organizers, touted him as
``world famous.'' And oh yes: People magazine crowned Breashears _
something of a Tony Perkins circa-1975 look-alike _ the ``sexiest
explorer'' of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A celebrity, right? ``You're doomed when you start to believe
that stuff,'' says Breashears, whose 5-foot-10, 160-pound frame
does not suggest world-class physical feats. ``Besides, people
aren't interested in me. They're interested in the experiences I
give them in my films. I'm just a window. A portal.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect any appearances on ``Hollywood Squares,'' or any
of the other trappings that often accompany fame. ``I don't think
he knows how to cash in on it,'' says his friend David Fanning,
senior executive producer of the PBS television program
``Frontline.'' ``He hasn't made much money because he doesn't know
how to sell himself.'' Breashears keeps a small office in the
Victorian manse that belongs to a friend in Newton, Mass., uses a
modest Boston apartment as a sort of base camp, and lives nearby
with his girlfriend, ``Nova'' TV producer Liesl Clark. He has no
agent and no publicist. Why? ``It's just such a bizarre thought,''
he answers, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has public acclaim altered his unwillingness to buy into the
American dream. As in: purchase a house, settle down, etc.
Sometimes he'll actually talk about buying a first home, but the
conversations don't last long. ``It creates anxiety in me,'' he
says. ``I have the means to do it, but it would mean giving up my
vagabond nature. And it just hasn't mattered. If it mattered, I'd
do it. I'll get to that point someday. But right now my work is my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. When Breashears was about 10 years old,
his father, a demanding Army officer, became increasingly violent
and eventually abandoned him, his mother, and his three siblings.
It is a dark chapter with which he has since wrestled, and one that
he feels helps explain why he does what he does. ``I've chosen a
life of climbing, a life of running away from commitment and
stability,'' he says. ``When your world falls apart like that _
when someone you're supposed to admire becomes someone you fear _
it can lead to a life in which it's hard to make attachments.''
</P>
<P>
   Close relationships have suffered. The foremost casualty was his
four-year marriage to Veronique Choa, now a Virginia-based graphic
designer, whom he met at the foot of Everest in 1986. Breashears
was away working during much of the marriage _ a documentary film
on Tibet here, a movie about Peruvian mummies there _ and he wasn't
eager to carve out a real partnership when he was ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To talk about large subjects freaked him out,'' says Choa, who
considers her former husband a good friend. ``These were subjects
like, `Where are we going to live?' and `Are we going to have a
family?' It put a lot of stress on him to think about those things.
He avoided talking about them. . . . I wanted a life, and a life
with him. I wanted to share experiences. I did not thrive alone. I
was unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Large mountains, small world: Choa is now married to America On
Line president and chief operating officer Robert Pittman, who was
formerly married to Sandy Hill, a socialite/climber who was part of
the 1996 calamity on Everest and who earlier climbed the mountain
with Breashears.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked to choose some words to describe Breashears, Choa selects
``neat,'' ``meticulous,'' and ``precise.'' ``He should have been a
surgeon,'' she muses. Others who know him well offer these
descriptions: iconoclastic, focused, prickly, thoughtful,
controlling, curious, disciplined, self-reliant, careful,
practical, impatient, efficient. In the end, one word _ driven _ is
mentioned more than the others, and Breashears does not disagree
with it. ``This is not a calm soul,'' he confesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the boy who is going to prove himself to his father,''
offers Fanning. ``He is going to climb his way out of the
unhappiness of his childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the boy who takes no project lightly, especially if
it involves unforgiving places. This is no risk taker, despite his
chosen profession. He knows that the finish line of any climb is at
the bottom, not on the top. Indeed, in 1994 Breashears turned back
his Everest party of five climbers and four Sherpas at 24,400 feet
because he didn't like the snow conditions ahead. Even when he
reaches the summit, he wants to do it on his own careful terms.
``He'll never put himself in harm's way,'' says his mother, Ruth
Breashears, who lives in Denver. ``He listens to the mountain.''

THRILLS, CHILLS, AND SPILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do (newspaper columnists) use frisson to mean `hint' or
`inkling' about three times per 600-word column _ or is it just in
New York, especially the bigger daily newspaper there?'' grumbles
Bill Earls of Middletown, Conn. ``A terrible word, terribly
overused. Next to it, famously'' _ another '90s vogue word _
``looks discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a bit hard on frisson, which can spice up prose nicely,
used in moderation. However, frisson doesn't mean ``inkling,''
though Earls may have seen such a misusage: Not long ago, a New
York Times reviewer wrote ``Lansky goes his calculating way with
never a frisson of threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But a frisson _ French for ``shiver'' or ``thrill'' _ is not the
hint or inkling, but the shudder of anticipation aroused by the
hint; not what Meyer Lansky did or didn't radiate, but what people
around him felt. A frisson can be scary or delicious, or both at
once, if you like horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no doubt it's a trendy word, as Earls suspects. But
this newspaper, as it happens, has been sparing with its frissons,
averaging one per month even in the most thrilling years of the
decade. (The low of the past 20 years was sober 1981, during which
not a single event was stimulating enough to bring forth a frisson.
And in 1979, frisson was new enough that one writer got it
completely wrong, describing ``a frisson of pompoms'' at an Orange
Bowl game, when he surely meant a flourish.)
</P>
<P>
   The Times may appear more excitable, with 17 frissons so far
this year, compared to the Globe's four, and 37 last year to our
11. But since our big-sister daily publishes far more total words,
the proportion may be about the same. And New Yorkers being New
Yorkers, they were already lamenting their weakness for frisson in
the '80s; now they're using the word with that conscious air that
says ``I know this is a buzzword, and I'm using it ironically and
amusingly, not because I'm a language lemming.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, New York magazine describes the Caldor store in
Bridgehampton, which closed last month, as a place where ``the
rarefied clientele that frequented Barneys during the week got a
declasse frisson from wading knee-deep into a pile of house
slippers or sizing up a shelf of Thighmasters.'' The thrill of
novelty may be gone, but the frissons, it seems, are lingering on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If only it were simple &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's no flood tide, but pleas keep trickling in from
defenders of the subjunctive, concerned that journalists are
helping to kill off a useful feature of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the fossils of subjunctivism _ Come what may, heaven
forbid _ that worry the writers. Nor is it the poetic subjunctive,
as in Shakespeare's ``If this be error and upon me proved / I never
writ, nor no man ever loved.'' No, the daily battle, they say, is
over were and was, and which goes where.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was in Dixie''? Wrong, wrong, wrong. Using was for
were is incorrect and illogical, writes Robert Haddleton of
Norfolk, seconded by Dale Cook of Woodville. Were should be used in
statements that are contrary to fact, our teachers told us: ``If I
were a rich man,'' subjunctive mood; ``When I was a rich man''
indicative mood. And yet, since at least the '50s, usagists have
noted that was often appears in contrary-to-fact statements; the
diligent editors of Merriam-Webster's usage guide find that was for
were has been common in contrary-to-fact clauses since about 1700.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of school, most of us seem to judge the acceptability
of the subjunctive was by ear. Few people say ``If I was you,'' for
example. (If I'm wrong, I don't want to know it.) But the M-W
editors quote from a Henry Adams letter that describes people ``all
staring gravely, as if it were a funeral, at me as if I was the
coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   How many subjunctive detectives would notice that the was,
according to the rules, should be were? Does was fly under our
radar because the as ifs have so firmly established the
counterfactual nature of the premise? Or because we share
(consciously or not) Adams's urge to vary the verb?
</P>
<P>
   Other subjunctivists, in any case, are more alarmed at seeing
were used for was, a mistake often triggered by an If clause: ``If
he were wrong, he should apologize.'' Had we but world enough and
time, we would hear from them, too _ but it will have to wait.

HURT CONTINUES IN THEFT OF ID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a quick business trip, a job interview at
the Brockton (Mass.) Veterans Administration Hospital, but when
Doug Mason paid a visit to the area in January, he entered a legal,
financial, and bureaucratic hell unlike anything he has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's mistake? He left his briefcase out of sight for about
five minutes. Here's what has happened since: His name has surfaced
as the chief suspect in a robbery case and is hazily connected to a
murder investigation. Money is missing. His credit history has been
stained. All the while, as he wonders what will go wrong next, one
uncaring bureaucrat shuffles his case off to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, someone, or perhaps several people, stole Mason's
identity and ran roughshod over society. They also wrought havoc on
Mason's sense of self, and tarnished his good name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all consuming,'' he said last week from his house in Palm
Bay, Fla. ``There's a strong sense of helplessness.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mason, 34, a psychology doctoral candidate, first lost his
briefcase, he did what anyone might expect. He canceled credit
cards, got a new license, and continued on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   That was in January. His first sign of trouble didn't come until
he answered a call on April 6. Massachusetts State Police Trooper
Al Hunt was on the line, telling Mason that someone in the Boston
area had been using his name.
</P>
<P>
   First there was a cellular telephone account that was somehow
linked to a murder investigation, but neither Hunt nor anyone else
will tell Mason how. Last week, a credit bureau sent Mason a letter
detailing two credit card accounts that were opened at Filene's
Basement and charged to their maximum amount.
</P>
<P>
   When Mason called the store, he was told that the person with
the credit cards took a job at Filene's Basement using Mason's name
and Social Security number. A week and a half after that Doug Mason
was hired, he stole $1,500 and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the real Doug Mason has been caught in a legal
quagmire. Hunt won't explain the murder link, and he hung up when I
asked him about it. As often happens in such cases, authorities
disputed jurisdiction and failed to investigate _ until Detective
Steven Blair of the Boston police launched a probe late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, meanwhile, wonders whether police will knock on his door
and take him away from his wife and 5-year-old daughter. His fears
are not misplaced. In the age of computers and instant credit,
stolen identities have become an enormous and disastrous problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more popular, assuming someone's
identity and committing crimes left and right,'' said Blair, who
specializes in investigating such crimes. Though the state enacted
a new law against identity theft last month, many authorities fear
lacks the teeth to be much of a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Joe Machado, an antiques dealer from Boston. A
man acquired Machado's identity last year and ran up thousands of
dollars in bills on newly acquired credit cards. The suspect tried
to run down two police officers with his car, which was found with
a stash of heroin in it. He gave police Machado's name and
information.
</P>
<P>
   That unleashed a torrent of misfortune. When the impostor
skipped a court appearance, police showed up at Machado's house.
The Registry revoked his license. He carried a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``My credit was destroyed,'' said Machado. ``I had to carry
special papers all the time. If I got stopped, the computer would
tell them I'm dealing drugs and defaulting. You never know what's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The thieves operate without fear. One even stole the identity of
Kathy Curran, a reporter for WBZ-TV, whose face is regularly on
television in Boston. That particular thief had the same maiden
name as Curran, lifted her information from records at Beth Israel
Hospital in October, and had new credit cards mailed to an
abandoned house in Quincy, Mass. She charged nearly $5,000 to the
cards before she was caught, then was sentenced to just probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still has all my information,'' Curran said. ``It's really
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Florida, Mason still waits for the worst, wondering when
police might wrongly arrest him, when a credit application might be
turned down, when a potential employer might reject him because of
the mistaken criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever took the briefcase has a key to my house,'' he said.
``My wife's Social Security number was in that briefcase. My
address was in that briefcase.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wants back is simple: His own good name.

EUROPE SAILING ARE A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the cruise world, Alaska is hot, not cold, and Europe is
rapidly warming.
</P>
<P>
   While Alaska, in season, has become one of the hottest cruising
regions in the world, cruise lines are sending more and more of
their ships to European waters. And the number of ships is expected
to increase in the upcoming years.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing cooling off this season is the war in
Kosovo, which is causing lines to avoid the entire Adriatic. One
thing is certain: Cruise lines will always avoid any area where
there is trouble.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even river cruises along eastern European countries are being
affected by some cancelations as travelers express concerns about
the escalation of war or other war-related problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Princess Cruises' Grand Princess, the present holder
of the world's largest cruise ship title, had its maiden voyages in
Europe. And it will return this year along with three additional
Princess ships. The demand for cruises in Europe, the
Mediterranean, and the Baltic is growing with each year and the
lines are deploying more and more ships. Popular lines like Royal
Caribbean, Celebrity, and Norwegian Cruise Line are joining regular
European cruisers like Holland America, Cunard, Costa, Crystal,
Radisson Seven Seas, Royal Olympic, Seabourn, Silversea, Windstar,
Bergen, Classical, and Orient Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the list, travelers interested in sailing in Europe
will find great flexibility in ports of call.
</P>
<P>
   There are many good reasons to consider a European cruise:
First, there's Europe itself with all its culture, history, dining,
and other pleasures; then there is price, with cruises beginning at
around $1,300 plus air fare (even air fares can be less costly
booked with a cruise); and, finally, there is the cruise itself _ a
relaxing, stress-free way to travel. On a cruise there is no
packing and unpacking at each port.
</P>
<P>
   Should a cruise on the ocean not be to your liking, Europe also
has some grand river cruises. Grand Circle Travel, which
specializes in travel for those 50 and older, has found that river
cruises so popular that it is now building its own vessels. The
company said that in the last two years sales of its European river
cruises grew 50 percent and it predicts even greater growth for
this year and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Majesty's season
</P>
<P>
   Boston's cruise season began last Sunday as the newly stretched
Norwegian Majesty headed for Bermuda for the first of its 26 weekly
voyages to the island. In January, the Majesty was cut in half and
a 112-foot addition was added. But don't be concerned. Norwegian
Cruise Line has done this twice before with its Norwegian Wind and
Norwegian Dream, both in 1998 and both with 130-foot midsection
additions. And if that's not enough assurance, consider this: On
its crossing from the shipyard in Germany to Boston, the Majesty
hit not one but two massive storms with 35-foot waves. Captain
Einar Lindlupsen said the ship handled the storms well. Some of the
workers sent along on the trip for finishing work didn't do so well
and ended up seasick. But they worked through the night last
Saturday to make the ship ready for its first Bermuda sailing last
Sunday at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hudson River
</P>
<P>
   James Fenimore Cooper called The Hudson River ``this nation's
Rhine . . . the mighty river, complete with our own humble castles,
legends, and ancient associations.'' Now cruises are being offered
in summer aboard the 63-foot Crescent. The vessel is followed by a
chartered bus that meets the boat at docks to take travelers to
historic and scenic spots, then brings them to a variety of inns
and hotels where their luggage will be waiting. The cruises are
planned for June 13-20, Sept. 12-19. Sept. 26-Oct. 3, and Oct.
10-17. The all-inclusive cost is $1,890. For information, call Karl
Rodman of River Valley Tours at 800-836-2128.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Holiday cruises
</P>
<P>
   It's never too early to plan ahead. And Holland America is
offering passengers who book a Christmas cruise in the Caribbean on
board either the Nieuw Amersterdam or the Westerdam
two-fo-one-savings. The cruises, which leave on Dec. 18 and 19,
begin at $1,149 (air fare extra), are for 10 days, and include all
the holiday favorites, from foods and decorations to music and
services conducted by on-board Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish
clergy.

   In Hawaii, the classic SS Independence (built in Quincy, Mass.)
is featuring three holiday cruises (two for seven nights, one for
three nights) that include a stay in Honolulu, the site of a
spectacular holiday light display. Children also travel free (port
charges and taxes are extra and there are some restrictions). On
these cruises, a family of four can enjoy a three-night cruise and
one night at the Outrigger East hotel, beginning at $2,258.
</P>
<P>
   For its holiday cruise, the Crystal Harmony is featuring the

Valley. The canal boat will be used for tours of the Blackstone
River. ``Coffee milk is important to every Rhode Islander,'' said
Robert Billington, president of the tourism council. ``This is a
wonderful way for those not familiar with coffee syrup to sample
its many uses. It's best enjoyed mixed with milk, or as an ice
cream topping.'' The syrup is made by Autocrat Coffee, based in the
Blackstone Valley of Rhode Island. Bottles are $2 and can be
obtained by calling 401-724-2200 or stopping by the Visitor Center
at 171 Main St., Pawtucket.

HEALTH AND FITNESS, 1830'S STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's those rich, spicy foods that are ruining your health _ and
washing them down with alcohol or caffeine-laced drinks makes
things worse! That was the no-nonsense message spread by Sylvester
Graham, a former minister, as he toured New England and the
mid-Atlantic states in the 1830s. The result? Both ridicule (the
man did have a prickly personality) and a devoted following.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, perhaps the original low-fat diet guru, advocated eating
``vegetables, plain bread made from coarse, unbolted wheat, and
other bland natural foods,'' said Tom Kelleher, a research
historian at Old Sturbridge Village, Mass. ``He thought that the
correct diet, combined with a regimen of sleeping on a hard
mattress, fresh air, pure water, exercise, and sexual restraint
would lead to a happier, healthier life.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's views are included in a new exhibit at Old Sturbridge,
``Picture of Health: Illness and Healing in New England
1790-1860,'' which runs from this April 24 through Jan. 1, 2001.
Here's what else you'll find:
</P>
<P>
   --Early American home remedies. For a cough: ``Make a hole
through a lemon, roast it, and catch the juice.'' For consumption
(tuberculosis): ``Every morning cut up a little turf of fresh
earth, and lying down, breathe into the hole for a quarter of an
hour.'' For an earache: ``The smoke of tobacco blown into the ear
is excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   --Evidence of tooth transplants in early America. ``While some
dentists claimed that the teeth took root and remained firm for
years, the true failure rate must have been near 100 percent,''
said Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   --Colorful advertisements for pills, potions, and assorted
nostrums, such as Dr. Benjamin Smith's ``Improved Indian Vegetable
Pills.'' Many of the medicines consisted mostly of inert
ingredients, alcohol (thus making the patient at least feel good),
or substances that remain largely unknown today.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit provides a chance to learn about the healers and
preachers who are now forgotten. Well, not quite forgotten.
Sylvester Graham, the diet guru, is memorialized in a creation of
his disciples: the graham cracker.
</P>
<P>
   (Old Sturbridge Village is a re-created New England community of
the 1830s in Sturbridge, Mass. For more information, call
800-SEE-1830, or TTY, 508-347-5383.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: You're visiting South America, so it's important to
know the difference between a cougar, a puma, a catamount, and a
mountain lion. What's the difference? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: In Thailand, the movie ``There's Something About Mary''
is called ``My Love Will Stand All Outrageous Events.'' In Hong
Kong, it's ``Enjoy Yourself in the Game of Love.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``It is not he who has lived the longest, but he who has
traveled the farthest, who knows the most.'' _ Armenian proverb. &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's contest time: In connection with Carla Neggers' new romantic
novel ``Kiss the Moon,'' which is set in New Hampshire, Mira Books

Fascinating facts: Things we learned while visiting Walt Disney
World's Animal Kingdom: (1) Bugs make up 80 percent of the animal
world; (2) the cheetah is the only great cat that purrs. (The theme
park has just opened a visually stunning section devoted to the
animals of Asia. Among attractions are a jungle trail and a wild
river ride on which you will get wet.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thanks for the help: Directions on a snack-sized bag of American
Airlines peanuts: ``Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whoops: In Australia, Burger Kings are known as Hungry Jack
restaurants, not Happy Jack as we unconsciously wrote recently
because we were in a jovial mood. A reader adds: ``I did, however,
see one such fast-food restaurant labeled as `Burger King' while we
were there. I wonder if they will all be renamed? Maybe for the
2000 Olympics?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? No difference. They're the same animal. &QL;

 ASWAN, Egypt: ... more tranquility.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tranquil also describes the Winter Palace's Royal Bar, the place
to put your feet up after a hot day of sightseeing and challenges
like dealing with the endless bargaining any ride in an Egyptian
taxi requires. The bar is all dark woodwork, lit with glowing,
backlit stained glass. It has a formal feel, as does the entire
place. On the night when I ambled across the hall to make dinner
reservations in the 1886 Restaurant, the hotel's fanciest, I was
reminded that my companion would have to wear a jacket and tie. She
did.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel acts as a giant buffer between the frenzy of Luxor and
the calm of the gardens, the most glorious in town, overflowing
with palms, hibiscus, hollyhocks, nasturtiums, marigolds,
ornamental pools, and an aviary filled with cooing doves. (Dinner?)
The star attraction in this oasis is a huge swimming pool, where,
during my visit, there were a lot of seriously flabby Europeans of
a certain age wearing skimpy swimsuits, exposing pale,
soon-to-be-sunburned flesh. You wonder what the Egyptian male
waiters serving them poolside _ men accustomed to seeing Egyptian
women covered head to toe _ make of this display.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nile is just another patch of water, a manager at the Mena
House informs me. But the Pyramids are unique.
</P>
<P>
   The Mena House has the world's greatest view of the world's
greatest monuments _ if you get the right room. Because the hotel's
18-hole golf course is so close to the Great Pyramid, guests in the
past have occasionally climbed it in order to use it as the world's
largest golf tee. You can't do that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Originally built as a royal hunting lodge, the Mena House was
expanded with the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal, when Cairo
welcomed the Empress Eugenie by building a brand new road out to
Giza. The spiffy road helped spur tourism, and eventually, some
wealthy Britons bought the Mena House and spent a fortune turning
it into a deluxe hotel, fitting it out with elaborate latticework,
tiles, screens, and arabesque arches. More than a century on, the
sense of luxury still prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in 40 acres of jasmine-scented grounds, the hotel has
an outline that is as complex as that of the pyramids is smooth.
Turrets, towers, and long rows of arches punctuate the facade.
Inside the lobby, hanging like so many stalactites, are dozens of
glass pendants that cast a soft golden glow on you as you check in.
If you've just arrived from chaotic Cairo, or its equally hectic
airport, you'll find basking under them soothing indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mena House is a self-contained world, with sports facilities
including the Cairo area's largest swimming pool, several
distinguished restaurants _ including The Moghul Room, Egypt's
finest Indian eatery, where the Red Sea prawns are divine _ and a
casino, nightclub, and discotheque. Heretical though the thought
is, there would be enough to occupy you for a few days even without
the Pyramids. But of course you'll want to explore them thoroughly,
and since they're a five-minute stroll from the hotel door, you can
do so in easy stages, breaking for a poolside lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The decor in the Mena House's larger rooms and suites is
completely over the top, with Islamic arches, mirrors, and gilding
the dominant motifs. Consider my bathroom. Beware the bather who
steps from this tub with a less than confident body image. You're
confronted with a full-length mirror. Step to the sink and there's
a five-sided mirror to reveal your every flaw. En route to the
dressing room you run a gantlet of full-length mirrors on both
sides. In the bedroom, a huge, scallop-shaped mirror hangs over the
dressing table. The sole occupant of this extravagant space, I
nevertheless never felt alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of caveats. In addition to the 19th-century rooms, all
three of these hotels have modern wings that, while comfortable,
are relatively charmless. Meanwhile, the historic sections of all
three have some rooms with views of the Nile or, in the case of
Mena House, the Pyramids, and others that overlook the hotel
grounds. If you feel you haven't traveled all the way to Egypt to
gaze at a plot of petunias, you'll want the more dramatic vistas.
Be prepared to pay extra for them, though.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth remembering is that the Egyptian government's idea of
what constitutes a five-star hotel _ a classification all the above
have received _ isn't necessarily up to the standards of, say, the
Savoy Group. Rooms in all three hotels are slightly run-down. The
government actually owns all three properties, which are managed by
foreigners: the French Sofitel group in the case of the Winter
Palace and Old Cataract; the Indian-based Oberoi company in the
case of the Mena House. The top managers in the hotels are
foreigners, but most of the staff are Egyptian, and haven't
necessarily ever even seen a truly great hotel. So the managers are
left trying to describe one to them. Sometimes it works. On the
other hand, in the Winter Palace I was served wine with a blob of
cork floating in it. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he told
me to take it out.
</P>
<P>
   About the wine. Egypt has good grape-growing conditions but also
an Islamic government that has little interest in developing the
industry. So the wine, which comes in three generic varieties _
``white,'' ``red,'' and ``rose'' _ tastes like turpentine.
Meanwhile, the government slaps a staggering 450 percent duty on
imported vintages, which managers in top hotels are forced to buy
because their guests expect good wines as a complement to the good
food they offer. The first time I went to Egypt, I learned the
solution to this dilemma from a couple of savvy American travelers:
Bring your own.

A COMEDIC LOOK AT DYSFUNCTION'S MANY FORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE COUNTRY LIFE 
By Rachel Cusk 
Picador, 342 pp., $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rachel Cusk's ``The Country Life'' is an oddly ingratiating
social comedy about an unlikely governess who finds herself working
for an impossible family.
</P>
<P>
   Cusk confidently draws the reader into the troubled mind of the
narrator, 29-year old Stella Benson, as she's leaving London
behind, quitting her job, abandoning her flat, writing farewell
letters to her parents and to Edward _ presumably the man in her
life, although that is never spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   Stella is unhappy with her parents. We get an idea of the nature
of their relationship when she comes upon a packet of letters her
father wrote to her at school, using the persona of the family dog
(``Your faithful friend, Bounder''). The problem, Stella explains,
is that her parents, aspiring to ``a social position to which they
had not been born,'' sent their children off to prestigious
schools, institutions that made her older brother ``homogenous,''
and killed her younger brother at age 13 in a bizarre javelin
accident (. . . his small body on the grass like a bird struck by
an arrow''). Stella is haunted by her parents' inability to
criticize the school's role in her brother's death: ``They didn't
dare; as if by questioning the sport they would have betrayed their
inferiority, the public discovery of which they feared more than
all the private sorrow in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella has been hired, unseen, as a companion to Martin Madden,
17 and disabled, who lives with his family in an imposing house
next to the family farm, a huge agribusiness called Franchise Farm.
The Maddens, born to the social position Stella's parents aspire
to, are as dysfunctional as any family on ``Sally'' or ``Jerry
Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   The brittle Pamela Madden, whom Stella dislikes on sight, veers
between being superior and condescendingly chummy. Piers, Pamela's
husband, is a hen-pecked cipher given to talking in cliches, when
he talks at all. Toby, the priapic Madden older son, has designs on
any female who crosses his path including, Stella guiltily
suspects, his own mother. Caroline, a married daughter, is a nasty
snob. Martin, misshapen and confined to a wheelchair, is smart and
sarcastic, and very angry, justifiably, as Stella soon sees.
</P>
<P>
   Stella struggles to adapt to her new position as ``help.'' She
can't help noticing what's going on around her, and commenting on
it. She is a subversive force in the Maddens' world. She's also
completely inept at her job and unequal to the challenge of living
in the country. Beset by sunburn and allergies, scratched by
brambles, inappropriately dressed for nearly every occasion, Stella
bumbles on, trying to do her job, but failing. Her bad judgment and
ineptitude lead to some farcical situations, as when, despite being
unable to drive, she takes Martin for a ride in the family car.
</P>
<P>
   The novel ambles along from disaster to disaster. The plot, such
as it is, takes a back seat to Stella's distinctly unhomogenous
personality and her perceptions, as when she first meets Pamela:
``I had a remote sense of some inner derangement, whose faint call
I could hear as if momentarily borne on a favorable wind from a
great distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella's voice is smart, literate, offbeat, confiding. Near the
end of the novel the reader finds that the narrator has been
holding back vital information about herself, although it remains
unclear whether this is deliberate or accidental, or a combination
of both. Cusk has dropped hints about Stella's past along the way.
At one point Martin, who seems as though he could have a bright
future as a therapist, manages to draw a reluctant Stella out on
the subject of Edward. Ultimately, though, Stella's secrets are
less interesting than Stella's observations.
</P>
<P>
   Cusk is an astute social critic with a gift for comedy. Her
first novel, ``Saving Agnes,'' won the Whitbread Prize for best
first novel in 1993. ``The Country Life,'' her third, and the first
published in America, is a pleasure.

   BOSTON -- These are not German shepherds. They're
(itals)German(unitals) German shepherds. Born in the mother
country. Bred at an exclusive kennel in Glendale, Calif. Schooled
in the rarefied discipline of Schutzhund training, which emphasizes
protection, tracking, and obedience. Peak value of $20,000-$30,000,
given the proper bloodlines and development. Top of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dafoe's house pets.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's merely their temporary status, Dafoe explains
as he roughhouses with Vamp, the male, and Zona, the female, in the
upstairs study of his North Shore home, a room garnished with dog
paraphernalia and a photo album charting their upbringing. These
dogs were meant for shows, for competition, not lounging about. And
his job _ as the Bruins' No. 1 goalie, a viable candidate for the
Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best, and the key ingredient in Boston's
Stanley Cup run, which begins Thursday night in Carolina _ doesn't
afford Dafoe enough time to train them properly. Maybe after
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they're not to be confused with those wimpy
poodles or coddled Scotties who consider leaping onto the couch
taxing activity. These dogs are more intelligent, more ambitious.
They demand more, and that's why Dafoe or his bride, Kim, a former
Rottweiler owner whom he has converted in their five years
together, regularly takes Vamp and Zona to the Boston Canine
Training Center in Middleton to have them put through their paces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of drive, a lot of energy,'' says Dafoe, his
eyes lighting up. ``If they didn't do something, they'd probably
tear the house apart. They get so pumped, so excited _ they love to
go out and work.''
</P>
<P>
   He attaches no cosmic significance to this trait, sees no
special connection between owner and animal. When he describes his
own attitude toward work _ ``I'd go crazy if I wasn't playing
regularly; I'd be climbing the walls; I need a challenge'' _ he
doesn't acknowledge that he could just as easily be discussing Vamp
and Zona.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Sproule, Dafoe's junior coach at Victoria, British
Columbia, who became his surrogate father, gets the drift.
``They're big, strong dogs, not lap dogs; they give a good insight
into Byron,'' he says. ``Some dogs have no identity; these do. And
there's an identity to Byron, a very strong personality.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a point of departure, however, and Dafoe unwittingly
articulates it with this analogy on raising animals: ``It's like if
you have kids. If they're good at something, you want to push them
along.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is the antithesis of that philosophy. ``Everyone in
Comox Valley,'' says Kim, referring to their hometown on Vancouver
Island, ``is so proud of Byron because they know he did it all on
his own.''
</P>
<P>
   He had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His family tree really is a hodgepodge of branches scattered
about by winds of discord.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was born to a Canadian father and British mother in
Sussex, England, and like many things concerning his genealogy,
he's vague about what brought them there. ``Work or something, I
guess,'' he says with a shrug. In fact, his father was a would-be
poet, and his mother was a great admirer of Lord Byron, after whom
she named her first-born child; he must thank his lucky stars every
night that she wasn't reading Percy Bysshe Shelley instead.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 3 months old, the family emigrated to Canada, where
a bit of destiny may have come into play. His mother lacked the
proper papers for her infant son, but a sympathetic Customs
official in Montreal said, ``He looks like a hockey player. We'll
let him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey was only one of sundry diversions on Vancouver Island,
about 10 miles _ a two-hour ferry ride _ from mainland Canada. In
Comox Valley, an area of some 20,000 comprising Courtney, Comox,
and Cumberland, there were two ski resorts within 20 minutes, the
Pacific Ocean just two minutes away, plus the Campbell River, which
featured some of the best salmon fishing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe embraced all the popular local activities _ skiing,
waterskiing, sailing, fishing, street hockey, tennis _ but this was
not a boyhood idyll.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers that his father took him public skating for the
first time when Byron was 3; a year later, he abandoned wife and
son. Jane Dafoe remarried, and when Byron was 7, his stepfather
introduced him to youth hockey; three years after that, he, too, up
and left. ``I never really had a male influence a lot growing up,''
says Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   He says this without a trace of resentment, though he maintains
no contact with either man; it is simply a fact he had to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a strong maternal bond to fill the void. With her
second husband, Jane Dafoe had two more children _ Benji, now 22,
and Chelsea, 21 _ and she found it a struggle to feed three mouths
on her salary from a series of secretarial and clerical jobs. ``I
counted one time,'' says Byron. ``I lived in 14 houses by the time
I was 21. We were always renting, always moving.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more to keep Jane Dafoe occupied. Benji has Down
syndrome, and his mother raised him at home. ``So you can see she
had quite a lot on her plate,'' says Byron.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there is no bitterness as he recounts this; these were
his circumstances, and nothing was going to change them.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks with pride about how Benji has handled his handicap:
``He works out of a group home now that contracts jobs. He's like
the town mascot. Everyone knows him.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, because Benji occasionally was prone to
misadventures. Byron remembers the time his 4-year-old brother rode
his new bike around town _ right onto the ferry, winding up on the
mainland. ``He got off in Powell River,'' says Byron, ``and the
people there knew who he was and put him right back on the ferry
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe laughs over these reminiscences, but he also acknowledges
the bottom line: ``I got a lot of responsibilities put on my plate
that a lot of kids didn't. Sometimes I wish I could've enjoyed
being a kid more without all the pressures of how was I going to
get this done or that done. But I think it made me a better
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he became a self-starter with a vengeance. At the age of
10, he was doing two paper routes. By 12, he also was working in a
supermarket butcher shop. ``The worst job was Friday nights from
6-9,'' he says. ``I had to clean the rotisserie. All that grease .
. . ''
</P>
<P>
   There were days when he would be up at dawn to deliver the
papers, head off for a full day at school, proceed to the butcher
department, rush to the rink for a 5 p.m. practice . . . then start
his homework.
</P>
<P>
   But he flourished. He was an age-group tennis champion in his
early teens. He was a straight-A student who skipped sixth grade
and graduated from high school at 16. All of which took a back
seat. ``To me,'' says Dafoe, ``school was a steppingstone to get
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   So he could have more time for hockey. The people along the
trail of Dafoe's athletic development all refer reverently to his
``focus'' as the trait that sets him apart. They don't know the
half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his first organized game, Dafoe came to the
conclusion that he was going to be an NHL goalie. ``I remember
signing up for my first youth league,'' he says. ``They asked you
to list your two favorite positions. I put `center' because I
wanted to score goals and `goalie' because I liked the equipment.
Before our first game, we didn't have a goalie. The coach asked for
a volunteer. I said I'd give it a shot. I loved it. And I never
skated out again.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother had one admonition: ``If you're going to play goal,
do it right, because I don't have the money for this.''
</P>
<P>
   He went beyond that. Goaltending became his obsession. And he
had exacting standards at an early age. Among his memorabilia is a
laminated color drawing he did at age 10 of his idol _ Gerry
Cheevers, the Bruins' former champion goalie and current scout,
whose recommendation ultimately brought Dafoe to Boston. ``The
thing I loved about him was that he was such a competitor,'' says
Dafoe. ``He didn't care what the score was or what his stats were
as long as his team won. If the score was 7-7, then he just wasn't
going to give up the eighth goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words are often repeated these days. About Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he showed extraordinary promise, all the while
fending for himself. ``I had no father, no money,'' he says. ``I
had to make my own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he never recalls feeling lonely, perhaps because he was
embraced by the community of hockey. ``There was always a father
around who would give me a ride to the rink,'' says Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   One of those dads was Warren Fleenor, who now lives in
Providence but at the time was Dafoe's Pee Wee, Bantam, and Midget
coach _ and chauffeur. ``He was just one of the gang,'' says
Fleenor. In the car, maybe, but not on the ice. ``He shone,'' says
Fleenor, a former junior goalie. ``He was an excellent goalie. I
didn't have to work that much with him because he had it all down;
it was just a matter of him coming into his own. I knew out of the
whole crew, he was the one who was going to make it to the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's a convenient observation to make in hindsight,
but there's no question Dafoe was considered special. He generally
played a year above his age group, and when he was 14, he was
selected for the all-star team that would represent the island in
the Super Series tournament at Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   One problem. The players had to provide their own funds for the
trip, and there were none to spare in the Dafoe household. So, well
versed by now in self-reliance, Byron made the rounds of the local
businesses, raised sponsorship money, and took the ice in Vancouver
looking like a Winston Cup race car. ``I had decals up and down
both sleeves, on my back, on my front,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers got their money's worth _ Dafoe was the
first-team all-tournament goalie and Vancouver Island made it to
the final before losing to Minnesota. Dafoe also got something out
of the enterprise _ an introduction to Sproule and a ticket out of
Comox.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sproule, who coached Dafoe's Super Series team, owned, operated,
and coached the Tier II junior club in Victoria, some three hours
down island from Comox Valley. He was impressed enough with Dafoe's
tournament showing to invite him to training camp the next fall. It
was to be nothing more than a sneak preview; there was no way Dafoe
was going to stick. ``He was 15,'' recalls Sproule, ``and this was
a league dominated by 17-, 18-, and 19-year-olds. It was
exceptional for a 15-year-old to play in that league, especially a
goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dafoe crossed up Sproule by having an outstanding camp, and
there followed a battle for his services. Dafoe wanted to accept
the Tier II bid. His mother wanted him to pursue his education, and
he had a scholarship offer to a prestigious private school for
gifted students that happened to be two blocks from Sproule's
house. Byron wanted out of Comox _ ``I was getting bored with it,
looking for stimulation, hanging out with a bad crowd,'' he says _
but the education he wanted to pursue was in hockey.

 BOSTON: ... in hockey.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over his mother's protests, he took Sproule's offer. And found a
family. He moved in with Sproule; Dale's companion, Hannah; and his
5-year-old son, Aaron. Dafoe and Aaron initially shared a room;
Aaron considers him an older brother and took up goaltending
largely through his inspiration. Eventually, Byron got his own
room, and even after leaving Victoria the following year, he
returned regularly in the offseason until he bought his first house
in California two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he was playing regularly _ ``again, unheard of for a
15-year-old goalie,'' says Sproule _ and unwittingly triggering
another bidding war. The following season, he was a Tier II
All-Star. He was also a 16-year-old high school graduate with
impeccable grades, and he was wooed by several colleges that wanted
him in their classrooms and their nets. Harvard recruited him.
Illinois-Chicago, Michigan, and North Dakota brought him in for
visits on consecutive weekends, ``and I changed my mind about where
I wanted to go each weekend,'' says Dafoe. ``Those last three
months of the season were hell because I couldn't decide what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another factor _ the Portland Winter Hawks of the
Western Hockey League, the top junior level, had been courting
Dafoe since he was 13 and now were relentless.
</P>
<P>
   His mother wanted him to go to college. Byron wanted to go to
the NHL, and he figured the fastest route was through Portland. But
he also wanted to hedge his bet a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Sproule solved the dilemma. He had a Victoria lawyer draw up a
10-page contract with Portland _ ``unheard of for junior hockey,''
says Dafoe _ that provided money, a car, and a lifetime guarantee
of full college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe has yet to exercise the last perk, but he's had steady
work ever since.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to take the last two seasons out of context. Dafoe's
tenure in Boston has been an upward graph of success _ a 30-25-9
record and 2.24 goals-against average last season when the Bruins
vaulted back into the playoffs after having finished last in the
league in 1996-97; a 32-23-11 mark, 1.99 GAA, and 10 shutouts, all
of which place him at or near the top of the NHL statistics this
season and confirm what Bruins president-general manager Harry
Sinden considers his emergence into elite status. ``He's above the
level of a No. 1 goalie now,'' says Sinden. The performance was
punctuated by Dafoe's recent 13-4-4 record and 1.78 GAA during a
life-and-death stretch in which the Bruins climbed from out of the
playoff race to a comfortable position entering the last week of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people act as if I've had nothing but success,'' says
Dafoe. ``This is my eighth pro year. It didn't happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the long haul took Dafoe through many travails and much
frustration, including stops in two NHL organizations, Washington
and Los Angeles, where he couldn't find a home. Though he allowed
more than five goals a game at Portland _ ``We had some bad
teams,'' says former Winter Hawks coach Ken Hodge, ``and Byron
learned a lot about mental toughness and perseverance; he never
pointed fingers'' _ Dafoe was the Capitals' second-round pick in
the 1989 entry draft. Even that was something of a disappointment;
Central Scouting had him rated as the top goalie in the draft, and
he thought he'd be going in the first round to Washington. Instead,
the Caps picked his archrival from juniors, Olaf Kolzig, ahead of
him. ``When you look back,'' says Nashville Predators general
manager David Poile, who at the time was running the Capitals,
``you could say we did the right thing taking both. But maybe we
didn't because they shared the same spot.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting to know each other during the Capitals' Foreign
Legion training camp in Russia and Sweden, the two newcomers became
unlikely friends. ``I felt he was a cocky s.o.b. in junior,'' says
Kolzig. ``Then on that first trip, we found we had a lot in common.
Like he lived 10 minutes from my house on the island.''
</P>
<P>
   They roomed together for a year in the minors _ ``Our teammates
in Baltimore were asking, `Are you sure you guys want to do this?'
'' recalls Dafoe _ and served as best man at each other's wedding
last summer. But Dafoe was never able to establish a foothold as he
bounced between Washington and the minors for four years, and
``Olie, right or wrong, was always just a tad ahead,'' says Poile.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe lobbied for a change of address and got it when the
Capitals dealt him to the Kings before the 1995-96 season. In two
years there, he alternated in net, first with Kelly Hrudey and then
with Stephane Fiset, on one of the league's most dreadful defensive
clubs. His records _ 14-24-8 and 13-17-5 _ reflected that, but the
experience wasn't a total waste. The veteran Hrudey became
something of a mentor, and Dafoe recalls at least one invaluable
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Against Winnipeg one night, Hrudey surrendered five first-period
goals, and on the bench, Dafoe says, ``I knew I'd be coming in for
the second period. He deserved to be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hrudey finished the game, and though he lost, 6-5, he
played brilliantly the rest of the way. Afterward, Dafoe asked him,
``How the hell did you do that? Why didn't you just take the rest
of the night off when you were struggling?''
</P>
<P>
   Hrudey responded by scolding him, ``You never give up, no matter
what the score. All you worry about is making the next save. And
you can never stop fighting for yourself, because once you do,
they'll know you've given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe took that advice to heart the following year when Hrudey
left for San Jose as a free agent and the Kings assured him he
would be the No. 1 man _ a week before they acquired Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   He still hadn't fully established himself, except in one mind.
While doing TV work years before, Cheevers had taken a busman's
holiday at an AHL game in Baltimore. Afterward, he had expressed
his admiration for Dafoe's play that night to a friend in the
Skipjacks organization, who told him, ``Gerry, they've got the
wrong guys in Washington.'' Cheevers kept that in mind,
occasionally saw Dafoe with the Capitals and Kings, and as a Boston
scout, he reported to his bosses that Dafoe ``had an excellent
chance of becoming a No. 1 goalie,'' says Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spunky and all that,'' says Cheevers. ``I endorsed him,
but Harry and Mike (O'Connell, the assistant GM) made the deal. We
checked a lot of things before we went after him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were rebuffed in their initial attempts to acquire
Dafoe, and in the summer of 1997, they considered LA's asking price
_ center Jozef Stumpel _ too high. But Stumpel was a holdout, and
``and his demands were so high,'' says Sinden, ``that we said, `The
hell with it.' We wanted Dafoe badly.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Aug. 29, Stumpel, Sandy Moger, and a 1998 fourth-round
draft choice were packaged for Dafoe and Dmitri Khristich, a deal
that in retrospect qualifies as another Sinden coup.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe knew there were no guarantees when he arrived. Jim Carey,
a Vezina laureate who once had beaten him out for the Capitals job
and had joined Boston for the past 20 games of the previous season,
was still around. Rob Tallas was also in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a new coach, Pat Burns, who assured his goalies
that he came in with no preconceptions and that the job would go to
the best man. Dafoe took him at his word, and when camp ended, he
was sharing the job with Carey.
</P>
<P>
   After an early 6-2 West Coast swing, Burns turned with
increasing frequency to Dafoe, ``and I couldn't get him out of
there,'' says the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe didn't begin to feel secure until one of his lowest
professional moments. On Nov. 26, 1997, at Florida, he allowed the
Panthers six goals in 12 shots before being lifted from a 10-5
loss. ``I figured I was headed to the bench after that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think that was one of the nights you quit hockey,''
says Kim with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Burns approached Dafoe the next morning and said, ``See
that big yellow thing up there? That's the sun, and it came out
today. Don't worry about it. You're going back in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to let him down after that,'' says Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't _ and since Carey was demoted to the minors on Dec. 5,
1997, there's been no question about who's No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe has removed all doubts, even during this season's dry
spells that left the Bruins in playoff peril. ``The defense wasn't
as solid in front of him as we were last year,'' says captain Ray
Bourque. ``We've had more breakdowns. But he's never lost his
confidence, and then he had that great stretch. Thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe attributes it to maintaining an even keel, never wavering
in his determination. ``If you put consistency next to any
goalie,'' he says, ``he's probably one of the better ones in the
league. This year I've really tried to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns's system, which mandates defense at all costs and enables
Dafoe to focus on the shooter, has played a role. But Burns, who
has coached Patrick Roy, Grant Fuhr, Felix Potvin, and Damian
Rhodes, among others, during NHL stops in Montreal and Toronto,
feels there's more to it than that. Temperamentally, he compares
Dafoe to the unflappable Fuhr, and he illustrates his point with a
pantomime of a frazzled goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never looks behind him after he's made a save,'' says the
coach. ``If he lets in a goal, he doesn't keep looking at the puck
in the net; he just sweeps it out and he's ready to get on with it.
If he has a bad game, he doesn't let it get to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, ``he's accepted by his teammates,'' says Burns.
``Everyone likes Byron. He doesn't make excuses or point fingers
when things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the team feeds off that,'' says Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dafoe, an $850,000 bargain this season who stands to reap a
multimillion-dollar bonanza as a free agent this summer, has one
bit of unfinished business. ``I've never won a playoff series,'' he
says, recalling last year's first-round ouster by Kolzig's
Capitals. ``I want to get out of that first round, see how far we
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend and sometime rival has an idea. ``The season he's
had,'' says Kolzig, ``it wouldn't surprise me if Byron won the
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   That would cement his status as top dog.

   It put banks in the business of neighborhood-building, after
half a century of neglect. Although it hasn't yet had a persuasive
audit, there's a widespread and growing feeling that it has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now the statute is under attack. Republican Senator Phil Gramm
of Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has vowed to
block the financial services reform bill that cleared the House
Banking Committee by a large margin _ because it extends the CRA's
applicability to such institutions as mutual-fund companies and
insurance firms, in exchange for broader lending powers.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Gramm will fail; the CRA is a broadly popular
measure. If Republicans don't agree to its extension before the end
of the legislative season, they'll have to take their chances with
financial overhaul in the next Congress. Still, it is worth
remembering the circumstances that gave rise to its birth.
</P>
<P>
   The great suburban migration of the 1950s and 1960s in the
Northeast and Midwest, and the 1960s and 1970s in the South and
West, is still relatively little understood. One thing in
particular seems clear. It often involved a kind of panic, where
the usual community-sustaining institutions didn't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   An especially good glimpse can be had from Gerald Gamm's new
book, ``Urban Exodus: Why the Jews Left Boston and the Catholics
Stayed.'' This thoroughly reported and elegantly written book
surely is the best interpretation of Boston politics since J.
Anthony Lukas's ``Common Ground'' in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   From the turn of the century until the 1950s, Dorchester and
upper Roxbury consisted of two large and nearly opposite halves. To
the west of Blue Hill Avenue were the Jews, peaking in the 1920s at
about 77,000 people _ half the Jewish population in the Boston
area.
</P>
<P>
   To the east were the Catholics, around 136,000, most of them
Irish. A slow-growing community of African-Americans was
concentrated in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 20 years, however, the Jewish population emptied
out, replaced by a checkerboard of white enclaves, a few integrated
districts, and large African-American, Haitian, Hispanic, and
Vietnamese neigborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   It's relatively simple, argues Gamm, who is interested in why
some neighborhoods persist for generations and others quickly
change. The Jews fled, and the Catholics stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are territorially defined and hierarchically
organized, Catholic parishes urged their families to stay put.
Because their survival was predicated on portability and autonomy,
Jewish institutions in many cases actually led the flight.
(Protestant congregations have found it similarly easy to move
lock, stock, and church-house door, says Gamm.)
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the fault of banks and real estate agents who are
ritually blamed, the explanation for the ``white flight'' that
afflicted Boston from the slow beginnings in the 1920s to the
dramatic climax in the 1970s is to be found in the Jewish readiness
to flee from harassment and tension, given their historical
experience.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to blame the Jewish community. Yet it is easy to wish
there were some countervailing forces at work, especially now after
large tracts of Boston have been stripped of their local
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It's here that the CRA comes in.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to move whole religious communities back into the
city, but it has been possible to cause banks to search for ways to
make profitable loans in neighborhoods they once avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Because banks seeking regulatory permissions are judged partly
on the basis of their compliance with the act, Gramm claims the CRA
has become a vehicle for ``fraud and extortion.'' No doubt there
have been times when activists have pushed banks to make unwise or
even improper loans in order to present a good report _ though the
purchase of low-income housing bonds has become an alternative to
direct lending.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, the CRA has been highly successful in stopping
bad practices and fostering good new ones. It will be even more so
when mutual funds, insurance companies, and other bank-like
entities are required to take an interest in their communities'
success.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The Kosovo crisis has been compared
with Vietnam, to remind us of getting bogged down in a losing war,
and World War II, to highlight the danger of ignoring a tyrant
trying to wipe out a whole population. A more apt comparison may be
with the United Nations' bloody ``police action'' in Korea, which
stopped communist expansion in the region. Nearly 50 years later
U.S. troops are still there, and North Korea is still a menace. By

MONEY-LOSING WEB MAGAZINE PLANS PUBLIC STOCK OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN BERGER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three weeks ago, Salon Internet Inc. announced
it would change its name to Salon.com, so it came as no great
surprise when the inevitable follow-up announcement arrived: The
company plans a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Salon officials said Monday they had filed papers with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 2.5 million shares of
common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The stake amounts to about 26 percent of the company. Salon is
an Internet media company that began with an on-line magazine and
expanded to offer interactive, on-line forums and services targeted
at a high-income, educated clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The shares would be offered at between $10.50 and $13.50 each,
which would raise between $26.25 million and $33.75 million for the
San Francisco-based company. WR Hambrecht &AMP; Co., also of San
Francisco, is the lead underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in its prospectus it would use the money to
expand its sales and marketing efforts, improve distribution and
expand its business operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet initial public offerings have been setting
records and awarding jackpots to investors, Salon's announcement
came on a day when the market shook as a stampede of money left the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's prospectus, Salon will face the same
risks as other companies doing business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company has never made money. In the fiscal year ended March
31, 1998, Salon lost $3.8 million. It racked up another $4.3
million losses in the nine months ending Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects those losses to increase for ``at least the
foreseeable future,'' the prospectus said in an SEC-mandated
section that details a wide array of potential problems a company
could face.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its revenue was likely to fluctuate from
quarter to quarter and that revenue was almost entirely based on
the sale of sponsorships and banner advertising on its Web page.
Advertisers are not tied into long- term deals.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based advertising is still a largely untested market,
the prospectus noted, a problem that has bedeviled other
content-driven companies in the sector. Only a few companies have
managed to make money providing non-pornographic editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   While Salon has achieved widespread recognition as an on-line
publication for literate, upscale Web surfers, some analysts
expressed concern that the company's business model was too
narrowly focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a magazine,'' said Steve Harmon, senior investment
analyst at Internet.com, an on-line financial news site.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said the company needed to broaden its appeal to Web
users by expanding its chat room and electronic-commerce
components.
</P>
<P>
   The offering would make multimillionaires of some of the
company's board and senior managers. They include Bruce Katz, a
major investor in The Well, the Sausalito-based Internet discussion
board acquired by Salon this month, with 973,000 shares; editor and
chairman David Talbot, a co-founder and a former editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, 402,083 shares; and Michael O'Donnell, the
chief executive, 158,333 shares.

   HOWS-MY-DRIVING _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Don't like my

of inviting the general public to report on truckers' driving
skills has blossomed. Hundreds of thousands of trucks now sport
``How's my driving?'' decals with toll-free telephone numbers,
requesting complaints _ and, sometimes, praise _ from motorists.
Begun in the late 1980s, the simple concept has boomed in
popularity in recent years, spurred by the proliferation of
cellular phones and increasing friction between cars and trucks on
congested highways. ``Is it effective? Without a doubt it is,''
said Joe Zingale, executive vice president of Driver's Alert, a

   HOLOCAUST-DEBATE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the past 14

used for political purposes. The editor of an influential magazine
on Jewish affairs was called ``brainless when it comes to the
Holocaust'' for criticizing the growing field of Holocaust studies.
And scores of museum directors, curators and academics have been
accused of commercializing the memory of 6 million Jews killed in
the Holocaust to further political agendas and boost ticket sales
for an increasing number of Holocaust exhibits and museums.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century after the Holocaust, defining, owning
and placing it in context have become more complex and more

intensifying: Who will speak for the victims after the last
witnesses are gone? And what will they say? (Belkin, Palm Beach

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Allow Dan Phillips to glean a landfill and
he just might develop a subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Slender, mustachioed and ponytailed, Phillips, a 53-year-old
former university dance instructor, is launching an ambitious
project to construct homes for the working poor using recycled
materials.
</P>
<P>
   He is completing a Victorian-style home in this city 75 miles
north of Houston and is starting a second home he has designed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first of 900 homes, give or take a hundred,''
Phillips said half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has an additional seven lots awaiting his homes _ trash
turned into treasures. He has mortgaged his own home to finance the
project, which sparks a bit of anxiety in art teacher Marsha
Phillips, his wife of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd better get busy on that second house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips acknowledges his ideas on homebuilding are
unconventional and even ``loony'' to a few contractors. More than
one has stopped by to explain to him why his homes won't last. But
that doesn't stop Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``That door and transom were headed to the landfill,'' said Dan
Phillips, gesturing toward a handsome wood and glass entryway of an
almost-finished Victorian-style home in the heart of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that absolutely free. That door unit is a $2,000 door
unit; it is an architectural antique,'' he said. Then he pointed to
the lock set on the door. ``That lock set is worth $200 alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips isn't just venturing a good guess on value. Since 1983,
he has operated the Phoenix Workshop, an antiques and art
restoration shop in Huntsville. He opened it after leaving Sam
Houston State University as a dance instructor. Now his passion for
antiques and his creativity, social activism and concern for the
ecology are driving Phillips into full-time home-building.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story Victorian home is built out of 2-foot cedar
end-cut beams. ``I bought a three-year accumulation of a
lumberyard's cedar end cuts,'' said Phillips, surveying his
handiwork at 1323 Avenue N.
</P>
<P>
   The blocks made from the end cuts, which were nailed and glued
together, form the walls of the 1,400-square-foot home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself some basic questions like, `What is a
wall supposed to do?''' said Phillips, who holds a doctorate in
dance. ``A wall holds a roof up,'' he answered himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of materials accommodate that mission,'' he said. The
cedar end cuts are a good example. ``It doesn't have to be 2-by-4s
and Sheetrock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The home's roof is made of tin shingles he purchased at various
garage sales. ``That's a 75-year-old roof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He used a donated sliding glass patio door as a skylight. Then
there's the turret that he fashioned out of 2-by-4 end cuts. ``If
you are going to have a Victorian house, you have to have a
turret,'' Phillips explained.
</P>
<P>
   He did have to special-order a curved window for the turret, and
not everything can be recycled. The home has a new central air and
heating unit. The electrical wiring and plumbing are also new.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the house's materials have had previous lives. The
flooring is yellow pine that Phillips purchased from a contractor
tearing down a house. He pointed out that the inside staircase was
obtained for only $20, including delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mind-boggling that someone would let loose of that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips delights in singling out the ``you wouldn't believe how
I got that'' items in the house, including rolls of copper
screening that he purchased for $15, a regular $500 value. There
are pallets of donated bricks that will form sidewalks around the
house. There is a donated 1950 gas stove that Phillips is restoring
that will be worth $3,000 when it is functioning. Then there are
the antique deadbolt locks, large blocks of steel with equally
large plates of steel as bolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are as rare as you can find on the planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He found a free lock, although he had to pay $18 for a key.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips estimates that materials alone would run $60,000 if
purchased on the market. His penchant for acquiring recycled
materials permits him to build the house at $30 a square foot,
about half the per-square-foot cost of a new home. It is a price
attractive to families barely making it.
</P>
<P>
   Secondhand materials don't mean a second-rate home, said Mike
Roempke, a city building official. ``What he has done is very
good,'' Roempke said. ``It hasn't been thrown or pieced together.
The project he has done is very, very good. It is very
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' plans and construction ideas are screened by a
supportive local structural engineer before they are submitted to
the city.
</P>
<P>
   While the construction is unconventional, it meets city building
codes and in some cases exceeds them. For example, house foundation
beams are 4 inches thick and 6 inches wide according to building
codes. Phillips' donated beams are twice the dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start to think outside the box a little bit, you can
have all these materials available to you,'' he said. ``You go to
garage sales, flea markets, salvage yards, junk piles, go into
Dumpsters, hit antique shops; it is everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Contractors avoid using recycled materials because of the
patience and time required to accumulate the items. Not everything
is available at garage sales or salvage yards when needed. The
items also may be defective or need trimming, refinishing and other
time-consuming work. It is far easier to shop for new materials.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips' favorite pastime is checking out antiques shops
and garage sales with his wife, who also contributes design ideas
for the proposed homes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his eye for antiques, Phillips uses his creativity for
the modern. He created a bathtub out of a cementlike Fiberglas
compound. He hollowed out a short, thick, wood branch for the tub's
faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a price to be paid for using recycled materials.
``The design of the house grows out of the materials,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple purchasing the almost-finished Victorian home asked
for a three-bedroom, two-bath home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolute domain over design,'' Phillips said. There are
no contractor-client spats over where to put the pantry or what the
the upstairs bathroom's color scheme should be. And Phillips
constructed the home to be economically efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything looks as though it comes right out of
Architectural Digest or House Beautiful, even if those are the
magazines that Phillips uses for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   An upstairs closet door warped. ``Well, that's what you get, a
warped door,'' Phillips said. It is not a major defect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his ideas work. He glued halved hickory-nut shells on
the trim and fencing, adding a touch of the artistic. But the
area's squirrels spotted the shells and have been launching attacks
with teeth and claws.
</P>
<P>
   For Phillips and his three-member building crew, it's a learning
experience. Jim Tullos has worked with Phillips for five years. He
began constructing the Victorian house nearly a year and a half
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built houses before, but never something like that,'' said
Tullos, 30, who added that he thought Phillips ``was a little bit
looney, but you have to give him the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is building a second house next to the Victorian home.
Tullos and his family will be the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Padon, 20, a workshop employee, comes over to ``do the
things the guys don't want to do'' like ``color-matching, painting
and cleaning up their mess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a marvelous house,'' she said. ``It spices up the whole
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Brine Robertson, who helped construct the Victorian house,
admits he ``didn't know what to think'' about the project. ``I
never saw a house built like that,'' Robertson said. ``But I would
love to live in a house like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' concern goes beyond housing for the homeless. The
workers receive ``a hamburger above minimum wage,'' but the
experience is invaluable for their rsums, he said. And thanks to
Phillips' encouragement, Padon has decided to attend Sam Houston
State in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' efforts have sparked interest in Huntsville. The
project attracts daily visits from the curious. Neighbors, and even
strangers, have donated materials and labor. City officials have
been ``cheerleaders,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has received seven more lots from owners who want him
to build homes. The lot owners will receive payment when the homes
sell.
</P>
<P>
   A new home invigorates old neighborhoods, Phillips said. But it
also helps families who would like their own affordable home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, recycling materials means less space taken up in
landfills _ a sore spot for Phillips, who is troubled by the
massive amounts of building materials being dumped and buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obscene,'' he said. Yet most cities prohibit anyone from
gleaning materials because of the fear of liability and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   He is upset with today's ``throwaway'' mentality that consigns
even usable materials to the scrap heap. Every house he builds
rescues materials from disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my missions is to use recycled materials and prove you
don't have to have new materials to build a house,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   And so far his experiment is working.

representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at

 For release: Tues., April 20 or thereafter  
 By GERALDINE A. FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In the early 1940s, I was a small child living in Newburgh, a
town 60 miles up the Hudson from New York City. Newburgh had a
substantial Italian-American population, many of them
first-generation immigrants from Italy.
 &HT;    And we were at war with Italy.
 &HT;    My father had come to America in 1920 and become a citizen soon
after, but he loved the country of his birth. He went back as often
as he could to visit his parents and siblings in Marcianese, a town
near Naples, until the war broke out and ended those visits.
 &HT;    The war was very real to our family. My mother's two youngest
brothers were in the Navy, and my cousins were represented in every
branch of the military, in every theater of the war.
 &HT;    And we were typical in other ways as well. To help the war
effort, my mother grew a ``victory garden.'' We all saved tin cans
and tin-foil gum wrappers that were collected each week, and my
father regularly bought War Bonds.
 &HT;    At one point, my mother said to my father, ``Do you realize,
Dominick, that you are giving the government money to send bombs
over your parents' heads?''
 &HT;    ``Of course I do,'' my father replied in his heavily accented
English. ``But God will protect them. Mussolini is wrong.''
 &HT;    That memory has come back to me over the past several weeks as
television and newspapers have brought images of other families
facing similar questions, this time the families of the
Serbian-American community.
 &HT;    The television reports out of Kosovo are depressingly familiar _
distraught refugees, lost children looking for parents, frantic
parents searching for children, women crying over dead family
members, the fragile elderly huddling together, sick and confused.
The stories of rapes, mass graves, summary executions and burning
villages all echo similar stories from 1993.
 &HT;    The place is different, though not so far away _ then it was
Bosnia-Herzegovina, now it's Kosovo. But the players are the same:
The oppressors are Serbs under the direction of Slobodan Milosevic,
and the oppressed are Muslims who have the misfortune to have made
their homes in an area which Milosevic covets for his Greater
Serbia.
 &HT;    I dealt with the Bosnian carnage firsthand. In 1993 I was
appointed as the American ambassador to the United Nations Human
Rights Commission. That June I testified before the bipartisan
Human Rights Caucus in Congress.
 &HT;    ``I feel strongly that the situation in the former Yugoslavia
could have been avoided, or at the very least contained, if we, the
world community, had been more vigilant,'' I told the caucus. ``I
mention this because I truly believe that the former Yugoslavia is
but the beginning.
 &HT;    ``The cold war is over,'' I said. ``The good news is that
repressive governments no longer control half the world. The bad
news is that those who have been repressed for so long have neither
the know-how or the money to convert to democracy.
 &HT;    ``I ask this Caucus to think ahead,'' I concluded, ``to look at
the emerging countries in Eastern Europe and figure out how we, the
United States government, can take the leadership in preventing
another Bosnia.''
 &HT;    The silence from Congress for the next six years was deafening.
 &HT;    In the meantime, the Clinton administration pressed for the
creation of an International War Crimes Tribunal and worked for a
diplomatic resolution to the Balkan crisis. But Milosevic, who
should have been indicted by the tribunal for his actions in
Bosnia, remained free and in control.
 &HT;    The results of that freedom and control are being played out in
Kosovo and on our television screens every night.
 &HT;    This is not merely a civil war. It is a continuation of the
premeditated armed aggression begun years ago by Serb leaders to
eliminate the ``problem'' of non-Serb populations under their
control.
 &HT;    To me, however, perhaps the most surprising aspect of the entire
Kosovo saga has been the fact that Milosevic's appeal to
nationalism has managed to span the Atlantic and reach Serb
communities throughout this country.
 &HT;    And, as I've watched the news shows and heard Serbian-Americans
blasting NATO and praising Milosevic, I've thought back again and
again to my father and his attitude about the war against
Mussolini.
 &HT;    He was right _ God did protect his parents. And during my 1984
campaign for vice president, I learned from a former GI that my
Uncle Angelo had been a member of the Italian resistance and had
saved that GI's life. Since my father died before the war ended, he
never knew that his younger brother was fighting on our side.
 &HT;    Were things different then? Did victims slaughtered by the
dictators of the 1930s shed a different, more valuable blood than
those being slaughtered today in Kosovo? Are raping, pillaging and
ethnic cleansing in the name of nationalism acceptable in the
1990s?
 &HT;    And, if not, I'm surprised we aren't hearing Serbian-Americans
saying, ``God will protect our families. Milosevic is wrong.''
 &HT;    Perhaps television is an irresistible allure _ protesting gets
coverage, supporting doesn't. And maybe patriotism is not cool in
today's irony-saturated world.
 &HT;    But in this age of freedom and broad ethnic tolerance in this
country, it wouldn't hurt for all of us who revel in our ethnicity
to remember that the word at the end of the hyphen is ``American.''
 &HT;    (Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former congresswoman and the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984, is a Manhattan-based
attorney.)

ONCE BUDGET WRAPS, ONSLAUGHT OF LOBBYISTS RESUMES  
 (ADV: THIRD AND LAST OF A SERIES) 
</HEADLINE>
 LAWS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Rep. Susan Gerard and her fellow ``Mushroom
Coalition'' members are sitting on the state House of
Representatives floor this morning, going through bills with the
other legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the signal comes from one lawmaker. House Speaker Jeff
Groscost is summoning the Mushrooms to his chamber. The group of
moderate Republicans rushes off, leaving the House without a
quorum.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors, Groscost gives the group the lowdown on the
latest state budget deal. Schools can have an additional $60
million over two years, but money for cities and community colleges
must come out of another fund.
</P>
<P>
   Grudgingly, all relent. Everyone has had to give up something.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard takes the opportunity to vent. She tells Groscost that
the budget could have been resolved more quickly if House leaders
hadn't ignored the group and if they had included all members in
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   With that, she excuses herself and returns to the House. Action
on the floor had been at a standstill because there weren't enough
members present.
</P>
<P>
   After the House breaks for lunch, some Mushroom
Coalition &UR; members hold a news conference in the House lobby. It's
been a long &UR; week and the lawmakers are showing signs of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Two snap at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barry Wong tells the press that thanks is owed to many
people &UR; for helping to obtain this budget. He includes Lisa Graham
Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you thanking Lisa Graham Keegan?'' Gerard demands.
``What &UR; did she do? Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, Wong says, ``Maybe I should retract that
statement?''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard walks out of the room, heads outside and paces the
Capitol &UR; Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would he do that? I can't believe it,'' Gerard says. Then,
feeling a bit guilty, she adds: ``Maybe I shouldn't have said that.
I don't &UR; know.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll need to consider those laments later. Lobbyists have
surrounded her. They want to know, is it true? Has the House agreed
on the budget? With the budget out of the way, the lobbyists know
that lawmakers can return to their bills.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them about the money for schools. What she didn't know
was that the Senate was already placing conditions on the extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   Back in her office, Gerard discovers lunch has been delivered to
the lawmakers, courtesy of State Farm Insurance. Lunch comes in a
box, made to look like a home, and filled with a brownie, macaroni
salad and a roll-up sandwich made with a tortilla that looks like
it contains sun-dried tomatoes. As a bonus, a State Farm key chain
with a tiny flashlight is included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you don't go out to lunch with the lobbyists, they
find a way to bring it to you,'' Gerard says. ``I hate these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   She sits at her desk and starts flipping through messages and
prioritizing them. She calls the &UR; Governor's Office about a
managed-care bill and answers a few questions on its status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need legislation on &UR; this,'' she tells the governor's
assistant. ``We need to get these idiots to talk to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The hour for her caucus meeting comes too soon. Gerard stuffs
messages into her pocket and heads out the door. This time, she
takes the back &UR; way. The route is restricted and allows lawmakers to
avoid the public. She shows the visitor where leadership hides out
and a tunnel that &UR; leads to the Senate Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never taken it,'' she confesses. ``But if you don't
want &UR; anyone seeing you cross the mall over to the Senate, you take
this.''
</P>
<P>
   That gives Gerard an idea. Even though the caucus has started,
she decides to visit her friends in the Senate. She looks in on her
buddy and mentor Sen. John Wettaw, R-Flagstaff. They talk about a
hideous lime-colored, velour couch in his office. They also talk
about the budget and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Two passing senators notice Gerard and ask to meet with her
privately. That's when she hears the rumors. The Senate wants to
extend the school year if the House decides to put more money
toward education.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing her purse, she heads to a caucus meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When she enters the room, lawmakers are fuming. The proposed
budget has taken another twist. Senate leaders have told the House
they won't approve the extra funds for schools unless the House
extends the school year by two days.
</P>
<P>
   Questions fly. Don't &UR; they realize that costs the schools money?
Will two days make a difference? Aren't we micromanaging the
schools? Let them decide how they want to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that most in the room are opposed to extending the
school year, Groscost ends the discussion and tells the group: ``We
don't have to do this, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   They agree not to, and the caucus meeting comes to a close after
4 p.m. Now, the waiting game begins again. The House staff needs to
get the paperwork together for a budget vote. That could take at
the minimum three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone braces for a late night. They finish with the budget
around midnight. Everybody got a little and had to give up a
little. No one was completely happy, but the tension was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday _ Lobbyists, constituents and an early morning vote.
</P>
<P>
   Morning comes too soon for Gerard.
</P>
<P>
   She finds herself rising a few hours after the budget vote to
attend a 7:30 a.m. district breakfast at the Sunnyslope Village
Alliance. And there's no time for a nap. Caucus meetings resume at
10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With the budget out of the way, House members listen to an array
of bills. At this hour, mobile slaughterhouses are monopolizing the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative analyst is explaining that mobile
slaughterhouses must now kill, clean and carve beasts on the
property of the person who owns the beast. They can no longer take
the beast to their business and do the work there.
</P>
<P>
   For at least an hour, the group discusses whether the law will
put some companies out of business, the techniques used and why
such a law is needed. Then, Rep. Franklin Flake is called upon to
give firsthand knowledge about the business, as his father owned
such a company.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard can no longer contain herself: ``I can't believe this. We
didn't discuss the budget this long,'' she says, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They work through lunch, break at 1:30 and go back onto the
floor at 2:30 p.m. for the committee of the whole, where bills are
debated and amended.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard spends her lunch hour with two lobbyists, who have been
waiting for her outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Howard and Roselyn O'Connell, lobbyists for Planned
Parenthood, ask Gerard for help clarifying the definition of
``abortion'' on a bill in the Senate. Gerard had helped to get the
bill through the House.
</P>
<P>
   They walk over to the Senate and meet with Sens. Ann Day and Sue
Grace. Howard and Gerard explain the dilemma. Day and Grace agree
to add an &UR; amendment. They all shake hands and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard crosses the mall and heads back to her office. &UR; But the
five-minute walk to the House floor takes nearly half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol's front doors, two stop her. Inside the
House &UR; doors, another motions her over. As she climbs the stairs,
another wants to talk for a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, everyone wants something,'' Gerard says.
</P>
<P>
   As she fumbles inside her purse for her cigarettes, a lobbyist
asks for her advice on a bill. Even though he doesn't smoke, he
pulls out a lighter and offers her a light.
</P>
<P>
   It's a warm day and lawmakers and lobbyists mill about outdoors.
Seeing two health care lobbyists, Gerard decides it's her turn to
ask for something.
</P>
<P>
   A low-income constituent is looking for prenatal care and having
difficulty finding any programs. Gerard stops a Department of
Health lobbyist and one from Maricopa County. Both tell her they'll
look into it and within 30 minutes, they are back with the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kathleen Dunbar's bill, pulled earlier in the week when she
opposed a budget deal favored by Senate leaders, is back on the
calendar now. Was leadership rewarding the Tucson Republican for
changing her position? Or did things just work out that way?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' Gerard says, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   To accompany her animal cruelty bill, Dunbar has brought along a
bulletin board with pictures of tortured animals. She invites
anyone on the floor to look at it, but no one does. The bill is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar says her decision to side with leadership wasn't an easy
one. In the end, Rep. Michael Gardner, also of the Mushroom
Coalition, helped her decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me you have to do what's right for you. And I thought
about my bills and my constituents,'' Dunbar says. ``But I was
honest about it. Some people aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the day goes. Today, the House adjourns about 5:30 and
Gerard goes home to collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Friday _ A day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rested on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawmakers didn't. And neither have the lobbyists _ a
stroll through the Wesley Bolin Plaza parking lot is a testament to
that.
</P>
<P>
   There's a silver Mercedes E320 with cream leather interior. Down
the way sits a red convertible BMW 325i. There are Jaguars, Volvos,
a few Lexus models and about a dozen assorted convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   With the budget out of the way, lobbyists know that lawmakers
will now be returning their attention to bills and amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard has phone calls to return and meetings to attend. Today,
she's scheduled to talk to St. Luke's Charitable Trust. She reads
bills that will be reviewed next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is for certain,'' she says. ``Next week won't be as
crazy as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The action, she confesses, will move to the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE LINGO &QL; 
House speaks its own tongue &QL; 
Like most businesses and industries, the Arizona House has a lingo
all its own. Here are some examples. &QL; 
COW: An acronym for ``Committee of the Whole,'' which is when the
representatives meet on the floor. Lawmakers, for instance, use the
term to say they are in ``cow'' or will be ``cowing.'' This is not
to be confused with having a cow, which also takes place on the
floor. &QL; 
They: This is an all-encompassing term for the House leadership,
which includes the speaker, chairman and majority leader. &QL; 
In the box: A reference to a general fund for House bills. When a
bill is put in the box, that means monies for it will come from the
general fund and it must compete with other measures for the
money. &QL; 
Mushrooms: A coalition of moderate House Republicans. The group got
the name because its members contended that leadership kept them in
the dark and covered them with bull. &QL; 
The Motowns: House Democrats who believe they rarely get
information on important events through proper channels. Their
motto: ``I heard it through the grapevine'' from a popular Marvin
Gaye song. &QL;

NAVAJOS SHUN RETURN OF BURIAL PLUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. - For almost 50 years in the late 1800s and
early 1900s, museums from across the country paid archaeologists to
excavate Southwestern Indian burial sites, collecting tens of
thousands of human remains and a huge assortment of pottery, crafts
and sacred items buried with the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But while most tribes in recent years have been working with
museums to get these items returned to their homelands, officials
for the Navajo Nation have been taking a cautious position.
</P>
<P>
   They're saying that _ at least for now _ they would just as soon
allow these items to remain in the museums.
</P>
<P>
   And this is despite the fact that the tribe is now beginning to
talk about putting up permanent exhibits at its new $8 million
museum, library and tourist center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been advised by (begin ital) hatathlie (end ital)
(medicine men) to be careful about what we ask to be returned by
the museums because they do not want anything exhibited at the
museum that was removed from a burial site,'' said Richard M.
Begay, head of the tribe's Traditional Cultural Program.
</P>
<P>
   The same attitude also seems to pertain to the thousands of
human remains that were collected by museums for research. While
other tribes have worked with museums like the Smithsonian and the
Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff to get the human remains
returned for reburial, Navajo officials say that their medicine men
and reservation communities have expressed no desire to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Begay, stems from Navajo traditions that
require Navajos to have nothing to do with death, either directly
or indirectly. Coming in contact with anything connected with human
remains, even with a pot buried with the body, requires the person
to go to a medicine man and have an expensive ceremony performed.
</P>
<P>
   And while museums usually have detailed records of where the
remains were excavated, Begay said that communities on the
reservation have told the tribe that they do not want the remains
reburied ``in their back yards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some talk about creating a cemetery on the
reservation to rebury the remains, but so far no community has
indicated a willingness to have it located in their area,'' Begay
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Speaker, who works with tribes on issues of repatriation
for the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., said the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, which started the
whole movement to return the items to the tribes, doesn't require
the tribes to take the items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to work with the tribes to return the items,''
he said. ``Or if they want us to keep storing them, we're willing
to do that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The remains have been a valuable tool for scientists, who have
used data collected from examining the bones to learn about the
lifestyles and history of the early inhabitants of the United
States. These include the average lifespan of early Native
Americans, diseases prevalent during their lives and even, to a
certain extent, what kinds of foods they ate.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller museums, such as the Museum of Northern Arizona,
collected human remains in the early part of this century for
study, although museum officials say no research is currently being
conducted with the remains they now have stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have been telling the museums is to take care of the
remains and see that they are stored properly,'' said Begay, who
added that the tribe doesn't have to worry about the remains being
exhibited as they were in many museums up to just a decade ago;
federal law now prohibits exhibiting human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Lomahaftewa, assistant to the director for Native
American Relations at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, said other
tribes have also indicated that they want to hold off return of
cultural items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some tribes want to wait until they have time to consult with
their elders,'' she said. ``Other tribes are not sure what to do
because maybe the ceremony for which the object was used isn't done
anymore. And other tribes just may not have the financial resources
to take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only cultural items the Navajos have been active in bringing
home are the medicine bundles that were used by old-time medicine
men.
</P>
<P>
   The bundles, which contain sacred items like corn pollen and
eagle feathers, were used by the medicine men in healing ceremonies
and were at one time actively being acquired by museums and private
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dave Wilcox, director of anthropology at the Museum of
Northern Arizona, said the museum returns medicine bundles to the
tribe once efforts have been made to contact the person who donated
the bundles to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard at times to find these people, but if we make a
good-faith effort to locate them and then can't, we go ahead and
proceed with returning the medicine bundle to the tribe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even here the tribe has been cautious in determining what it
wants returned, Begay said, because the bundles do not go to the
museum but are turned over to practicing medicine men who can use
them in their ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This becomes difficult if the medicine bundle was used for a
ceremony that is no longer practiced,'' Begay said. ``If that
happens, we have to store it until we can figure what to do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``the medicine bundles are still in demand by
private collectors,'' Begay said, ``even though it's against the
law to purchase them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said collectors search border-town newspapers for obituaries
of medicine man, and it's not unusual for relatives to get offers _
sometimes for hundreds of dollars _ for the deceased's medicine
bundle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to educate the people to turn these bundles back
to the tribe so that we can find someone who will be able to use
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't, the objects in the bundles will be returned to
their natural state after a ceremony has been conducted.'' &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI _ There's a hurricane brewing in the Caribbean, but it has
nothing to do with wind or rain.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders are outraged by a British government proposal
to restore full citizenship to its 13 remaining colonies, from the
Pacific to the Caribbean -- at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has ordered the island commonwealths to ditch the death
penalty and bans on homosexuality, and to tighten regulation of
offshore banking, the lifeblood of islands such as Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The colonies are to bring their laws into line with British
practice by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And if the colonies' local governments do not comply, Britain
will change their laws for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to seeing it done,'' said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cook unveiled the proposal before the British Parliament on
March 17 after months of wrangling over the citizenship issue. The
Parliament is expected to vote on the plan within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the move would end the ``strong sense of grievance''
felt in the territories since their citizenship rights were taken
away by the Thatcher government in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Caribbean, a region that's historically religious and
conservative, the demand to legalize homosexual acts, in
particular, has incited controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the community affairs minister in the Cayman
Islands, Julianna O'Connor-Connolly, said the Cayman Islands had a
``mandate from God'' to retain its ban on gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abide by the views of the vast majority of Caymanians who
live in a Christian community based on firmly held religious
beliefs that homosexuality should not be legalized,'' the
government said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   The homosexuality question became a hot-button issue last year
when the Cayman Islands prohibited an American cruise ship carrying
some 900 gay men from making a one-day stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Later anti-gay activists in Jamaica protested against a
scheduled performance by the Village People, a six-member band that
became gay icons in the late 1970s, causing the group to cancel
their concert.
</P>
<P>
   All this prompted U.S. gay and lesbian groups to boycott some
islands -- including the Caymans and Jamaica -- citing blatant and
widespread discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've continued to put pressure on these islands because we've
received reports of gay travelers feeling harassed in certain
places,'' said Augustin Merlo, executive director of the
International Gay &AMP; Lesbian Travel Association in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Islands have often found themselves torn between their
conservative cultures and a desire to attract tourism dollars from
gays and lesbians who represent a $47.3 billion travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Smith, tourism minister in the Bahamas, said most
Caribbean islands welcome gay tourists, although anti-homosexual
sentiments shouldn't come as a surprise in a region where churches
are often more pervasive than bars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, which is not a British colony but where
homosexuality is also illegal, one pastor has helped organize a
Christian group called Save the Bahamas that plans to lobby for
stricter sodomy laws as well as a ban on gay cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often said that when the United States sneezes, the
Caribbean catches the flu, so when morals decline in the United
States, they decline here,'' said Vaughn Miller, pastor of Nassau's
Resurrection Tabernacle Church.

<P>
   Britain's controversial plan would restore full citizenship
rights revoked in 1981 for colonies as far-flung as Anguilla in the
Caribbean to St. Helena halfway between Africa and South America to
the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, fearing vast migration among Hong Kong's 6.4 million
people ahead of the island's handover to China, Britain made people
in the colonies ``British subjects,'' stripping them of the
automatic right to live and work in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The change will give colonial residents ``the right to travel
freely throughout the European Union, and will enable their young
people to support themselves through work experience while they
study in Britain,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is particularly welcome in Montserrat, where most
of the island's 12,000 residents were evacuated due to an active
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   But in the British Virgin Islands, Chief Minister Ralph O'Neal
said London's demands smack of ``a form of imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no plans to scrap the death penalty. Rather he
wants to extend it to include drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda -- the oldest and wealthiest of the colonies -- has been
the most vocal in its opposition to the proposal, with some
residents suggesting independence.
</P>
<P>
   The island of 61,000 people has denounced what it sees as
Britain's attempt to threaten its tax haven status.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda has grown rich by encouraging offshore banking, an
industry that's been criticized for both its secretive rules and
for laundering illicit drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a referendum to decide whether or not the country
wants to be tied to the United Kingdom,'' said former Premier
Pamela Gordon. ``If not, then the only choice would be
independence.''

   MIAMI _ There's a hurricane brewing in the Caribbean, but it has
nothing to do with wind or rain.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders are outraged by a British government proposal
to restore full citizenship to its 13 remaining colonies, from the
Pacific to the Caribbean -- at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has ordered the island commonwealths to ditch the death
penalty and bans on homosexuality, and to tighten regulation of
offshore banking, the lifeblood of islands such as Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The colonies are to bring their laws into line with British
practice by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And if the colonies' local governments do not comply, Britain
will change their laws for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to seeing it done,'' said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cook unveiled the proposal before the British Parliament on
March 17 after months of wrangling over the citizenship issue. The
Parliament is expected to vote on the plan within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the move would end the ``strong sense of grievance''
felt in the territories since their citizenship rights were taken
away by the Thatcher government in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Caribbean, a region that's historically religious and
conservative, the demand to legalize homosexual acts, in
particular, has incited controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the community affairs minister in the Cayman
Islands, Julianna O'Connor-Connolly, said the Cayman Islands had a
``mandate from God'' to retain its ban on gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abide by the views of the vast majority of Caymanians who
live in a Christian community based on firmly held religious
beliefs that homosexuality should not be legalized,'' the
government said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   The homosexuality question became a hot-button issue last year
when the Cayman Islands prohibited an American cruise ship carrying
some 900 gay men from making a one-day stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Later anti-gay activists in Jamaica protested against a
scheduled performance by the Village People, a six-member band that
became gay icons in the late 1970s, causing the group to cancel
their concert.
</P>
<P>
   All this prompted U.S. gay and lesbian groups to boycott some
islands -- including the Caymans and Jamaica -- citing blatant and
widespread discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've continued to put pressure on these islands because we've
received reports of gay travelers feeling harassed in certain
places,'' said Augustin Merlo, executive director of the
International Gay &AMP; Lesbian Travel Association in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Islands have often found themselves torm between their
conservative cultures and a desire to attract tourism dollars from
gays and lesbians who represent a $47.3 billion travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Smith, tourism minister in the Bahamas, said most
Caribbean islands welcome gay tourists, although anti-homosexual
sentiments shouldn't come as a surprise in a region where churches
are often more pervasive than bars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, which is not a British colony but where
homosexuality is also illegal, one pastor has helped organize a
Christian group called Save the Bahamas that plans to lobby for
stricter sodomy laws as well as a ban on gay cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often said that when the United States sneezes, the
Caribbean catches the flu, so when morals decline in the United
States, they decline here,'' said Vaughn Miller, pastor of Nassau's
Resurrection Tabernacle Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we don't want that to happen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, senior strategist with the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based gay and lesbian lobbying group, said he is stunned
by discrimination in the Caribbean and that ``recalcitrant
protectorates'' were acting outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such discrimination against an entire group of people is
egregious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the conservative American Family Association has

to voice dissatisfaction with the government's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupelo, Miss.-based organization was the first to promote a
Disney boycott after Disney-owned studios produced such sexually
controversial movies as ``Priest'' and ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain can do what it wants, but we don't have to agree with
it, so what we're doing is encouraging travelers to spend their
tourism dollars in places other than England,'' said Allen Wildmon,
director of public relations for the American Family Association.

INNER VISION: ARTIST PAINTS FROM MEMORY, IMAGINATION &HT;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By BARBARA KARKABI 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was springtime 26 years ago when Joe Harris lost
his sight _ the victim of a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was walking back to his car after a quick trip to the
grocery store when shots rang out, and he fell to the ground. Hours
later he woke up in the hospital, his eyes covered with bandages.
Doctors told him that he was blind ... and that he would be blind
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened just like that,'' Harris recalled. ``I was minding
my own business. One minute I was seeing and the next, everything
was dark. I went back to being a little baby. I had to start all
over again. I was mad, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harris never let the anger poison him _ or keep him from
seeing the world's vivid colors and shapes in his mind's eye.
Eventually, after years of searching for his own style, Harris
learned to transfer the glistening blues, greens, reds and oranges
of his memory into paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The folk artist's first one-man show opened at the Blossom
Street Gallery &AMP; Sculpture Park in Houston last Saturday and runs
through May 4. A few days before the opening, Harris proudly sat in
front of the creations he can only touch and imagine. He's happy
that people seem to like his work and even happier that he learned
a way to express his inner vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A folk artist is someone who is self-taught,'' Blossom Street
owner Richard Roederer said. ``To me, he is the epitome of folk art
because he developed his own style. No one taught him how to do it.
He's as folk art as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 52, the former construction worker and truck driver has
traveled a long road and is proud of what he has accomplished. Six
months after he got out of the hospital, Harris went to a facility
in Kerrville to learn the skills he needed to function as a blind
person and return to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a door was closed to me and I made up my mind to keep
up with the world,'' Harris said. ``I was ready. I wasn't going to
let that anger keep me down and keep me from doing. It was just a
total new adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his injury, Harris tried drawing and painting, enjoying
it so much he began taking correspondence courses from a Minnesota
art school. But after the shooting, Harris was so focused on his
everyday life that he almost forgot about his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought about painting or drawing in awhile until one
day my mother called me,'' Harris recalled. ``She said, `J.B., are
you still painting and drawing?' I always take her at her word, so
I thought that meant I should do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Harris said, he began to think about how he
could paint. Though he retained the memory of shapes and colors, it
took him a long time to figure out how to transfer his ideas to
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   He began his attempts in the '80s and ruined a lot of canvases,
he admitted with a grin, before he ``got it right.'' Harris first
tried working with oil, then started sketching with colored
pencils. But neither approach worked. Then he got a raised-line
drawing kit, which allowed him to make an image he could feel with
his hand. That allowed him to start making drawings and sketches,
though he still didn't know how to transfer them to canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Harris next tried crayons and found that if he applied layer on
layer of colors and built the spot up, he could actually feel the
shapes with his fingers. Once he realized he could do that, Harris
said, his work took off. He now works with wax pastels and textured
surfaces such as sandpaper, so he can feel the surface and shapes,
like Braille. Even so, it's an elaborate process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me three to four weeks to do a piece,'' he said.
``And I have to make notes to myself from where I left off so I
remember what step I was at.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris gets his pastels, he has a friend or relative call
out the color so he can put them in a container marked with
Braille. Instead of drawing at an artist's easel, he works on a
flat surface, so he can bear down harder as he applies the various
colors.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of using wax pastels, Roederer explained, is that
they are dry when Harris applies them. Harris adds a coat of
varnish after each layer so he can feel the difference in texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe has no fear of color. That is one of the No. 1 things I
like about his paintings,'' Roederer said. ``The textured surfaces
and layers are excellent. To me he is just a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris can also tell by touch what color he is using because the
feel of the color changes. He applies more pressure to some colors
than others; for fruits he uses a light hand, but with trees he
really likes to ``dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Harris has taken several art courses at the
University of Houston to get a better feel for the use of color.
Besides his family, including his wife, Glenda, who is legally
blind, he has been helped and encouraged by a number of Houston
artists, including Jesse Lott and John Biggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Dr. Biggers at the Black Heritage Gallery, and he really
encouraged me to keep on going,'' Harris said. ``I was working on a
little piece, and I asked him to show me how to paint water. He
asked for me to put my hand on his to let me feel how he made the
stroke, and I could get the feel of how he was making the motions
with the water. He is real fast with his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott showed Harris how to make gravel surfaces to paint on,
though Harris prefers sandpaper, which is more predictable. One of
the 12 paintings in the exhibit is done on a gravel surface. It's
obvious that he loves colors, especially blues and greens _
predominant colors in his series ``The Garden,'' which also has
luscious red apples, a bright orange-yellow sun, and, in one
painting, a red-eyed snake peering over the brown branch of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do landscapes because when I paint it has to make
sense to me, so I have a better idea of what I am doing or trying
to do,'' Harris said. ``I would like to try more variety. I have
done a self-portrait by feeling my face.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Harris speaks calmly about his exhibit but says
he hopes it will launch his career and change his life. In the past
few years he has sold a number of paintings and has been in a group
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have people see what I do,'' he said. ``Some
people doubt that a blind person can paint. But I guess just
because you suffered a tragedy and it left you disabled, there is
no reason to quit living. You still need to try to pursue your
goals and ambitions. It's going to be a struggle but with effort
and perseverance you can overcome the disability.''

<P>
   In the three weeks of war in the Balkans it is estimated that
NATO planes have flown 6,000 missions and 800 cruise missiles have
been launched.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic result is that the Kosovo conflict has turned into a
catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians leaving
their homes and enduring appalling hardships. Many of them have
died in bombings or in the crossfire of fighting between the Kosovo
Liberation Army and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   With the war sowing death and destruction throughout Yugoslavia,
the damage to it has been estimated at $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the conflict, many people warned that a military
operation against Yugoslavia would be a mistake, an unwarranted and
disproportionate measure, and urged a political solution. NATO took
a different course, which has resulted in an ignominious failure _
a defeat for NATO and for the policy of force generally.
</P>
<P>
   This could have untold consequences for Yugoslavia and for all
of Europe, unless urgent steps are taken to stop this madness.
Henry Kissinger, who was initially critical of President Clinton's
actions, is now saying that if NATO is to avoid breaking up it
cannot afford a defeat in Yugoslavia. He is apparently little
concerned about what would happen to the Albanians or to the Serbs
in the event of NATOs ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the leaders of the alliance speak of a political
solution, they in fact mean Yugoslavia's capitulation. But that is
just another dangerous illusion, a way to unpredictable,
catastrophic developments. The only alternative to a wider conflict
is a search for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As I am writing this, news agencies report that the Turkish
authorities are conducting a major offensive against Kurdish
rebels. The long-seething conflict has erupted with fresh force,
but no one is saying a word. What will the United States and NATO
do? Give more weapons to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And in Colombia, another friend of the United States, where
20,000 people die each year and the number of refugees has exceeded
1 million, even U.S. newspapers are wondering why the United States
chooses to ignore the responsibility of Colombia's government for
that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why? This is more than just a double standard. A much
broader hidden agenda is now being revealed. It is clear that the
Kosovo problem could have been resolved politically and that NATO's
military action can only make things worse. It is also clear that
this is a no-win situation for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the United States in such a hurry, why was it not
interested in political solutions? On the eve of NATO's 50th
anniversary, the Kosovo conflict is cynically being used to show
the world who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is given to understand that the U.N.
Security Council and other international organizations are
ineffective, indeed helpless, thus forcing the United States to
``lead'' in this way. Even worse, to make arbitrary action look
legitimate, the conflict is being internationalized and other
countries are drawn into it, in a way that compromises them. But
that logic is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the United States
has been boycotting all attempts to reform the United Nations and
circumventing its Security Council. It has also thwarted efforts to
create a new European security architecture, as called for in the
Charter of Paris, thus forcing Europe to accept NATO's ``security''
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, the United States has defied the opinion
of Russia, China and India, which together represent half the
population of the world. It has shown its European allies that
Europe remains a political dwarf, that even its economic might
cannot stop U.S. hegemony. That, today, is how Washington envisions
a new world order.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior has already done serious damage to the
international system. The danger is becoming real that the Yugoslav
tragedy could engulf the entire Balkan region and even all of
Europe. Even if the conflict is stopped soon, it is clear that the
world could hardly go back to what it was before March 23.
</P>
<P>
   A new arms race appears inevitable. There are dozens of
countries where this ``model'' can be replicated _ creating and
exacerbating latent conflicts and then ``settling'' them with
bombs, cruise missiles and ``surgical strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was an imperfect world order based on
international organizations trying to resolve crises politically.
Now, nations will want to rely on arsenals of weapons. And since
sophisticated modern weapons are too expensive for most countries,
they will not play by the rules of the rich; instead, they will
seek weapons of mass destruction _ nuclear, chemical and
biological, which can be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, terrorism _ the cheapest weapon. No one can hope
to protect themselves from this dread threat with purely technical
or military means.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear to all that this is a road to disaster. Not
only Russian politicians but most ordinary Russians as well have
been badly shaken by the conflict. It is giving ammunition to the
forces of the past, those who were always against new thinking and
resented any reforms, any cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the Russian people are wise enough not to
allow their country to be drawn into a war. But it would be
irresponsible to ignore the fact that the danger of a wider
conflagration is growing. Of course, we should keep a clear head,
but Russia will now have to rethink a great deal in its strategy,
its treaties and certainly its relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be impossible to overcome the crisis at no cost _
but overcome it we must. The way out is to resume efforts to build
a new world order based on equitable cooperation of different
civilizations. No one has given NATO the kind of functions that it
has arrogated to itself and seems ready to proclaim as the basis of
its new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must resist the urge to try to manage increasing
global complexity with police operations. We must not condemn the
world to disorder.

<P>
   In the three weeks of war in the Balkans it is estimated that
NATO planes have flown 6,000 missions and 800 cruise missiles have
been launched.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic result is that the Kosovo conflict has turned into a
catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians leaving
their homes and enduring appalling hardships. Many of them have
died in bombings or in the crossfire of fighting between the Kosovo
Liberation Army and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   With the war sowing death and destruction throughout Yugoslavia,
the damage to it has been estimated at $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the conflict, many people warned that a military
operation against Yugoslavia would be a mistake, an unwarranted and
disproportionate measure, and urged a political solution. NATO took
a different course, which has resulted in an ignominious failure _
a defeat for NATO and for the policy of force generally.
</P>
<P>
   This could have untold consequences for Yugoslavia and for all
of Europe, unless urgent steps are taken to stop this madness.
Henry Kissinger, who was initially critical of President Clinton's
actions, is now saying that if NATO is to avoid breaking up it
cannot afford a defeat in Yugoslavia. He is apparently little
concerned about what would happen to the Albanians or to the Serbs
in the event of NATOs ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the leaders of the alliance speak of a political
solution, they in fact mean Yugoslavia's capitulation. But that is
just another dangerous illusion, a way to unpredictable,
catastrophic developments. The only alternative to a wider conflict
is a search for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As I am writing this, news agencies report that the Turkish
authorities are conducting a major offensive against Kurdish
rebels. The long-seething conflict has erupted with fresh force,
but no one is saying a word. What will the United States and NATO
do? Give more weapons to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And in Colombia, another friend of the United States, where
20,000 people die each year and the number of refugees has exceeded
1 million, even U.S. newspapers are wondering why the United States
chooses to ignore the responsibility of Colombia's government for
that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why? This is more than just a double standard. A much
broader hidden agenda is now being revealed. It is clear that the
Kosovo problem could have been resolved politically and that NATO's
military action can only make things worse. It is also clear that
this is a no-win situation for Europe.
</P>

MAKE LIFE EASIER BY PREPARING FOR DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As baby boomers lose their parents, many find
their grief woven thick with questions they can never answer. Such
as: Who are these people in these old photographs? What was life
like way back when? And: Where's the key to the safe deposit box?
</P>
<P>
   The solution, according to Lynn McPhelimy, is to get ready now.
It will bring you peace of mind. It will help your family cope. And
it's easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Her book, ``In the Checklist of Life: A Working Book To Help You
Live and Leave This Life!'' (AAIP Publishing, 1997), contains blank
work sheets for pertinent data from insurance and investment
information to family hiding places, letters to your children and
your choice of casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're alive and healthy, don't wait until you are dying to
plan your funeral,'' McPhelimy said. ``You have favorite songs.
It's very close to a wedding you've got your pallbearers, you've
got your readings and your songs. A funeral should be a celebration
of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers were so uncomfortable with McPhelimy's book that 15
rejected it, she said. One asked her: What do you think your market
is? She replied: ``Anyone who is breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, after selling 100,000 copies by word of mouth and
spots on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``The Today Show'' and
elsewhere, the Connecticut native travels the country trying to
convince others to plan for the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Too often when loved ones die, survivors spend months or years
coping with unresolved emotional and financial issues, McPhelimy
argues. McPhelimy's parents made it easy. Both were diagnosed with
terminal cancer in 1982. Her father started with the septic tank.
He sketched his daughter a map so she wouldn't dig up his beloved
garden. Her mother bought a special red-haired Cabbage Patch doll
to leave for her someday granddaughter. Today, McPhelimy's daughter
sleeps with the doll every night.
</P>
<P>
   From the meatloaf recipe to family secrets to the clothes they
wished to be buried in, McPhelimy's parents walked her through the
mysteries of dying.
</P>
<P>
   Her grief would be clear: She wouldn't miss her parents for the
wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, two months after McPhelimy's father died, the
septic tank needed pumping. ``I said, `This is not funny. I believe
in signs, but this is going a bit far.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about death is practical, loving and cathartic, hospice
workers say.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to terminally ill patients to tie up loose ends,
said Linda Covert, regional director of Community Hospice of Albany
County, N.Y.. ``Some people take bigger steps and walk right in.
Others back up, then go forward slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young parents often make videos or write letters to their
children. About 60 percent of hospice patients want to discuss
funeral arrangements, Covert said. She urges family members not to
dodge the ``death discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even splitting up the family furniture before isn't
cold-hearted, McPhelimy argues. ``If you say you want something
because of a special memory, then a story comes out and you get all
the fun stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to march up with the workbook and say, `I need
to know your Social Security number.' More people do want to talk
about it than you'd realize,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends a gentle approach. ``You can start it with a
photograph. Ask, `Who is that in the picture?' And then as you ask
about that eccentric aunt, more memories come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Covert recommends asking a terminally ill relative what they'd
like you to do to help. Tell them why they are important to you.
And sometimes, just being there is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what families don't realize is that they don't have
to talk,'' Covert said.
</P>
<P>
   And even after someone has died, families can write down
cherished memories or identify old photographs, McPhelimy said.

</P>

COURTHOUSE RISES FROM ASHES SIX YEARS AFTER FIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBORO, Texas _ What locals saw on Jan. 2, 1993, the morning
after the fire, was enough to break their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The palatial limestone Hill County Courthouse _ Waco architect
Wesley Clark Dodson's 1890 Second Empire-style monument to civic
pride _ lay in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The third and second floors had collapsed. The basement was
flooded. Vital documents stored in fireproof vaults, though not
burned, were saturated with water. The ornate, three-tiered clock
tower beloved by generations had tumbled and disintegrated in a
shower of sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could stand on the first floor,'' County Judge Kenneth
Davis ruefully recalled, ``and look up at the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such a calamity, many communities might have called
in the bulldozers and started over. But in Hill County, the grand
old edifice in the heart of town was more than a utilitarian
structure in which births were recorded and malefactors went to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The grand old edifice was the town's heart.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the centerpiece of Hillsboro's historic downtown,
which played a major part in the city's growing tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, within days, county officials, aided by the Texas
Historical Commission and other agencies and foundations, launched
an ambitious campaign not only to rebuild the burned-out building
from the ground up, but to make it even better.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, after six years and roughly $10 million, the
restored courthouse will make its debut. Gov. George W. Bush will
offer the dedication speech. Then Hill County native Willie Nelson
will sing the building's praises in a benefit concert to help pay
off a $250,000 balance.
</P>
<P>
   But the real star will be the courthouse, which will be open to
the public for the first time since the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted the fire,'' said Brad Patterson, a Texas
Historical Commission preservation consultant whose jurisdiction
includes Hill County, ``but it's amazing what came out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   What had been a down-at-the-heels, often modified and patched
public building _ its inside walls painted institutional pea green
_ now is a showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Stained glass accents have been returned to the multi-story
arched windows. Hardwood flooring removed from the Texas Capitol
during its restoration has been installed to replace grimy
terrazzo. Vaulted ceilings that had been lowered have been restored
to their soaring glory and sheathed in a dazzling armor of pressed
tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hill County Courthouse,'' Bush said, ``is a magnificent
piece of architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire had an impact far beyond this north central Texas farm
community. Bush called the blaze the ``driving force'' behind his
Courthouse Preservation Initiative, a plan to provide public money
for restoring the state's remaining 225 historic courthouses. &UR;  &LR; Last
week, the Texas House approved an appropriations bill that provided
$100 million for such use.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also strengthened a historical commission effort to
survey the state's old courthouses and make recommendations for
their repair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the survey is incomplete, Patterson said it already has
revealed ``conditions probably are worse than we anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've found across the board,'' he said, ``is that
counties used a Band-Aid approach. They fixed the plaster, but
didn't fix the roof leak and it continues to leak over the years.
We found dangerous conditions in some places. Virtually all of them
need upgrades _ heating and cooling. Some counties didn't have
computers. And if they did, they'd blow the fuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one case, there clearly was an electrical problem, but the
circuit breakers wouldn't trip. We went up to look and there were
no circuit breakers to trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the Hill County fire was started by an
electrical short in or near the third-floor office of District
Attorney Dan Dent.
</P>
<P>
   Dent recalled he had gone to his office New Year's Day to
prepare for an upcoming jury trial. It already was dark at 6 p.m.
when Dent got his files, turned off the fluorescent lights and
headed home.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, passers-by saw flames shooting from the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 6:15,'' said Davis, ``the fire was well out control.''
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that the courthouse was on fire, thousands of
area residents mobbed the town square. There, in a steady drizzle
and temperatures in the high 40s, many wept as they watched
firefighters' futile efforts to control the conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of sadness,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the ordeal, the 70-foot-tall clock tower fell
with a crash of doom.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some residents began lobbying for clearing the town
square of rubble and building anew. That's what was done when a
courthouse was burned by an arsonist in the 1870s, they noted. And,
despite the town's affection for the courthouse, it wasn't the
original _ it was the fifth incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been talk like that,'' said Sherry Hayes,
Hillsboro's Main Street Program and tourism director. ``But among
county officials, it didn't get a lot of consideration ... I'd say
the decision to rebuild came almost immediately. They were out
there the next day, moving stuff out. They started making phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the first floor and the limestone walls _ in some
places 2 feet thick _ were found to be sound. First-floor
furnishings were salvaged, refinished and returned to use.
Water-logged county documents were pulled from their soggy
surroundings and freeze-dried.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the projected cost for restoration was placed at $6
million, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it was $7 million, then $8 million, then $9 million,'' he
said. The final cost will be about $10 million. An insurance
settlement brought $3.5 million. The rest, with the exception of a
$250,000 balance, came from private donations, overnment and
foundation grants and county certificates of obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillsboro was the first Main Street Program city designated in
Texas,'' the historical commission's Patterson said. ``They got the
conservation ethic kind of early. They persevered. It took a lot of
time, effort and money, but they struggled through it. They always
had the goal of restoration in mind and it looks like they've
achieved it. It's really quite a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the courthouse, Hill County residents _ present and
former _ said, was just the natural thing to do. The building was
``a shrine, a place of beauty,'' said Houston Chronicle associate
publisher and editor Jack Loftis, a Hill County native who helped
organize Saturday's ceremonies.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``We were raised with it,'' he said. ``We played around it. We
were in it for serious business matters. It was so much a part of
everyone's life, it didn't seem right not to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, thousands of Hill County farm families would
congregate at the courthouse on Monday trade days, buying and
selling produce when such markets really were ``farmers markets.''
Politicians _ William Jennings Bryan, Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson _
thrilled locals with oratory from the second-floor balcony.
</P>
<P>
   The county judge, who as a youth blasted sparrows and pigeons
out of the eaves with his BB gun, recalled that for 18 months after
the fire he habitually glanced toward the then-absent clock tower
to check the time. ``I never knew I was such a creature of habit,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a black hole in the center of town,'' Hayes, the
tourism director, added. ``At night, there would be lights all
around it. But it would be black. The darkness was so strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Vignettes of the courthouse flickered through the memory of
retired Hillsboro lawyer Donald Eastland, a lifelong resident. He
recalled when the courthouse housed the town library, the district
courtroom hosted Boy Scout ceremonies and barbecue tables were
spread in the lobby for a town festival.
</P>
<P>
   Old men, he remembered, would perch on benches across the street
in Bond's Alley to ``whittle, spit and criticize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had benches on both sides of the alley,'' he said.
``They'd sit in the shade in the morning, then go home for lunch
and come back and sit in the shade on the other side in the
afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who grew up in the Hill County town of Abbott, visited
the courthouse ruins with a friend shortly after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was depressing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things happened in that courthouse,'' the singer
recalled. ``On Wednesday nights, they would have singing in the
courthouse _ a lot of old gospel singers. My grandparents were some
of them. I would go with them. I thought it was incredible they
would let us use the courthouse to do singing. It was part of my
growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, born in 1933, recalled walking through the courthouse as
a boy, when he rode the train to Hillsboro to see cowboy movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a regular spot,'' he said. ``We'd walk around it. The
big marble halls seemed sort of awesome to me at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the Hill County Courthouse that the young Nelson first
encountered restroom graffiti, and he remembers it still: ``Bulls
with short horns have a force that's weak. You better stand close,
or you'll pee on your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of happy hours there,'' Nelson continued.
``When it was gone, it was just like a big hole in Hillsboro. That
courthouse meant a lot to people, more than we even thought at the
time.''

   NY-KUNZ-LANDMARK (New York) _ Gray Kunz, the four-star chef
without portfolio, has generated nearly as much talk about his
search for a space for his own restaurant as he did while cooking
at Lespinasse. Finally he is hoping to open in Lever House, the
landmarked office building high above Park Avenue. Kunz hopes to
join a growing contingent of New York restaurateurs who have
discovered the advantages of recyling grand old spaces into
culinary pleasure palaces. By Marian Burros.

   SIMILI-COOKING (Bologna, Italy) _ Bologna is a city that lives
on its stomach. True, it has Italy's leading university. It fields
a pretty good soccer team, too. But Bologna's real study and its
true sport is food. Its markets are unrivaled in Europe. The
legendary Tamburini food shop is paradise on earth. And then there
are the Simili sisters. Margherita and Valeria Simili are doing
what they have been doing all their lives _ they cook and bake. And
for the last 13 years, they have run a little cooking school,
founded with the help of Marcella Hazan, one of their biggest fans,
that is one of the city's most valuable hidden assets. By William
Grimes.

 &HT;    Delta admits fliers bumped
 &HT;    to put exec's kids in first class
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First-class passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight
last month got bumped to coach to make room for a top executive's
children, according to an account circulated by pilots.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman acknowledged the incident, described in a
pilot union newsletter and posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Tom Slocum conceded ``several mistakes'' were made in
the way Delta employees handled the children of Chief Financial
Officer Warren Jenson on a March 4 Atlanta-Denver flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Slocum said Jenson wasn't present and had no direct
involvement, adding the youths also were blameless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were there this never would have happened,'' Slocum
said. He added Jenson, who joined Delta last year from NBC,
reimbursed the airline more than $1,000 for the cost of vouchers
given to the bumped passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sorry this situation occurred and has accepted full
responsibility,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said the airline ``isn't going to quibble with the
facts'' laid out in the article, as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Jenson's secretary brought three of his children and one of
their friends to the gate for Flight 969 as it was about to depart.
First-class was full, but there were open seats in coach. The
secretary had an agent move first-class passengers to coach so the
youths could sit up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight attendants and pilots were incensed,'' the unsigned
article said. ``They had been ready for an on-time departure and
now members of a senior manager's family were causing a delay and
inconveniencing passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight left 24 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   The article said the Jenson children's friend _ who, unlike
them, was ineligible to fly free _ had a discount coach ticket but
got the first-class upgrade free. That violates a policy championed
by Jenson in which agents cannot waive ticketing rules in most
cases, the article said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum declined to provide any additional details. He said Delta
``sincerely regrets any inconvenience to any customers'' on the
flight.

SAN FRANCISCO GIVES THE BOOT TO PUBLIC ART 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is some irony in the San Francisco
Transportation Authority rejecting The Foot, an 18-foot sculpture
that was to have been placed on the city's waterfront. The $475,000
sculpture represented the only reliable form of transportation in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But it also represented the most reliable way to cause a stink
in San Francisco: Propose a piece of public art.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Authority (the Board of Supervisors wearing
conductors' hats) rejected The Foot on Monday by a vote of 6-4. The
supervisors didn't know much about art, but they knew what the
public disliked.
</P>
<P>
   I was almost sad to see The Foot go, or more precisely, not be
built at the foot of Market Street. It'll be great to escape all
the lousy foot puns, though.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Supervisor Mark Leno, who voted for The Foot, we
had a good laugh about it, even though I thought it was a
pedestrian idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, this drew attention, provoked thought and raised
criticism, the way art should,'' Leno said. ``Any art worth any
value would bring out voices of displeasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, The Foot made us laugh and propose alternative body
parts that would better represent San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Now that The Foot has been rejected, we can put a sculpture of
The Finger on the waterfront. It's the San Francisco national
symbol, judging by what you see in car windows, and no one finds it
as obscene as a foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have heard some of the testimony,'' Leno said.
``One woman said it's sexist because it's clearly a white, male
foot. An Asian man said it's an insult to his culture because the
head is the crown of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that gives us that big a laugh these days is almost
worth the half mill. The money for the Buster Simpson sculpture was
supposed to come out of funds set aside for public art, so don't
tell me you'd rather see it used to fill potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, public works crews are working all over San Francisco
as the mayoral election nears, and they work slowly enough to be
called road sculptors.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, their work won't endure as long as Rodin's.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Authority still has $475,000 that has to be
spent on public art on the Embarcadero, so the question now is what
to spend the money on.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't reach Stanlee Gatti, head of the Art Commission.
Perhaps this energetic, humorous guy was conjuring up some Silicon
Valley art for the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's having Apple Computer build a giant mouse, to take
the place of the giant spider he once proposed be put on the gilded
dome of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the public can send in all its ideas for art on the
Embarcadero. You see if you can do better than a foot. Any pierced
body parts will do.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, the public has a notion it has more taste than
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The public would have voted down the Transamerica Pyramid, had
it been put to a vote. It was considered tacky. Now it's tacky to
consider anything tacky, particularly if it looks like a building
from ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Bridge would never be approved today. It would
have to be strung with suicide barriers, barriers between lanes and
tracks for trains no one in Marin would ever take to work. No one
would like the reddish paint, and would demand real gold instead.
</P>
<P>
   The western span of the Bay Bridge would never be allowed today
because it's so industrial looking. It would have to look delicate
and highly strung, like the sensibilities of residents of
post-industrial San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The only piece of public art passed by a public referendum
recently was a stadium and adjoining mall. Consider that. People
voted for it because they consider 49ers football the highest of
arts in the Bay area, and it's true.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the public really hates about public art is that San
Francisco always has to go to Seattle to find an artist. What's
wrong with San Francisco? Is it a city of live/work lofts filled
with artists of stocks and bonds, and sculptors of their own
bodies? Don't answer that.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like public art, go out and make your own. Nobody
is going to like it anyway. But you'll be rich.
</P>

'70S FONDUE FAD IS HOT AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just as fashions in clothes, music and other
facets of life come and go, so do fashions in food. And with things
retro ``in'' and chic these day, everything old is new again. So
it's not surprising that fondue _ fashionable in the '60s and '70s
_ is making a return appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Dip dining is convenient, fun, easy on the hostess
and great for entertaining a small, intimate group in a casual,
participatory dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rodgers, author of the recently released ``Fondue, Great
Food to Dip, Dunk, Savor and Swirl'' (William Morrow; $14),
attributes the renewed interest in fondue ``to a whole new
generation of cooks who are finding out how much fun it is and how
easy it is. I knew fondue was making a comeback when I went to an
industry gourmet products show two years ago and saw mountains of
new very sturdy, extremely well-made fondue pots made by the
Cadillacs of the equipment business like Le Creuset and
Calphalon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of fondue pots have increased 20 percent yearly for the
last three years, according to Ann Knutson, manager of public
relations at the West Bend Company in West Bend, Wis. Today's pots
are basically the same as those that have been around since the
'60s, but with updated styling that includes a nonstick interior
and a dishwasher-safe pot.
</P>
<P>
   At Le Creuset, fondue pots sales are also on the rise (20
percent growth in the last two years), said Doug Richardson, vice
president of marketing. ``What's driving the renewed interest is
the idea of breaking bread together and sharing a meal that fits
with the home entertainment trends that we've seen for over a
decade now.''
</P>
<P>
   Casual, laid back, hassle-free, uncomplicated, relaxing
entertaining is what people are interested in these days, noted
Barbara Caplan, a partner in the Norwalk, Conn.-based Yankelovich
Partners Inc., a market research firm that measures how people
live, how they approach food and their attitudes. ``People want to
be hosts, not chefs. They want to create a pleasant experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of fondue is in part due to younger families
serving it who are remembering it from their childhood, said Marlys
Bielunski, director of food communications for the National
Cattlemen's Beef Association in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good way to participate in a meal. ... It is a slow
way to eat and have conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bielunski doesn't think the interest in fondue today will rise
to the level of the '60s and '70s, but ``it is probably filling a
niche to bring families and couples together to have an effortless
but meaningful, fun evening with social interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Fondue's popularity is also on the rise on the local restaurant
dining scene. At La Fondue Bourguignonne in Sherman Oaks, owner
Robert Chicha noted, ``Last year was our best year ever, and this
year is off to a good start. More people are family oriented _ and
the restaurant is a good place to bring teen-agers. People like a
fondue meal because it is active, keeps them busy and offers
something to do at the table. The food is hot all the time _ and
you can take your time eating. It can also be very romantic,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A French native, Chicha opened his first fondue restaurant in
Westwood in 1970 (it closed in 1990) while the dish was at its
height of popularity. ``I decided to serve beef fondue because the
restaurant kitchen was too small for conventional cooking. With
fondue, most of the cooking is done in the dining room _ not the
kitchen.'' Even though the restaurant has had its ups and downs
over the years, Chicha has stuck with fondue because of the
customer following and his belief in the concept.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Chicha served only beef fondue (with oil) but
added cheese and chocolate fondues to the menu more than 15 years
ago. About 10 years ago, with the increased interest in healthy
dining, he began offering a wine-based broth cooking mixture.
</P>
<P>
   The complete dinner is the most popular menu selection. It
includes cheese fondue as an appetizer, a salad, an entree fondue
(with chicken breast, scallops, shrimp or filet mignon or a
combination) with a choice of either cottonseed oil or broth for
cooking, and chocolate fondue for dessert. Five dipping sauces _
sweet and sour with pineapple, tomato sauce with parsley and
garlic, bearnaise sauce, sour cream and chives (with garlic salt)
and a house sauce (cream, garlic and nutmeg) _ accompany the
entrees.
</P>
<P>
   Chicha serves the cheese fondue with cut-up day old French
bagette cubes, cornichons, small cooked potatoes and fresh mushroom
quarters. Chocolate fondue dippers include marshmallows and thin
wafer cookies along with an assortment of in-season fresh fruits
such as strawberries, bananas, pineapple, grapes, blueberries,
melons, apple, plums, tangerines, nectarines or apricots.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant uses candles to heat the chocolate or cheese
fondues in ceramic pots. Broth and oil fondues are heated in metal
fondue pots placed over electric heating elements built into the
dining tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fondue is not a fad _ it is a classic, and it is here to
stay,'' said Rodgers. But there's more to the fondue of the '90s
than the traditional trio of favorites.
</P>
<P>
   In his cookbook, Rodgers has tossed an explosion of updated
flavors and ingredients _ like roast garlic, sun-dried tomatoes,
fresh ginger, balsamic vinegar, designer mushrooms, capers, smoked
salmon, goat cheese, mascarpone, gorgonzola and more _ into the
appetizer and entree fondue pot with mouthwatering results.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgonzola, Port and Walnut Fondue, Sun-Dried Tomato Pizza
Fondue, Duck Fondue With Asian Orange Sauce and Swordfish Fondue
With Tapenade Mayonnaise are just a few of the many
tempting-sounding creations. And in the dessert realm, it may be
difficult to resist a terrific Fresh Cherries Jubilee Fondue,
Tiramisu Mascarpone Fondue or Peach Caramel Fondue.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who ranks the fabulous Peanut Butter and Milk Chocolate
and the incredible Italian Fontina and Porcini fondues among his
favorites, puts many new faces on the traditional topic with his
more than 50 innovative ideas.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to serving cheese-style fondues (he prefers them
to fried fondues, which require longer cooking time) for an entree,
Rodgers always offers guests a platter of vegetables, cooked
shrimp, cooked chicken breast and cooked roast beef in addition to
bread cubes. In addition, he always serves a chunky salad like
romaine with grapefruit, cucumbers, sweet onions and a nice
vinaigrette so people get filled up. Rodgers prefers to serve only
one fondue creation per meal _ not two or three. If the entree is
fondue, dessert will be something else _ not a sweet fondue.
</P>
<P>
   Grab that old fondue pot off the shelf in your closet or
purchase a new, stylish one and get cooking. Fondue is back in
vogue. &UR;  &QL;

   &LR; CLASSIC SWISS THREE-CHEESE FONDUE
</P>
<P>
   Swiss cheese shops combine different shredded cheeses to make
their own proprietary fondue mixes. This version uses three of
Switzerland's greatest cheeses: Gruyere for its full flavor,
Emmentaler for nuttiness and Appenzeller for sharpness. If you can
get only one or two of these cheeses, don't worry _ use about 1
pound (trimmed weight) of whatever you can get and make your own
house blend. It will still be delicious. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
1 garlic clove &QL; 
1 cup dry white wine &QL; 
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice &QL; 
8 ounces Gruyere cheese, rind trimmed and discarded and shredded
(about 2 1/2 cups) &QL; 
8 ounces Emmentaler cheese, rind trimmed and discarded and shredded
(about 2 1/2 cups) &QL; 
3 ounces Appenzeller cheese, cut into small cubes (about 1/2 cup) &QL; 
4 teaspoons cornstarch &QL; 
1 tablespoon kirsch &QL; 
Few gratings of fresh nutmeg &QL; 
Freshly ground pepper to taste &QL; 
Choice of dipping ingredients: crusty mixed-grain bread, French OR
Italian bread, cut into bite-size cubes (leave a piece of crust on
EACH cube); skinless cooked chicken breast; boiled new potatoes;
blanched asparagus spears, broccoli florets OR cauliflower florets
</P>
<P>
   Rub inside of a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan with garlic;
discard garlic. Add wine and lemon juice and bring to a bare simmer
over medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, toss Gruyere, Emmentaler and Appenzeller
cheeses with cornstarch. A handful at a time, stir cheese mixture
into wine, stirring first batch until it is almost completely
melted before adding another. Fondue can bubble gently, but do not
boil. Stir in kirsch and season with nutmeg and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to a cheese fondue pot and keep warm over a fondue
burner. Serve immediately, with dipping ingredients of your choice.
Makes 4 to 6 servings.
</P>

   AMERICAN SWISS CHEESE FONDUE: Domestic Swiss cheese is not as
fully matured as imported Swiss cheese, but it can make a fine
fondue. Substitute 1 pound domestic Swiss cheese, cut into tiny
cubes; finely shredded, for the Gruyere, Emmentaler and Appenzeller
cheeses.

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice &QL; 
1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (5 cups) &QL; 
2 ounces freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (1/2 cup) &QL; 
1 tablespoon cornstarch &QL; 
Freshly ground pepper to taste &QL; 
Choice of dipping ingredients: crusty sourdough bread, cut into
bite-size cubes (leave a piece of crust on EACH cube); cooked

</P>
<P>
   Transfer artichoke mixture to a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Add wine and lemon juice and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
</P>

AIDS GROUPS SEE DECLINE IN DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While stock-rich philanthropies are giving away
more money than ever, foundation support for AIDS causes has
dropped sharply in the past three years, according to a nationwide
survey of charitable foundations released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in foundation giving mirrors widespread reports of a
steep drop in individual donations to AIDS groups in many parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for organizations in San Francisco has largely held up
because of consistent giving from corporations and individuals. But
their counterparts in cities like Boston and New York are facing
million-dollar shortfalls and have cut up to a quarter of their
staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Groups, such as the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, expect they,
too, will be facing significant belt-tightening in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   All are having to adapt to a changing fund-raising climate that
includes donor fatigue and the sense that the disease, which is now
treatable, is no longer an urgent priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemic is `old news,''' said Jane Breyer, development
director for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. ``It's getting
harder and harder to get people engaged. Folks are burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the booming stock market is credited with a record 22
percent increase in foundation giving overall last year, HIV-AIDS
funding is going down, the survey found. Health-related grants in
general are also up, according to Funders Concerned About AIDS, a
group that promotes the cause among foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly $16 billion in foundation grants given in 1997,
$30 million went to AIDS-HIV causes. That was down from $37 million
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The survey commissioned by Funders Concerned About AIDS found
that the core group of philanthropic supporters who give most of
the money for AIDS and HIV was shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Foundations and organizations granting at least $50,000 per year
fell 22 percent since 1997, the survey found. Eight percent of
those donors told surveyors they expected to cut their AIDS funding
this year.
</P>
<P>
   While some foundation officers said they were unimpressed with
the quality and quantity of grant proposals from many AIDS groups,
others apparently don't feel the disease merits the attention it
once did, said Paul DiDonato, executive director of Funders.
</P>
<P>
   More people than ever are living with HIV, and it is spreading
like wildfire in parts of the developing world. So it is
distressing to see that while overall foundation giving increased
41 percent in the past two years, AIDS funding went down, DiDonato
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going through the roof, while AIDS grant making _ I won't
say it's going through the floor, but it is seeing a noticeable,
verifiable decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, is an
affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) weakens
the immune system, subjecting the body to serious infection. AIDS
is most often spread through sexual contact, sharing contaminated
needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just foundation support for AIDS programs that is
declining. Individual donors aren't giving as much, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the topic right now for us, and it has been for some
time,'' said Don Spradlin, associate director for major gifts at
Maitri, a San Francisco organization that was founded as a Buddhist
hospice for gay men with AIDS. ``The community does not any longer
view AIDS as an urgent issue.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With protease inhibitors keeping people with HIV alive much
longer, the need for hospice care has diminished, although not
disappeared. Spradlin's organization recently shortened its name
from Maitri AIDS Hospice and broadened its mission to care for
people with HIV who need 24-hour nursing, whether they are facing
imminent death or not.
</P>
<P>
   Two other San Francisco-based AIDS service organizations,
Project Open Hand and Shanti, combined office space in December to
save costs.
</P>
<P>
   Shanti Executive Director Bob Rybicki said they also had held
the line on salaries and had branched out into training other
groups on how to care for people with terminal illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Foundation also is planning for an expected decline in
donations. The organization has already seen a sharp drop in
foundation funding, but since that is not its major source of
income, the effect has not been severe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York has cut about
25 percent of its staff positions, and the AIDS Action Committee of
Massachusetts is facing a $1 million shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very lucky in the Bay area,'' Breyer said. He said a
number of corporations _ the Charles Schwab brokerage firm, the Gap
clothing retailer, Wells Fargo Bank, the Chevron Corp. and American
Airlines _ ``were there in the beginning, and they have really
stuck by us.''
</P>
<P>
   And while AIDS walks and bike rides nationwide have fewer
participants in recent years, proceeds from San Francisco's AIDS
Walk last year stayed the same _ about $3.6 million. But that
probably won't last, Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be honest with you: I am going into this (summer's)
walk assuming we will not'' do as well as in the past, she said.

RISK-TAKING ACTRESS LIVES HERMETIC EXISTENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What is reality?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate psychedelic era question is back in vogue again,
what with mind-bending, is-it-real-or-is-it-virtual movies like
``The Matrix,'' ``Open Your Eyes'' and David Cronenberg's latest,
``eXistenZ,'' filling theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The same question applies to ``eXistenZ's'' star, the
professionally provocative, personally subdued Jennifer Jason
Leigh. In her work, she's been as bold as an actress can be, even
in an age when outrageous risks have been a badge of artistic
seriousness. But off screen, the 37-year-old actress is a shy,
bookish homebody whose idea of a good time is playing with her dog,
immersing herself in research and nerding around on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really need to be flamboyant,'' she explains. ``Plus,
I don't have the energy for it, let alone the inclination.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more contradictions. Though she's a child of Hollywood
_ Dad was the late actor Vic Morrow, Mom is screenwriter Barbara
Turner, and she took the middle name as a tribute to family friend
Jason Robards _ the actress has always leaned creatively toward the
independent film movement, especially its most extremely
independent faction. And even on the rare occasions when she's made
studio pictures, Leigh has opted for dramatically interesting over
star-making roles.
</P>
<P>
   From her earliest work as one of TV's first anorexics in ``The
Best Little Girl in the World,'' Leigh has created an indelible
gallery of troubled women. There was one of the movies' most
memorable pregnant teen-agers in ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.''
There have been enough dysfunctional relations to fill a Corleone
family reunion (``Sister, Sister,'' ``Georgia,'' ``Dolores
Claiborne,'' ``Bastard Out of Carolina''), and she's played enough
numbed-out sex workers to stock an escort service (``Miami Blues,''
``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' ``The Men's Club,'' ``Short Cuts''). The
list of self-destructives ranges from ``Single White Female's''
psycho roommate to the brilliant Dorothy Parker (``Mrs. Parker and
the Vicious Circle'') to ``Cabaret's'' Sally Bowles in the hit
Broadway revival.
</P>
<P>
   Having just come off that demanding, audience-interactive
musical _ her first major live theater job _ Leigh looks
particularly waiflike, having chopped off most of the hair she dyed
black for the role. Anything that dark can't be bleached back to
her natural light blond, she explains, so the hair was just one
more sacrifice made for her art.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of dedication, coupled with her willingness to
push the behavioral envelope, that convinced Cronenberg that Leigh
could bring his ``eXistenZ'' to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer playing the lead in this movie was not just about
acting, but the kind of tone and ambience she can create,'' says
Cronenberg, whose films _ ``Dead Ringers,'' ``Videodrome,'' ``Naked
Lunch,'' ``Crash'' _ mix astute philosophical speculation with
alarming, grotesque imagery. ``She can be beautiful and sexy and
glamorous, which she is in this movie, but also nerdy and shy and
withdrawn. She can do all of that stuff totally convincingly and
then morph from one of those moods into the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh agrees that the collaboration with the biotech-obsessed
Cronenberg was a match made in cyberpunk heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's just got such an original vision, full of
extraordinary details,'' she says. ``I love working with people who
really stick by their vision _ and it's something that they want to
do, not something they're hoping to please a bunch of people with.
And sometimes there were three levels of reality going on, which
made it challenging but also lots of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the strange, near-future world of ``eXistenZ,'' which opens
Friday, Leigh plays Allegra Geller, an introvert who blossoms in
the elaborate, make-believe worlds of the best-selling
virtual-reality games she creates. By this time, games have evolved
beyond computer and video screens into semi-organic entities that
plug into players' bioports (insertion jacks mechanically installed
at the base of their spines), so the hallucinatory program can
interact with the players' central nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   This lucrative, addictive technology has entranced millions and
inspired a Realist underground of radicals opposed to people
spending their consciousness in this virtual dream world. They've
put a price on Allegra's head, and with an inexperienced bodyguard
(Jude Law) she tries to escape their assassins both inside and out
of the dimension of her new game, eXistenZ.
</P>
<P>
   Got that? If not, rest assured that there are more twists
involved. Some pretty gross specifics, too, ranging from fleshlike
game pods to a weapon called a gristle gun to the sweet-and-sour
mutant amphibians served in a cyberspace Chinese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurant was pretty disgusting, yeah,'' Leigh admits.
``The stuff on that plate was edible, but it smelled ba-a-ad. Lucky
for me, Jude had to eat most of it _ and he's a vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross or not, Leigh committed to Cronenberg's project fully; so
fully, in fact, she had to sacrifice her part in the last film by
the ultimate independent filmmaker, Stanley Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh had filmed a few scenes with Tom Cruise for the maestro's
two-years-in-the-making erotic thriller ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' But
when the perfectionist director wanted to reshoot them months
later, she was in the middle of ``eXistenZ's'' Canadian production
and could not leave for Kubrick's London set. Her scenes were
reshot with Cruise and another actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge disappointment, but what can you do?'' she says
stoically. ``The thing for me to hold up is that I had the
experience of working with him, and I loved it. That was not
disappointing; he was such a mensch, sweet and nothing like the
stories everyone hears about how he was so hard to work for. He was
quite open, let us improvise; it was so luxurious. He cared so much
and was so smart and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick died in March, hours after completing his final cut of
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' In honor of the secretive genius's wishes,
Leigh refuses to divulge any story information about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   She is thrilled to mention her next project, though, a film
scripted and about to be directed by her mother, in which Leigh
plays a hotel chambermaid who takes way too much interest in the
guests' personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh admits that after creating a wide array of bizarre
characters, finding roles that suit her tastes is getting harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate generic anything because I don't feel anything from
it,'' she says. ``And I don't want to repeat, so I really look for
things that I have an immediate response to and I think are really
interesting. Sure, it's not easy, because I have done a lot. But
choosing roles is not really a cerebral process for me. I just read
something and think, `Oh, I've got to do this character.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh has stuck to her guns throughout a distinctive career and
maintained her personal equilibrium along the way. A lot to be
proud of _ or at least enough to make her feel comfortable about
herself. But Leigh admits that she's still painfully self-conscious
around people, especially when she doesn't have scripted dialogue
to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less nervous about it, but I'm still very shy outside of
work,'' she confesses. ``I am proud of my work and happy about my
life. But I guess I just don't feel that articulate, so I always
feel like I'm not expressing myself in the best, most evocative
manner. All the things I feel proud about in my acting, I don't
think I do justice when I try to describe them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh sells herself short, and you wish she wouldn't. But at the
same time, you don't want her to change anything that keeps her
more interesting than she even realizes. &QL;

   Greenwich Dome Tickets
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to buy tickets for the Millennium Dome in
Greenwich, England, yet? _ Mitchell Peters, St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   A. Although admission prices to Greenwich's much anticipated
(and much criticized) Millennium Dome were announced last month,
tickets won't go on sale until Sept. 22. Entrance to this high-tech
indoor theme park will cost about $33 (at an exchange rate of 60
pence to the dollar); $27.50 for children 5 to 15 (under 5, free);
and a family of five will pay $95. The dome is scheduled to open
Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinta Johnston, a spokesperson for the New Millennium
Experience Company, which is in charge of the project, said that
pricing was announced early so that travel agents could organize
packages. So far, at least one British tour-bus company _ National
Express, telephone (44-8705) 808-080 _ is offering packages from
any city in Britain for $50, including transportation and
admission. Ms. Johnston said that other tour organizers, including
United States travel agents, will also have packages _ updated
information will be posted on the dome's Web site,
www.dome2000.co.uk, as it becomes available. A telephone number for
ordering tickets, which must be purchased in advance, will be added
to the site on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve million visitors are expected to visit the $1.2 billion
Millennium Dome, which, upon completion, will be 164 feet high,
1,049 feet in diameter, with some 20 acres of floor space. ``The
Millennium Experience,'' the dome's opening yearlong exhibition,
will include 15 thematic zones filled with high-tech games and
gadgets, virtual reality and interactive displays that will explore
work, leisure, travel, the human body, spirituality and learning
(among other topics) in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The dome, designed by Richard Rogers, one of the architects of
the Pompidou Center in Paris, has stirred up controversy mainly
because of its enormous cost and doubts about whether a new subway
line to the site, seven miles southeast of London, will be
completed. At this point, the Jubilee Line Extension is scheduled
to be completed in late fall.
</P>
<P>
   New York Walks
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in New York City in July and would like information
on walking tours. _ Alyce Waltzman, San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Guided walking tours are a popular summer offering in New
York, and you're likely to find at least a dozen in July. You might
want to do some preliminary research on exactly what area you wish
to explore, since most of the walks focus on individual
neighborhoods like Harlem, the financial district and Greenwich
Village. Among the possibilities are these:
</P>
<P>
   On July 11 at 1 p.m., The New-York Historical Society and Big
Onion Walking Tours are offering a two-hour walk through Harlem.
The Abyssinian Baptist Church, Strivers' Row (a group of late
19th-century brownstones on 138th and 139th Streets that were once
home to Harlem's elite) and sites associated with the writers Zora
Neal Hurston and Langston Hughes are on the itinerary. Participants
meet at the northwest corner of 135th Street and Lenox Avenue. The
cost is $10, $8 for students and seniors. Reservations are not
required. On the day of the tour, call Big Onion Walking Tours,
(212) 439-1090, after 10:30 a.m. to verify the schedule. Among
other July walks, Big Onion has a Jewish Lower East Side tour
scheduled for July 11 at 1 p.m. and a Central Park at Twilight walk
on July 1 at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 92d Street Y runs a number of tours. A 90-minute walk
through Chelsea on July 11 at 1 p.m., for example, takes in the
area's Greek Revival and Italianate town houses and art galleries.
On the itinerary are the turn-of-the-century Chelsea Hotel on West
23d Street; the Chelsea Market, a blocklong collection of food
shops near 15th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues; and the
General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church, a shady
ensemble of 100-year-old red brick and brownstone buildings bounded

<P>
   My favorite part of my job is playing with unusual flavors and
coming up with interesting combinations. But sometimes I worry that
I have gone too far. This was initially the case with these
cornmeal biscotti, flavored with rosemary and orange.
</P>
<P>
   I love the coarse texture and nutty flavor of cornmeal and have
tried baking several types of cookies with it. I made crumbly,
buttery sables, which took on the color of hay, and delicate
shortbreads, which turned out extra crisp. But these biscotti ended
my quest: cornmeal gives them a wonderful, grainy crunch without
making them too hard, and it adds a subtle, toasty corn taste.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I added rosemary _ not a strange idea, really. It has a
natural affinity for cornmeal (think of how deliciously they are
paired in polenta), and it is a natural digestive and appropriate
to eat at the end of a meal. The rosemary lends a musky, pine
flavor _ one that cries out for a touch of refreshing brightness.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the orange zest comes in. (Adding the rosemary and
the zest to the warm, just-melted butter keeps the rosemary from
turning brown and brings out the essential oils in both of them.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, those flavors and the others in these little
biscotti _ anise, almond and hazelnut _ blend into a mild harmony
that isn't the least bit frightening. They are complex cookies and
will hold their own no matter how often they are dunked.
</P>
<P>
   Although they're a fine match for coffee or tea, I prefer them
with a glass of dessert wine. An off-dry Italian vin santo is a
particularly nice complement. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

BOLDNESS OF SPIRIT, IN A CHICKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roast chicken is a fallback dish for many cooks _ it's the
simple weeknight meal, the main course that almost every dinner
guest will eat. But if you don't bother to make a sauce or a
dressing, roast chicken can also be boring.
</P>
<P>
   An easy way to give it some character is by basting it with
flavorful liquid. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this does
nothing to keep the bird moist; even a very lean bird remains moist
as long as it isn't overcooked. The liquid adds flavor to the skin
and creates a ready-made sauce that can be spooned over the chicken
as you serve it.
</P>
<P>
   If you add some sugar or other sweetener to the basting liquid,
the bird gains a mahogany color that you have to see to believe. As
it heats, the sugar caramelizes, becoming thicker and stickier and
turning the chicken's skin crisp and gorgeous. The result is not
overly sweet, because caramelized sugars have a bitter, complex
component.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer honey to sugar and like to combine it with orange juice
and ground cumin, which add acidity and even more complexity. This
aromatic mix creates pan juices that can be spooned over rice or
sopped up with bread.
</P>
<P>
   You need a certain boldness of spirit to roast a bird this way.
After 20 minutes of cooking, you will be certain that the skin is
going to burn in spots. But have faith. Rotate the chicken back to
front in the oven and continue to baste. The skin will become
uniformly dark brown. If you're convinced that it will scorch,
lower the heat a bit.
</P>
<P>
   I remove chicken from the oven when an instant-read thermometer
inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 155 degrees; any
traces of pinkness disappear during the few minutes I let it sit
before carving. This is a shorter cooking time than some people may
be comfortable with; the chicken can stay in the oven a little
longer, but above 165 degrees it will be beyond rescue, even by a
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ROAST CHICKEN WITH CUMIN, HONEY AND ORANGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   { cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   { cup honey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound chicken, giblets and excess fat removed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Use a nonstick roasting pan, or
line a roasting pan with a double layer of aluminum foil. Combine
orange juice, honey, cumin, salt and pepper in bowl, and whisk
until smooth. Place chicken in pan, and spoon all but \ cup of
liquid over all of it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place chicken in oven, legs first, and roast for 10 minutes.
Spoon accumulated juices back over chicken, reverse pan back to
front, and return to oven. Repeat four times, basting every 10
minutes and switching pan position each time. If chicken browns too
quickly, lower heat a bit. If juices dry up, use reserved liquid
and 1 or 2 tablespoons of water or orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   3. After 50 minutes of roasting, insert an instant-read
thermometer into a thigh; when it reads 155 to 165 degrees, remove
chicken from oven, and baste one final time. Let rest 5 minutes
before serving. &QL;

FUN WITH OYSTERS AND A LITTLE COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Superfresh raw oysters on the half shell with just a spritz of
lemon juice are one of life's great gustatory treats. But these
plump, briny little creatures are also wonderful cooked with other
flavorful ingredients. And the cooking takes only minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known cooked oysters are Oysters Rockefeller, created
at Antoine's restaurant in New Orleans at the end of the last
century. This dish of oysters on the half shell, covered with
spinach, bread crumbs and butter, and then baked, is said to have
been named Oysters Rockefeller because it is so rich.
</P>
<P>
   Baked stuffed oysters were also popular early in this century,
but many cooks now shy away from the classic preparations, having
been turned off by inferior versions in which the poor oysters are
buried under mounds of bread crumbs or gooey sauces. But when made
in your own kitchen with slightly updated flavor combinations,
stuffed oysters is a fantastic dish.
</P>
<P>
   The only real trick to making these dishes is shucking the
oysters. Place the oyster on a flat surface, flatter side up and
slip an oyster knife, church key or dull paring knife into the
hinge. Twist forcefully until the oyster pops, then twist off the
top shell. Sever the muscle that holds the oyster meat to the
bottom shell.
</P>
<P>
   Too much work? Here's an easy out: grill the oysters. When just
warmed through, after two or three minutes on the grill, an
oyster's shell separates, making it easy to open. Five minutes on
the grill, and the shell actually opens slightly. This method also
imparts a trace of smokiness to the oysters, complementing their
delicate, briny taste.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any type of oyster is good for cooking, though the
more expensive ones are probably best appreciated raw. A tip:
simply buy the variety that is freshest on the day you plan to
cook. If you cook oysters, you can also ignore the old maxim that
they should be avoided in months without an ``R'' (May through
August).
</P>
<P>
   This was true in the days when refrigeration was rare. Today, it
makes some sense with raw oysters, because in the hot months many
oysters spawn, which makes them more watery and fatty. But that
does not affect their taste in cooked dishes.
</P>
<P>
   So break out the grill and the cold beer and get ready for
summer with an oyster feast. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE GRILLED OYSTERS IN THEIR SHELLS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   { cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   \ cup Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 dozen oysters of your choice, well washed to remove sand and
grit
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons, quartered. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Build a medium hot fire in a grill.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a shallow baking pan, combine butter and garlic, and place
the pan at the edge of the fire to melt the butter. When butter has
melted, add lemon juice, Tabasco, Worcestershire and salt and
pepper to taste, and stir to combine.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place the oysters on the grill directly over the fire and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes. At this point you can pull them off and
open them with an oyster knife, or you can leave them on the fire
for another 2 to 3 minutes until they open completely.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove the oysters from the fire, pull off the top shell, and
sever the bottom muscle. Sprinkle the oysters with parsley, douse
them with the butter sauce, and then serve them in their shells
with lemon quarters for spritzing.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 appetizer servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED OYSTERS WITH SPINACH, PERNOD AND ORANGE MAYONNAISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   { cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   { cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups spinach leaves, well washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Pernod or other anise liqueur
</P>
<P>
   1 dozen oysters on the half shell, bottom muscle severed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oven to 500 degrees. To make the mayonnaise, in a medium
saute pan, bring the orange juice to a boil over high heat. Reduce
heat to medium high, and continue to boil until juice is reduced to
about 2 tablespoons, 10 minutes or so. Meanwhile, combine the egg
yolk, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and salt and
pepper in the bowl of a food processor or blender, and pulse to
blend. With the motor still running, add the remaining olive oil in
a slow, steady stream. It should form a thick, creamy emulsion.
Stir in the reduced orange juice, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large saute pan, heat the vegetable oil over high heat
until it is hot but not smoking. Add the spinach, and saute,
stirring briskly, until spinach is just wilted, about 1 minute.
Remove from heat, and stir in the garlic and Pernod.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove the oysters from their shells. Divide the sauteed
spinach equally among the 12 shells, place the oysters back in the
shells on top of the spinach, and spoon the mayonnaise on the
oysters.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place the oysters on a baking sheet, put in oven, and roast
until the mayonnaise is slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove
from the oven, and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BAKED STUFFED OYSTERS WITH BACON AND CORN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 slices bacon, diced small
</P>
<P>
   { red onion, diced medium
</P>
<P>
   \ cup corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   \ cup unseasoned bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 dozen oysters on the half shell, bottom muscle severed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oven to 500 degrees. In a medium saute pan over medium
heat, cook the bacon until it is about three-quarters done, about 4
minutes. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of fat, add the
onions, and saute, stirring until onions are transparent, 7 to 9
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove from heat, add the corn, bread crumbs, parsley and
salt and pepper to taste, and mix to combine.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place the oysters on a baking sheet, top each with some of
the bread crumb mixture, place in the oven, and bake until nicely
browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, and serve hot.

   Gallo Zinfandel, Alexander Valley, Barrelli Creek Vineyard,
Sonoma County, Calif., 1995. About $14.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Gallo's single-vineyard Sonoma County wines, this is
a blend of 82 percent zinfandel and 18 percent petite sirah, both
from Barrelli Creek vines. The two grape varieties were fermented
separately, blended, then aged for almost 14 months, mostly in
American oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rich, full-bodied wine with a beautiful bouquet
and a surprisingly long finish. It might benefit from a few years'
extra aging, but it's perfectly ready to drink now.
</P>
<P>
   The alcohol level is high, 14.4 percent, but that's not uncommon
in zinfandels these days, and it gives them the robust quality
we've come to expect. Not exactly a summer wine, it would be ideal
for use with red meats, game and some assertive cheeses.

AIRPORTS REDRAW CAR-RENTAL MAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 25) 
(jt) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With so many airports undergoing major renovation these days,
getting in and out of them in a rental car can be almost as
annoying as a waiting for landing permission on a packed plane.
Many major airports, like Kennedy International in New York, were
long overdue for modernization or expansion. Others, like
Minneapolis-St. Paul, renovated once and now must do it again
because of a swell in the number of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association estimates the 1998 passenger total
on United States scheduled airlines at 614 million; the figure in
1988 was 453.7 million. The end is nowhere near: The Federal
Aviation Administration recently forecast that the number would
reach nearly a billion by 2010. A result, one expert says, is
``stressed out'' airports.
</P>
<P>
   Construction means that passengers find themselves shunted
around concrete Jersey barriers, sitting in temporary waiting rooms
or claiming luggage amid walls of flapping plastic. And when the
wraps finally come off, passengers almost inevitably must go
farther than before to pick up rental cars, as rental operations
are displaced to make more room for airline counters, planes and
passengers. ``It's the wave of the future,'' said David Gotschall
of the San Jose, Calif., airport.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is that even in a rebuilt airport, it takes
passengers longer to get to a consolidated garage to pick up their
car and longer to shed the car on the return trip. In the new
designs for airports in areas where real estate is expensive,
counters, garages, cars, car washes and offices for the big-name
car rental companies are moved to the edge of the airport property
or away from the grounds entirely. Then, to eliminate the dozens of
company vans that go around and around the curbs like a child's
toy, the airport provides consolidated buses for all car-rental
customers, since they are all going to the same remote area.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, the rental car would be standing outside
the air terminal with the key in it,'' said Simon H. Ellis, Hertz's
vice president for properties and concessions. ``But this is not
possible everywhere so we have to work on other options.''
</P>
<P>
   One result, according to Jon LeSage of Abrams Travel Data
Services in Long Beach, Calif., an airport planning consultant, is
that in the next 10 years most of the top 100 airports in the
country, including San Jose, will be changing the way they handle
car-rental services. Nearly a dozen already have.
</P>
<P>
   Rental Companies Go Along
</P>
<P>
   Once when I used the phrase ``pushed out'' to describe what
seemed to be happening to the rental companies at the hands of
airport management, a rental-car official said that was not really
right: rental companies participate in the airport-redesign process
because they have a major role. Ellis said that typically 20 to 30
percent of all arriving passengers rent a car; in Denver the figure
is 50 percent, which is extremely high since a good portion of
arriving passengers at any airport are coming home. Within these
margins, there are wide variations, of course: almost all business
travelers rent cars, but five passengers in one family will take
only one car. But it remains true that a major exit for airport
users is through a car-rental office.
</P>
<P>
   The rental companies are also big revenue sources for airports:
they pay 8 to 10 percent of their gross revenues to the airport, in
addition to rent. Even companies that operate off airports, said
Ray A. Mundy, director of the Airport Ground Transportation
Association in Knoxville, Tenn., pay an average of 8 percent of
their gross. Ellis of Hertz said that his company pays San
Francisco Airport $10 million a year. Car-rental companies rank
second or third among airport revenue sources. Airline fees come
first and parking revenue vies with car-rental revenue for second
and third places.
</P>
<P>
   Vast Spaces
</P>
<P>
   The numbers involved _ acres, cars, parking spaces _ are
amazing, and certainly make clear why all the rental companies
cannot crowd into even a vast terminal. San Francisco has just
moved all its rental-car services to a garage with five stories of
seven acres each. David Albersman of A.G.A. Consulting in
Bloomington, Minn., said that the Minneapolis airport was using an
interim rental-car facility again, but the new one, moved two miles
from the airport to create parking space, will use a multilevel
60-acre site to hold 18,000 rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is how do you tell someone how to get where
they want to go,'' Albersman said. ``What signs, what sounds, what
colors do you use to say how to get there?''
</P>
<P>
   This is what is driving travelers bananas when they get their
bags and look at the wall where the rental counters used to be. A
longish van ride is ahead even before the contract can be signed.
And if the rental-car company they use is not in the consolidated
area, but is an ``off airport'' company, there will be a second
ride.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, according to research by Tony Fuller, an Avis
spokesman, eight airports are using or installing some form of
consolidated rental-car site, usually removed from the terminals:
Minneapolis, whose earlier try was the first; the new airport at
Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Newark, Pittsburgh, Sacramento, San
Francisco and Washington National (Reagan). Atlanta, Phoenix and
Seattle, as well as San Jose, say they are in negotiations toward
the same solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big congestion-mitigation step,'' Gotschall said.
``Each time a car is rented at the terminal, it involves four
vehicle movements: the renter drives the car off, the renter drives
the car back, the company drives it away for fueling and cleaning
and then drives it back to be rented again.'' By contrast, in the
consolidated garages _ what the companies call ``quick turnaround''
installations _ the car washes and fuel pumps are right there when
the car is returned.
</P>
<P>
   All this reduction in vehicle movement as well as consolidation
of customer pickup has another value: it can reduce emissions.
Mundy said that many cities that had not met their Federal goals
for tougher emissions standards and might lose highway aid often
looked to their airports for help.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, Ellis says, is running out of space in its garages and
needs more close-in parking areas. Las Vegas is another looking for
new ways to arrange itself.
</P>
<P>
   Allow Extra Time
</P>
<P>
   Ron Salk, who edits Salk's International Airport Transit Guide,
subtitled ``How to Get From the Airport to the City Worldwide,''
has an entry under Dallas-Fort Worth noting that Avis, Budget,
Hertz and National ``have no agents in baggage claim'' and use
consolidated buses.
</P>
<P>
   If you are traveling on a tight schedule, ask the car-rental
company if it has a counter in the terminal and an adjoining garage
or if it is based in a consolidated garage, or is totally
off-airport. If the reservationist answering the 800 number does
not have details, ask for the local number and make further
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Reagan Airport in Washington, according to Tara
Hamilton of the Metro Washington Airport Authority, Garage A,
served by airport-sponsored vans, houses Alamo, Avis, Budget, Hertz
and National. Thrifty is off-airport, and its clients must go to
Garage A before they can catch a Thrifty van. On the other hand,
Enterprise and Dollar are allowed to pick up directly from the
arrivals curb because they agreed to provide a joint van for their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   If the reservationist describes a time-consuming procedure,
particularly if your arrival hour is not in daytime, be sure that
you have selected a plane that gets there early enough to leave
some slack.
</P>
<P>
   And when you are returning a car at the airport, remember that
you may have one or two more rides before you can start running for
the departure gate.

   Fancy Cars Available For Rent in London
</P>
<P>
   If you would like to rent a luxury car in London, Avis has
inaugurated a program that it says can guarantee you the make and
model you want within 24 hours of your request _ a distinction that
those who get ``or similar'' will appreciate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen 1998 and 1999 models available range from an Audi
A3 SE 1.6SE to a Mercedes-Benz SLK 230 to a Porsche Boxster; the
daily rate if rented from, say, three to six days is $110, $263 and
$350, respectively, computed at $1.59 to the pound. The cars, which
include Jaguars as well, are available through Avis Prestige Cars,
a licensee. Avis says its guarantee means that if the make and
model are available when you call, you will get what you asked for.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avis, however, has some stringent standards for anyone who
slides behind the wheel. In addition to a valid driver's license
that has been held for at least two years, two credit cards and a
passport are required. Renters must be at least 25 years old to
rent the lowest (if you will) tier of cars, and at least 30 to rent
anything else. A charge of $686 to $845 must be paid before the
rental; any damage to the car will be deducted from that payment.
Cars cannot be taken out of Britain. Finally, there is a charge of
a day's rental for no-shows, unless 24 hours' notice is given. The
fee includes unlimited free mileage, insurance and the 17.5 percent
VAT. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The major compensation for all the bother is, of course, the car
you're getting. It can be delivered free to a hotel in central
London or, for $40, to Heathrow Airport. Information: (800)
331-1084.

   Creatures of the Deep, On View in Monterey
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of living deep-sea animals, most never seen before
in an aquarium, opened last month at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in
central California. ``Mysteries of the Deep'' features more than 40
species collected from as deep as 3,300 feet below the ocean's
surface. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition focuses on the Monterey submarine canyon, an
underwater chasm that begins offshore from the aquarium and
eventually reaches a depth of over two miles from rim to floor.
Through living animals, videos, a deep-sea lab and hands-on
activities, visitors examine the three major deep-sea habitats
found in Monterey Bay _ vertical canyon walls, the sea floor, and
the midwater zone, a dark ocean realm between sunlit surface waters
and the bottom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The species featured are from all three zones, and are hardy
enough so that pressure is not a factor in keeping them alive. They
include pallid eelpouts, mushroom corals, sea whips, filetail
catsharks and Pacific hagfish. Many of these colorful and graceful
animals are housed in multi-species tanks that recreate the look of
deep-sea communities. The exhibition includes a daily program of
live and taped video broadcasts from robotic research submarines
now exploring the canyon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey Bay Aquarium, 886 Cannery Row, is open daily.
Admission, which includes the deep-sea exhibition (through Jan. 6,
2002), is $15.95, $12.95 for seniors and students, $6.95 for the
disabled and ages 3 to 12. Information: (831) 648-4888.

   300th Birthday Party For Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred years ago, in 1699, the Virginia Colony moved its
capital five miles inland from Jamestown and named it Williamsburg
for the reigning English king, William III. The city remained the
capital until 1780 (when it was moved to Richmond), and this year
is celebrating the anniversary of its founding with a series of
exhibitions and programs. Through objects, manuscripts,
photographs, paintings, rare books and prints, visitors can view
the historical legacies of three centuries: the 18th at the John D.
Rockefeller Jr. Library in Colonial Williamsburg, the 19th at the
Swem Library at the College of William and Mary, and the 20th at
the Williamsburg Regional Library. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia General Assembly voted for the move to Williamsburg
on May 1, and many events mark the day. At the DeWitt Wallace
Gallery in Colonial Williamsburg, ``1699: When Virginia Was the
Wild West'' will be on display from May 1 through Feb. 13, 2000. It
features 17th century decorative arts and more than 300 artifacts
excavated from early Indian, English and African settlements, with
wall labels that illustrate the story in Classic Comics style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A public archeological excavation of the Nassau Street Tavern
will start Saturday and continue into the fall. Festivities on
Saturday include a commemorative ceremony recalling the events of
1699 at 10 a.m. in front of the Wren Building at the College of
William and Mary, and a parade led by the Colonial Williamsburg
Fife and Drum Corps at 1:30 p.m. The National Symphony Orchestra,
conducted by Leonard Slatkin, will perform at the William and Mary
Hall at 7:30 p.m. The program will include selections from the
American composers Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein and Virgil
Thomson. Ticket prices range from $8 for students to $45; (757)
664-6492. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day ``A Celebration in Song,'' a nine-hour vocal
concert, will be held from 1 to 10 p.m. at the William and Mary
Hall. Open-seating tickets: $15, $3 for students and children. Call
(757) 873-7333 for more information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A calendar of 300th anniversary events is available at
www.300th.ontheline.com, or from the Williamsburg Area Convention
and Visitor's Bureau, (800) 368-6511.

   A French Painter's American Links
</P>
<P>
   The Parisian artist who arrived in New Orleans on a sunny fall
day in 1872 to visit his mother's American family, the
well-connected Mussons, stepped into the midst of stylish Creole
society. He left in March with a rich record of his visit, work
that can be seen in an exhibition that opens Saturday at the New
Orleans Museum of Art, ``Degas and New Orleans: A French
Impressionist in America.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show, which runs to Aug. 29, will feature 40 objects,
paintings, drawings, pastels and prints, including 17 of the
approximately two dozen pieces that Degas is thought to have
created or begun during his visit to the city where his mother,
Celestine, was born. Family heirlooms on display will include
jewelry and a Bible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is part of Francofete, a yearlong celebration of
French influence in Louisiana, which dates to 1699. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Degas' works are being gathered from, among other places, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New
York, the National Gallery of Art and the Dumbarton Oaks House
Collection in Washington, the Musee d'Orsay and Louvre in Paris and
the Ordrupgaard Collection in Copenhagen.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's most notable paintings and Degas' first to be
bought by a French museum, ``A Cotton Office in New Orleans,'' will
be on loan from the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Pau. It portrays the
artist's Uncle Michel in top hat and frock coat musing over a scrap
of cotton in a clubby 19th-century place of business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, $10, $5 ages 3 to 17, are available through
Ticketmaster, (800) 409-9959. Beginning Saturday, tickets can be
bought at the New Orleans Museum of Art, 1 Collins Diboll Circle in
City Park; (504) 488-2631. The museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Tuesday through Sunday.

LAW OF GRAVITY APPLIES TO BORDEAUX PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in four years, the prices of Bordeaux wines
are beginning to fall, in some instances significantly below last
year's levels. Among some of the better-known chateaus, Margaux is
down 14 percent, Cos d'Estournel 25 percent, Ducru-Beaucaillou 16
percent and Gloria 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But don't rush to your local wine store looking for a bargain
just yet. The price drop refers to the 1998 vintage, which is
maturing in chateau cellars and whose wines will not be sold in the
United States until 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Bordeaux, whose prices set off a debate among those in
the wine trade, will begin to arrive this year. More about them
later.
</P>
<P>
   The price drop was welcomed by the Bordeaux Wine Council, a
trade group, which announced it officially in Paris last week. As
always, the five most famous chateaus _ Haut-Brion,
Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Margaux and Mouton-Rothschild _ were the
first to announce their prices, which are called opening prices.
</P>
<P>
   As the wine passes through the hands of brokers, shippers,
importers, distributors and retailers, that opening price can
increase by 50 to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux is France's biggest wine exporting region, so what goes
on there is closely watched by wine experts around the world. They
had been predicting a drop in French wine prices because of the
Asian financial crisis, declining Japanese demand and growing
competition from wines elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   To other wine players, greed on the part of Bordeaux producers
also had a part. They point out that the 1997 vintage, a relatively
mediocre one, was offered for sale at prices well above the 1996, a
very good vintage, as producers tried to make the most of a hot
market.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary judgments of the 1998 vintage put it considerably
above the 1997 in quality, which means that the 1998s are being
offered at lower prices than the less-good 1997s.
</P>
<P>
   But where did the astoundingly high prices for Bordeaux wines of
the last few years come from anyway?
</P>
<P>
   After a succession of indifferent years _ 1991, 1992, 1993 and
1994 _ worldwide demand for a good wine was great. The 1995 vintage
was excellent, and anticipating the demand for it, Bordeaux
producers set their opening price 35 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, demand was so strong that prices were pushed up 50
percent more. Growers were encouraged to offer the 1996 vintage at
even higher prices _ in some cases, 55 percent or 60 percent higher
than what they had asked for the 1995s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, there was some logic to all this,'' said
Anthony Barton, owner of Chateau Leoville-Barton in St.-Julien, in
Bordeaux wine country. That is, good wines sold in a buoyant market
in a generally expanding world economy. ``When things ceased to
make sense was when the 1997 vintage was put on the market,'' he
added. Although that year produced some excellent wines, few would
say they were equal to, let alone better than, 1995 or 1996. Yet
prices went up again.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said it was ``a grave error'' for producers to think that
there was a true demand for the 1997 vintage at this high price.
``Now the 1998 campaign is under way and it has caused producers
quite a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Dulong, vice president of the Bordeaux Wine Council,
defended the 1997 vintage as ``overly criticized,'' but promised
``a significant effort'' to lower prices for the vintage, much of
which remains unsold.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Abdallah Simon, chairman of the Seagram Chateau and
Estate Wines Co., an important Bordeaux importer, said he was not
worried about selling the 1997s but criticized the Bordelais for
pushing the 1997 prices so high.
</P>
<P>
   In Bordeaux, Paul Pontallier, manager of Chateau Margaux, said
of 1997: ``We did what we had to do _ perhaps we went a bit too
high. Pricing is out of our hands. The market makes the prices. Our
job is to make the very best wine we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Will a measure of logic return to a market driven by ego and
tradition, as well as economic realities? Barton, whose family has
made wine in Bordeaux since 1822, is cautiously optimistic. ``With
luck and a small measure of good judgment,'' he said, ``the 1998
vintage will be sold at about the right price.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I look forward to returning to the old-fashioned
formula of increasing prices in good years and decreasing them in
lesser years.''

FORM AN ALLIANCE TO BATTLE FIRE ANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
Q: I have fire ants all over my yard. I've used everything, but
they seem to just move to some other spot. 
_ J.S.C., Houston 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are fire ants in my compost pile. How would you suggest
getting rid of them? &QL; 
_ A.B., Kingwood &QR; 
 &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A: There are means to control these pests, but so far not to
eliminate them altogether. Scientists are studying effective
controls with natural predators. One, a tiny fly, is apparently
most promising.
</P>
<P>
   If all members of a mound are not killed, especially the queen,
then survivors are likely to set up again. Therefore, your best
shot is to kill off as much of the mound as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many think that baits, even though they take weeks to reach 80
percent to 90 percent control, are most effective in fighting fire
ants. Some baits are faster-acting than others, but those that are
slower may actually have the longest-lasting control. Eventually,
if the bait is used according to label instructions, the colony is
put out of commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Agricultural Extension Service, Texas Agricultural
Experiment Station, Texas Tech University, University of Texas,
Texas Department of Agriculture, and Texas Parks &AMP; Wildlife
Department have joined forces to find the best means to combat fire
ants and to inform the public of the best current procedures in
controlling these ants. It is a program that encourages all of us _
neighborhoods and communities _ to work together. Since fire ants
move from garden to garden, it makes sense to team up with your
neighbors for a broader attack.
</P>
<P>
   The above organizations have put together a new Texas Imported
Fire Ant Research and Management Plan that suggests a two-step
approach, especially useful in heavily infested areas. The Web site
for this plan, http://fireant.tamu.edu/, gives detailed information
on fire ant control.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the plan suggests:
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast a fresh (preferably unopened) bait during warm weather
and when ants are foraging for food, usually late in the day.
Applications made between late August and mid-October, when weather
conditions are more stable, achieve greater control by early
spring, researchers say. A neighborhood effort will also achieve
greater control.
</P>
<P>
   Wait five days or more after applying bait, then treat any
nuisance mound in a high-traffic area with a drench, granular or
dust insecticide, or treat organically. But be patient and let the
bait do its thing on other mounds.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of products available for fighting the fire
ant mound. Injectable products that contain pyrethrum can help.
These products may come in a spray can with a plastic tube that is
inserted into the mound. This kills any ants in the mound at the
time of application. Of course, this won't kill any foragers. But
if you get the queen and her brood, the workers will be at a loss
and the colony will dry up.
</P>
<P>
   There are drenches with chemicals such as diazinon that are
mixed with water and sprinkled on mounds. These drenches vary in
kill time. And you may not want to work with concentrates.
Certainly, avoid contact. And keep the overall environment in mind.
Runoff pollutes.
</P>
<P>
   Granular products also are sprinkled on the mound, then gently
watered. Again, it may take several days before this type of
pesticide kills the colony.
</P>
<P>
   There are organic/home-remedies for treating ants: Drench a
mound with straight vinegar, soapy water or boiling water. Be
extremely careful approaching and treating a mound. Fire ants move
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners have tried steeping manure to make a manure tea,
adding molasses and using this concoction as a drench. I have not
tried this method.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you choose, follow the instructions carefully. And of
course, first suppress mounds in areas used by people and pets.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage ants in the compost pile, apply one of the
fast-acting baits that contain hydramethylnon. A pile that cooks
properly will eliminate any insecticide residues. But research says
baits break down quickly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mail garden questions to Kathy Huber, garden editor, Houston
Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston, Texas 77210. The bulk of mail
prevents individual replies to all unpublished letters.

THE JETS ROCKETED OUT OF WINNIPEG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the Winnipeg Jets hockey team?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.R., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The Jets, an original World Hockey Association franchise that
joined the NHL in 1979, became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   More than $62 million was raised to build a new arena in
Winnipeg and keep the franchise from moving, including $13 million
from a radio telethon and ``Save the Jets'' concert. The effort
failed when the team's owners could not come up with their share of
the funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were purchased for $68 million by Richard Burke and
Steven Gluckstern in October 1995. Burke, now the sole owner, is
considering another relocation to Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Scottsdale will decide on May 18 whether to approve
funding for a new arena to house the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I write to Johnny Mathis?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.C.N., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him in care of Columbia Records, 550 Madison Ave.,
New York, NY 10022-3211.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, 63, was born in Gilmer, Texas, and grew up in San
Francisco. His most recent album is 1998's ``Because You Loved Me:
The Songs of Diane Warren.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer has an official fan club that publishes a quarterly
newsletter with a concert schedule, details on future projects and
a personal birthday greeting from Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to Johnny Mathis International Fan
Club, Box 2066, Burbank, CA 91507-2066.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for the song ``Basketball Jones,'' which I
believe was a parody of the song ``Love Jones.'' Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.H., Livermore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: The song appears on the 1991 album ``Cheech &AMP; Chong Greatest
Hit'' and a 1998 compilation, ``Basketball's Greatest Hoop Hits.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a remake by Barry White and Chris Rock on the
``Space Jam'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The song was originally released by Cheech &AMP; Chong on the album
``Los Cochinos.'' It reached No. 15 on the charts in 1973.

NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO BUY PC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Think computers are too expensive? You haven't been
paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, eMachines (www.e4me.com) advertised a system with a
Cyrix M II-333, a 2.1-gigabyte hard drive, 32 megabytes of RAM, a
32-speed CD-ROM, Windows 98 and a 56kbps V.90 modem for $399. Want
to add a monitor? That'll be $499.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to spend $400? How about a system for $299?
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz Computer (www.microworkz.com) is taking orders for
the WEBzter Jr., a $299 PC with a Cyrix M II-300, a 3.2-gigabyte
hard drive, 32 megabytes of RAM, Windows 98 and a 56kbps V.90
modem. Another $99 gets you a CD-ROM and floppy drive, and another
$140 gets you a 15-inch color monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of computers at the other end of the scale are falling,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Dell advertised a $2,200 system with an Intel
Pentium II-450, a 10-gigabyte hard drive, 64 megabytes of RAM, a
32-speed CD-ROM drive, a 3D graphics card, a cutting-edge sound
card, a 17-inch monitor and a 56kbps V.90 modem. Today, you can get
basically the same system with a Pentium III-450 for $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes. Remember the days when you had to spend at least $1,500
to get a basic computer? And when really good computers cost more
than $3,000? That's all ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it's due to increased competition between the three
big chipmakers _ Intel, AMD and Cyrix _ and traditional
computermakers _ Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard _ and upstart
computermakers _ eMachines and Microworkz.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Compaq stock took a tumble after the company
said its earnings for the first quarter would fall below analyst
expectations. Among other things, Compaq blamed lower-than-expected
demand and increased competition in the commercial PC market.
</P>
<P>
   Falling PC prices also are due to the changing face of the
average computer buyer.
</P>
<P>
   There still are computer enthusiasts who will gladly fork over
$3,000 for the latest and greatest machine. But many of today's
buyers looking for their  reported
that 56 percent of all sub-$1,000 PCs are sold into households with
annual incomes of $35,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Other buyers have just figured out that they don't need to spend
$3,000 or $2,000 or even $1,000 when all they want to do is surf
the Web, trade e-mail, balance the family checkbook and write
letters to Grandma.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the number of consumers seeking low-cost
computers has outpaced the number looking for top-end machines. A
recent ``San Jose Mercury News'' story, for example, stated that 61
percent of all PCs sold in retail stores cost $1,000 or less.
That's up dramatically from just 25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts predict that the penetration rate of PCs in
homes could soon exceed 100 percent, because so many people will
seek multiple computers to run everything from lights and security
systems to entertainment centers and kitchen appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Will computer prices continue to drop? Many experts think so.
The power of the Web and the versatility of electronic commerce is
giving small companies a chance to compete, and major corporations
will have to cut prices to maintain market share.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Apple Computer factors in to
all this. The company's iMac has proven hugely successful. Older
iMacs sell in the $900 range, but even new ones cost just $1,200.
And the Power Macintosh G3s _ Apple's top-of-the-line machines _
are getting rave reviews in the computer press.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, now's the time to buy. So get out there
and look around! But consider these thoughts before buying a
low-end PC:
</P>
<P>
   - As illustrated above, many of the cheapest systems are not as
complete as we might like them to be. Some come with all the
hardware you might need, but no operating system. Some don't come
with monitors or CD-ROM drives. Read the fine print and make sure
you know what you are buying.
</P>
<P>
   - Nobody is giving anything away. Makers of cheap PCs are
cutting corners. That's not to say cheap PCs are unreliable. But
don't expect the same performance as you would from a name-brand,
top-notch machine.
</P>
<P>
   - Think about how you will use the computer before you buy one.
Cheap PCs are great for Web surfing, sending e-mail and simple
computing. But if you like to play the latest 3D games, a cheap PC
probably will give you poor performance or none at all. &QL; 
SPIRITS ARE ABOUT TO SPEAK &QL; 
As you might expect, last week's column about the mystery at Harold
Temmer's Sun City West home sparked quite a few e-mails from
readers.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, here's the nutshell version: Temmer's
wife wrote a letter to friends on the computer. Temmer later called
the letter up on the computer and found the name and address of a
stranger typed at the bottom. Turns out the stranger had been dead
10 years, and nobody could figure out how his name and address got
into Temmer's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Without any other explanation, Temmer and I joked that his
computer must be haunted!
</P>
<P>
   As I pointed out in the column, we ruled out the possibility
that Temmer bought a computer with a used hard drive that could
have contained the stranger's information. Temmer said he bought
the computer six years ago, and the stranger died four years before
that. And the stranger's information had never shown up on Temmer's
computer before.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Richard wrote: ``To me, there was a delicious
irony in the coincidence that your article was headlined ``Do the
dead have PCs in heaven?'' _ appearing just below the Cyberslang
definition of ``Legacy Tech'' as ``outdated hardware and
software.'' Surely, if the dead have PCs in heaven, what they've
got is Legacy Tech: dead, gone and obsolete computers.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Sharron had several ideas. Among them, ``Because
he is a retired assistant vice chancellor of the University of
California-San Diego, he could have an intelligent friend playing a
trick on him.''
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Virginia wrote, ``Since it was a man's name and
address, perhaps this bit of data came from a mailing list _ one
that hasn't been updated in a while or that is using very old data.
If Temmer and his wife haven't used any mailing lists and don't
have any on their computer, perhaps they have received something
from someone else's mailing list. An e-mail about a class reunion,
perhaps, or a church group, or fund-raising spam.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a reader named Tom wrote, ``In regard to your headline
in today's ``Republic,'' `Do the dead have PCs in heaven?' I have
the answer: No. In heaven, they have Macs. The PCs go to the other
place.'' &QL;

GORE-LOVING HOCKEY WRITER SHOULD HEAR FROM FANS  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE APRIL 20 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the National Hockey League first began expanding
out of its northern, Canada-centric roots, purists feared the dire
consequences of diluting sparse talent. Where Maurice ``Rocket''
Richard once flew, thugs would now reign.
</P>
<P>
   They were right and wrong. Fights and mayhem still mar the game,
but latter-day hockey still produces genuine artists, like the
just-retired Great One, Wayne Gretzky. What the purists failed to
account for, however, was the expanding base of thugs in the
stands. And in the press boxes.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they didn't account for hockey being played before
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   To its great shame, the NHL promotes the brutality of its sport,
glorifying carnage even in its advertising. It does this for one
reason: Banal, mouth-breathing violence addicts who know nothing of
hockey's finer points are drawn like leeches to the blood.
</P>
<P>
   To some ``fans'' of hockey in Texas, the game is akin to a
Saturday night at an Amarillo roadhouse. There's drinkin' and
there's fightin'. And fightin' and drinkin'. Did we miss anything?
</P>
<P>
   That certainly appears to be the breadth of knowledge that Keith
Gave, a sportswriter who, incredibly, earns a living as a pro
hockey columnist for the ``Dallas Morning News,'' brings to his
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Gave wrote with disturbing excitement about a
vicious cheap shot against Phoenix Coyote center Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   It was, Gave wrote, ``a gruesome reminder of what it means to
mess with Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone suggested Roenick's injury might finally quiet one of
the biggest mouths in the NHL. Especially with his jaw wired,
requiring him to suck his meals though a straw for a few weeks,''
wrote the Texas hockey expert.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, whose face was crushed into the boards as a result of a
blind-side cheap shot by Dallas' premier thug, Derian Hatcher,
dislocated his jaw, and broke it in three places. He has had two
metal plates inserted to hold his mouth in place. He will lose at
least eight teeth. And his thumb was fractured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hockey is a tough game. It tolerates _ even expects _
retribution, vengeance and all the other Puzo-esque melodramas
among its players. But it is a game of paradoxes. The same NHL that
revels in its violent collisions awards the only
individual-achievement trophy in pro sports named after a woman.
Part of the Great One's greatness was winning the Lady Byng trophy
for sportsmanship four times.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sort of subtle distinctions, however, that are
lost on people like Keith Gave, who thought the oft-suspended
Hatcher should have received the first star of the game for his
handiwork. He seems to reflect his readership's acumen regarding
hockey. Two-thirds of respondents to a ``Morning News'' poll
rejoiced in seeing Roenick's blood on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   However unlikely, it might help Gave's perspective to hear from
real fans of the game. His number in ``Hockey Town USA - Not'' is
1-(214)-977-8034. Or, by e-mail, at keithgave(at)dallasnews.com. &QL;

HAIL-PROOF ROOFS A TOUGH SELL: FEW HOMEOWNERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Hail-resistant roofs will defend your house,
save you money and time, and perhaps over the long haul bring
insurance costs down for every homeowner in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it's been a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the state and insurance companies launched a
pioneering program to lower insurance premiums for homeowners who
put hail-resistant roofs over their heads, only a fraction of
Texans have taken advantage of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate, Farmers and State Farm insurance companies, which
insure two-thirds of all homeowners in the state, gave roof
discounts on 1,300 policies in the last year, a tiny fraction of
the more than 2.9 million policies they hold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program needs some work,'' said Don Bassett, an Arlington
roofing contractor who has put on only one hail-resistant roof in
the last year. ``We've bid it many, many times, but the numbers
don't seem to work out for people.''
</P>
<P>
   The tepid beginning apparently isn't for lack of interest. Texas
contractors, insurance companies and state regulators report steady
inquiries from homeowners in one of the most hailed-on environments
in North America.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other states _ Colorado and Oklahoma, for example _
have similar programs, though Texas is apparently the only one with
regulatory authority over it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is apparently money. Roofs that qualify as
hail-resistant can cost significantly more than those that don't,
money that must come from the homeowner, not the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, few major manufacturers produce a shingle or roof
product that meets the standard, and a number of them have
questioned whether the testing _ dropping steel balls from varying
heights _ has anything to do with a hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   And lastly, the discounts mandated by the Texas Department of
Insurance vary widely, according to the type of hail-resistant
roof, area of the state and type of insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the industry and the state say the program can benefit
everyone's bottom line. They contend that as more people become
aware of it, more will take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to just sit back and say: `This is Texas. We're going
to have hailstorms and there's nothing we can do about it,''' said
Lars Rosene, a State Farm spokesman. ``This is a proactive approach
for dealing with hailstorms and that's not something we've had in a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The discount program went into effect in mid-February 1998, the
result of years of discussion about how to minimize financial
losses for the insurance industry in Texas, which were staggering
after billion-dollar hailstorms in 1992 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a homeowner who puts on a hail-resistant roof must get a
discount on his insurance premium. The discounts range from 1
percent to 35 percent, with the greater discounts going to roofs
that rated better in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Hail-resistant roofs, whether asphalt, wood or metal, are
considerably more expensive than regular roofs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to cover a 3,500-square-foot roof _ a common size _
with asphalt shingles, a homeowner would expect to pay about
$3,100. The same size roof with the highest qualifying
hail-resistant shingles would cost about $1,100 more.
Hail-resistant wood shingles would run at least $3,300 more than
regular wood shingles on the same size home.
</P>
<P>
   John Fakhari paid more than $11,000 for his hail-resistant
shingle roof for his large Eagle Mountain Lake home last year,
close to $4,000 more than a standard shingle roof.
</P>
<P>
   His insurance premiums dropped dramatically, both for the
hail-resistant roof and for replacing wood shingles with asphalt,
so he expects to recoup the extra expense in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at four different options, and I thought this was the
best decision,'' he said. ``I hope it turns out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance department and insurance companies say that when
homeowners decide whether to spring for a hail-resistant roof, they
should also figure in the cost of their deductibles, their time and
trouble in turning in a claim if they sustain damage, and in the
long term, the savings from making fewer damage claims that usually
increase premiums. They are also looking at how to make the program
more affordable for low-income homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The industry favors reducing the discounts as the roofs age,
meaning that it would take longer for homeowners to recoup their
upfront costs. The state has not made a decision on that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the discount to offset the increased costs of
the roof, but there are other advantages,'' said Gary Julian, a
personal property specialist with the insurance department.
``Hopefully, over a period of time, by mitigating these losses, we
can reduce insurance costs.''
</P>
<P>
   A lack of confidence in the testing of hail-resistant roofs has
discouraged most of the nation's major shingle manufacturers,
according to Russ Snyder, general manager of the Asphalt Roofing
Manufacturers Association. Manufacturers fear that they will be
held liable if the roofs don't hold up in a hailstorm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite concerned that the science that has been adopted
by the (insurance department) is not representative of what a
hailstone might do,'' Snyder said. ``It's not representative of
real-world conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rich Roe, technical director for Mississippi-based Atlas
Roofing, one of the few asphalt shingle manufacturers with a
hail-resistant product, said his company makes no claims about the
ability of its StormMaster shingles to perform in a hailstorm. The
company only says it passed the impact test, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state isn't scheduled to take an in-depth look at the
program for another four years. The next time a hailstorm strikes
in North Texas, homeowners and the insurance industry are likely to
get the program's first real evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable with the discounts, and we believe in the
program,'' Rosene said. ``But we haven't had the big storm to know
where these products stand. We've tested and retested, but when it
comes to softball-size hail in Arlington, we just don't know.''

RECKLESS ABANDON OF YOUTH TOOK A TRIP TO PARTS UNKNOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember the most minute details of that trip like it was
just, well ... this morning. I was going to say yesterday, but I've
forgotten most of yesterday already. However, most of this morning
is still on my ``to-do'' list and, therefore, as easy to recall as
that fateful trip that I took all those many moons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gov. Bush, I was ``young and irresponsible'' back in my
B.V. days.
</P>
<P>
   That's Before Velcro. I've divided my life into two distinct
periods: B.V. and A.V. Before and After Velcro. Even though Velcro
was invented in 1948, many years passed before it became a factor
in my life. Fastening has never been the same. I don't know how
Velcro affected the governor, but I am truly a better person
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, my roommate, Andrea, and I hopped into my little Dodge
Challenger one beautiful Friday afternoon intent on driving from
Houston to Waco. We were going there to hang out with my fiance and
his friend, who I alleged was exceedingly handsome even though I
had never actually seen him. I just didn't want to make that
three-hour drive by myself, and Andrea hadn't had a date since the
Alamo fell.
</P>
<P>
   We were halfway to our destination when, to our amazement,
snowflakes started to fall from the brooding sky. Undaunted, we
kept driving as the snowflakes enlarged and multiplied until we
were in engulfed in blizzard-like conditions.
</P>
<P>
   We were faced with the decision of either retracing our steps or
trying to drive through the storm. At this point, we could not
distinguish the narrow lanes of Texas 6 from the ditches that
embraced it just beyond the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   There was no safe place to pull over. All we could see were
trees and snow-covered fields for miles around. Besides, we only
had about $5 between the two of us. I doubt that anyone except my
fiance even had a clue where we were. I didn't even have a spare
tire. The only thing in my trunk was some cans that I was going to
recycle when we returned to Houston so that I could afford to do my
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Upon deciding that we had gone too far to turn around, we simply
pumped up the volume on the radio and, literally, plowed ahead. We
did not meet another car until we arrived safely in Waco four hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make that young, irresponsible and lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Warp speed ahead, Scotty, to a day last month when I was
preparing for another road trip. I had AAA designate the route for
me on a map so detailed that it would make NASA proud. I had seven
credit cards in my wallet along with enough cashier's checks to
tide me over for three or four days if necessary. My mechanic
changed the oil on my car and inspected it from headlights to
taillights with a diagnostic microscope.
</P>
<P>
   In the trunk next to my luggage was an emergency roadside kit
complete with flares and a thermal blanket. I definitely had a
spare, plus a can of Fix A Flat. A cell phone, a pound of bologna
and a loaf of bread completed my preparations.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this was just for the drive to my office five miles
away from my home.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, is all of this elaborate preparation a result of age
and wisdom or is it fear and anxiety brought on by witnessing one
too many tragedies? Maybe it's just a result of having enough
quarters to do my laundry now. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   But I must say that we had a really good time that weekend. At
least I did. Unfortunately, that fellow we matched Andrea up with
was ugly as sin. Oh, well.

BOOKS FOCUSES ON HOLLYWOOD'S SEEDY SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Monica Lewinsky. Forget George Stephanopoulos. This is
the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'n' Roll
Generation Saved Hollywood'' (Peter Biskind, Simon &AMP; Schuster,
paperback, $15, 506 pages), the story of Young Turk directors
having their way with Hollywood in the 1970s, dishes more dirt than
all the White House tell-alls could ever dream of doing.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs? Oh, yeah. There are studio honchos admitting they'd leave
a line of cocaine as a tip for waitresses and big-name directors
confessing to habits topping a quarter of a million dollars per
year. Sex? Whew. Plenty of it. In Biskind's book, everybody sleeps
with everybody else and can't wait to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Riders'' has already made the best-seller list, and now
it's out in paperback. You won't find a more concentrated,
hard-core, make-you-gasp gossip book anywhere for $15.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as a backdrop to all the raw gossip is Biskind's premise
that a handful of up-and-coming directors wrestled control of
American movies from the studios in the '70s and started making
intelligent, timely films that saved the industry from imminent
collapse. Without them, argues Biskind, American movies would have
lost their hold on the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least a dozen saviors on Biskind's list _ Dennis
Hopper, Warren Beatty, Robert Altman, Bob Rafelson, Peter
Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, Billy Friedkin, Francis Ford Coppola,
George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma and Hal Ashby. He
also takes major detours into the lives of actor Robert De Niro,
producers Peter Fonda and Bert Schneider and writers Paul Schrader
and Robert Towne.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind's argument is that films like ``Easy Rider,'' ``MASH,''
``The Last Picture Show'' and ``Shampoo'' came along at a time when
the studios were wallowing in Doris Day fluff and fat-budget
musicals. The new directors saved Hollywood from internally
hemorrhaging, argues Biskind _ their films said something to a
younger audience, opening up another generation to the power of
movies as the '70s tumbled into the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The new directors made their mark by turning the studio system
on its ear, making the director the most important part of the
movie deal. But then, one by one, they proceeded to implode.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cimino's massive budget overrun on the 1980 film
``Heaven's Gate'' is usually seen as the death knell of the
director's freedom _ it cost $44 million to make and grossed only
$1.3 million. But the tapestry the young directors were putting
together started unraveling long before that.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of massive budgets, massive insecurities, odd
groupings of groupies, easy-to-get drugs, easy-to-get sex and the
pure pull of power brought the house down around them. That's where
the gossip of ``Easy Riders'' comes in, and such good gossip it is.
</P>
<P>
   Here's studio executive Don Simpson, who died in 1996, on
Altman: ``He was such an alcoholic. He was full of gibberish and
full of himself, a pompous, pretentious a--hole.''
</P>
<P>
   And this rejoinder from Altman: ``Simpson was a bad guy, a bum
... it's a plus to our industry that he's not here anymore. I'm
only sorry he didn't live longer and suffer more.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Easy Riders,'' private conversations are quoted, everything
from the size of a drug habit to the size of a man's tool, but
nobody has come back at Biskind, calling him a liar. The book is
written primarily from interviews he conducted in the years he
edited Premiere and American Film, moving easily through the world
of movie-making.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind sees ``Easy Rider'' as the first film to pull Hollywood
out of a prolonged slump _ a slump that saw box office attendance
at 15.8 million in 1971, an all-time low. But even as it was
showing Hollywood the way to make money, ``Easy Rider'' was
planting the seeds of self-delusion that would eventually bring
about the collapse of America's new cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind points out that Hopper gathered the ``Easy Rider'' crew
in the parking lot of the New Orleans airport Hilton at 6:30 a.m.
before filming and went into a tirade. Fonda described Hopper as
``this little fascist blowin' us all off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper's combination of flying ego and crawling paranoia, fanned
by the success of ``Easy Rider,'' led to Hollywood footing the bill
for ``The Last Movie'' _ an artistic and economic fiasco that
spelled a quick and ugly end to Hopper's reputation as an emerging
talent behind the camera. Hopper's collapse as an up-and-coming
director was mirrored by other directors of his times, each
implosion a little more gruesome than the last.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper's ego had nothing on Friedkin, whose ``The French
Connection'' and ``The Exorcist'' were followed by duds such as
``Sorcerer,'' ``Cruising,'' ``The Guardian,'' ``Blue Chips'' and
``Jade.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with that list of flops, Friedkin couldn't come to terms
with his failure, saying, ``In the '70s, if you had a flop the
attitude was, `That's too bad, but it was a good picture.' Then it
became, if you made a film that was not a hit, they put you under
indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, ``Easy Riders'' looks down its nose at George
Lucas and Steven Spielberg, the only two directors from the '70s
who have consistently made blockbuster movies, bringing the public
back to the theater and power back to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind passes both men off as borderline dweebs, suggesting
that neither has the neuroses worthy of true genius. ``Easy
Riders,'' unable to find any real lust for the crazed life in
either Lucas or Spielberg, brushes off their movies as successful
but so-what.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coppola takes a swipe at Lucas and Spielberg by saying, ``Now,
here we are, 20 years after `Heaven's Gate.' Directors don't have
much power anymore, the executives make unheard of amounts of money
and budgets are more out of control than they ever were. And there
hasn't been a classic in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The flaw in ``Easy Riders,'' the flaw in Coppola's take on
Hollywood, is the notion that we shall never see the like of the
'70s directors again _ that these men cradled a special kind of
genius. The truth is that John Ford made as many outstanding movies
in his lifetime as the class of the '70s, combined, and that there
are, even now, talents emerging that make Hopper and others seem
like pretty small potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   It smacks of pettiness to deny Lucas his standing among talented
directors because the Star Wars trilogy appeals too much to the
buying public, the great unwashed. And it's just as petty to deny
Spielberg his just due as a great director.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola can talk all he wants about the lack of classic movies
over the past 10 years. But the fact is, ever since his
``Godfather'' triumphs he's been eating Spielberg's dust.

 &HT;    COMDEX FEATURES OPERATING SYSTEM WARS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- When it comes to our corporate customers, we say,
`Hey, whatever floats your boat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So says Richard Sullivan, an IBM software marketing executive.
His is a widely held view at the spring Comdex computer conference
in Chicago, where much of the talk Tuesday was of rivalries,
alliances and marketing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the multi-flavored approach more evident than with
operating systems, the underlying software that powers such
applications as word processors and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   While Windows, the operating system sold by giant Microsoft,
dominates personal computer desktops, the overall market remains
more fluid. Computer professionals who deal with such hardware as
network
</P>
<P>
   servers and hand-held devices have come to recognize that they
have plenty of choices in operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft takes up the single largest chunk of floor space at
the huge Comdex trade show for its Windows 2000 system. But the
densest crowds have flocked to a cluster of booths that feature
Linux, an
</P>
<P>
   operating system that some industry watchers have hailed as a
serious competitor to Windows -- and not only because it can be
downloaded for free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the operating system game, you're competing with
Microsoft,'' said Robert Young, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Red Hat Software, which offers Linux at no cost on its
Web site and for $50 on a CD. ``If you compete with a monopolist,''
he said, ``you can't play by their (CQ) rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Linux users has risen from 100,000 in 1993 to more
than 15 million today, and Young estimates Linux holds 17 per cent
of the operating system market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Windows, Linux can run on machines powered by other
</P>
<P>
   than Intel processors, including Alpha and Sun Sparcmachines
processors.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Linux users prompted Dell Computer earlier this
month to offer Linux installations on its network servers and on
its popular Optiplex workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several large computer and software firms _ including IBM,
Compaq Computer, Novell and Oracle _ have invested in Durham,
N.C.-based Red Hat Software, which makes its money by packaging
Linux software and services.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux isn't the only competition for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite Linux's momentum, sales of rival operating systems
continue to chug along at a healthy rate,'' said Joseph Panettieri,
executive editor of
</P>
<P>
   Smart Reseller, a trade publication. ``Simply put,'' he added,
``savvy resellers and network administrators know that they can't
bet their
</P>
<P>
   businesses on a single operating system. Instead, astute
technology managers are keeping one eye on established operating
systems while keeping the other on the fledgling Linux industry.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which has five times the revenue of Microsoft, illustrates
this trend. The company has named separate full-time system
managers to work in
</P>
<P>
   with Microsoft and with the Linux community.
</P>
<P>
   Said Linus Torvalds, who created Linux eight years ago and who
has emerged as a big celebrity at Comdex: ``I want to see when
people go into a computer store, that they have to think about what
operating system to use, that there isn't one default choice.''

A '50S HOUSE IN TEMPLE, TEXAS, MAKES NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know this house. You lived in it, or your parents did. Maybe
your grandparents still do. It is so normal, so average, the
neighborhood could be postmarked Anywhere, U.S.A. The house is like
thousands that were built in American suburbs in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The squat plastic coffee cups with a single ring for a handle _
you've held those. The plastic glasses, the melamine plates _
you've used those. There's a bread box _ you know how it will sound
when the door snaps closed. You know the kitchen counter, even
though flecked with gold glitter, will be as smooth as cornstarch.
</P>
<P>
   The colors on the kitchen cabinets _ turquoise, orange, lemon
yellow _ set the scene as effectively as the Saarinen and Eames
furniture that floats in the open expanse of the turquoise-floored
living room. You can practically smell the pigs-in-a-blanket
cooking in the copper-front Chambers wall oven. You can hear the
theme song to ``I Love Lucy'' playing somewhere in the house. You
know without looking it's a black-and-white TV recessed in a
cabinet with rough fabric-covered doors and rabbit ears on top.
</P>
<P>
   This house, built in 1959 by laminate magnate Ralph Wilson in
Temple, Texas, is so typically mid-century American, it has joined
Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater
on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The house is also deceptively futuristic. Wilson, who died in
1972, covered every possible surface of his house with plastic
laminate. Some people may know the generic product by a
competitor's brand name, Formica. Wilson used his house as a
showcase and laboratory for his company, Ralph Wilson Plastics _
now known as Wilsonart International, the nation's largest
manufacturer of solid-surface materials.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Wilsonart bought the Wilson House from Ralph's widow,
Sunny. The company plans to store archives there and use it much
like Wilson did, as a showcase for Wilsonart goods.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson often used his house to test his product. He covered his
garage walls with brown laminate, then refused to install garage
doors. He wanted to see how the plastic walls would withstand the
extreme Texas temperatures. After he died, Sunny had doors put in
for security reasons. The laminate, though, still looks good.
</P>
<P>
   The shower stalls and bathroom cabinets and counter tops, used
daily for decades, show no signs of age or ravages of moisture. The
bedroom doors and sliding pocket doors, also laminate, are as
smooth and lustrous as the day they were hung.
</P>
<P>
   The rounded edges found on the kitchen counters seem
unremarkable, until you remember that when they were installed,
sharp edges covered in aluminum strips were state-of-the-art.
</P>
<P>
   The multicolored laminate kitchen cabinets had to be installed
by a contractor who specialized in beauty shops, that being the
only application at the time for plastic-coated cabinets. Now,
laminate cabinets are quite common.
</P>
<P>
   This is what made Wilson's house so attractive to the National
Register. It was directional; the materials that were used and the
manner in which they were applied affected the way subsequent
houses were built. Ralph Wilson was a visionary, but his home was
that of the middle class, built in the mid-century, in central
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few buildings that reflect the lives of average citizens
are ever saved,'' says Grace Jeffers, the curator of Wilson House.
This is what makes it so valuable, and so personal. Everyone who
walks through the door feels a connection.
</P>
<P>

   The Wilson House is open for tours by calling (254) 773-9898.
The house is at 1714 S. 61st St., Temple, Texas.

   STROKES-DRUG &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Before the night was over, it seemed that
everyone at All Saints Episcopal Hospital knew about the stroke
patient who watched ``Judge Judy.'' Lila Shaw's fondness for the
feisty judge of daytime television, backed up by a quick call to
911, helped give doctors the confidence to use a powerful but
time-sensitive, clot-busting drug called t-PA. By midnight, Shaw
was well on her way to recovery. But three years after the drug's
approval, doctors say, too many patients are missing out on its
potential. Studies show that only 3 percent to 5 percent of those
eligible nationwide get the intravenous medication, according to
American Heart Association officials. By CHARLOTTE HUFF. Story will

<P>
   LA PORTE, Texas _ Veterans of the battle of San Jacinto once
collected free drinks for their battlefield heroics, but today, the
fight that gave Texas its independence is hardly mentioned beyond
the marshy reaches of Buffalo Bayou, east of Houston. Battleground
officials hope to change that attitude with an expensive new plan
to raise the image of the San Jacinto Monument to a level equal
with that of the Alamo. By ART CHAPMAN. Story will move in ``n''

   ROOFS-INSURANCE &QL;

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Hail-resistant roofs will defend your house,
save you money and time, and perhaps over the long haul bring
insurance costs down for every homeowner in Texas. But so far, it's
been a tough sell. A year after the state and insurance companies
launched a pioneering program to lower insurance premiums for
homeowners who put hail-resistant roofs over their heads, only a
fraction of Texans have taken advantage of the program. By CHRIS

average child has only 18 of them. The institute's president will
be in Fort Worth on April 26 to give a seminar. By CAROLYN POIROT.

   CHARTER-PROBE _ CBS News on Wednesday will report on a year-long
undercover investigation of Atlanta-based Charter Behavorial Health
Systems, the nation's largest chain of psychiatric hospitals. The
report focuses on Charter's children's wards, where the network
says it found evidence of deaths, injuries and hospital
falsifications of medical records in institutions from
Massachusetts to California. Charter has 91 hospitals in 32 states,
which admit about 60,000 children and adolescents a year, and it
takes in more than $300 million of taxpayer money annually.

   HITECH-SECRETARIES _ Technology and an increasingly mobile
workforce will transform many of today's secretaries and
administrative assistants into Information Coordinators. In the
next six years, Information Coordinators will be the ``ground
control'' for the rapidly evolving workplace, according to a new
report on the office of the future. IC's will serve as the critical
communication link among far flung employees, people working on
projects and telecommuters. They will also provide training for
teams working on new technologies, according to the report by
OfficeTeam, an international staffing company in Menlo Park, Calif.

   COKEBOTTLER-EARNINGS _ Coca-Cola Enterprises said today it lost
$62 million, or 15 cents a share, in the first quarter, partly

loss by the world's largest soft drink bottler was 2 cents more a
share than in the year-ago period. The results met Wall Street's
expectations. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FIRE-GEL _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Flames roar from Homestead to
Port St. Lucie, Fla., but wooden power poles that should be tinder
in their path stand tall thanks to John Bartlett. Bartlett is the
firefighter from Jupiter, Fla. who made national news and a tidy
profit by turning absorbent diaper gel into a booming fire-shield
business. His curiosity about how a pile of diapers remained
uncharred through a 1993 house fire led to the creation of
Barricade, a solution of water-absorbent polymers that sticks to
just about any surface and wards off flames. (Kalajian, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Now we get to the good news about income taxes: Two
out of three taxpayers will get a refund on their federal taxes,
averaging about $1,563. It's a refreshing windfall, one that some
people like so much that they build it into their spending
expectations every year. Two points need to be made: One, you
shouldn't leave that much money in Uncle Sam's account next time.
Two, it's up to you to decide whether this year's refund is a toy
or a tool. You can party or plan ahead, and either one will feel
good. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   FIRE-GEL _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Flames roar from Homestead to
Port St. Lucie, Fla., but wooden power poles that should be tinder
in their path stand tall thanks to John Bartlett. Bartlett is the
firefighter from Jupiter, Fla. who made national news and a tidy
profit by turning absorbent diaper gel into a booming fire-shield
business. His curiosity about how a pile of diapers remained
uncharred through a 1993 house fire led to the creation of
Barricade, a solution of water-absorbent polymers that sticks to
just about any surface and wards off flames. (Kalajian, Palm Beach

   MONEYTALK _ Now we get to the good news about income taxes: Two
out of three taxpayers will get a refund on their federal taxes,
averaging about $1,563. It's a refreshing windfall, one that some
people like so much that they build it into their spending
expectations every year. Two points need to be made: One, you
shouldn't leave that much money in Uncle Sam's account next time.
Two, it's up to you to decide whether this year's refund is a toy
or a tool. You can party or plan ahead, and either one will feel
good. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

THE SPIRITUAL DIET: LOSING POUNDS THROUGH PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LYNN STEINBERG  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LeAnn Larsen has fought the battle of the bulge since she was a
teenager, sampling one weight-loss program after another without
much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutri/System, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Dexatrim pills _ I
tried them all,'' said Larsen, a 51-year-old pastor's assistant at
the United Evangelical Free Church in the Ballard section of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until she stopped counting calories and put her
trust in God and a Christian weight-loss program called the Weigh
Down Workshop that the pounds came off _ and stayed off.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, thousands of men and women like Larsen flock to
Weigh Down meetings throughout the region and learn to substitute
God for food.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which started seven years ago in a Tennessee
church, has grown to an estimated 30,000 chapters worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest of several Bible-based weight-loss programs _
including First Place, 3D and Step Forward _ that differ in their
particulars but have as their central element a reliance on a
higher power. In that, they bear some resemblance to secular
12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   For the 58 million adult Americans who are overweight, these
programs offer a distinctly different approach to weight loss,
which has become a $33 billion-dollar a year industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a diet; that's why it worked,'' said Teri Lewis, a
42-year-old accountant, of Weigh Down, which helped her lose close
to 100 pounds and cut her dress size in half, from a 24 to a 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was that it made my relationship with God
better,'' Lewis said. ``It got me reading the Bible more. It took
my focus off food and onto that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times, after a stressful day, when Lewis would have
sought comfort in potato chips and french fries.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after she began the Weigh Down Workshop. She
started turning to scripture instead. If she wasn't at home, or
didn't have a Bible handy, she offered a simple prayer: ``Lord,
help me to get through this and not eat what I shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentals of the program, founded by Gwen Shamblin, a
Tennessee dietician and one-time cheerleader, are laid out in her
book ``The Weigh Down Diet'' (Bantam Doubleday, $22, 317 pages),
which has sold more than 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Shamblin preaches that ``head hunger'' _ the urge to
eat when the body doesn't need food _ is really spiritual hunger.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches people to recognize the difference and counsels them
to eat when they're hungry, stop when they're full, and satisfy
their emotional and spiritual needs with prayer.
</P>
<P>
   There's no counting calories or fat grams. There are no
forbidden foods. ``God created Fritos and dip for our enjoyment,''
Shamblin said. So she advises people to eat what they want _ just
less of it. Have a small serving of ice cream instead of half the
carton.
</P>
<P>
   When folks come to her and say they have an urge to snack, she
hands them a Bible and tells them to ``Chew on this.'' The only
exercise she promotes is kneeling down to pray.
</P>
<P>
   That's where she and many other dieticians part company.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association, a professional organization
that promotes sound nutrition, says regular physical activity is an
essential part of losing weight and keeping it off. It doesn't have
to be a 30-minute workout at the gym. It can be a brisk walk after
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely critical to good health, not just weight
loss, but long-term good health,'' said Sue Butkus, a dietician and
nutritionist at Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to physical activity, she said a safe and effective
weight-loss program should include a variety of foods and promote
the slow and sustained shedding of pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Butcher, 47, tried for years to slim down, finally growing
so frustrated she resigned herself to being overweight rather than
risk disappointment again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to put myself through that anymore,'' Butcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the incident that sent her down the path of
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Bob, were at Seattle's Museum of Flight. A
B-52 bomber was on display. Butcher was so fascinated with the
aircraft that she braved the steep metal stairs up to the cockpit
so she could have a look inside.
</P>
<P>
   At about 210 pounds, on a 5-foot-3 frame, she had a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   She heard snickering behind her as she reached the halfway
point. ``I don't know if it had anything to do with me,'' she said,
``but in my head they were laughing at the fat lady going up the
stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of that incident led Butcher to decide later that she
could no longer ignore her weight. ``God help me,'' she says she
cried out. ``I can't do this. I hate the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, while running an errand at her church, she
accidentally stumbled into an orientation for the Weigh Down
Workshop. She sat down and listened. Then she joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to look to food for everything,'' Butcher said. ``It
was a comfort. Then I transferred my love affair with food to a
love affair with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of satisfying what she came to recognize as ``head
hunger,'' she went to Shamblin's audio tapes or to the Bible and
began reading wherever it fell open. Soon, her desire to eat would
pass. She lost 55 pounds in 18 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two years after her first session, Butcher leads the
Weigh Down workshop at her church. Her husband leads another group
for men.
</P>
<P>
   The program consists of weekly meetings at which participants
view an hourlong video, then engage in discussion and prayer. The
workshop costs $103 for the first 3-month session, including
workbooks and tapes. Follow-up sessions cost less.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m. one recent Monday, 10 women of every size, shape
and age, gathered in a classroom at the United Evangelical Free
Church. They sat in folding chairs, facing a television at the
front of the room, with workbooks and Bibles in their laps.
</P>
<P>
   They listened attentively, occasionally nodding in affirmation,
as Shamblin preached: ``We all have hungry hearts ... but only one
thing will fill a hungry heart ... the Lord Almighty.''

PLANS UNDER WAY TO ENHANCE OBSERVATION OF BATTLE THAT WON TEXAS
INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PORTE, Texas _ Veterans of the battle of San Jacinto once
collected free drinks for their battlefield heroics, but today, the
fight that gave Texas its independence is hardly mentioned beyond
the marshy reaches of Buffalo Bayou, east of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Battleground officials hope to change that attitude with an
expensive new plan to raise the image of the San Jacinto Monument
to a level equal with that of the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years after the April 21, 1836, battle,
veterans gathered in Houston and rallied around a long flag pole
used during the fight. They put the pole on their shoulders and
took off on a round of bars. They would drop the pole in front of
the bar and demand free drinks in the name of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   With that round consumed, they would rattle a gourd canteen with
a Mexican bullet inside and demand another.
</P>
<P>
   It worked then, but today, their battlefield accomplishments
have been muted. Though it is still a state holiday, San Jacinto
Day is not a prominent Texas celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people today don't understand the Battle of San
Jacinto,'' said J.C. Martin, executive director of the San Jacinto
Museum of History. ``Coming here to the battlefield doesn't make it
much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Jacinto Battleground State Historical Park between
Houston and Bay City is an uncommon place with an irregular
history. Construction of the 570-foot monument began in 1936, but
when it was finished three years later it sat idle. All the money
was spent to make it taller than the Washington Monument _ fine for
a Texas-size boast _ but nothing was left to stock the museum at
the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to keep the fans running inside because if you turned
them off, mildew would begin sprouting on the walls like a wheat
field,'' said Malcolm McLean, who served as an assistant director
and archivist at the museum from 1939 to 1941.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, who later taught history and Spanish at both Texas
Christian University and the University of Texas at Arlington,
began assembling the museum's artifacts in the third-floor attic at
the Houston Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the state struck a deal: The monument belonged to
the state, but the museum would be run by the private, nonprofit,
San Jacinto Museum Association.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, maintenance of the park was handed over to the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   That confederation stopped a helter-skelter management that
brought several unrelated changes to the 1,000-acre park. A
reflecting pool was built, again similar to the Washington
Monument, but because of its mud bottom, it doesn't cast a
reflection. Picnic sites were constructed on the battlefield, and
roads cut through it.
</P>
<P>
   The Battleship Texas was anchored at the corner of the park and
concession stands were built at the edge of Sam Houston's old camp
site.
</P>
<P>
   It is only within the museum that any measure of understanding
of the battle can be obtained. In what has been the most successful
addition to the entire park, a 35-minute slide presentation called
``Texas Forever,'' is shown in the museum theater.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two computerized projectors cast more than 3,000 images on
the screen and tell the story of Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's
campaign against the rebel Texians. With slides shown as fast as 20
per second, the presentation is seamless and flawless, ending with
Houston's victory on the high-grass prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over half a million people have seen the slide
presentation since it began nine years ago,'' Martin said. ``It has
been very successful. In Texas Forever, we tried very had to tell
the truth from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, it is time to get the message to more people. A
master plan has been developed that will cost an estimated $55
million over the next dozen or so years. It will attempt to restore
the battlefield to its original 1836 condition.
</P>
<P>
   The reflecting pool will be drained and filled in with natural
prairie grasses. The picnic areas will be moved off the
battleground to adjacent areas. The Battleship Texas can't
realistically be moved, but its ticket office and concession stands
can be shifted away from Houston's camp site.
</P>
<P>
   A new visitor's center will be constructed.
</P>
<P>
   The goals, Martin said, will be to preserve the park's
significant cultural, historical and natural resources, and raise
the public awareness of the battleground.
</P>
<P>
   The monument belongs to all the people of Texas not just the
Houston area, Martin said. ``We all need to share in the history
and share in the responsibility. This is not a Gulf Coast treasure,
it is a state treasure.''

`BAREFOOT CONTESSA COOKBOOK': SHOELESS IN THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parties catered by Ina Garten of the Barefoot Contessa in East
Hampton, N.Y., are characterized by dauntingly lavish, artfully
arranged displays of vegetables, breads, fruit, cheeses and cakes.
But as her ``Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'' (Clarkson N. Potter,
$32.50) now reveals, the food from her shop could not be more
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few omissions, like the temperature for baking the
terrific chocolate buttercream cake, this is an excellent starter
cookbook, to set the novice on the path to successful dinners and
parties, especially looking toward summer. Bright photographs, by
Melanie Acevedo, show exactly how most of the food should look, and
illustrations show the differences between mincing, dicing,
julienne and chiffonade.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are replete with nice little touches, like the black
sesame seeds garnishing the oil-glossed sugar snap peas, and
directions for roasting some of the tomatoes for the tomato-basil
soup. But with few exceptions, like the lobster pot pie, they are
not complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, Ms. Garten suggests shortcuts, advance
preparation and convenient substitutions, including canned and
frozen vegetables and prepared mayonnaise. Feel free to use
packaged puff pastry, and do not expect to have to bake your own
bread to re-create her food.
</P>
<P>
   Little notes accompany the recipes, elaborating on the
ingredients and techniques. The navel orange segments specified in
the pretty beet salad, for example, must be cut away from the
membrane, not merely separated as when eating an orange.
</P>
<P>
   All the dishes are designed for entertaining, whether it's
plying weekend guests with staggeringly rich scones for breakfast,
assembling an array of tasty dips to be scooped with endive leaves
for cocktails, making a big turkey meatloaf for more than one meal
or recycling extra grilled lemon chicken breasts into a salad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recipes serve six or more, and many will feed 10.
(That chocolate buttercream cake will serve up to 12; bake it at
350 degrees.)
</P>
<P>
   Want to dazzle your guests? Try the roasted whole boned salmon
with a fennel stuffing. It couldn't be easier, and it most
certainly will produce raves when served at a buffet or dinner for
10 to 15.

`TIME, LOVE, MEMORY': LESSONS OF FRUIT FLIES, FROM THE FINCH'S
FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``great biologist'' of Jonathan Weiner's new book, ``Time,
Love, Memory,'' is Seymour Benzer, a professor at the California
Institute of Technology and one of the pioneers in the growing
fields of genetics and molecular biology. But what do time, love
and memory have to do with genetics? A great deal, says Weiner, a
scientist and science writer who won a Pulitzer Prize for a
previous book, ``The Beak of the Finch,'' a study of Charles Darwin
and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Benzer and the generations of students he has fostered studied
time, love and memory in fruit flies to see how genes govern
behavior. Fruit flies wake up at dawn and go to sleep at night even
when they are in a sealed room and never see the sun. Fruit flies
also have elaborate courtship rituals and mating behavior: love.
And surprisingly, experiments supervised by Benzer have proved that
flies can learn, for example, how to avoid electric shocks. That
is, they have memory.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's book is a fascinating history of the effort, led by
Benzer, to find the specific genes that regulate time, love and
memory in fruit flies and therefore to demonstrate something larger
about the connection between genes and behavior. Benzer was dealing
with what Weiner calls one of the ultimate questions, like the
origin of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the most intimate, the most immediate, in some ways the
most intricate and the most important for our inquiring species
will always be the origin of behavior,'' he writes. Are we born
already programmed to behave in certain ways? Or is all our
behavior learned? These are questions that are explored in Weiner's
very readable, literate and authoritative account.
</P>
<P>
   The most engaging parts of ``Time, Love, Memory'' are the early
chapters in which Weiner introduces Benzer and gives some of the
scientific background. There is an intimacy to the story here that
fades as Weiner proceeds and his subject grows in complexity and
becomes more difficult to manage on the page. In the second half of
the book we almost lose sight of Benzer (who, in any case,
eventually lost interest in studying the genetic origin of
behavior), and we sometimes lose Weiner's narrative thread as well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, ``Time, Love, Memory'' remains a solid and
absorbing story. If you aren't a biologist, you are likely to learn
a great deal about contemporary biology and the idiosyncratic,
sometimes bizarre ways of quarrelsome, ferociously ambitious
scientists. Weiner has a poetic and philosophical turn of mind, and
he manages to see the almost spiritual implications of the search
for the deepest truths about the nature of life. For example, when
he arrives at the discovery of the gene responsible for the sense
of time in fruit flies, he writes, ``The sense of time, mysterious
for so many centuries, was no longer a mystery that could be
observed only from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``Qualities that people had always thought of as
somehow floating above the body, apart from the body, as if they
belonged to the realm of the spirit and not of the flesh, as if
they were supernatural, might be mapped right alongside qualities
as mundane as eye pigment.''
</P>
<P>
   When Weiner comes to the genetic basis of memory, he observes
that, in the broadest sense, ``genes themselves are ancestral
memories of life on earth.'' He cites Proust to the effect that
memory is ``a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the
abyss of not-being,'' and from there makes an apt comparison:
``Evolution is learning. Species store learning in chromosomes the
way individuals store learning in their brains and societies store
learning in books.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the tale is Benzer, a personable, eccentric
polymath. His experiments with fruit flies in the 1960s and '70s
departed from the conventional scientific wisdom, which held that
there was no important genetic basis for human behavior. They also
led the way in the field of behavioral genetics for a generation of
later scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way, this is a parable of the strangeness of life,''
Weiner remarks as he embarks on Weiner's story. ``So much
millennial science from such tiny and alien creatures.'' Weiner
goes back in time to summarize the speculations of Gregor Mendel,
the first modern geneticist, and of Thomas Hunt Morgan of Columbia
University, who established the genetic basis of inheritance early
in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this early history is marvelously exciting. But as
science becomes more complicated, Weiner skips over what laymen
might find to be the most interesting details. He writes about
cloning and using enzymes to chop genes and altering their
sequences to find out how they work. But we don't get any colorful
sense of how this work is done, what it looks feels like in the
laboratory. And having had such good descriptions of those things
earlier in the story, we miss them.
</P>
<P>
   The subject remains fascinating all the way through, however,
and Weiner never lapses into a specialist's language. Some of the
best moments are furnished by his descriptions of the ingenious
experiments to determine whether fruit flies could learn. Then
there is the moment when Jeff Hall and Michael Rosbash fix a piece
of broken fly behavior (the loss of the biological clock) by
injecting a gene into an embryo. It was what Hall called a
mini-revolution, and Weiner brings us vividly and reliably there.

 &HT;    $1.65 million in arts grants headed to Georgia
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, which saw its grants
from the National Endowment for the Arts tumble 75 percent from
1990 to 1998, has rebounded for a combined $135,000 in 1999 grants,
its highest total in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The newest, a $50,000 grant, is to support ``Building Bridges to
the Community,'' an outreach and educational program that includes
such nontraditional venues as churches and community halls. It's
among 14 Georgia grants totaling $1.65 million _ part of the $58
million final round of 1999 national grants _ to be announced today
at the Woodruff Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   The federal largesse is especially welcome at the ASO, hurt in
recent seasons by a drooping box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased and honored to get two major NEA
grants in a single year,'' said Allison Vulgamore, ASO managing
director. (An $85,000 gift was announced in December.) ``It
bespeaks our major roles in setting national trends in outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Arts Federation, as usual the largest recipient
with a new $769,700 grant, enjoyed a slight increase over 1998 for
a yearly total of $1.1 million. The 1999 grant of $543,000 for the
Georgia Arts Council represents a 12 percent increase over 1998 and
the second increase in a row since the almost one-third cut the
council suffered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged,'' said Caroline Leake, executive director of
the council. ``Bill Ivey himself has been in the trenches, and
that's part of why you're seeing more money in the underserved
areas.'' Ivey, chairman of the NEA, was formerly based in Nashville
as head of the Country Music Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed a 50 percent increase in the $98
million NEA budget. Due to a ``winding down in the culture wars,''
in the words of Southern Arts Federation director Jeffery Kesper,
the NEA for the first time in years does not face substantial
resistance from conservatives. Michael Hightower, vice chairman of
the Fulton County Commission and a member of Americans for the
Arts, testified before Congress last week on behalf of the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S GETTING WHAT
</P>
<P>
   Here are the new Atlanta- and Georgia-based grants of $25,000 or
higher:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Southern Arts Federation: $769,700. To support tours and
residencies of arts entities in eight states from North Carolina to
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Georgia Council for the Arts: $543,000. To be distributed by
the council to various arts entities across the state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Atlanta Symphony Orchestra: $50,000. For the ``Building
Bridges to the Community'' outreach program.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alternate ROOTS: $50,000. To support residencies and fees for
artists, and publications documenting their activities, in
communities throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  7 Stages: $35,000. For the creation of a cash reserve to
offset fluctuations in earned and contributed income.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jomandi Productions: $30,000. For development of a national
board of directors and a feasibility study for the acquisition of a
performance facility.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Valdosta State University: $25,000. To support the position of
a folkorist.

NABOKOV AS MOUNTED SPECIMEN: CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION ENCASES
WRITER'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The novelist, lepidopterist, translator and teacher known as V
N, V. Sirin, Vasily Shishkov, Vivian Darkbloom and Vladimir Nabokov
would have turned 100 on Friday, April 23. The birthday party has
begun without him. If he had scripted it himself, he could not have
produced a better nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Speak, Memory,'' Nabokov writes about ``a young
chronophobiac who experienced something like panic'' when he
watched a home movie taken weeks before he was born. ``He saw a
world that was practically unchanged _ the same house, the same
people _ and then realized that he did not exist there at all and
that nobody mourned his absence. He caught a glimpse of his mother
waving from an upstairs window, and that unfamiliar gesture
disturbed him, as if it were some mysterious farewell. But what
particularly frightened him was the sight of a brand-new baby
carriage standing there on the porch, with the smug, encroaching
air of a coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   If a prenatal home movie could cause such panic, think what a
post-mortem birthday party could do.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov-the-ghost would see that everything had changed. His
mother would not be waving, but his son, Dmitri, would be there, a
large and tragic version of himself. Then Nabokov would see his
biographer, his wife's biographer, his English translator, the
lawyer for his estate, the merchant selling off his library piece
by piece. This time it would not be a mysterious farewell but an
uncanny hello from the appreciative ghouls holding the bits of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir (rhymes with redeemer) Nabokov (rhymes with the gawk
of) was born on April 23, 1899, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Last
week the Nabokov centennial celebration began in New York with a
Town Hall symposium sponsored by PEN American Center, The New
Yorker and Vintage Books. Martin Amis (novelist), Alfred Appel
(friend and interpreter), Brian Boyd (biographer), Richard Ford
(novelist), Elizabeth Hardwick (critic), Dmitri Nabokov (son),
Joyce Carol Oates (novelist), David Remnick (journalist), Michael
Scammell (translator) and Stacy Schiff (biographer) all came to pay
their respects.
</P>
<P>
   This week the celebration continues. The New York Public Library
is exhibiting Nabokov's manuscripts alongside his black-rimmed
glasses, butterfly net and worn-down pencils. Glenn Horowitz
Bookseller Inc. in Manhattan is showing off and selling off
Nabokov's library, including the dedication copies he inscribed to
Vera, his wife, with fanciful, colorful hand-drawn butterflies. Ms.
Schiff's biography ``Vera'' is coming out, with the details of a
Nabokov affair with a poodle groomer.
</P>
<P>
   And Nabokov's memoir, which he originally wrote in English as
``Conclusive Evidence,'' then translated into Russian, then
retranslated into English as ``Speak, Memory,'' is being issued yet
again, with Nabokov's review of it installed as a 16th chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe V N would recognize the world he left in 1977, maybe not.
Dmitri Nabokov, once a fast-living opera singer and race-car
driver, now chastened by a near-death experience after a fiery
crash and the death of his mother in 1991, has decided to devote
himself to literature. He is revising his own novel about parallel
lives, which has a love scene told in mathematical formulas. With
his lawyer, he is fighting the American and British publication of
``Lo's Diary,'' a new novel by an Italian writer, Pia Pera, about
Humbert and Lolita told from Lolita's perspective. And he is
thinking of finishing his father's half-done novel, ``The Original
of Laura,'' which Nabokov asked his family to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   At Glenn Horowitz Bookseller, Nabokov could make a last visit to
his old books. He would see the first editions he inscribed to Vera
_ including ``Speak, Memory,'' ``The Gift,'' ``Ada, or Ardor,''
``Pnin,'' ``Pale Fire,'' ``The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,''
``Transparent Things'' and his translation of Pushkin's ``Eugene
Onegin'' _ splayed like butterflies in glass boxes, with tiny
labels pinned next to them, referring collectors to a catalog and
price list.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he would discover that his hated, tattered,
green-covered copy of the Olympia Press edition of ``Lolita,''
which he aggressively marked up in preparation for its American
publication, had become the harlot of the birthday bash. The book
would be selling _ no, sold _ for $125,000. And he would see that
its cover, author's scribbles and all, had been used as the
prototype for a green rug designed by the artist Barbara Bloom. He
would learn that the rug was now in great demand and that Ms. Bloom
was considering publishing some more of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Nabokov would recognize himself better at the public
library, the home of the Berg Collection's newly acquired Nabokov
Archive. There he could see his worldly possessions flash before
him: his first published poems (1916), a chess problem he solved as
a teen-ager (1919), his drawing of an owl (or ``sirin'' in Russian,
which was one of Nabokov's Russian noms de plume), a long-forgotten
haiku decorated with a drawing of a butterfly (1923) and the diary
entry from 1922, when his father was shot: `` `Father is no more.'
Those four words hammered in my brain.''
</P>
<P>
   V N could watch himself aging in pictures: a young boy with his
family and dachshund, Trainy (1908), a rower at Cambridge
University (1922, labeled ``Moi''), a forlorn face in a derby
(1925), an egotistical butterfly hunter (1929-30, inscribed by
Nabokov, ``He is undeservingly handsome''), a Wellesley College
professor looking at a butterfly collection with young women under
a tree (1945-46), a bald Pnin-like figure reading ``Pnin'' with a
cat on his lap (1958), a man playing chess with his wife (1966).
</P>
<P>
   He would see his victories and disappointments laid out before
him: the kindly rejection that ``Lolita'' got from Katharine White
at The New Yorker (``I don't suppose anyone like me, with five
potential nymphets in the family ... would not find the book
uncomfortable''), and the cruel review his friend Edmund Wilson
gave his lovingly literal translation of ``Eugene Onegin.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he would see his revenges too. He could read his handwritten
sarcasm dripping onto his copy of Wilson's review (``How many rare
and unfamiliar words!'') and the tiny newspaper item he clipped
announcing Wilson's tax problems. He could read his line-by-line
thrashings of translations that he hated and his harsh grades for
the writers of the day, entered unmercifully in his copies of
short-story collections (A-pluses only for himself and J.D.
Salinger, C-plus for William Maxwell, D for Roger Angell, E for Ms.
Hardwick).
</P>
<P>
   But his best revenge would be in the ``Lolita'' section.
Although the manuscript note cards would not be there (they were
destroyed, said Rodney Phillips, the curator of the library's
exhibition), Nabokov could gawk at the ``Lolita'' paraphernalia
that had been saved, including the brochure from Grand Teton
National Park and the white, heart-shaped glasses that his
Hollywood agent, Swifty Lazar, gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there would be those stern pronouncements about the
monuments of literature: his dismissal of Jane Austen (``a
collection of eggshells in cotton wool'') and his chilly
calculation of the number of words in Austen's ``Mansfield Park,''
Dickens' ``Bleak House'' and Flaubert's ``Madame Bovary.'' Nabokov
would see again how he reduced Kafka, Tolstoy and Joyce to diagrams
of beetles, train cars and maps of Dublin respectively, and how he
ranked Russian writers (first Tolstoy, then Gogol, Chekhov,
Turgenev). And he would see his comically bad rewording of the
opening words in his copy of ``Ulysses'': not ``Stately, plump Buck
Mulligan came from the stairhead,'' but ``Buck Mulligan, who is a
robust vulgarian, came from the stairhead.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were not enough to convince him of his everlasting
greatness, he would see the inconsequential objects snatched from
oblivion: his magnetic chess set, his deadpan assessments of
American motels (``Boxwood Manor _ Restricted. Delightful for long
stays''), his list of things to take on a 1944 trip to Cape Cod
(one pair of dungarees, four pillow slips, one flashlight, one
ration card), his worn-down pencils and his elaborate recipe for
``Eggs a la Nabocoque,'' boiled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   What would the chronophobiac think? He might love it. He might
hate it. He would certainly try to fix it. If there is one constant
in the exhibitions, it is not Nabokov's humor, not his grasp of
American ``poshlost'' (Russian for vulgarity), not his amorous,
ludic style, not his love of masks, mirrors, mimicry, memory,
butterflies, doubles. The one constant is Nabokov's endless fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he opened a book, whether it was by him or someone
else, he reworked it, retranslated it, graded it, counted its
words, sketched its scenes, penciled in changes for the next
incarnation. After spending four years translating ``Eugene
Onegin'' and then seeing it trashed by Wilson as hideously literal,
he announced that ``it was not close enough and not ugly enough,''
and vowed to redo it.
</P>
<P>
   In his copy of the Olympia Press ``Lolita,'' Nabokov not only
gleefully crossed out the name of the press every chance he got
(the publisher Maurice Girodias had been slow to pay and quick to
take away Nabokov's rights), but he also edited it to make the
language more specific and more colloquial. ``Take the linen in''
became ``take in the wash,'' the ``stipple'' of down on Lolita's
arm became ``tracery.'' V N also plumped up Lo to conform with a
study of healthy school-age girls published by the U.S. Health
Department. The first time around, he had her ``hip diameter, from
crest to crest, barely 8 inches, probably even less'' and her
``thigh circumference, 14.'' In the American edition, it was ``hip
girth, 29 inches, thigh girth (just below the gluteal sulcus) 17.''
</P>
<P>
   He was crazy about details. As Stephen Jay Gould noted in an
essay in ``Vera's Butterflies,'' a book on Nabokov's inscribed
first editions compiled by Sarah Funke, there was a connection
between his writing and his lepidoptery: ``the almost obsessive
attention to meticulous and accurate details.'' No wonder
lepidopterists named butterflies in his honor: Humbert, Lolita,
Kinbote, Shade, Pnin and Eugene Onegin.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Nabokov ever needed an English translator, said
Scammell, his English translator and PEN's president, was to spare
himself the temptation to rewrite his novel while translating it.
He loved to annotate, correct, label, collect and recollect. And
when others tried to do it for him, he often balked.
</P>
<P>
   So what would he think of the lines of his life laid out before
him, some straight, some twisted, all out of reach and uneditable?
As Dmitri Nabokov noted at the end of the Town Hall symposium,
Vladimir Nabokov believed ``the sorrow of interrupted life is
nothing compared to the sorrow of interrupted study.'' He once
wrote, ``I cannot forgive the censorship of death. ... In this
eerie, alien world, the letters of life, whole lines, have been
transposed by the typesetters.''

OVERSEAS WINE SALES SET RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB NORBERG   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Overseas wine drinkers have discovered U.S
wines, particularly those produced in California, buying a record
$537 million in U.S. wine last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the wine exports were from California.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. wine exports totaled about 72 million gallons,
or $537 million, compared with 22 million gallons, or $98 million,
in 1988. In 1997, overseas wine sales were 60 million gallons,
valued at $426 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a continual increase in the last 10 years,
because of an increase in California marketing and the general
trend in large wine markets to look for other wines to taste,''
said Joe Rollo of the Wine Institute, a San Francisco trade
association. ``California wine in particular has become of interest
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine Institute President John De Luca predicted that
international sales could reach $650 million this year and more
than $1 billion by 2004. He said a potential trade deal with China
could open a huge untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   The leading market for U.S. wine in 1998 was the United Kingdom,
where exports were valued at $143 million, an increase over the
past year of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan was second at $93 million, an increase of 134 percent,
despite the economic problems that have gripped that country.
</P>
<P>
   Ken-ichi Hori, Wine Institute trade representative in Japan,
said the boom coincides with the emergence of discount wine stores,
which increase competition; news reports about the health effects
of moderate wine consumption, and wine as a symbol of
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were $91 million in Canada, $48 million in the
Netherlands, $23 million in Switzerland and $11 million in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the fourth-largest producer of wine in the
world, and the ninth-largest exporter. Exports, however, account
for a relatively small 12 percent of total production. In
California, 125 wineries produce wine that is sold in 165 different
countries.

`60 MINUTES II': RESTRAINT AS A EUPHEMISM IN PSYCHIATRIC
HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Every year, scores of thousands of mentally ill people are
confined at one or another of the dozens of hospitals belonging to
Charter Behavioral Health Systems, the nation's largest chain of
for-profit psychiatric hospitals. About half the patients are
children, whose parents will find little comfort in Wednesday
night's hourlong report on ``60 Minutes II.'' With the help of an
undercover investigator, a hidden camera and some former Charter
employees, CBS News has unearthed evidence of deaths and injuries
of patients and falsification of records.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bradley begins the report with a horror story: a 16-year-old
boy asphyxiated by a towel wrapped around his face while he was
under ``therapeutic restraint,'' his wrists and ankles strapped and
held immobile. He was the third patient in four months to die while
being ``restrained'' in this Charter hospital, in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The examples caught by a hidden camera in another hospital of a
screaming patient being ``restrained,'' to use that bland word for
an exercise in violence by what look like SWAT teams, are not
likely to find their way into Charter's advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But the more basic indictment arising from the CBS investigation
goes beyond the occasional, possibly justified use of force.
Low-paid and ill-trained workers are found to be handling patients
without medical supervision; when doctors are available, they
sometimes provide only cursory attention.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover reporter, Terrance Johnson, a licensed social
worker, took a low-paying job at the Charter hospital in Charlotte,
N.C. He records the doings of a nurse who apparently fills out
reports on patients in accord with instructions to emphasize the
negative. Although most Charter workers try to do their jobs
conscientiously, the driving purpose of their employer, some former
employees are convinced, is to collect money from federal programs.
That came to $300 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is understandably defensive about using the hidden
camera, a tiny device placed in the investigator's eyeglasses. Such
techniques can be troubling, but as Bradley explains, Charter is
not forthcoming about its procedures beyond a rote statement
avowing its compassion, and executives declined to be interviewed
for the program.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs-Brown, the inspector general of the federal
Department of Health and Human Services, deplores the scenes of
rough treatment of inmates that Bradley shows her, and her office
has taken action against a few Charter hospitals. But Dr. Dennis
O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Health Care Organizations, which is entrusted with accrediting
psychiatric and other institutions, confesses to not even knowing
about incidents of abuse that have been reported in newspapers. He
tells Bradley, ``Our information pathways need to be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, CBS News has now provided an information pathway. It
remains to be seen whether the authorities will travel it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gray Kunz, the four-star chef without portfolio, has
generated nearly as much talk about his search for a space for his
own restaurant as he did while cooking at Lespinasse. Finally, he
is hoping to open in Lever House, the landmark office building on
Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many obstacles remain between him and a sure deal on the former
employee cafeteria and terrace of Lever House, a 1952 edifice with
a glass-curtain facade that changed office building design forever.
Will there be enough room for the kitchen he needs, after the
million-dollar extravaganza he was accustomed to at Lespinasse?
Will the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission allow him
to cut a door into the side of the building to allow direct access
to the dining room?
</P>
<P>
   Kunz said he knows there is ``added-on difficulty with a
landmarked building, but there's a lot of character and cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a landmark space, the rewards are so much better,'' he
said. ``You have a facade, an exterior so wonderful it attracts a
certain clientele that has an eye for that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the negotiations succeed, Kunz will join a growing contingent
of New York restaurateurs who have discovered the advantages of
recycling grand old spaces into culinary pleasure palaces. David
Rockwell, the architect who designed Michael Jordan's: The Steak
House in the landmark Grand Central Terminal, summed up the allure:
``There is something about a space revealing its layers that is a
richer, more exciting experience'' than working in a raw space, he
said. ``You are trading off being able to throw up Sheetrock
wherever you want for an incredible sense of quality of what was
there before. There is a shortage of spaces where the space itself
is the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The recycling trend began two years ago when Le Cirque 2000
opened in the landmark rooms of the Henry Villard Houses, built in
1887 and now part of the New York Palace Hotel. Adam Tihany's
ultramodern design was controversial. But Jennifer Raab, the
landmarks commission's chairwoman, said: ``Le Cirque did one of the
best preservation jobs in the city. The new things they brought in
are all temporary, and when Adam Tihany's designs are no longer the
rage, a new set of designs will come.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight months, more and more owners have realized
that one way to stand out in the blizzard of new restaurants with
similar menus is to be in a landmark building. Tabla and Eleven
Madison Park made news in the Art Deco Metropolitan Life Building,
at Madison Avenue and 24th Street; Bayard's opened in India House,
the former home to the New York Cotton Exchange, built in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   And more are on the way. After years of delay, construction has
finally begun under the Queensboro Bridge on a project that will
include two restaurants. Pier A, the Victorian building near
Battery Park City whose reclamation has been in the works for 10
years, is to open in the fall as a restaurant with incomparable
views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. A private
apartment in Grand Central is becoming a lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings like these, at ``the monumental end of the spectrum,''
are particularly suited to restaurants, said Dr. James Marston
Fitch, the founder of the Columbia University graduate program in
historic preservation and a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle, the
architectural firm that oversaw the restoration of Grand Central
and Ellis Island. ``It is new wine for old bottles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, developers have had a change of heart and
finally understand that there are substantial tax credits for
restoring landmarks. For landlords, a retail establishment can help
pay for a restoration. ``You can breathe new life into old
buildings by creating a new economic engine,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   And the landmarks commission looks with particular favor on
restaurants. ``One of the great things about restaurants is that
they don't call for a lot of division of space, so they keep the
open feeling,'' Ms. Raab said. ``Restaurants often prize the same
features preservationists appreciate, like the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kunz has discovered, even a relatively new landmark has
irresistible allure. For 50 years, Fitch said, ``the policy was all
old buildings are bad buildings, all new buildings are good. But in
the last 10 years the public hostility to old buildings has turned
to enthusiastic support.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the preservation movement has grown beyond a
fringe element. New York City's 33-year-old landmark law, passed
after the razing of the old Pennsylvania Station, is one of the
strongest in the country, said Peg Breen, president of the New York
Landmarks Conservancy, a nonprofit group that gives financial and
technical help to owners of landmark properties. ``Now there is
more emphasis on buildings that are 30, 40 and 50 years old,'' like
Lever House and the Four Seasons Restaurant, she said. ``In many
instances there is a sense of prestige to own a landmark or to live
in a historic district, and people have seen their property values
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has designated 1,400 exteriors and 102 interiors
as landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   As businesses consolidate, particularly banks, more and more
grand spaces have become available. ``The large turn-of-the-century
buildings are perfect for restaurants because volume is a luxury''
in Manhattan, said Tony Goldman, whose company, Goldman Properties,
specializes in restoration. He has opened Wall Street Kitchen and
Bar in the 1907 neo-classical American Bank Note Co. building at 70
Broad St. in the financial district. ``When you have space that is
20 or 25 feet high, there's an aura. There's value in the artistic
quality _ the fabulously carved and elaborate ceilings, grand
columns and craftsmanship that is not available today.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most notable new-old restaurants are in one landmark,
the Metropolitan Life Building. While Tabla has Indian accents,
Eleven Madison Park has retained Art Deco characteristics. The
latter project ``took six months extra and cost 30 percent more
than had been budgeted,'' said Richard Coraine, the director of
operations for Danny Meyer's restaurants, including these. ``The
whole rich history of landmarked buildings is another story to
tell, and there is a certain amount of pride that the building is
important for other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayard's, in India House at One Hanover Square, is an even more
sensitive re-creation of an original space. The building, in the
Italianate palazzo design, has been a private club since 1914. The
club continues to operate at lunchtime, but Harry Poulakakos, who
owns Harry's at Hanover Square downstairs, and his son, Peter, have
restored the interior, peeling back layers of paint to reveal the
magnificent architecture and mahogany double staircase, and
removing the acoustical tile from the ceilings and linoleum from
the floors.
</P>
<P>
   Dining there is transporting, out of turn-of-the-millennium
Manhattan: you almost hear the rustle of silk damask gowns and feel
the warm glow from the candelabra.
</P>
<P>
   Farther uptown, in Tribeca, Henry Meer has opened City Hall in a
landmark 1861 Italianate building on Duane Street that used to
house a dry-goods wholesaler and was once Public School 10. The
creamy yellow exterior sparkles in sunlight; inside, the dining
room, with its two-story ceilings, has the original cast-iron
columns and support beams, enhanced by historic photographs of New
York lining the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really looking for another restaurant,'' said Meer,
who also owns the Cub Room in Soho. ``But being a passionate New
Yorker, I always wanted a restaurant to be reflective of New York
and have a New York experience.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York Harbor, Pier A is expected to be open by year's end
with a restaurant and banquet rooms; Levy Restaurants of Chicago,
which operates the highly rated Spiaggia there, is negotiating to
operate them. Pier A began life in 1886 as the headquarters of the
docks and ferries department and was a fireboat station before it
was set for demolition to make way for Battery Park City. The metal
and glass structure became a landmark in 1977, saving it, but the
project, which was to take six years, is now in its 10th year. The
budget has ballooned from $18 million to $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Grand Central, the Campbell Apartment, a hidden jewel of a
Florentine palazzo, is being renovated as a cocktail lounge by Mark
Grossich, who calls it ``a one-of-a-kind space in a one-of-a-kind
space.'' From the 1920s to the '40s, it was the office of a wealthy
businessman, John W. Campbell. The apartment, where he and his wife
entertained guests, had a pipe organ and grand piano. ``It gives
you a sense of how large a swashbuckling tycoon lived at the
time,'' said Grossich, who also owns Bar and Books.
</P>
<P>
   The organ and piano are gone, but the rest of the apartment is
being restored to its former grandeur, with painted beamed
ceilings, a huge stone fireplace, an enormous leaded-glass window,
even gargoyles. Grossich hopes to open by the end of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark revival is also renewing activity at the
long-stalled Bridgemarket, the vaulted space beneath the Queensboro
Bridge, leased by the London-based Conran Holdings and Joel Kissin,
the owner of Guastavino's Inc., which will run two glass-front
restaurants and two Conran stores. After 22 years of delays,
workmen are finally cleaning the tiled ceiling, which soars 37
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants are scheduled to open by year's end. One of
them, Guastavino, at ground level, will be like Conran's Quaglino
restaurant in London, a grill with rotisserie food. The other, Club
Guastavino, a more luxurious French-accented version of Bibendum,
also in London, will be on a mezzanine, where a party of two could
easily leave behind $200. The names honor the architect Rafael
Guastavino, a 19th-century Spanish immigrant who invented vaulted
tiled ceilings, one of which can be seen in the Oyster Bar at Grand
Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into these landmarked spaces, you get a definite
sense of place, of continuity with the past,'' said Ms. Breen, of
the Landmarks Conservancy. ``Places that give you a sense of the
past, and an understanding that there have been generations before
you help to ground you and help to make you feel a part of New
York.'' &QL;

PERSISTENT FOX 
HAIRY-CHESTED HISTORY 
ANIMATION IMITATING LIFE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox may not pull off the upset it hoped for this season, beating
NBC for the top ratings position among viewers between the ages of
18 and 49, the category that both use to determine which network is
really television's leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox did beat NBC in that category last week, for its sixth
triumph over NBC this season, its most victories ever. It was also
the first time that Fox managed to beat NBC this season without
relying on some special sports event, like the World Series or
Super Bowl, or some slash-and-burn video special, like ``When Good
Pets Go Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many ``if you can't beat 'em, join 'em''
developments of this season, NBC is now the network boosting its
ratings base with vivid video footage, like a man being sucked up
into a jet engine. The network's new Wednesday night entry,
``World's Most Amazing Videos,'' is apparently pulling in many of
the fans of that kind of Fox fare. Last week it was the
14th-highest-rated show of the week among young adult male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with that jet-propelled new addition, NBC again
showed that when its powerhouse Thursday night lineup is in repeats
it is vulnerable to attack from Fox. But the real secret to Fox's
gaining on NBC is the strength of its new animated shows.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Futurama'' on Tuesday and ``Family Guy'' on Sunday are
putting down roots with the male viewers who are the core of Fox's
strength. On Tuesday, where Fox has been struggling, ``Futurama''
posted the best ratings for Fox of the season, managing to finish
13th of 129 shows last week among those younger male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In the more hospitable (for Fox) surroundings of Sunday,
``Family Guy'' made a strong impression by finishing second only to
``The X-Files'' among male viewers between 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   Fox still trails NBC by a little less than three-tenths of a
rating point for the season in the age group. But that will be all
but impossible to make up because the May ratings sweep begins in
two weeks, and NBC will be fully armed with original episodes of
its Thursday shows, as well as a strong lineup of movies and
specials.
</P>
<P>
   But the animated series, if they continue to grow, may give Fox
a new power base from which to challenge NBC next season.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The War Channel?
</P>
<P>
   Some say the History Channel ought to be called the War Channel,
or perhaps the Murder-and-Mayhem Channel, because of its fondness
for programs about war, the military, fighter planes, guns, secret
police forces, dastardly crimes and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so far from that,'' protested Abbe Raven, the network's
senior vice president for programming. ``Military history is
important, but look at our new shows: It's probably less than 20
percent'' war-related.
</P>
<P>
   The network has tried to broaden its definition of history for
its 1999-2000 season schedule, which includes specials on the
history of basketball and of advertising, as well as ``History's
Lost and Found,'' about famous artifacts, and a series on natural
disasters called ``The Wrath of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The three most popular programs in the channel's history were
about the Hell's Angels and San Quentin and Folsom prisons, in that
order. But its most-watched night of the week, which is Sunday,
features ``Tales of the Gun'' and three programs related to the
military and to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for focusing on such topics is that they are
particularly popular with men. The network's prime-time audience is
roughly 70 percent male. Adult male viewers are considered
especially valuable to advertisers because they don't watch as much
television as other groups and are difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Military history will remain a staple, ``but we're broadening,''
Ms. Raven said. ``The 50th anniversary of the Korean War is coming
up next year, and we'll do a definitive miniseries on it, and very
proudly, but we're also expanding with things like `History's
Mysteries,' for example, with Arthur Kent joining us as host for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The network recently began placing billboards or signs in sports
arenas and stadiums. Indeed, during retirement ceremonies for Wayne
Gretzky at Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday night, the
hockey superstar was positioned in such a way that much of the
television coverage showed a huge History Channel banner in the
background.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Spade's New Cartoon
</P>
<P>
   Even NBC has noticed the strength of animation. The network has
commissioned its first original prime-time animated series, a
skewed take on family comedy, created by one of NBC's stars, David
Spade of ``Just Shoot Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The animated show is tentatively called ``Sammy,'' after one of
two main characters in the show, a ne'er-do-well deadbeat Dad named
Sammy who returns after 17 years to reunite with the three sons he
abandoned as toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Spade had no trouble concocting this situation, he said, because
it more or less exactly parallels his own experience as a son.
</P>
<P>
   Spade, who conceded he was ``sort of working things out
psychologically'' by creating the series, said he never told the
animators that the situation was this close to his real life. When
the initial drawings came in, ``everybody looked so much like the
real people it freaked me out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the show began to germinate during his days on
``Saturday Night Live,'' he said, when he thought he would like to
do a skit in which he could do both his own voice and his father's.
Since he also wanted to be able to flash back to childhood scenes,
animation seemed the right way to go, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the series the father takes the three sons to the park, sends
them all out for long passes during a football game, and then takes
off.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that there may be a bit more reality to this than in
most cartoons, Spade said he believed ``a lot of kids today are in
broken homes and they'll relate to the feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how his father feels about it, Spade said: ``He sort of
likes the attention, but it's going to get ugly fast. No, really, I
think he has to grant a little leniency. I think by us growing up
this way, he has to bite his tongue a little bit and say, `All
right, this is what you want to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   NBC plans to add ``Sammy'' to its schedule in January.

 EDITORS NOTE: This week, The San Francisco Chronicle introduces 
 ``Learning to Cook,'' a new column by Marion Cunningham. Widely 
 known for her revisions of the Fannie Farmer cookbooks, 
 Cunningham has begun a crusade to revive the dying art of home 
 cooking.  
   
 Her column, which will be available regularly through the New 
 York Times News Service, teaches novice cooks the basics of 
 working in the kitchen and preparing recipes. Please look for it 
 when The Chronicle's food stories move on Tuesdays.  
   
 Today, we bring you a profile of Cunningham, who teaches new 
 cooks in her Walnut Creek, Calif., home. We also bring you her 
 first column.  
   
   
Walnut Creek, Calif. _  MARION _  Consider the case of the recently
divorced CBS executive. Stumped by a tarte tatin recipe instructing
him to toss sliced apples in a bowl, he stood on one side of his
kitchen and threw them into a bowl across the room. He thought the
tossing action somehow aerated the fruit. How about the woman who
stared blankly at a dairy case, searching in vain for a package of
softened butter? &HT;    Laugh if you like, but don't expect food expert and author
Marion Cunningham to join you. To her, these culinary fiascoes are
very real examples of a larger issue: America is forgetting how to
cook. With sidebars: Top 10 Marionisms, List of Basic Kitchen
Equipment, Recipes for Beginners, Miniprofiles of Novice Cooks.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seeds for a major spring storm system developing over the
Middle West on Wednesday were sown Tuesday as a narrow ribbon of
Pacific jet stream winds, with speeds in excess of 160 mph, dove
southeast toward the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, showers and thunderstorms, fed by an increasingly
speedy channel of moist winds from the Gulf of Mexico, will douse
parts of the central Plains in response to a compact but potent jet
stream disturbance ejecting east ahead of a developing low pressure
system over southwest Kansas. A few storms could become severe.
Recurrent rains will produce rainfalls to 2 inches or more from
northeast Kansas and eastern Nebraska. Moderate to heavy rains will
spread to northern Missouri, southern Iowa and northwestern
Illinois. The risk of flooding will be heightened in areas where
showers and thunderstorms repeatedly pass over the same regions.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate rains will fall over parts of southern South Dakota and
northwest Nebraska as moist winds from the east ascend the sloping
terrain. Accumulating snows will fall in the mountains of Wyoming
as moist winds wrap westward around the expansive Kansas low.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible in west Texas along a
north-south line that marks the boundary between humid air from the
Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the plateaus of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a batch of showers will race eastward over parts of
the northern Middle Atlantic states as a warm front south of the
region teams with a jet stream disturbance to lift relatively moist
air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaska Volcano
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the Alaskan peninsula, a volcano erupted
Monday afternoon spewing an ash cloud over Unimak island. The plume
of ash and smoke prompted warnings for residents near Shishaldin
volcano to stay indoors until the ash fallout ceased. Volcanoes
have been known to disrupt worldwide weather patterns due to their
fine ash particles reaching into the stratosphere and being carried
around the globe by high level winds. However, the gelid atmosphere
of southwestern Alaska limits the ascent of a volcanic cloud and
this eruption's effects will only be noticed by nearby residents.

of inviting the general public to report on truckers' driving
skills has blossomed. Hundreds of thousands of trucks now sport
``How's my driving?'' decals with toll-free telephone numbers,
requesting complaints _ and, sometimes, praise _ from motorists.
Begun in the late 1980s, the simple concept has boomed in
popularity in recent years, spurred by the proliferation of
cellular phones and increasing friction between cars and trucks on
congested highways. (Banstetter, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   HOLOCAUST-DEBATE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the past 14
months, the director of the United States Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., was fired when he objected to the museum being
used for political purposes. The editor of an influential magazine
on Jewish affairs was called ``brainless when it comes to the
Holocaust'' for criticizing the growing field of Holocaust studies.
More than half a century after the Holocaust, defining, owning and
placing it in context have become more complex and more contentious
issues than ever. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 CHAMPION OF HOME COOKING: Marion Cunningham fights to save a 
 fading art  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; WALNUT CREEK, Calif. &LR;  _ Consider the case of the recently divorced
CBS executive from Los Angeles.
<P>
   Stumped by a tarte tatin recipe instructing him to toss sliced
apples in a bowl, he stood on one side of his kitchen and threw
them into a bowl across the room. He thought the tossing action
somehow aerated the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Bay Area woman who stared blankly at a dairy case,
searching in vain for a package of softened butter?
</P>
<P>
   Or another who substituted cornstarch for flour, figuring the
two looked enough alike that the switch would work?
</P>
<P>
   Laugh if you like, but don't expect food expert and author
Marion Cunningham to join you. To her, these culinary fiascoes are
very real examples of a larger issue: America is forgetting how to
cook.
</P>
<P>
   At 77, the woman who wrote the Fannie Farmer cookbooks and spent
11 years at James Beard's side easily could rest on her reputation
as one of the America's grande dames of the kitchen. Instead, she
has embarked on a passionate crusade that may turn out to be one of
the most important culinary contributions to the 20th century: She
is teaching people who are completely lost in the kitchen how to
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham believes the simple art of cooking and sharing food
is an essential part of a healthy society. But the skills are
fading.
</P>
<P>
   Some may argue otherwise, pointing out the proliferation of
cookware stores and the rise of the restaurant culture as proof
that America is in love with food.
</P>
<P>
   But Cunningham isn't talking about eating out or about people
with well-equipped, well-used kitchens. She's talking about the
newly divorced &UR;  &LR; father or the harried parent or the twentysomething
who grew up in a house where take-out food was the norm. Her
targets are men and women who don't have the time or the confidence
to cook regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking is important, she says, because the table is the modern
tribal fire, the place where stories are shared, families are
created and culture is passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catalyst for social interaction is cooking and eating
together,'' Cunningham says. Serving food family-style teaches a
child to share, to leave something for the next person. Sitting
next to someone sparks interaction and teaches people how to have
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone cooks at home, even if they're not very good, the
people they share it with take something with them when the meal is
over,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Given that philosophy, it's easy to understand why Cunningham
was so concerned about the apple-tossing executive. His story
prompted her to seek out similar tales. About two years ago, after
listening to an eye surgeon read from a cookbook and confess
ignorance about instructions that seemed simple to Cunningham, she
decided to dedicate herself to teaching the kitchen novice the art
of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Few others are as qualified for such a quest. In the 1970s,
James Beard, the dean of American cooking, handpicked Cunningham as
his assistant. She went on to write six books and teach all over
the country and in Paris. She is regularly sought out as a source
in food media and a guest on panels with colleagues such as Julia
Child and Chez Panisse founder Alice Waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she gets it exactly right,'' Waters says. ``She's
talking about the good feelings that come from sharing food at the
table. It's not about fueling yourself. It's about connecting as
human beings. That's a terribly important ritual that is missing in
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham set about her task by ferreting out people who knew
so little about cooking that, to them, ``blanch'' meant the female
lead in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' She found her first group
when she asked for volunteers from the 450 people who attended a
food seminar panel she was on.
</P>
<P>
   For 11/2 years, in batches of six or seven, students met in the
comfortable kitchen of her Walnut Creek home to make three dishes
each week. At the end of each class, they sat down and ate their
creations together. Cunningham taught them how to chop an onion,
how to navigate in the grocery store _ even how to clean the
kitchen efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the students, who immediately took to Cunningham's
twinkling, gentle approach, taught her what they needed to know.
What does the phrase ``dot with butter'' mean? How do you cook
something until golden? How can flimsy egg whites be ``folded''
into batter? They showed her why recipes were confusing and shared
their bewilderment at simple tasks, like picking out the right sort
of rice at the grocery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned more from them than they did from me,''
Cunningham says.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the success her students were achieving in the
kitchen, she compiled the experiences into a new book called
``Learning to Cook With Marion Cunningham,'' (Alfred A. Knopf,
$29.95, due out May 2). It's already getting good previews.
Publishers Weekly this month gave it a star, designating the book
as a new work of unusual interest and merit.
</P>
<P>
   The book has more than 150 recipes, with every step spelled out
in breezy language, and more than 100 accompanying photographs. And
although many of the book's recipes are simple _ scrambled eggs,
for example _ some allow the new cook to produce table-dazzlers,
like roast leg of lamb or shrimp curry.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham manages to get inside the head of the novice cook,
understanding befuddlement at something as seemingly simple as
dredging meat in flour. And it's all done with tremendous respect
for the beginner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a true teacher. She's has so much joy in what she does,
and she just wants to share it,'' says Julie Scharmer, one of
Cunningham's novices and a woman who used to equate cooking with
chores like vacuuming.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what kept adults from the kitchen, Cunningham
turned to her experience teaching children to cook. But she found
that adults have something kids don't: fear of failure.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in teaching adults, she reasoned, she would have to
address that fear. So Cunningham looked at her own. She recalled
how aggravated and anxious she was trying to use her new computer,
and realized that the language of hard drives and modems was as
foreign to her as the language of the kitchen was to her students.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham found lots of parallels. Take shopping, for example.
Her novice cooks were as lost in the grocery as she would be in a
computer store. Before they took her class, many only shopped once
or twice a month because the experience was so frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first classes centered on three-hour field trips to
the grocery with lots of discussion about how and what to buy. Once
her students became comfortable selecting ingredients, they
understood that the success of a dish begins with the confidence to
pick the best _ and the correct _ ingredients at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Cunningham set about teaching basic skills. Even that
proved challenging because adults were so concerned with doing
something wrong. Cunningham would show them a simple knife
technique _ like tucking their fingers under when holding food to
cut _ and they would get frustrated by the food's appearance and
how they held the knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fret about doing everything so it looks like Jacques
Pepin,'' she would tell them. ``Just get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Students also had no idea how to determine serving sizes and how
much food to cook. Leftovers were terrifying. Cunningham, who
enjoys the creative use of leftovers, converted them to her way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home cooking is about having to make something out of what you
have...of making yesterday's food taste very good.''
</P>
<P>
   She taught her students some of her favorite tricks. Bake two
chickens instead of one and have the second for another meal later
in the week. Find recipes, like the olive-oil-based green sauce in
today's recipe collection, that can be used on a salad one day,
pasta the next an even a baked potato another.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the matter of recipes themselves. Students froze
in the face of long ingredient lists and techniques that seemed as
convoluted as building a car engine from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   So Cunningham broke things into stages. She believes the best
recipes have only five ingredients _ and two of them are salt and
pepper.

<P>
   ``What people don't realize is that the recipe is just a rough
guide to a certain destination. There are many variations along the
way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those variations depend on a skill she says isn't hard to
develop: critical tasting. She starts with lemonade, teaching
students that adjusting the balance of sweet to sour is critical
tasting at its essence.
</P>
<P>
   She also taught &UR;  &LR; them how to make simple food that would produce
big results. Her baking powder biscuits, one of the first things
her students made in the oven, were just the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they look in the window and see that little blob of dough
become this wonderful golden, puffy biscuit, it boosts their
confidence immediately,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The look in the eyes of a student who is peering at his or her
first batch of biscuits is reward enough for the teacher _ as long
as the student brings the biscuits to table and shares them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tempting when we are old to become a missionary, to
see the world as lacking,'' she says. ``I really don't want to be
guilty of that. I don't want to be preachy. But I wish there were a
national law that made everyone cook steadily for two months. Then,
if they don't like it, they can quit.''

Top 10 Marion-isms &QL; 
 &QL; 
Author and cooking instructor Marion Cunningham uses the following
tips to help new cooks. These ``Marion-isms'' are based on a list
prepared by cooking student Jamie Jobb.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``When cooking, there is one main rule: Taste, taste and &LR; 
 &UR; taste again.'' &LR;  Problems with a recipe often can be remedied while
preparing a dish. It's much harder, if not impossible, to tweak
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The oven is our friend.''  &LR; You don't need to watch over
something if it's in the oven. Use the time to enjoy your dinner
guests.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``With each dish, try to achieve one taste.''  &LR; Too many
ingredients result in a culinary cacophony.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Your hands remember things because they're closer to the &LR; 
 &UR; ingredients.''  &LR; Don't be timid about touching the food you cook.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``There are no substitutes, except when you are forced by &LR; 
 &UR; fate to substitute.''  &LR; If you do substitute, keep track of what
you're changing so you can replicate the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Butter will smooth out sharp tastes and rough edges.'' &LR;  Use
butter as a flavor tool.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``No matter what the recipe, things can change.''  &LR; Slight
differences in ingredients, room temperature, humidity, lunar
gravitational pulls, solar flares or other unknown conditions can
affect how a dish turns out. So always taste as you go and make
note of any changes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Salt and sugar are instruments of flavor.''  &LR; They can help
marry ingredients in a recipe. They're usually best used when the
dish is cooking, not after.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Home food is not restaurant food.''  &LR; You don't have sous
chefs and busboys in your kitchen, so keep it simple.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Your attitude comes through the food.''  &LR; If cooking a
particular dish is true drudgery, don't do it. Cook what you like
to cook.

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: This is the first installment of Marion 
 Cunningham's new column, ``Learning to Cook.'' Intended for 
 beginners, it's part of the 77-year-old writer's campaign to 
 revive the fading art of home cooking. Please look for the 
 column regularly in the San Francisco Chronicle food package on 
 the New York Times News Service wire. Today's column includes a 
 polenta recipe and accompanying tip bar.  
   
   
 LEARNING TO COOK: Keep It Simple to Taste Success  
   
   
 By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When I first started to teach adults who knew
absolutely nothing about cooking, I used some of the same methods I
had for teaching children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I placed a dozen children's cookbooks on a table and asked the
children as they arrived to choose the book they thought would help
them the most. I did the same thing with the adults. The results
were the same with both age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups chose straightforward books _ ones that didn't have
cartoons or treat the subject lightly, or that were packed with
sidebars and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The students preferred a simple presentation, without too much
to read on each page. They also liked recipes with just a few
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But one difference between the children and adult novices was
that the children learned quickly and happily because they didn't
consider the consequences _ they had no fear of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, on the other hand, were terrified of failure and
possible embarrassment. If only we could learn all we needed to
know by the time we were 12 years old, how easy things would be.
</P>
<P>
   It helped the adult beginners to have some small successes
early. Many recipes that could be baked in the oven _ baking powder
biscuits, baked polenta, roast chicken with vegetables _ gave the
students confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning the class, I asked the adults to read the three
recipes I intended to teach _ usually a simple menu _ and to point
out which instructions they found puzzling. Most were baffled by
basic directions, the kind of instructions that even most beginner
cookbooks assume readers can do.
</P>
<P>
   Adults also feel as uneasy shopping for groceries as they do
cooking, which is easy to understand with the vast numbers of
products in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The rice section, for instance, contains short grain, long
grain, brown rice, wild rice, boxes of partially cooked rice and
converted rice _ totally baffling to a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Working with novices, I also discovered how important
descriptive words are _ as they are in learning any new craft _ and
how confusing it can be if you take them too literally.
</P>
<P>
   When we were exploring the produce section of the supermarket,
for example, I asked the students if anyone had bought and used
green onions and scallions. One student replied that she had _ but
she had cut the white part off and discarded it because onions are
called ``green'' onions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us are lonely and live with today's mantra, ``I'm so
busy and have no time.'' Buying take-out food, then eating it
quickly and alone, often in front of a TV or computer screen, only
contributes to the feeling of isolation. But cooking at home is a
wonderful antidote. Your world narrows into a personal space where
you can share food and yourself with others.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with friends and family around a table, sharing a meal
that you've prepared with care, remains the most benevolent of
human rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recipe for polenta with vegetables is one of those
dishes that is straightforward to prepare to serve to others.
Accompanied by a simple green salad, it makes an excellent
vegetarian entree. Or, you can use it as a side dish to go with
chicken, beef or pork.
</P>
<P>
   A good thing about this dish is that you can put it in the oven
and forget about it for a half hour or so while you prepare the
salad or set the table. Just check it at the end of 30 minutes, as
indicated in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the recipe, I've also included some instructions for
basic kitchen skills _ this time, the easiest way to chop a tomato,
bell pepper and onion. These methods are good ones to learn. No
matter the recipe, they're the best way to accomplish a common
cooking task.

 &LR; Marion Cunningham, Bay Area cooking teacher, is the author of &LR; 
 &LR; ``Learning to Cook'' (to be published in May), ``Cooking With &LR; 
 &LR; Children,'' ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' and ``The Breakfast &LR; 
 &LR; Book,'' among others. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE BASICS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; How to Chop a Tomato &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Use a sharp, smooth-edged knife or a good serrated-edge knife.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut off the stem top and discard.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut the tomato on a chopping board into about 6 slices
crosswise.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stack the slices into two or three piles.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cut the tomato slices into bite-size pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to Prepare Bell Pepper &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Slice off the stem top and the root bottom.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut the pepper in half lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   3. Open each side up. Remove the seeds and veins with a paring
knife and discard.
</P>
<P>
   To slice: Stack the halves and cut the pepper into strips 1/4
inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   To chop: Line up the strips side by side; then, holding them in
a bunch, chop crosswise into little pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to Peel, Slice and Chop an Onion &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To peel: Using a paring knife, slice off the fuzzy brownish root
end and the stem top of the onion and discard. Peel off the papery
brownish-yellow outer skin of the onion with your fingers or a
paring knife and discard.
</P>
<P>
   To slice: Cut the onion in half from stem top to root end. Put
the onion halves cut side down on a cutting board. Cut slices
crosswise from each half. Cut slices about 1/8 inch thick. As you
slice, curl under the ends of the fingers of your hand holding the
onion, so you don't cut yourself. Move your hand back a little
after each slice.
</P>
<P>
   To chop: Slice the onion in half from the stem top through the
root end. Place each half flat side down on a cutting board.
Holding a half firmly with one hand, make about seven vertical
slices from the stem end to the root end, but don't slice
completely through the root end (this will make it easier to
slice.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, slice crosswise, letting the little pieces fall. Repeat
with the second half of the onion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; POLENTA BAKED WITH VEGETABLES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Polenta is the Italian version of our cornmeal mush. It has
become very popular here recently, perhaps because the Italians
have shown us different ways to liven it up with other ingredients.
Polenta baked with vegetables is a very satisfying dish, and all it
takes is stirring cornmeal, salt, olive oil and water together in
the baking dish, adding a few vegetables, and then, after about an
hour of baking, sitting down to supper.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 large red tomato
</P>
<P>
   1 green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh spinach, or 1/2 box frozen chopped spinach
(thawed)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cup polenta (use either a yellow cornmeal or an Italian brand
of polenta _ not instant)
</P>
<P>
   31/4 cups lukewarm water
</P>
<P>
   11/4 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To prepare the vegetables: &LR;  Cut the stem off the tomato and
chop the tomato into bite-size pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the stem off the bell pepper and cut the pepper in half
lengthwise (store one half for future use). Remove the veins and
seeds and chop the pepper.
</P>
<P>
   If using fresh spinach, remove any large, tough stems and wash
the leaves. Take about half of the spinach, pile it on a cutting
board and, using a large knife, chop into pieces the size of large
postage stamps. Press the leaves firmly into a measuring cup and
measure out 11/2 cups of chopped spinach. Wrap and store any extra
spinach for future use.
</P>
<P>
   If using frozen spinach, be sure it is defrosted, and squeeze
out any excess water with your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the onion and cut it in half lengthwise from the stem down.
Store one half for another use. Chop the remaining half of the
onion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing the polenta: &LR;  Put the polenta, water, salt and olive oil
into an 8-inch square baking dish and stir with a fork until
blended. There's no need to grease the pan. Add the tomato, pepper,
spinach and onion to the polenta and stir to distribute the
vegetables evenly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Baking the polenta: &LR;  Put the baking pan on the center rack of
the oven and bake for 30 minutes, then check to see if the liquid
is boiling around the edges of the baking pan. If so, leave the
temperature as is. If not, turn the oven up to 400. Bake for
another 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed _
that's your signal that the polenta is done.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pan from the oven and put it on a heat-proof counter.
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese evenly over the top and let sit for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the polenta into squares, then lift portions from the pan
with a spatula. Serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 as a main course, or 6 as a side dish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leftover polenta:  &LR; If you have any leftover polenta, you can
enjoy it by frying squares of it in olive oil until they are golden
on each side. Serve for supper, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
In fact, you'll find it so delicious, you might want to bake an
extra dish of polenta so you can enjoy it again this way.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Got a Minute? Make a Steak  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  After more than 50 years in the same location on
Broadway, Alfred's moved to a new Financial District location that
once housed the equally famous Blue Fox.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it got a new upscale decor _ deep-red accents and crystal
chandeliers _ the food has remained pretty much the same. It still
serves one of the best steaks in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred's uses a mesquite grill for its signature cuts, but one
of my favorite dishes is the minute steak, which is quickly
pan-grilled. It can be done in only a few minutes on a home stove
by pounding the tenderloin to about a 3/8-inch thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the name implies how quickly this cooks _ one minute
_ but for the home cook it probably will take twice that long,
about a minute on each side. So let's call it the two-minute steak.
Doesn't quite have the same cachet, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is one of those last-minute dishes that can be
prepared in a flash. You can marinate the steak in the olive oil,
salt and pepper while you change clothes or open a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The most time-consuming chore is heating up the cast-iron grill
pan, which will take a good 10 minutes to get as hot as possible.
</P>
<P>
   After a minute on each side, the steak comes out with perfect
crusty grill marks outside and a succulent pink interior. Believe
me, filet mignon never tasted so good.
</P>
<P>
   It's so effortless that it's perfect for a special dinner for
two. Just add some roasted potatoes and a steamed vegetable, and
you can clink your wine glasses over one of the best meals around.

</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, finely minced

   Combine the olive oil, garlic and pepper in a shallow container
large enough to hold the meat in a single layer. Place the meat in
the container and turn to coat with the marinade. Let marinate

<P>
   Heat a cast-iron grill pan over high heat until very hot. This
will take about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the meat in the hot grill pan; generously salt the top.
Grill for 45 seconds to 1 minute, turn and season with salt. Grill
for 1 minute longer. The meat will still be bright pink in the

   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pound the filets to about 5/8-inch thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the olive oil, garlic and pepper in a shallow container
large enough to hold the meat in a single layer. Place the meat in
the container and turn to coat with the marinade. Let marinate
until ready to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a cast-iron grill pan over high heat until very hot. This
will take about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the meat in the hot grill pan; generously salt the top.
Grill for 45 seconds to 1 minute, turn and season with salt. Grill
for 1 minute longer. The meat will still be bright pink in the
center.
</P>
<P>
   If grilling one filet at a time, place the finished steak in a
warm oven while cooking the second.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2.

EXTRA-BITTER CHOCOLATE  
 TO SAVE THE PARSLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How is extra-bittersweet chocolate different from regular
bittersweet, and where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Chocolate sweetness is determined by the ratio of cacao
solids to sugar. Unsweetened baking chocolate is 100 percent cacao
solids, with no sugar. Bittersweet and semisweet chocolate are 35
percent to 60 percent cacao solids, 65 percent to 40 percent sugar
(although some chocolates also contain an emulsifier, at less than
1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Extra-bittersweet chocolate (also called extra-bitter) usually
has 67 percebt to 70 percent cacao, and the rest sugar. Pastry
chefs prefer it for its fuller, more intense flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Most specialty stores and many large supermarkets sell Valrhona,
Lindt and Scharffen Berger brands. The Sweet Life, 63 Hester
Street, (212) 598-0092, fills mail orders; 3.5-ounce bars of
Valrhona and Lindt are $2.99 each, and Scharffen Berger is $9 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whenever I buy celery, parsley or scallions for a recipe, I
wind up throwing most of them out. Can I freeze them, or store them
better?
</P>
<P>
   A. Forget freezing _ it makes these vegetables flabby and
flavorless. Scallions and parsley keep well when immersed, root or
stem end down, in a glass of water in the refrigerator. Or they can
be wrapped in a damp paper or dish towel, put in a plastic bag and
stored in the vegetable crisper. They should last about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Celery also benefits from a damp-towel wrap and a home in the
vegetable drawer, but you can just store it in the plastic bag it's
sold in, or in your own plastic bag. Either way, the vegetable
crisper will help it keep its snap for up to two weeks. Even if the
outer stalks are slightly brown and withered, the inner ones may be
fine.

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with 
 enough leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes 
 plus suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow, plus 
 suggestions in optional trim.  
   
   
 THE WEEKEND COOK: Bulgur Stands In for Pasta, Rice, Potatoes  
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As grains go, bulgur wheat is among the easiest to
prepare: Soak it in liquid, and soon the grains swell to a
chewiness that makes a pleasant base for numerous dishes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with this kind of ease, you can save even more time during
the week by preparing bulgur on the weekend and refrigerating it
for later. Bulgur's resilient texture and nutty flavor keep up to
five days.
</P>
<P>
   Most people associate bulgur with grain salads like tabbouleh.
But it's good, too, in a salad of finely chopped grilled
vegetables, nuggets of cheese and a pungent vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   We make the most of bulgur, however, when we also consider it
for hot dishes instead of rice, potatoes or pasta. Even when bulgur
is cooked after soaking, it retains texture.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying recipes and ideas explore bulgur's hot
possibilities. The Asian-flavored weekend casserole is testimony to
bulgur's versatility with seasonings. The recipe pairing bulgur
with vermicelli and sausage may sound odd, but it is in the same
grain-cum-pasta vein as Rice-a-Roni and the Jewish dish known as
kasha varnishkas. The fresh and very springlike entree soup is
ridiculously easy and shows bulgur as a good alternative to soup
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   When you want a nutritious grain with good texture, versatility,
ease of preparation and convenience, think bulgur. And think about
heating it up.
</P>

 &UR; MASTER RECIPE: BASIC BULGUR WHEAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   7 cups water
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   4 cups bulgur wheat
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the water and salt in a medium-size saucepan over high
heat; bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Place the bulgur wheat in a large bowl and pour the boiling
water over it; stir briefly. Let stand, stirring occasionally,
until the bulgur is chewy and almost all the water has been
absorbed, about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the bulgur in a colander for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve 4 cups bulgur for the Weekend Recipe. Cool, cover and
refrigerate the remaining bulgur for use throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 12 cups.

 &UR; WEEKEND RECIPE: ASIAN-FLAVORED HALIBUT-BULGUR CASSEROLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   21/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps cut into 3/8-inch
thick slices
</P>
<P>
   10 large garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   4 cups prepared bulgur (from Master Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 halibut fillets (about 21/2 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces baby spinach leaves, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 11/2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan. Add the
mushrooms and saute over medium-high heat, stirring frequently,
until they are glossy and start to brown, about 3 minutes. Add 8
cloves' worth of the minced garlic and all of the grated ginger.
Saute, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute. Add the water and
boil until the liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the
sherry, vinegar and soy sauce; boil for 1 minute. Add the bulgur
and toss until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   Spread half of the bulgur in a casserole large enough to hold
the fish snugly. Lightly season the fish with salt and pepper.
Place the fillets over the bulgur. Spread the remaining bulgur over
the fillets. Cover tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 16 to 20 minutes, or until the fillets are done.
</P>
<P>
   While the fish bakes, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a
large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining garlic and
saute, stirring frequently, until barely golden, about 3 minutes.
Add the spinach and toss until it is wilted, about 1 minute. Season
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the fish to dinner plates. Spoon some of the bulgur
around each fillet and more on top. Top each fillet with a mound
spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &UR; WEEKNIGHT RECIPE: BULGUR &AMP; VERMICELLI WITH SAUSAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Boiling the sausage helps rid it of excess fat.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound reduced-fat hot Italian sausage links
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil &QL; 
2 large onions, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound medium-small button mushrooms, quartered
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup white wine or chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces vermicelli or capellini, broken into 2-inch lengths,
boiled until al dente, drained
</P>
<P>
   5 cups prepared bulgur (from Master Recipe), at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Prick the sausages with the tip of a sharp knife. Place them in
a large, heavy saucepan with water to just cover. Bring to a boil
over high heat. Boil for 5 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Return the sausages to the saucepan and saute, turning once,
until both sides are golden, about 3 minutes total. Often this is
possible without extra oil. If the bottom of the pan starts to
burn, add a little oil.
</P>
<P>
   When the sausages are browned, remove them from the pan and cut
into medium dice; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the oil to the pan and place over high heat. When the oil
ripples, add the onions and mushrooms and saute, stirring
frequently, until the mushrooms are browned, about 5 minutes.
Deglaze with the wine or broth, scraping up the browned bits on the
bottom of the pan. Stir in the parsley and oregano.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cooked vermicelli, stirring to separate the strands. Add
the sausage and bulgur, tossing thoroughly until the mixture is
hot.

 &UR; More Ideas for Leftovers &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
With a pot of prepared bulgur in the fridge, the following ideas
are possibilities for mid-week meals:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Poultry Dressing. &LR;  Saute a generous amount of garlic and onions
in olive oil. Add raisins, prepared bulgur, chopped fresh mint and
lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Use as a
dressing for chicken or pop it into a casserole, cover and
microwave until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bulgur Primavera. &LR;  Substituting bulgur for pasta in this dish,
aim for double the amount of bulgur to vegetables. Saute finely
diced onions until golden. Add julienned carrots and red peppers,
and asparagus and scallions that have been finely sliced on the
diagonal; saute for 20 seconds. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth, a
handful of frozen defrosted peas and chopped fresh dill and mint;
simmer for 30 seconds. Add prepared bulgur; toss until it is heated
through. Add toasted pine nuts; toss thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bulgur-Lentil Salad. &LR;  Aim for triple the amount of bulgur to
lentils. Marinate halved cherry tomatoes, diced radishes, diced
cucumbers and diced scallions for 15 minutes in a pungent
vinaigrette that is well seasoned with salt and pepper. Toss the
mixture with cooked lentils and prepared bulgur. Mound the mixture
on a platter. Toss diced avocado, crumbled feta cheese and coarsely
chopped cilantro in a little more vinaigrette. Spoon over the
bulgur salad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bulgur Grape Leaves. &LR;  Aim for triple the amount of bulgur to
lamb. Saute minced garlic until it begins to change color. Add
finely ground lamb and saute, stirring constantly to break up the
meat into tiny pieces, until the lamb is no longer pink. Add
prepared bulgur, chopped dill, salt, pepper, cumin and lemon juice.
Use as a filling for grape leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bulgur-Berry Breakfast. &LR;  Hull and slice strawberries, combine
them with blueberries and raspberries and toss with a little sugar.
Set aside for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon over a bowl of prepared bulgur. Sprinkle with a little
sugar, if desired. Pour cream, half-and-half or milk of choice over
all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike putting asparagus on the menu in August or December, a
vice some chefs can't seem to shake, real spring vegetables can be
served for a limited season. Some, like ramps and fresh morels and
fiddlehead ferns, are pleasures as fleeting as daffodils in the
park, and New York chefs are making the most of them by assembling
what amounts to bouquets in a soup plate.
</P>
<P>
   Spring vegetable ragouts are the dish of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Michael Jordan's: The Steak House, a bastion of beef,
customers are ordering David Walzog's warm ragout of spring
vegetables in a celery cream sauce. Not instead of the steak, but
before it.
</P>
<P>
   Dishes like this are replacing winter's sturdy roasted roots.
The key ingredients, sweet young things like spring garlic and baby
onions, are in the market only a month or two. Asparagus, baby
carrots, fava beans and garden peas sustain a longer stretch, but
they, too, seem most suited to this season.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers say demand for these symbols of spring is up 20 to 25
percent over last year among chefs, who get a jump on home cooks
and receive early shipments. But produce markets are now starting
to carry items like fresh morels, although at inflated
first-of-the-season prices, and tender, mild spring garlic, which
has not be dried. And the more assertive wild leeks called ramps
are already turning up in the Greenmarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The fricassee at Payard Patisserie and Bistro, which combines
ramps, morels and spring garlic, is no great challenge for the home
cook, nor is Bill Telepan's delicate ragout at Judson Grill. The
ragout at the new Maison restaurant is a simple combination of
ramps, white asparagus and peas, but at Jo Jo, 27 vegetables are
cooked separately before coming together on the plate. Cena's
ragout of spring vegetables is in a sauce of Vidalia onions, those
erstwhile spring treats, while Veritas tops off a spring vegetable
fricassee with a splash of truffle oil.
</P>
<P>
   For the dinner he is preparing next week at the James Beard
Foundation, Georges Perrier of Le Bec Fin in Philadelphia will
combine morels and asparagus in a sauce enriched with cream.
</P>
<P>
   Put all those ingredients in the hands of a chef and one thing
is certain: out comes the butter. As virtuous as a spring vegetable
ragout may sound, especially with bathing suit season looming, its
flavor invariably depends on a gloss of sweet fresh butter.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Gras' lightly sauteed early vegetables with watercress
at Peacock Alley is the exception; it's finished only with olive
oil. Obviously, without the fat you might as well serve crudites.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as butter or olive oil is the cooking. Every
one of these vegetables needs a different amount of time over heat.
Cooking them to their own specifications may seem like one step too
many, after rinsing, peeling, trimming and shelling, but for one
short season, the result is worth the effort.
</P>

ramps and a tablespoon of water, cover and cook 4 minutes longer,
until tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add morels and their liquid to spring garlic and ramps,
increase heat to medium-high, saute briefly and add another
tablespoon of butter. Check seasonings, add parsley and serve.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: From Speakeasy to Bar to Restaurant  
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _  It grew from a speakeasy, it reportedly
housed the first off-track betting machine in California, but in
its respectable old age, Fabbro's now prides itself on being one of
the area's oldest restaurants.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fabbro's Restaurant and Bar has been a family business since
1933, when Redwood City was a small rural port that served a
growing logging business in the nearby hills.
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, George and Mary Fabbro, immigrants from the
Friuli region in northern Italy, had shuttered a speakeasy that
they had operated from their home. In 1933, they opened a bar in a
building George had purchased farther south on El Camino Real. They
ran the bar with George's brothers and lived in a flat upstairs.
Eventually, the bar grew into a restaurant and bar, which is still
located in the building George bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather liked to drink, party, gamble, go to the track
_ he was a real carouser,'' Michael Fabbro says fondly. He's the
third generation to run the business.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fabbros, George's penchant for gambling led to
his setting up the first off-track betting machine in the state.
George installed a bookie in his living room upstairs so his
customers could walk up from the bar and place bets. When the
authorities objected to the bookie in the living room, George built
a shed out back, where he relocated the bookie and installed the
machine. Today, the shed _ painted the same rust red as the
160-seat restaurant that sits right on the curb _ is used for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Indirectly, Mary inspired the restaurant. ``She'd make a few
dishes for lunch for the customers _ pasta, roasted meat _ peasant
food,'' Michael says. Cold marinated cracked crab, a Fabbro
signature dish, was also Mary's dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was put on the tables for free for the drinking customers.
My father still makes it as a special a few times a month when
crab's in season. He gets a kick out of doing it,'' Michael says.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Michael's father, Frank (who still tends bar
at lunch), and uncle, Tarsizio ``Jim,'' took over from their father
and within a few years added dinner service.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dishes popular then were abalone steak (a mere
$3.50) and ground sirloin steak ($3). Abalone is no longer on the
menu; ground sirloin is.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the choices include some of the restaurant's
long-standing dishes, like pan-grilled English sole and calamari
steak and newer inspirations _ spinach salad with fruit, bacon and
goat cheese; Sonoma chicken breast with roasted red peppers and
sun-dried- cherry demi-glace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the menu more current, getting away a little from
the '70s Italian food,'' Michael says. The menu ideas come mostly
from Daryl Dillahunty, chef de cuisine, with input from Julia,
Michael's wife, who also helps manage the restaurant. The kitchen
executes the menu under head chef Scott Manit.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbro's interior has also changed with the times. In its bar
days, the floor and tables were bare, the place very simple. In the
'70s, Michael recalls, there was a ``loungy, cocktail feeling''
with red-flocked wallpaper and boarded up windows ``to make the
place as dark as possible,'' he says, laughing. ``There was lots of
cigarette smoke.'' By the '80s, the red flocking was gone and the
clubby look _ dark wood, white tablecloths _ was in.
</P>
<P>
   Michael remodeled last summer when he took the reins from his
father, knocking out partitions and reexposing the windows to
create a more spacious, light-filled look. The walls are now a
pretty yellow, and decor is simple, comfortable and attractive _
white tablecloths, neatly framed posters and photographs of Italy
shot by Michael and his sister Barbara Fabbro.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the building holds out, we'll be here,'' he says,
laughing. ``I like the building and the history that is here. And
the comfortable neighborhood bistro feel.''

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Ginger Beer With `Bite' Sparkles for Judges  
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Finally, finally, finally, the weather is warming
and we can turn our attention to cool, refreshing drinks. One
that's gaining store shelf space is ginger beer, the
stronger-flavored artisan cousin of ginger ale.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted eight ginger beers and found one that stood
far above the others. Panelists were divided on almost every other
ginger beer sampled. Interestingly, the company that took first
place also makes the concoctions that came in second and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reed's Extra Ginger Brew &LR;  (four 12-ounce bottles, $3.99 at
Whole Foods) was the panel's overwhelming favorite. Most of the
panelists liked the ginger bite, but one picked up bitter
overtones, and another thought it was a tad too sweet. Three would
buy it; two might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Reed's Premium Ginger Brew &LR;  (four 12-ounce
bottles, $3.99 at Whole Foods). One panelist thought it had a
``nice restorative quality,'' but others wanted more ginger flavor.
Two detected caramel notes, which they found unpleasant and
slightly medicinal. Two would buy it, one might buy it, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Natural Brew Outrageous Ginger Ale  &LR; (four 12-ounce bottles,
$3.49 at Whole Foods) scored just two points lower than Reed's
Premium. Two panelists disliked the cloudy appearance, and one
panelist described the flavor as soapy and unpleasant. But another
panelist liked the balance of ginger to sweetness. One would buy
it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped dramatically after third place, but the best of
the rest was  &UR; Reed's Original Ginger Brew &LR;  (four 12-ounce bottles,
$3.99 at Whole Foods). Three panelists thought it tasted like it
was made from dried ginger instead of fresh (it  &LR; is  &LR; made from
fresh ginger) and described the flavor as artificial. None would
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Stewart's Original Ginger Beer &LR;  (four
12-ounce bottles for $2.99 at Draeger's). Three panelists thought
it had an overbearing spiciness, but one liked the ginger bite. Two
panelists also liked the cola-like color. One would buy it; four
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Three ginger beers scored too low to rate: Sioux City, Cock 'n
Bull and Journey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San
Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park, Calif.; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind.

 CHRON   COOKS' BOOKS: Visions of Martha's Parties Will Dance in Your 
 Head  
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When I picked up home-and-hearth maven Martha
Stewart's new cookbook, ``Martha Stewart's Hors D'Oeuvres
Handbook,'' I visualized finding crocheted-chive napoleons and
monkey-picked jasmine rice balls filled with homemade truffled goat
cheese served on platters carved by the host from coconuts and
slabs of ice.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stewart is known for making complicated home and kitchen
projects, including cocktail parties, look so easy that even the
busiest people should be able to accomplish them on a lazy
afternoon. As we watch her television show or read her magazine, we
forget this is her livelihood, much the way we forget movie stars
are paid to spend the time and money to look that good. Normal
people with jobs and children and lives can't compete.
</P>
<P>
   The book ingeniously tempts from the get-go with more than 200
color photographs right in the front of the book instead of in the
middle or spread throughout. By the time you've leafed through
them, you'll have visions of cocktail parties dancing in your head.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the book is worthwhile for the photographs alone.
Photographer Dana Gallagher mixes shots of the food with some demo
shots, like how to make pommes annette and nori stacks with smoked
salmon. Readers will get ideas not only on food but also on
presentations, like using a hollowed-out bread loaf as a server for
tea sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the crux of this book: It needs to be approached
with realist's eyes. As with all things by Martha, it's great for
ideas, but you don't need to follow them to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I am not going to whittle fresh sugar cane into
skewers for tropical chicken. I won't feel guilty if I don't boil
the water for ice cubes for 10 minutes before freezing it so it
will be clear. And the idea of using chives to tie a plantain chip/
jerk chicken bundle is my idea of a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, crispy asparagus straws _ thick asparagus
spears wrapped in prosciutto and phyllo dough _ are at the top of
my list for my next get-together, as is the roasted red pepper and
eggplant dip (yes, Martha has included such mundane party food as
dips).
</P>
<P>
   Her methodology is sound most of the time. She gives tricks of
the trade, like slicing a whole loaf of bread horizontally into
long strips, topping them, then cutting them into diamonds or
squares for perfectly shaped canapes.
</P>
<P>
   She lists helpful notes and techniques _ how to use dried
mushrooms, how to work with phyllo dough _ on the same page as the
first recipe in which they're used. And many of her recipes tell
readers how far in advance the dish can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most useful part of the book is in the back, where
she describes planning a party. She covers the usual stuff, like
how much to make for how many people, but she also gives tips on
balancing not just flavors and textures but workload _ mixing
labor-intensive appetizers with simpler recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Stewart's Hors D'Oeuvres Handbook'' isn't for people
who stress out over cooking and entertaining; it will only add to
the pre-party jitters. But for those who know a bit about cooking
and can comfortably skip making pain de mie from scratch without
guilt, the book will let readers tap into Martha's brilliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy _ Bologna is a city that lives on its stomach.
True, it has Italy's leading university. It fields a pretty good
soccer team, too. But Bologna's real study and its true sport is
food.
</P>
<P>
   Its markets are unrivaled in Europe. The legendary Tamburini
food shop is paradise on earth. And then there are the Simili
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in a courtyard off the Via San Felice, Margherita and
Valeria Simili do what they have been doing all their lives _ they
cook and bake. As girls, helping out in the family bakery, they
made bread, pasta and cakes for their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they cooked for their families. And for the last 13
years, they have run a little cooking school, founded with the help
of Marcella Hazan, one of their biggest fans, that is one of the
city's most valuable hidden assets.
</P>
<P>
   Around 3 p.m. on the Via San Felice, five days a week, you can
see pedestrians turning off the street and into the courtyard at
No. 116. At the far end of the courtyard, at Staircase G, they
enter what looks like an apartment but turns out to be a large
kitchen, where the sisters, already revved up for a full
afternoon's workout, take coats, collect the one-day tuition fee of
120,000 lire (about $65), offer coffee and aprons, and manage to
generate an atmosphere of cheerful bustle, although nothing in
particular is actually happening.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the lesson is an unusual one: la cucina rapida, or quick
and easy cooking. Yesterday, it was pasta. Tomorrow, it will be
bread, and the day after that, desserts. Most of it comes straight
from the heart of Emilia-Romagna, a rich gastronomic region where
the tomato is a tourist and fish is foreign, but butter, milk,
cheese and pasta achieve dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   Parmigiano Reggiano, prosciutto, mortadella, culatello, golden
tortellini filled with meat, cheese and vegetables _ the region's
roster of culinary all-stars goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   For students, the Simili school is a chance to experience
Italian home cooking at the highest level, passed along by two
women _ 63-year-old twins _ who make no special claims for what
they do. ``We like very simple cooking, and although we do have a
food processor, we almost always work only by hand,'' Margherita
Simili said. ``You feel more joyful that way, and you understand
better what you are making.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the lesson, she steps to the head of a long
work table and commands attention with a crisp ``Bimbi!''
(``Kids''), one of three salutations she will use to restore order
over the next four hours. Again and again, the student body _ a
dozen Italian women and a lone American man _ will snap to
attention at the sound of ``Bimbi,'' ``Bambini'' (``Kiddies'') and
``Ragazzi'' (``Guys''), the signals that important instructions are
about to follow. (Classes are in Italian, but both sisters speak
English and, with well-timed interruptions, translate the
goings-on.)
</P>
<P>
   The menu looks ambitious. It begins with prosciutto slices that
are spread with a paste of mustard, Parmigiano Reggiano and,
unbelievably, Philadelphia cream cheese, and then wrapped around
pear slices. It concludes, eight dishes later, with a whisky-soaked
cake made with chocolate, peaches, crushed amaretti and a rich
local ricotta that is half sheeps' milk, half cows' milk.
Motivation runs high, since the day's work will later be consumed
as dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Margherita operates at a high energy level, racing from table to
stove, yanking volunteers from the group, chaffing them good
naturedly when they fumble or hesitate, and fielding questions
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Valeria, who does the food shopping, stays on the sidelines,
putting supplies on the table, whisking away used plates and, at
selected moments that are milked to the utmost for dramatic impact,
stepping up to the head of the table to taste her sister's work and
correct it with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The salt routine goes over big with the group. Margherita stands
aside, a stirring spoon held aloft, as her sister slowly tastes,
eyes turned toward the ceiling. A hush falls over the group. Long
seconds pass. Valeria suddenly reaches for the salt pile and tosses
several pinches in the bowl with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Valeria lets her sister do most of the talking. She knows that a
silently administered dash of salt makes for better theater. It
also sets up her coup de grace, the moment when she tastes, starts
to reach for the salt _ and then declares the mushroom stuffing to
be perfect as is.
</P>
<P>
   In mock indignation, she turns to the class and says, ``I don't
always add salt, you know _ only when it's needed, and in this
case, the Parmesan gives us all the salt we need.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes, through the unexpectedly delicious polline di
fagioli (cold bean balls with a garlic and parsley sauce), a
sneakily clever baked pasta dish devised to keep the top of the
stove clear, veal balls in port sauce, a pea and cheese mold, beef
and vegetable brochettes, and baked stuffed mushroom caps.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon turns into evening, a table is set, the day's
work is set out on a communal table, the sisters open a lightly
fizzy bottle of white wine from the hills around Bologna and,
without further ado, a dozen Italians get ready to do what they do
best: eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Similis were born in Bologna, perhaps 500 feet from their
kitchen, which is not far from their present apartment. Their
father, Armando, owned one of the city's most celebrated bakeries,
the Panificio Simili Armando, right on the Via San Felice, at No.
67.

   At the age of 12, his daughters began working behind the
counter. When the orders piled up, they would go to the back of the
bakery and help make tortellini, tortelli and other pastas, as well
as the distinctive Bolognese bread, with its shiny, smooth crust
and soft, snow-white interior.

 &QL; 
(THE FOLLOWING RECIPES ARE GOOD FOR NOVICE COOKS. THEY FEATURE FEW
INGREDIENTS AND A HIGH PROBABILITY FOR SUCCESS.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LEEK AND POTATO SOUP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 leeks
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter (when serving the soup, put a slice of
butter in each serving)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the leeks: &LR;  Cut the tops off the leeks where the
color begins to turn from very light green to darker green. Cut off
the root ends and discard, along with the tops. Cut the leeks in
half lengthwise. Leeks often have dirt lodged between the layers of
the stalks. Separate the layers with your fingers and rinse under
cold running water to remove all dirt. Put the leeks on the cutting
board and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the potatoes:  &LR; Peel and rinse the potatoes under
cold tap water. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise. Place the
halves cut sides down on a cutting board and slice crosswise into
1/4-inch-thick pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the 4 tablespoons butter in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch
oven over medium heat, stirring regularly. Tilt the pot from side
to side so the butter covers the bottom. Add the leeks and potatoes
and use a large spoon to distribute the vegetables over the bottom
of the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the
leeks begin to brown, turn down the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add the broth and stir to mix leeks, potatoes and broth. Bring
to a boil, then lower the heat so the soup is simmering. Taste for
salt and add a little if the soup tastes flat. Cover the pot and
let the soup simmer for 35 minutes. When the potatoes are soft, the
soup is done.
</P>
<P>
   You can mash the vegetables if you want the soup coarse, or put
the soup through a blender or food processor if you want it
completely smooth. Some people like it simply left in chunks. Put a
pat of butter in each bowl and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6 (yields about 3 quarts).

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GREEN HERB SAUCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This sauce is good on baked potatoes, hearty fish like salmon,
scrambled eggs, added to a bowl of beans or broth and, of course,
on salads. To give the sauce a peppy edge, add 2 tablespoons capers
and omit the lemon. This variation is very good on steak or beef
roast.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons, grate the zest (the outer yellow skin) from both, then
squeeze the lemons, reserving the juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the garlic, lemon zest and lemon juice in a bowl. Stir
in the chopped cilantro, basil and parsley, then add the olive oil.
Stir until well blended. Add the salt and pepper; stir to blend,
then taste it. Add more salt, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 1 cup.

 &UR; ORANGE SOUR-CREAM CAKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This cake really doesn't need a frosting. Powdered sugar
sprinkled over the top of the cake will do nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter, let come to room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, remove from refrigerator and let come
to room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons orange extract
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grated orange zest (the outer orange-colored skin)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees at least 15 minutes before you
plan to bake the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the inside (bottom and sides) of a baking pan with the 1
tablespoon butter. The pan may be an 81/2x41/2x3-inch loaf pan or
an 8-inch round, 2-inch-deep cake pan. Sprinkle the 2 tablespoons
flour into the pan, then tilt pan, tapping bottom and sides with
your hand to distribute the flour as evenly as possible. Turn the
pan upside down over the wastebasket and tap the bottom to dislodge
any excess flour.
</P>
<P>
   Put the 1/2 cup butter and the sugar into a large mixing bowl.
Using a large spoon or an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar
until thoroughly blended and smooth. Add the eggs and beat until
completely blended with the butter-sugar mixture. Add the orange
extract and orange zest, and beat and blend into the batter.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the 1 cup flour, the baking powder, baking soda and
salt in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add half of the flour mixture to the batter and beat well. Then
add half of the sour cream and beat until the batter is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining flour mixture to the batter, beating until
blended. Then add the remaining sour cream, beating until it is
blended into the batter.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the batter in the pan; smooth the top with a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   If using a loaf pan, bake for about 40 to 50 minutes, checking
after 35 minutes for doneness. If using a round cake pan, bake for
20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Test for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of
the cake; if it comes out clean with no sticky batter clinging to
it, the cake is done.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pan from the oven, place on a heat-resistant surface
and let cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the inside rim of
the pan and invert the pan over a plate or a sheet of wax paper.
Give the pan a little shake if the cake does not come out
immediately. Let cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

 &UR; NOVICES NO MORE &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Who:  &LR; Jamie Jobb, 53, Walnut Creek
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why He Learned to Cook: &LR;  ``I wanted to get really orderly in
the kitchen and eat better. A lot of stuff you get in restaurants
you can do a good version yourself. But I wanted to learn how to do
that in a practical way ... and I wanted to become a better cook
out of the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Hurdle: &LR;  ``Fear of flour. I still don't have a lot of
confidence about baking, but I'm getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Recent Success: &LR;  Perfecting a blood-orange vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Mistake:  &LR; ``I did the standard thing, like putting salt
instead of sugar in a baked thing. I had to throw that out. But I
tend to not remember those things.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advice for Novices:  &LR; Don't be afraid to ask people who cook a
lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quote:  &LR; ``Cooking is an essential part of life. If you give it
up to Safeway or some deli, you're losing something.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Who:  &LR; Julie Scharmer, 47, Pleasanton
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why She Learned to Cook:  &LR; ``I was tired of hearing my husband
joke that his dinner bell was the smoke detector ... and I wanted
to be able to go at Christmastime to somebody's house and take
something they wanted to eat. It was just embarrassing to have
whatever I brought just sit there untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Hurdle: &LR;  ``The phone is a big problem. I get
distracted, and the food burns.'' She also had overcome a tendency
to throw in extra ingredients that detracted from the dish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Recent Successes:  &LR; Roasting a chicken, baking cornbread and
making a cabbage/cranberry salad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Mistake: &LR;  ``I learned that you had to cook fish 10
minutes per inch. So I bought this beautiful fish, and it measured
8 inches long. So I cooked it for 80 minutes.'' The rule, she later
learned, is 10 minutes for each inch of thickness, not length.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advice for Novices:  &LR; Find simple recipes and follow them
exactly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quote:  &LR; ``I've gone from being the person asked to bring the
potato chips to the person asked to bring a dish.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Who: &LR;  Jon Irwin, 25, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why He Learned to Cook: &LR;  Eating out is too expensive, plus he
enjoys a wide variety of foods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Hurdles: &LR;  Finding enough time to cook and finding
simple recipes. ``Some recipes are too complex. I won't do
something if it takes more than 45 minutes from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Recent Success:  &LR; ``I made a fennel, three cheese and green
pepper stuffed chicken breast that ... was really good.'' &QL; 
 &UR; Biggest Mistakes:  &LR; ``Most of my mistakes come from not following a
recipe. I improvise a lot. I'll put the wrong spice with something
and it won't complement the other flavors. Recently, I made onion
rings and forgot that you are supposed to batter them. So I threw
the onions directly into the hot oil ... and I caught the stove on
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advice for Novices:  &LR; ``Tools are the most important thing.
Spend the money up front because it's worth it in the long run. And
improvise. ... Don't always follow the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quote: &LR;  '`I try to learn as much as I can by watching other
people so I can come up with diverse, good-tasting things to eat
and I don't have to eat pasta every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Who: &LR;  Allan Temko, 75, Berkeley
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why He Learned to Cook: &LR;  ``I got tired of eating in
restaurants.'' As a recent widower, he felt he had no choice but to
develop cooking skills. ``I've been spoiled all my life because
people have been cooking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Hurdle:  &LR; ``Finding time ... good cooking takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Recent Success: &LR;  ``I have learned how to shop.'' He also has
perfected frying mushrooms and garlic for steak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest Mistake:  &LR; ``When I was first learning to make pasta, I
didn't realize that you had to heat the Paul Newman sauce. Now I'm
really good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advice for Novices: &LR;  ``If you have time, take some courses.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quote: &LR;  ``I don't really like cooking. It's in self-defense.''

 BOLOGNA, Italy: white interior.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Our mother was a very good cook, very traditional,''
Margherita said. ``We didn't know anything about Mediterranean
cooking in those days, for example, because we didn't travel, but
we did know the cooking of Emilia-Romagna, which is very good. We
have few traditions for second courses, and no fish, but the pasta
is the best in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simili philosophy is pure Italian: seek out perfect
ingredients and then try not to get in their way. ``I try to be
simple and natural,'' she said. ``But the simpler the dish, the
more difficult it is to reproduce. I don't really have a feel for
high cuisine, and I don't like it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   One pasta lesson, for example, covers local forms like tortelli,
tortellini, cappelletti, tagliatelle, lasagne and cannelloni.
Another covers typical pastas from all over Italy. In other
lessons, students learn about the meat broths and the meat sauces
that Bologna made famous.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, when Marcella and Victor Hazan were traveling
all over Italy collecting information for their second cookbook,
they sought out the Simili bakery and struck up an acquaintance
with the sisters that developed into a professional collaboration.
When the Hazans opened a cooking school in Bologna, they hired
Valeria as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they hired Margherita to teach baking and to lead
students on field trips in the area. At about this time, their
father sold the business, and the sisters opened their own bakery.
But the hard work was taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margherita came to us and said, `I don't think I can stand the
schedule, I'd like to teach,''' Hazan said. ``Marcella told them
she thought it was a great idea.'' Mrs. Hazan not only encouraged
the sisters to set up a school but gave them the equipment from her
kitchen when she closed down her school in Bologna and relocated to
Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the little school took root, attracting a varied
clientele. The students in the cucina rapida course included a very
elderly woman from the neighborhood, a tourist or two passing
through, and young local women in search of tips or simply a fun
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have given courses for children, and to draw a
broader clientele, they have ventured outside their usual
boundaries to offer instruction on, say, Tuscan cuisine or fish
cookery, often relying on outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get all kinds,'' Valeria said. ``We get shopkeepers, postal
workers, rich people. There are people who have told us that taking
this course is better than analysis. It's a lot cheaper, and they
feel better.''
</P>

   WATERTOWN, Mass. _ On the bedroom floor of their Watertown home,
on the living room couch, on chairs in the den, on mattresses
strewn on the sun porch, on foam pads and pillows and blanket piles
wherever there's a comfortable corner, Carla and Duncan Brown and
about two dozen of their friends sit cross-legged and casual, eyes
closed, for their peace offensive.
</P>
<P>
   These friends have come together almost every evening since the
beginning of April in response to the devastation in Kosovo. They
think they know how to stop the bombings and ease ethnic tensions
there: they meditate.
</P>
<P>
   And they are linked by the Internet with a group of about 90
Serbians in Belgrade trying the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that radio waves transmit sound over long
distances, they say their brain waves can radiate a form of energy
that is unusually calm and coherent, and helps dissolve the
stresses that cause war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undermining warlike tendencies,'' without the aggressors
even knowing it, said Laure Edwards, 43, a financial writer from
Natick who is an advanced meditator.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Watertown group has personal friends or family
members in war-torn Yugoslavia. But they have seen graphic film
footage of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, the world they knew
left behind them in shreds. And they have read touching e-mail
messages from Dragana Pejcic, a 38-year-old graduate student in
Belgrade who communicates with them through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is tired and exhausted from the daily air-raid
sirens, from going to the cellars and shelters during the night,
from listening to all kinds of (emotional) stories,'' Pejcic wrote.
``Monday, around 4 a.m., I woke up because the building was shaking
as if an earthquake hit us. . . . After that, we watched fire
everywhere. Terrible!''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Brown, 42, a computer network administrator, explained
the urgent concern that has brought the meditators to his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to go on with our normal lives knowing that
this is happening,'' he said. ``I'm upset by the suffering and
cruelty I see in Kosovo. The world is my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Kuhn, 49, a documentary archivist living in Pepperell,
said she was especially moved by stories of Serbian meditators
traveling across Belgrade, ``while bombs are coming down, to get to
a place where they can create a little island of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Pejcic, ``We meet in the home of Milija and Marija
Petrovic, (meditating) there during the day and sleeping in our own
homes at night. To get there, those who live on the other side of
the river Sava, in Belgrade's center, have to cross the bridge. And
because two bridges already have been bombed, with the threat of
further bombing increasing, many people hardly dare to come. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very painful to understand what's going on. We just know
what a solution is. And we work on that.''
</P>
<P>
   By meditating together, in Watertown as in Belgrade, the group
members say they are creating a more settled, restful environment
that is more conducive to rational decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   For Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic or NATO leaders to
really get the message, these meditators probably would need a much
larger group, they say. But perhaps they can help at least a few
people to shift their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing in Kosovo is because of all the differences people
see. A better answer is to help people see the commonalities, the
unity,'' said Peggy Gurnan, 54, who teaches mathematics at a middle
school in Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something intellectual or abstract,'' she said.
``It's a direct experience of connectedness.''
</P>
<P>
   These peacemakers practice an advanced form of Transcendental
Meditation. They say the technique allows their minds to settle
down so that they contact a field of natural energy and
intelligence, which they say some physicists call the unified field
of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Refining and softening this field in one place, they say, can
have a long-range ameliorating effect somewhere else. And doing it
together makes the effect more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   They know some observers will think their ideas absurd. But
history, they say, supports their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Brown, who wrote a Harvard dissertation on the subject,
said 43 studies have documented a link between this form of
meditation and reductions in conflict and negativity, including a
famous study of warfare in Lebanon published by Yale's Journal of
Conflict Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists who reviewed the work decided they had to publish
it,'' she said. ``They didn't believe it, but they couldn't deny
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her dissertation, Brown documented how most scientific
breakthroughs have been initially greeted by ridicule. People
laughed at the notion that radio waves could transmit sound over
long distances, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Other meditators added that those who preach nonviolence often
are viewed as weak or naive, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget how everyone thought the nonviolent techniques of
the civil rights movement were crazy,'' Kuhn said. This
(Transcendental Meditation) is a second-generation technique.''

THE HIGH LIFE OF DAVID BREASHEARS

 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once he gets to know you a bit, David Breashears will begin to
reveal the bits and pieces of his unusual life, from a childhood
darkened by a violent father to his ambivalence about the
forbidding mountain to which his name has become tightly linked. He
will talk about growing up scrawny yet becoming a legendary scaler
of rock faces and icefalls. About a nomadic and relentless work
style that saw him log some 200,000 air miles last year alone. And
about summiting Mount Everest four times, the third in 1996, while
making a remarkable large-format IMAX movie and unexpectedly
finding himself witness to a stormy tragedy during which eight
climbers perished.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting in a noisy Boston restaurant recently, precisely
dissecting his toasted bagel with chive cheese and tomatoes, the
43-year-old climber-cum-filmmaker is reduced to quoting Yogi Berra
in self-summation. Breashears carefully folds his narrow hands and
leans across the small table. His metallic-blue eyes peer straight
ahead. ``When you come to a fork in the road,'' he declares evenly,
``take it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has. Frequently. Next month, Breashears will embark on
an 18-city tour to promote ``High Exposure,'' an autobiography that
chonicles his diverse climbing life. (The book was aided in no
small measure by Jeff Long, a Colorado outdoor writer.) Once
something of a young cult figure among the rock-climbing dudes of
the Rockies, Breashears later became the first American to twice
summit Everest and the first person to transmit live images from
the mountain's 29,028-foot peak. He has made an assortment of
documentaries and won four Emmy awards. These days he is earnestly
working to aid the Nepalese Sherpas who make Himalayan
mountaineering possible, while planning another IMAX movie, this
one about Mount Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that last month, a poster advertising his slide
presentation at the University of New Hampshire, for which he was
paid $8,500, according to one of the organizers, touted him as
``world famous.'' And oh yes: People magazine crowned Breashears _
something of a Tony Perkins circa-1975 look-alike _ the ``sexiest
explorer'' of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A celebrity, right? ``You're doomed when you start to believe
that stuff,'' says Breashears, whose 5-foot-10, 160-pound frame
does not suggest world-class physical feats. ``Besides, people
aren't interested in me. They're interested in the experiences I
give them in my films. I'm just a window. A portal.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect any appearances on ``Hollywood Squares,'' or any
of the other trappings that often accompany fame. ``I don't think
he knows how to cash in on it,'' says his friend David Fanning,
senior executive producer of the PBS television program
``Frontline.'' ``He hasn't made much money because he doesn't know
how to sell himself.'' Breashears keeps a small office in the
Victorian manse that belongs to a friend in Newton, Mass., uses a
modest Boston apartment as a sort of base camp, and lives nearby
with his girlfriend, ``Nova'' TV producer Liesl Clark. He has no
agent and no publicist. Why? ``It's just such a bizarre thought,''
he answers, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has public acclaim altered his unwillingness to buy into the
American dream. As in: purchase a house, settle down, etc.
Sometimes he'll actually talk about buying a first home, but the
conversations don't last long. ``It creates anxiety in me,'' he
says. ``I have the means to do it, but it would mean giving up my
vagabond nature. And it just hasn't mattered. If it mattered, I'd
do it. I'll get to that point someday. But right now my work is my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. When Breashears was about 10 years old,
his father, a demanding Army officer, became increasingly violent
and eventually abandoned him, his mother, and his three siblings.
It is a dark chapter with which he has since wrestled, and one that
he feels helps explain why he does what he does. ``I've chosen a
life of climbing, a life of running away from commitment and
stability,'' he says. ``When your world falls apart like that _
when someone you're supposed to admire becomes someone you fear _
it can lead to a life in which it's hard to make attachments.''
</P>
<P>
   Close relationships have suffered. The foremost casualty was his
four-year marriage to Veronique Choa, now a Virginia-based graphic
designer, whom he met at the foot of Everest in 1986. Breashears
was away working during much of the marriage _ a documentary film
on Tibet here, a movie about Peruvian mummies there _ and he wasn't
eager to carve out a real partnership when he was ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To talk about large subjects freaked him out,'' says Choa, who
considers her former husband a good friend. ``These were subjects
like, `Where are we going to live?' and `Are we going to have a
family?' It put a lot of stress on him to think about those things.
He avoided talking about them. . . . I wanted a life, and a life
with him. I wanted to share experiences. I did not thrive alone. I
was unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Large mountains, small world: Choa is now married to America On
Line president and chief operating officer Robert Pittman, who was
formerly married to Sandy Hill, a socialite/climber who was part of
the 1996 calamity on Everest and who earlier climbed the mountain
with Breashears.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked to choose some words to describe Breashears, Choa selects
``neat,'' ``meticulous,'' and ``precise.'' ``He should have been a
surgeon,'' she muses. Others who know him well offer these
descriptions: iconoclastic, focused, prickly, thoughtful,
controlling, curious, disciplined, self-reliant, careful,
practical, impatient, efficient. In the end, one word _ driven _ is
mentioned more than the others, and Breashears does not disagree
with it. ``This is not a calm soul,'' he confesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the boy who is going to prove himself to his father,''
offers Fanning. ``He is going to climb his way out of the
unhappiness of his childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the boy who takes no project lightly, especially if
it involves unforgiving places. This is no risk taker, despite his
chosen profession. He knows that the finish line of any climb is at
the bottom, not on the top. Indeed, in 1994 Breashears turned back
his Everest party of five climbers and four Sherpas at 24,400 feet
because he didn't like the snow conditions ahead. Even when he
reaches the summit, he wants to do it on his own careful terms.
``He'll never put himself in harm's way,'' says his mother, Ruth
Breashears, who lives in Denver. ``He listens to the mountain.''

   John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign for Tibet,
a human-rights-monitoring group, remembers one classic
Breashears-led climb. It took place on Black Dike, a White
Mountains icefall, during the winter of 1994-95. ``Most people get
up at dawn and are at the icefall at 8 o'clock,'' Ackerly explains.
``But David was up at 4 a.m. and the icefall at dawn. So we were
hiking before light in 20-below-zero weather. We finished the climb
at 9 a.m., and we were down by lunch. But David had wanted plenty
of time to deal with whatever might go wrong, although nothing did.
He's very practical. He thinks of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fanning sees his friend as a kind of misplaced 19th-century
character filled with old-fashioned virtues. ``He's the guy you'd
send to the furthest corner of the colonial empire to keep the flag
flying,'' he says. ``Because he'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Breashears doesn't have a life. On the
contrary, his intensity and curiosity have pushed him hither and
yon. True, much of what he likes to do takes place outdoors _
climbing the White Mountains in New Hampshire, for example, or
fly-fishing for striped bass. But he's also likely to whip up some
Mediterranean or Oriental food to go with a bottle of Chilean red
wine, crank up a Bruce Springsteen CD (or slip out to the opera),
or open a thick historical tome. ``He's easily comfortable in a
wider range of cultures than most Americans,'' says Andrew Harvard,
an attorney who has climbed with Breashears on a dozen or so
Himalayan expeditions. ``In that sense he's like an educated
European.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Breashears never seriously considered college, opting
instead to do his learning on the ledges high above Boulder, Colo.
``He didn't have a bike or a stereo when he was growing up,'' his
mother recalls. ``All he wanted to do was climb.'' For a young
misfit who didn't go to his senior prom or bother to have his
picture taken for the yearbook, climbing was a pathway to
excellence and self-expression. His first job in films, some 20
years ago, was as a gofer in a documentary about climbing. He has
since worked on an assortment of movies at a variety of levels _ he
shot footage for Sylvester Stallone's 1993 ``Cliffhanger'' _ and
has recently himself made films about such subjects as the Chinese
occupation of Tibet, the ways that high altitude affects the body
and mind, and the mapping and measuring of Mount Everest.
Breashears has been on Everest 11 times since 1981, usually with a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   He was there in May 1996, toting a 42-pound, $186,000 IMAX
camera toward the summit, when all hell broke loose. On a night
that still rattles with controversy, eight climbers in other
expeditions died when they didn't get down from the top of Everest
before both darkness and a serious storm hit. Camped at 21,300 feet
_ a perch where he had charcteristically decided to wait because he
liked neither the unstable weather nor the mountain's crowded
condition _ Breashears put the success of his own expedition in
jeopardy to assist survivors and to donate 24 precious oxygen tanks
to the rescue effort. Several days later, he and his party of four
other climbers inched their way toward the summit, past Rob Hall
and Scott Fischer, two guides who'd perished on that awful night
and whose frozen bodies were now part of an open graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the top of the world, Breashears used his bare hands
to load the final 500-foot roll of 65mm film into the camera _ by
far the heaviest single object that had even been slogged up the
slopes of Everest _ and finished a mountaineering movie that may
never be matched. (The Sherpa on the summit with him was Jamling
Tenzing Norgay, son of the first Sherpa to reach the top, in 1953,
who was an inspiration for Breashears's youthful climbing.)
Significantly, he had chosen not to film the earlier nightmare. Nor
had he turned his camera on the corpses of Hall and Fischer. ``He's
always had a clear view of how to behave on the mountains, and what
he did reflects that view,'' says Andrew Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually think of that expedition when I'm driving my car,
when there's nothing in front of me that has to be done,''
Breashears says. ``And when I do think of it, it's never, ever,
about being on top of Everest. It's about the sequence of events
that led to those deaths. And how awful it must have been for those
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a transitional moment for me. A watershed. For one
thing, I gained access to a part of my soul I'd built a wall
around. I felt real sadness over those deaths, the kind of sadness
I hadn't been able to feel when my father died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also made me feel more comfortable and more self-assured
about who I am. Giving up those oxygen bottles and not filmimg what
was happening . . . In those moments, I was the person I'd hoped I
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, I have less of a need to ask myself, `Can you do
it? Are you good enough?' I have less of a need to prove myself.
I'm less agitated and more calm. It's like letting steam out of a
pressure cooker.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but he's still David Breashears and he's still on the
run. There's the upcoming book tour, the Kilimanjaro film project,
the Sherpa cause. There's the dream of making a film archive of
Tibetan life. Sure, he'd like to climb just for the fun of it _
Look! No camera! _ but where's the time for it? He runs regularly
and works out at a local gym, but he frets that he's not in the
kind of shape that would allow him to make a quarter-inch finger
hold from an overhang. ``I would never have fathomed that could
happen,'' he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Everest? He talks about it like he might talk about a complex
relationship with another person, someone he loves but knows he
should avoid. He says he feels it's become a trophy mountain, its
high camps and fixed ropes too often overpopulated by folks who
have served no real climbing apprenticeship. ``The Everest
freeway,'' he calls the place, telling friends he'll never go back.
</P>
<P>
   And yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   He did return in 1997 to make ``The Death Zone'' for ``Nova,''
and still talks about the flutter he gets when he sees this dark
icon rising into the clouds. That's when he'll say, ``I've always
felt drawn to Everest, felt a tug.'' And that's when he'll say,
``I'm not finished there.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Those convinced that ignoring history means we are
condemned to repeat it are comparing our increasing military
involvement in Kosovo with that in Vietnam and call it an example
of the folly of getting bogged down in a high-casualty, losing war.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic killings and
expulsions are also being likened to Adolf Hitler's mass murders
and deportations in the Holocaust. They are seen as a warning that
appeasement of murdering dictators does not prevent war but instead
encourages violence to spread.
</P>
<P>
   The two messages are contradictory and _ because history never
quite produces the identical situation twice _ not precisely apt.
</P>
<P>
   A more appropriate comparison, however, may be with the United
Nations' bloody ``police action'' led by the United States in Korea
from 1950 to 1953. The fighting was prompted by communist North
Korea's invasion of democratic South Korea in a brutal campaign to
militarily take over the entire peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a truce was negotiated and the North driven out of
the South, 88,000 U.N. soldiers had been killed, of whom 33,700
were Americans. South Korea lost a million civilians, 40 percent of
its industry and a third of its homes.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was simultaneously a political and military success
and a failure. The war ended with a U.N. armistice rather than a
peace treaty, and the north and south remain technically at war
today, their armies glowering at each other across a demilitarized
zone.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman's policy of accepting a stalemate rather
than pursuing total victory over the North was sensible but not
politically popular at home. The controversy forced Truman to fire
an irresponsibly gung-ho Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who came home to a
hero's welcome. And the resulting political firestorm contributed
to Truman's decision not to seek reelection in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that South Korea remained intact and was
gloriously rebuilt with western aid. Communist expansion was
thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that North Korea went relatively unpunished for
its aggression and still poses a potential global menace despite
its internal repression and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like Iraq or what? Just as Truman was in Korea,
President George Bush was content with pushing Saddam Hussein back
within his own borders but not pursuing him further. That avoided
further needless bloodshed but left him alive to fight again
another day.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly China recently helped North Korea build a new
three-stage rocket with the capacity to launch nuclear missiles at
Alaska and Hawaii. Current diplomatic talks have focused on
exchanging U.S. promises of aid in return for access to the
suspected nuclear weapons site but have not yet produced visible
results.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the intractable hostility is the North Korean
government's accusation this week, announcing that it expects to be
the next target attacked by Americans, after the bombing of
Yugoslavia and Iraq. The U.S. ``doctrine of strength applied
against Iraq and Yugoslavia does not work on us at all,'' the
official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 40,000 U.S. troops still patrol in South Korea almost
50 years after the war began. There has been constant tension along
the border but no new outbreak of fighting. Without casualty
reports, most Americans have forgotten that we are there and
probably will be for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly ambiguous outcome seems likely in the current Kosovo
crisis. Eventually the NATO air strikes will wear down Milosevic's
ability to control and destroy Kosovo. He will suddenly pretend to
be willing to talk peace. Then what?
</P>
<P>
   The appeasers want to turn and run, leaving him in charge of the
country he ruined but getting out before American blood is shed.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and his supporters want to go in with
guns blazing and demonstrate to the world that mass murder and
evacuation are not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Some course in between that protects Kosovo, allows its people
to return and gets rid of Milosevic and his brutes but leaves
Belgrade standing seems the way to go. It may require a perpetual
NATO troop presence, but Korea proves that can be a tolerable, if
imperfect, solution.

ALWAYS PLAY TIME FOR THE PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Celtics' bench looked pretty good Monday; they had
three starters in street clothes, all smartly attired. At the other
end of the court, Larry Bird had the same guys he's always had _ in
uniform, ready to go. It has been that way for two years.
</P>
<P>
   You can listen to Bird talk a lot about coaching, but one thing
he won't discuss is how well he deals with adversity and
roster-juggling. He hasn't had any. He's had to deal with tough
losses and a tough schedule, but he sees the same faces every day
and that is almost a miracle in this truncated season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers played their 42d game Monday. The top nine players,
all of whom are averaging at least 17 minutes a game, have missed a
total of five games, no one missing more than one. And of those
five games, two were non-injured absences; Jalen Rose was suspended
for a game for fighting and Mark Jackson missed one to attend his
father's funeral. The notoriously fragile Rik Smits missed his
first game Sunday _ because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable number in any season, let alone this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond imagination,'' Bird said of the season. ``I
thought it was going to be great, playing every day. But it's not.
We're on the road all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also is consistent with what Bird has seen since he took
over. Last season, for instance, five of Bird's top eight went
wire-to-wire and a sixth, Miller, missed one game because of a
suspension. Only Smits (nine games) and Dale Davis (the first four
of the season) missed more than one game.
</P>
<P>
   How do the Pacers do it? They don't know. There is a connection
between health and winning, more of a connection when talent is
added to the equation. But there's no accounting for the ankle
sprain that Antoine Walker suffered Sunday. It could have happened
to Miller or Davis or Jackson. It did happen to Antonio Davis _
obviously not as severely _ but he missed one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do anything different than anyone else,'' said team
president Donnie Walsh. ``I mean, we have a conditioning coach and
we try to pick stuff up early. I think it's a roll of the dice in
this business. I just knock on wood every chance I get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers do have three players on the injured list: Mark Pope,
Mate Skelin, and Fred Hoiberg. Even those guys are healthy. The
only legitimately hurt player this season is the maddening Derrick
McKey, who is trying to do the impossible: play himself back into
shape in a season with no time for practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he never played before,'' a sympathetic Bird
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana will say they need McKey for this or for that, but they
can do quite nicely without him. Smits is absolutely critical to
the club's success and he's been a constant ever since Dan Dyrek
started working on his feet. Miller, Chris Mullin, and Dale Davis
have started all 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' Dale Davis said. ``It gives you a chance to play a
consistent game and have a consistent year. Some of it is luck. But
a lot of it is how you go about training.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about minutes distribution, Davis said, ``It has an
effect. You play less, the less chance you have of getting hurt.
(Bird) has done a good job of rotating guys.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the experience factor. Dale Davis is the pup of the
litter and he's played seven seasons. The other four (Smits,
Miller, Mullin, and Jackson) all have played at least a decade.
They know how to take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around,'' Walsh said. ``But what amazes me is how
we've stayed healthy this season. With all those games in a short
period of time, that's when injuries occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Bird, ``We've been very fortunate. Overall, we've been
pretty healthy. The guys keep in shape. We also play a lot of guys,
so that helps. We try to keep their minutes down. I don't think
Reggie Miller needs to play 38 to 40 minutes a night (he plays
35.8).''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bird even pretended that Smits was a pre-game
concern. Asked before the game if Smits was going to play, Bird
said, ``I have no idea. If he's not out there, he's not going to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits was out there and he played. It's the Indiana way.

INVESTORS CAN EAVESDROP ON COMPANY-ANALYST CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene McQuade, speaking from a crowded room at the Helmsley
Hotel in New York, came through loud and clear to anyone with a
computer wired to the Internet and the interest to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a little bit of shareholder democracy in action.
</P>
<P>
   McQuade, the chief financial officer at Fleet Financial Group,
was leading a routine quarterly conference with brokerage analysts
and institutional investors last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet can count itself among a small but growing number of
companies using the Internet to level the playing field for
individual investors when it comes to those conference calls, which
had always been private conversations with professional
stockholders. In these cases, individual investors can now listen,
but not ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has evolved so it can be done well and you're
comfortable with it,'' said McQuade.
</P>
<P>
   Conference calls are almost always dry, often tedious, and
sometimes useless. But top managers explain events and plans in
detail on those calls and stocks often trade up or down on those
comments while the conversation is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have it both ways. You can't trade on that
information and not expect the media and individual investors to
have access to it,'' said Louis Thompson, chief executive of the
National Investor Relations Institute in Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line traders are really going to start pushing the
envelope for real-time disclosure and real-time access,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies balk at the idea of permitting virtually anyone
onto their call, complaining that information could be
misunderstood. Many analysts worry the practice will turn a
sophisticated financial conversation into mush.
</P>
<P>
   But the convenient old excuse, that it was impractical to tie
many hundreds or even thousands of people into a telephone
conference call, is history.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies now offer services that put conference call
audio on Internet sites. The cost, usually around $800, is
inconsequential to most public companies.
</P>
<P>
   These corporate ``Webcasters'' have been in operation for about
two years, but few companies signed up before the middle of last
year. Since then, most say their rosters of corporate clients have
increased by more than 100 percent quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   V-Call Corp., a Philadelphia firm, specializes in live
conference audio available at no charge to anyone who registers at
its site (www.vcall.com). Free software to play audio is easy to
download from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   V-Call's list of registered users has grown from 33,000 in
January to 125,000 as of last week. It boasts a roster of more than
300 companies using at least some of its services.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate Communications Broadcast Network in Boston handles
audio for clients who want it posted on their own Internet sites,
and Broadcast.com Inc. of Dallas (www.broadcast.com) posts some
live corporate conference calls, along with commercial radio and
other kinds of audio.
</P>
<P>
   C-Call Corp. of San Francisco (www.ccall.com) uses the same kind
of technology but most of its corporate clients restrict access to
the same professional investors who used to dial into conference
calls by phone. It may turn out to be an intermediate step before
companies use the Web to transmit to retail shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get comfortable with the medium, it's easier to
transfer that out to the retail (investors),'' said Blake Hayunga,
a vice president for the public company group at C-Call. ``It
happens in pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference calls open to the public have attracted groups of
several hundred to a few thousand. Microsoft Corp. conference calls
are heard by more than 10,000 people, including employees.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies tend to Webcast their analyst conferences
more often than other businesses and attract a larger listening
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But more companies, including Fleet, have an increasing number
of individual shareholders, and they are giving all their investors
the same access to calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing,'' said Rob Adler, president of
Corporate Communications Broadcast Network. ``The Internet is
changing the way a lot of things are done.''

ALBANIAN BORDER

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Relief agencies are beginning to lure out some
of the Kosovar Albanian refugees crammed into this mountain valley,
but many have adamantly dug in for a long stay here -- as close as
they can remain to their ravaged homes and missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two months, I won't move at all,'' said Osman Sllamniku(CQ
both), who is here with 21 people of his extended family in a tent
camp. ``After that, we'll consider it for the sake of the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such commonly heard sentiments, on each of the past two
days truck and bus shuttles carried more than 10,000 refugees away
from the frigid nights and windy, rain-spattered days of this
mountain valley.
</P>
<P>
   And a NATO helicopter ferry service is expected to start flying
by Thursday, taking away people ill-suited to the 9- to 10-hour
ride out. They will be flown to Tirana and other cities further
south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having helicopters here tomorrow,'' said U.S. Army Maj.
Hank Adams, who on Tuesday afternoon was inspecting the first loads
of gravel planned to turn a dirt track into a major access road at
an old Albanian military airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is attached to NATO's new HQ-A4, the headquarters
established to carry out humanitarian assistance in the region. He
said the grass air field will take out refugees and bring in the
food and other supplies now landing at a small site hard up against
a tent camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviators don't like touching down with the potential of
chopping a civilian's head off,'' said Adams, of Bozeman, Mont.
Children often run out to wave at arriving helicopters, and there
are no barriers to stop them or anyone else from walking into an
incoming rotor blade.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely when the refugee airlift begins will be up to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency
that will determine who gets to ride in the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR spokesman Jacques Franquin said the helicopters will be
used only for ``vulnerable'' people. But rather than further break
up families, such sick or elderly people will be accompanied by all
the relatives here with them.
</P>
<P>
   Franquin said he had heard no discussion of this same air
operation being used to drop food into the neighboring Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
   It is feared the Serbian-led Yugoslav military forces have
prevented the departure of hundreds of thousands of people who were
en route to the Albanian and Macedonian borders to escape ethnic
cleansing brutalities, and that these refugees may be in hiding in
remote mountains or forested areas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Programme has begun discussing an air drop
to them, and has made an appeal to donor countries for six million
of the food packages called humanitarian daily rations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor had NATO's Adams heard of plans for air drops from the field
here. He noted there are neither the aircraft nor the supplies in
Kukes to mount such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovar Albanian refugees still trying to flee Kosovo are
permitted by the Serbs to exit, the situation on the borders of
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro again will become critical.
</P>
<P>
   Once again on Tuesday, only a few refugees crossed into Albania,
although an estimated 2,000-3,000 did make their way into Macedonia
only to hear the UNHCR declare the border camps there full beyond
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While the exhausted refugees faced a second night of driving
wind and rain, those fortunate enough to cross the border faced new
harassment in Macedonia, which has reluctantly taken in the refugee
throngs.
</P>
<P>
   With its largest camp packed with 25,000 refugees, the UNHCR was
forced to put recent arrivals outside the enclave's fence because
local farmers would not sell or lease land to expand the Brazda
camp. That leaves those on its fringes vulnerable to raids by a
local population resentful of the influx of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian civilians come nightly to the exposed tents, throwing
stones, shining flashlights into the tents and shouting, while the
exiles cower inside, the Kosovo Albanians said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,000-3,000 refugees reportedly staggered over a
mountain crossing, overwhelming a remote hamlet of 60 houses called
Milana, the U.N. refugee agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of refugees said thousands more were behind them,
driven out by Serb purges of ethnic Albanian communities.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect of a resumed refugee flow is a major factor
fueling the effort to move out refugees who in many cases are
settling here to await the conclusion of NATO bombing aimed at
forcing Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
to allow the refugees back into an autonomous Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians once made up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, and Yugoslav forces have expelled an estimated 640,000 of
them from the province since last month. Many ethnic Albanians
favor independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   New tent camps are making a white and green mosaic across the
spring countryside here in anticipation of a new rush of exiles.
But aid authorities are aiming to keep them as transit camps, not
semi-permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These camps have to be transitional,'' said Daniel Endres,
coordinator for UNHCR here. ``We have to explain to refugees that
staying up here means many risks, and those risks increase with the
intensification of war on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border shelling already has pockmarked the countryside,
mostly northwest of here, as Serbian troops apparently try to knock
out camps of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The high concentration of people without proper services also
means the refugees stay cold, dirty and subjected to disease and
other health hazards.

   KUKES, Albania _ Poor conditions have spurred some refugees to
depart this rugged border area, but many will not leave unless they
are dragged out.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sllamniku(CQ) family is in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the five adult brothers, all here with their
families, is thinking about trying to leave. He would go to
Germany, where his wife's father lives.
</P>
<P>
   The rest will stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Every night Ismet Sllamniku and three other adults sleep out in
the tractor and wagon that was jammed with 46 people as it drove
out of Kosovo about 10 days ago. There isn't enough space to sleep
in the tents their 21-member family have been assigned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Zahide bemoans the cold water she must use to wash her
two-year-old daughter and baby son of 10 months. The camp stopped
giving out disposable diapers three days ago, she said, which is
quite a hardship with children suffering diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   The food given by the Italians who run the camp is OK, they
said, but it is food for Italians. Plates of hot pasta with a
tomato sauce were being served at lunchtime Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are few clothes changes for either adults or children, not
enough mattresses, and no cooking equipment even if they had food
to cook. A tent that housed 13 of the family was barren inside
except for three single mattresses, blankets covering the floor and
piled in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   So why not leave?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the point is to go from this tent to another tent, why
go?'' asked Ismet Sllamniku, 33. The question is a reflection of
the fact that refugees generally do not know what options await
them at the end of a ride down the mountain. Most are housed with
Albanian families or in collective centers such as gymnasiums.
</P>
<P>
   There is an additional factor of the tractor. At present
Albanian authorities are prohibiting most refugee tractors from
traveling the routes out of here, to prevent nationwide traffic
congestion on roads that are already narrow and potholed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the family's most valuable possession, and the going price
for tractors here is about one-fifth the normal market value.
</P>
<P>
   Ismet's 25-year-old brother Osman said there is some
psychological comfort in being close to the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be as near as possible to home, not as far as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the tractor as far as Tirana would be an 18-hour trip. If
the Kosovar Albanians are allowed back into their homeland, the
trip back would take much longer because of roads clogged with
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that in two months the situation will get better,''
said Osman Sllamniku. ``We know they burned our houses. But if even
a chicken coop remains there, I will go.''

ONE MOVING PART, NO BATTERIES: WHO'D EVER BUY IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the thrill and efficiency of the whirl of a
food processor and the hyperbuzz of a spice grinder _ smooth sauces
form instantly, spices are reduced to a powder _ they are about as
sensual as a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is the ancient mortar and pestle. This simple
tool _ a heavy hollowed base with a clublike pounder _ looks
hopelessly tedious to use. But after testing nine, I found them not
only efficient but effective in ways that no machine can be.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the crack of every spice pod, seeing the sticky juices
released from a clove of garlic, smelling the pungency of basil as
I bruised the leaves, was an addictive experience. Hanging your
nose over the feed tube of a food processor isn't quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just one reason the tool has lasted millennia.
</P>
<P>
   David Page, an owner of Drovers Tap Room on Jones Street, said
the mortar and pestle was ``more efficient than what we replaced it
with.'' Spice grinders and food processors take up more room, have
many more parts to wash and just don't do the same job. Those
machines have blades at the bottom of the cylinder, so only what is
at the bottom is ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of defeats the purpose of having a mechanical tool if
you have to be physically shaking it to get it to work properly,''
Page said.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, a mortar and pestle can perform tasks no
food processor or spice grinder can. Smooth paste or coarse spice
mixture _ the results are completely under your control. It's the
motion of your hand and the pressure you place on the pestle, not
the speed of a turning blade, that determine texture or thickness
of a sauce. A mortar and pestle can crush just a few fennel seeds.
Try that in a spice grinder.
</P>
<P>
   A delicate sauce like pesto is completely different when made
with a mortar and pestle instead of a machine. Pesto means
``pounded,'' but a food processor or blender chops and slices,
making for a bitter sauce.
</P>
<P>
   With a blender, you stuff in all the ingredients _ basil, pine
nuts, garlic and oil _ and everything is ground up before you're
sure the proportions are correct. With a mortar and pestle,
ingredients are pounded together gradually and build on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bertolli, an owner of Oliveto Cafe and Restaurant in
Oakland, Calif., and a proponent of the mortar and pestle,
describes the mechanical alternative succinctly: ``It's noisy, it's
boring and it doesn't produce a pleasing, rustic kind of result,
which is what pesto is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The mortar and pestle is also a crucial tool in Indian cooking.
Many chutneys, like mint and coriander chutney, have to be made by
hand. In a machine, their texture becomes too uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Indian food, the texture is important,'' said Julie Sahni,
the cookbook author and owner of Julie Sahni's School of Indian
Cooking in Brooklyn Heights. ``Indians eat with their fingers, and
textured foods are easier to pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Spice mixtures are also best made in a mortar and pestle. A
mortar and pestle crushes cardamom, for example, and forces out its
essence, while a grinder can only slice it. And as Ms. Sahni
pointed out, the heat of an electrical appliance can destroy the
volatile oils in spices.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be as many types of mortars and pestles as there
are uses for them. They come in varying forms, sizes and materials:
rough stone, wood, textured porcelain and marble that is cool to
the touch.
</P>
<P>
   After the testing, I discovered a few essential characteristics.
It is important to choose a heavy mortar, so it won't move when you
beat or pound with the pestle. High, sloping sides are necessary
for grinding spices and making sauces, to keep ingredients from
flying out and to force them to fall back to the center of the
mortar, so you don't have to constantly push them back with the
pestle.
</P>
<P>
   The materials that the mortars and pestles were made of proved
critical. A small glass one was practically useless. It was
difficult enough to get used to the idea of grinding spices with
glass, but the smoothness meant that the spices flew right out of
the mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Wood wasn't much better. When I crushed peppercorns, they dented
the wooden pestle, and garlic and basil left the porous mortar
irreversibly stained and scented when I made pesto. A wooden mortar
was also too light and was difficult to keep still when I was
beating in olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Most successful were the marble and ceramic mortars and pestles.
A marble one four inches in diameter was finely weighted. The
cone-shaped mortar helped focus the pounding in the bottom center
of the mortar, and the marble pestle was heavy enough to crack hard
spices like cardamom. Because it stays cool, it is perfect for
pesto and sauces like aioli. It is also reasonably priced _ $9.99,
for example, at Lechter's stores.
</P>
<P>
   The best all-round mortar and pestle was the 5 1/4-inch Mason
Cash, a vitrified ceramic model made in England. It is perfectly
weighted and has a soft matte texture. The pestle, a hollow ceramic
wand, has a fat base, so that when you pound out spices, you hit
several at a time, not just one or two. Just as a larger whisk is
easier to use, the larger pestle simplifies sauces like pestos,
chutneys and mayonnaises. Mason Cash also makes an 8-inch mortar
and pestle. The 5 1/4-inch model is $24.98 at Zabar's, 2245
Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ceramic Japanese mortars with hard wooden pestles are not only
useful but beautiful. Shaped like soup bowls and often painted in
pretty greens and blues, the mortars are textured inside with
raised ridges. The tools, called suribachi, are perfect for almost
every use _ spices can be ground to powder against the rough
surface, herbs and leaves can be shredded _ but not for sauces.
When I made aioli, I felt that I was sanding down the wooden pestle
as it scraped against the mortar. A model painted with dragonflies
is available for $14.95 at a Cook's Companion, 152 Atlantic Ave.
(Clinton Street), Brooklyn Heights; (718) 852-6901.
</P>
<P>
   A small ceramic mortar and pestle from Sur la Table, (800)
243-0852, for $13.95, has a flat, disk-shaped mortar with a pestle
that fits into it like a tennis ball in a cupped hand. It is far
too tiny for making sauces but is perfect for crushing small
amounts of spices and is a good alternative to larger models for
everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   A 3 1/2-inch cast-iron mortar and pestle, $39.95 from Sur la
Table, was ideal for spices. The iron pestle, though small, had
ample heft, making for effortless crushing of hard, odd-shaped
spices like star anise.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what shape or material mortar and pestle you buy, it
will be difficult not to become enamored of the sounds and the
scents _ how something as plain as a peppercorn can be transformed
from a black pea to pungent shards under your command.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ The blue-gray New England spring light
sweeps through the huge paned windows of Emily Eveleth's studio and
splashes across the white of her 1,000-square-foot studio space,
large by Manhattan standards but average for an old industrial
building, once a hat factory.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this suburban town not far from Boston, Ms. Eveleth, 38,
has found the room and the tranquillity she feels she needs to do
the intensive kind of portrait painting for which she has become
known. This is an environment in which her models, too, can
comfortably hold a pose, often for several long weeks at a time.
Actually the primary subjects of her portraits are and for many
years have been doughnuts: powdered, cream-filled or honey-glazed.
Ms. Eveleth has brought to the representation of a junk-food icon
all the technical skill and esthetic deliberation of serious
practitioners in the grand tradition of oil-on-canvas realism with
its inevitable aura of illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's funny,'' Ms. Eveleth said in a recent
interview at her studio, ``but the thing they don't understand is
that what they're responding to is the fact that it is a painting.
It's the language of painting that allows them to respond the way
they do.'' Ms. Eveleth's newest canvases, which are being exhibited
through April 24 at the Danese Gallery in Manhattan, present her
sugary subjects in matter-of-fact but heroic poses.
</P>
<P>
   In her monumental images, light glows in the flakes of a
doughnut's crisp, translucent glaze, and gently brushes the surface
of a powdery specimen's rotund form.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings seem almost abstract, but in reality they are
meticulously precise and naturally luscious to look at. With their
jelly-filled orifices subdued in shadows or temptingly oozing
reddish goo, these works have been found by some critics to be
``sexy'' and erotic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eveleth was born and grew up in Connecticut and studied at
Smith College. She comes, she said, ``from a family that was
involved in science and art, and maybe my work reflects it.'' Her
father was an architect, and her paternal grandfather made wood
engravings; her mother was a systems analyst who worked on the
Atlas missile project in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eveleth said she started out as a landscape painter. In
college, spending her junior year abroad in Italy changed the way
she looked at and thought about art. Examining Old Master paintings
in European and American museums, she was drawn to portraits by the
15th-century Flemish painter Hans Memling and to the dramatic
chiaroscuro of Caravaggio and Zurbaran.
</P>
<P>
   Later she studied with George Nick, a realist painter whose work
she admired, at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. ``I'm
lucky I found my focus early: I knew I wanted to be a painter,''
Ms. Eveleth said. ``In addition to landscapes, in the late 1980s I
was doing what Fairfield Porter used to call `found still lifes' of
objects around the house, not studio setups.'' She would ``tweak
them sometimes,'' she admitted, by rearranging certain items.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I noticed a doughnut in a kitchen-table still life and
in it saw so many things,'' Ms. Eveleth recalled. ``Its beautiful,
perfect form. Its rich colors. I realized I didn't need all that
other stuff and thought, `Why not do a painting of just a
doughnut?''' Soon she did, in a small format. By 1992 she had
figured out a way to work on a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   That year, at the Danforth Museum of Art in Framingham, she
showed five big pictures that gave the full treatment of
Renaissance-derived portrait-painting technique to a select group
of the sticky baked goods. Her first subject was a single
honey-glazed ring; since then she has painted other varieties alone
or in lumpish, looming stacks. Seen in full-frontal views on table
tops and set against expansive, mostly solid-color backgrounds, Ms.
Eveleth's doughnuts, like Monet's haystacks, undergo a range of
treatment in variously changing baths of light.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of neither Pop Art nor Photo Realism, whose products
were often images of images, Ms. Eveleth's pictures feel both
inescapably massive and oddly ethereal. ``They're not ironic or
cynical,'' the artist emphasizes. Perhaps only a die-hard
post-modernist would insist they were.
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago, she curated an exhibition at the Danforth
Museum that displayed her paintings alongside works she chose from
the museum's collection. So she placed a picture of a luscious
lemon-cream doughnut on a plate between companion 19th-century
tableaux of a stolid bourgeois gentleman and his wife by the
American artist Erastus Salisbury Field.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to play the central role in the unexpected triptych, Ms.
Eveleth's confection held its own against the older portraits'
impressive glazing, that is, the classic technique of building up
color through multiple thin layers of paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a grace in Emily's work, and a sense of a personal
relationship with everyday experience,'' said Nick, her former
teacher. ``It reminds me of Chardin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately Ms. Eveleth has also been painting human subjects, albeit
mainly the backs of bald men's heads. And she has begun working on
a new doughnut picture with a big brush and broad, sweeping
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Handwritten notes to herself reminding her to paint ``Looser!''
are tacked to her studio walls
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have to say about painting is said in paint,''
she mused aloud as she watched midday sunlight flicker across a
canvas that movers would soon carry away to New York for her show.
``I'm just grateful that what I'm trying to say in paint, people
seem to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   She put on her coat, locked her studio door and stepped out for
a lunch break at a local Indian restaurant, leaving her models
behind on their pedestals in sugar-preserved, graceful repose.

   WATERTOWN, Mass. _ On the bedroom floor of their Watertown home,
on the living room couch, on chairs in the den, on mattresses
strewn on the sun porch, on foam pads and pillows and blanket piles
wherever there's a comfortable corner, Carla and Duncan Brown and
about two dozen of their friends sit cross-legged and casual, eyes
closed, for their peace offensive.
</P>
<P>
   These friends have come together almost every evening since the
beginning of April in response to the devastation in Kosovo. They
think they know how to stop the bombings and ease ethnic tensions
there: they meditate.
</P>
<P>
   And they are linked by the Internet with a group of about 90
Serbians in Belgrade trying the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that radio waves transmit sound over long
distances, they say their brain waves can radiate a form of energy
that is unusually calm and coherent, and helps dissolve the
stresses that cause war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undermining warlike tendencies,'' without the aggressors
even knowing it, said Laure Edwards, 43, a financial writer from
Natick who is an advanced meditator.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Watertown group has personal friends or family
members in war-torn Yugoslavia. But they have seen graphic film
footage of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, the world they knew
left behind them in shreds. And they have read touching e-mail
messages from Dragana Pejcic, a 38-year-old graduate student in
Belgrade who communicates with them through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is tired and exhausted from the daily air-raid
sirens, from going to the cellars and shelters during the night,
from listening to all kinds of (emotional) stories,'' Pejcic wrote.
``Monday, around 4 a.m., I woke up because the building was shaking
as if an earthquake hit us. . . . After that, we watched fire
everywhere. Terrible!''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Brown, 42, a computer network administrator, explained
the urgent concern that has brought the meditators to his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to go on with our normal lives knowing that
this is happening,'' he said. ``I'm upset by the suffering and
cruelty I see in Kosovo. The world is my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Kuhn, 49, a documentary archivist living in Pepperell,
said she was especially moved by stories of Serbian meditators
traveling across Belgrade, ``while bombs are coming down, to get to
a place where they can create a little island of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Pejcic, ``We meet in the home of Milija and Marija
Petrovic, (meditating) there during the day and sleeping in our own
homes at night. To get there, those who live on the other side of
the river Sava, in Belgrade's center, have to cross the bridge. And
because two bridges already have been bombed, with the threat of
further bombing increasing, many people hardly dare to come. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very painful to understand what's going on. We just know
what a solution is. And we work on that.''
</P>
<P>
   By meditating together, in Watertown as in Belgrade, the group
members say they are creating a more settled, restful environment
that is more conducive to rational decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   For Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic or NATO leaders to
really get the message, these meditators probably would need a much
larger group, they say. But perhaps they can help at least a few
people to shift their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing in Kosovo is because of all the differences people
see. A better answer is to help people see the commonalities, the
unity,'' said Peggy Gurnan, 54, who teaches mathematics at a middle
school in Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something intellectual or abstract,'' she said.
``It's a direct experience of connectedness.''
</P>
<P>
   These peacemakers practice an advanced form of Transcendental
Meditation. They say the technique allows their minds to settle
down so that they contact a field of natural energy and
intelligence, which they say some physicists call the unified field
of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Refining and softening this field in one place, they say, can
have a long-range ameliorating effect somewhere else. And doing it
together makes the effect more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   They know some observers will think their ideas absurd. But
history, they say, supports their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Brown, who wrote a Harvard dissertation on the subject,
said 43 studies have documented a link between this form of
meditation and reductions in conflict and negativity, including a
famous study of warfare in Lebanon published by Yale's Journal of
Conflict Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists who reviewed the work decided they had to publish
it,'' she said. ``They didn't believe it, but they couldn't deny
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her dissertation, Brown documented how most scientific
breakthroughs have been initially greeted by ridicule. People
laughed at the notion that radio waves could transmit sound over
long distances, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Other meditators added that those who preach nonviolence often
are viewed as weak or naive, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget how everyone thought the nonviolent techniques of
the civil rights movement were crazy,'' Kuhn said. This
(Transcendental Meditation) is a second-generation technique.''

 &HT;    TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HONDURANS COULD FACE PERILOUS JOURNEY TO
U.S.
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS

<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Eighteen-year-old Ethelvina Hernandez says
``it was only by the grace of God'' that she survived her swim
across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Other Hondurans may not be as lucky, immigrant advocates fear.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Hurricane Mitch ravaged Central America, the
United States Information Agency, or USIA, is warning that a huge
``second wave'' of illegal immigrants may be headed north from
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The USIA estimates that since the October hurricane some 80,000
Hondurans without U.S. visas have already left Honduras, a country
of 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in spite of reconstruction efforts in their country,
another 170,000 undocumented Hondurans may be bound for the United
States in the coming months, according to a poll conducted in
Honduras at the request of USIA.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted in late February by the CID-Gallup
company of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those numbers are right, this could be one of the deadliest
summers we've had,'' said Charles Roth, a lawyer with Proyecto
Libertad, or Liberty Project, an immigrant advocacy group in the
Rio Grande Valley city of Harlingen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Roth is worried that Hondurans who try to cross the border
illegally during the hot summer months will run up against tough
new U.S. Border Patrol tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol's aim -- along the entire Mexico-United States
frontier -- is to deter illegal immigration by beefing up
surveillance in areas where migrants commonly cross.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley say the strategy
is helping to slow the flow of migrants.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth and other immigrant advocates say people are simply
choosing more isolated and perilous areas to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest examples of this, advocates say, was in
eastern San Diego County, Calif., where eight Mexican migrants
attempting to cross isolated mountains froze to death on April 2.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite entry point for Central Americans trying to cross the
border illegally is the Rio Grande Valley and the Brownsville,
Texas area. It is the shortest route from Central America to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hurricane Mitch destroyed so many businesses and so much
infrastructure in Central America, the United States has offered
more than $300 million in aid to Honduras. It has also agreed to
offer temporary visas to undocumented Hondurans who could prove
they arrived in the United States before Dec. 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cruel irony,'' Roth said, is that no one among the
predicted second wave of migrants that could be headed north now
will qualify under that policy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CID-Gallup poll, however, most people who are
preparing to try to enter the United States believe they will be
allowed to stay even without proper documents.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said Proyecto Libertad still is trying to help Hondurans
who arrived before the Dec. 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Ethelvina Hernandez, who worked in a clothing factory since she
was 15, said she left her home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, shortly
after the hurricane in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan was to find work so she could send money back to her
mother to help rebuild the family home, which was completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother worked so hard for us,'' Hernandez said. ``And in a
matter of five or ten minutes it was all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she is not married and has no children, Hernandez said she
volunteered to head north instead of older siblings. Siblings
already in the United States sent her $3,000, she said, but much of
that was stolen by smugglers before she even left Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   She was terrified, but continued her journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I could turn back after losing $3,000? No, I
wouldn't be able to live with myself,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   She relied mainly on ``the kindness of strangers'' to get her to
the border.
</P>
<P>
   She swam across the Rio Grande near Brownsville and, through
word of mouth, found out about Proyecto Libertad.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's working as a live-in childcare worker in Harlingen,
and trying to save several hundred dollars so she can pay for her
application to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She's counting on letters from people she knows in this area to
help convince the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service she
arrived in the United States before Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Jose Segundo Amaya Vigil, 46, doesn't have that hope.
</P>
<P>
   A tomato farmer from San Pedro Sula, he was caught by the Border
Patrol April 2 -- a day after crossing the Rio Grande -- and is now
jailed at an INS detention center in Port Isabel, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was caught I am grateful to be in the United
States,'' Amaya said. ``I expect to be allowed to stay because I am
an honest man, a hard worker who will stay just as long as the
government here says I can, and then I promise to return home to my
four children.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaya will have to plead his case before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my country,'' he added. ``If I did not, why did I not
come here earlier in life like others do? I am 46. I had a tomato
farm that fed my family. The storm ruined us.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents in the Brownsville area say they haven't
seen a second surge in Central Americans since the first couple of
months following the hurricane. But Hondurans are often among the
largest numbers of people they detain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will turn themselves in when they see us. They
say they heard there were special permits for them in the United
States,'' said Border Patrol Agent Ismael Herrera, who was recently
patrolling the dark green waters of the Rio Grande on a Zodiac
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hondurans with children have been released on their own
recognizance, Herrera said, and given a date to appear before an
INS judge later.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Border Patrol discovered that smugglers were
taking advantage of the policy and repeatedly giving different
people the same baby to carry while they crossed the river.
</P>
<P>
   Four Hondurans have been arrested in connection with the case.

<P>
   Has there been in the last thousand years a single best time to
be alive? In this age of faith in progress, it's easy to answer
quickly: Yes, right now. But does that almost automatic response
stand up to informed comparison with past times?
</P>
<P>
   To answer this question, The New York Times Magazine convened a
panel, moderated by the longtime New York Times columnist Russell
Baker, comprising the following scholars:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Cahill, author of ``The Gifts of the Jews'' and ``How
the Irish Saved Civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Douglas, professor of English and comparative literature
at Columbia, and author of ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in
the 1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elaine Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton, and author
of ``The Origin of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, and
author of ``Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two
American Centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Spence, professor of history at Yale, and author of
``The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL BAKER: None of us are living in this time by choice.
We're here because of somebody else's decision. Maybe, given our
druthers, we would prefer to be somewhere else _ I would bet in
most cases not in the future. The idea is to debate a little about
the ideal time to live in, if you had your own choice.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose some people would say this is the ideal time. I'm
prepared to argue against that, but for the most part I'm here to
listen to your opinions. Mr. Spence, you would probably like to go
back in time?
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN SPENCE: Absolutely. I would be very interested to live
my life in Hangzhou. I know where my villa is going to be: on the
west side of the lake in the hills, looking down on what was then a
totally unpolluted lake, and what was a kind of large and
prosperous rural pleasure resort. A beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: What year is it on the Christian calendar?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: I would be born around 1540. One of the problems here is
I'd like to have a bit of money. I don't want too much, because the
official agents from Beijing would take it away from me. This was
one of the most urbane and cultured times in all of Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
   I've always studied the Manchu Dynasty and modern China and the
revolution, and that was from 1644. But I would like to live in the
Ming Dynasty _ not knowing, of course, that the Ming was going to
fall. So I do need to die shortly before 1644. That was a great
time of scholarship, and it was also a great time for scholarship
for women.
</P>
<P>
   If it's all right, I want to be married to my real-life wife at
the same time, but my Chinese language would be much better in this
life. As a couple, we're always going to be able to play elegant
poetry games, word games that the Chinese have always loved to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And the reading _ the texts about that 16th-century period in
Hangzhou show an amazingly energized society. People read very
widely. It's a magnificent period in painting. The food is
magnificent. It is not a slave society. Booze is available but not
excessive. It's pre-opium, no heavy narcotics. And the distribution
of food in that region is efficient. It was a rich time to live.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: It sounds like a paradise. How about you, Mr. Cahill?
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS CAHILL: Sticking within the confines of the last thousand
years, I find myself drawn to the 14th century. I would love to
have gone to a Christmas party in medieval London with Geoffrey
Chaucer. I would love to have been around when Giotto began to
paint _ this man, influenced by the spiritual realism of Francis of
Assisi, asking himself: What do human beings really look like? And
then trying to make them in that way. I would love to have been
there when Joan of Arc began to muster the troops.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: They burned her.
</P>
<P>
   ELAINE PAGELS: I think that this would be a fascinating journey,
but I'd want to go with a full set of inoculations and an American
passport.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: How long do you want to be present?
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Since this is an intellectual exercise, I think you have
to assume that you're going to be part of the culture of the time.
We'd all like to cruise around and watch Columbus come ashore.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I find it difficult to reduce myself to one spot.
</P>
<P>
   DOUGLAS: But we all are reduced to one spot. And you'd live how
long? Thirty years in about 1390? You'd hardly have time to get
around to see everything you said you wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: In Hangzhou, there were long-lived people, maybe 90 year
olds, edging 100. They also had wonderful food, which didn't even
require teeth! Delicious rice pilaf dishes, soft lotus-root dishes.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Mr. Patterson?
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO PATTERSON: I chose three periods, excluding the period
following the civil rights movement in America. That has obviously
been the best time for Afro-Americans, but sticking to it would rid
the discussion of any fun. Working backward, my third choice would
have been to be a moderately prosperous New England farmer who
lived around 1750 to 1830 _ embracing the Revolutionary period.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been about 26 in 1776, so I would have fought in
the Revolutionary War. I would like to have had the opportunity to
talk intellectually with Madison, to club with Hamilton, to tell
Jefferson what a fraud I thought he was _ that really, it's not
fair that he should have a place in history just because he wrote a
great paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   My second choice is to have lived in Tokugawa, Japan, about the
18th century. I would not want to have been a samurai. By then,
they were no longer warriors; they were basically quasi
bureaucrats. And I wouldn't particularly care for the official
culture that the shogun imposed, although it was quite fascinating
_ those tea ceremonies. They would have been far too restrictive
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to have been a moderately prosperous merchant
around the 1730s, participating in what the Japanese call the
floating world, which is a kind of counterculture to the official
world imposed by the shogunate. They had a ball!
</P>
<P>
   I'd have been drawn to Kabuki dramas, to the fashion, to the way
they subverted the official ideology so that when the shogun said,
``You can no longer wear fancy clothes; you have to wear cotton if
you're a merchant,'' they wore cotton on the outside and silk on
the inside.
</P>
<P>
   I think the life expectancy may well have been much better
living in Japan at that time than in Europe. And it was a very
peaceful period. They threw out the Europeans and were able to
develop their own culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now I come to my first choice. It's in the 14th century. It's a
city-state that produced some of the most beautiful art in the
world. Can you guess?
</P>
<P>
   PAGELS: Siena?
</P>
<P>
   PATTERSON: No. I wouldn't want to be in Renaissance Italy if you
paid me. There were towns where a third to a half of the population
was dropping dead from the plague!

   The little city-state I had in mind would have been the town of
Ife in Yorubaland, in what's now western Nigeria, somewhere about
the mid-to-late 14th century. I would want to have been a sculptor,
one of the people who produced those incredible bronze heads or the
terra-cotta work that you now can see in the British Museum. Again,
the life expectancy would have quite possibly been higher than for
a working man in Europe at that time.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to have been a bourgeois gentleman in Holland
during the golden 17th and early 18th centuries, having your
portrait done by one of their great painters, but they were
involved with the slave trade. The same was true of the British.
</P>
<P>
   You think about being an entrepreneur in late 18th- and
19th-century England. You saw this incredible transformation, the
Industrial Revolution; the steam engine and all the rest. The
trouble is, one can't help thinking about the plight of the
displaced masses and the kids who were being sent down into the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: I wonder if I could change the focus to the idea of
progress. Do we all believe in progress?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: It seems to me it's not so much comfort or progress that
we're talking about; it's those who actually are drawn to live in a
period of extraordinary change and struggle vs. those who, I think,
want a period of enormous cultural subtlety and development.
</P>
<P>
   I tilt toward the latter, a time in which the culture is still
immensely lively, but the idea of progress would not exactly be the
point.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I would speak for progress. We are at the end of the
bloodiest of all centuries, to be sure. And it is not a universal
consciousness, by any means, but I think there is a consciousness
of the necessity for peace.

 Editors: See THE LOCAL ANGLE box below  
 Attention: Idaho, Minnesota, North Dakota  
 &HT;    ___  Forget electricity, the microchip and the car. Without
legumes, we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark Ages. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It is hard to determine a century's most important technological
invention or scientific discovery, not least because our ideas of
the date of a given invention are not clear. There are many things
that readers would list among the most interesting achievements of
this century, when in fact they date from the century before ours:
the automobile, for example, and the skyscraper, the subway, the
dynamo, the turbine.
 &HT;    You can also add the typewriter, the gramophone, the dictaphone,
the sewing machine, the refrigerator, as well as canned foods,
pasteurized milk, the cigarette lighter (along with the cigarette),
the elevator, the washing machine, the eraser, blotting paper, the
electric fan, the safety razor, the Murphy bed, the barber's chair,
the safety match, the raincoat, the safety pin, carbonated
beverages, bicycles with gears and pneumatic tires, the electric
tramway, synthetic fibers and great department stores to sell all
this stuff and _ if I may continue _ electric light, the telephone,
the telegraph, radio, photography and moving pictures.
 &HT;    Furthermore, a calculating machine was invented that could
perform numerous additions in one minute, setting us firmly on the
path toward the computer.
 &HT;    Now rewind to the Middle Ages before the year 1000 A.D. This era
can deservedly be called the Dark Ages because the barbarian
invasions that took place beset Europe for centuries and gradually
destroyed Roman civilization. Cities were deserted, in ruins; the
great highways, neglected, disappeared under a tangle of weeds; and
fundamental techniques were forgotten, including the processes of
mining and quarrying. The land was no longer cultivated and, at
least until the feudal reform of Charlemagne, entire agricultural
areas reverted to forest.
 &HT;    In this sense, the Middle Ages before 1000 A.D. were a period of
indigence, hunger, insecurity. As the population became smaller and
less strong physically, people were mowed down by endemic diseases
(tuberculosis, leprosy, ulcers, eczema, tumors) and by dread
epidemics such as the plague.
 &HT;    It is always risky to venture demographic calculations for past
millennia, but according to some scholars, Europe in the seventh
century had shrunk to roughly 14 million inhabitants; others posit
17 million for the eighth century. Underpopulation combined with
undercultivated land left nearly everyone undernourished.
 &HT;    As the second millennium approached, however, the figures
changed _ the population grew. Some experts calculate a total of 22
million Europeans in 950; others speak of 42 million in 1000. In
the 14th century, Europe's population hovered between 60 million
and 70 million. Though the figures differ, on one point there is
agreement: In the five centuries after the year 1000, Europe's
population doubled, maybe even tripled.
 &HT;    The reasons for Europe's boom are hard to pinpoint; between the
11th and 13th centuries, radical transformations occurred in
political life, in art, in the economy and, as we shall see, in
technology. This new surge of physical energy and of ideas was
evident to those living at the time.
 &HT;    Naturally it can be said that, with the reforms of Charlemagne,
with the construction of the Germanic empire, with the rejuvenation
of cities and the birth of the communes, the economic situation
also improved. But would it not also be possible to say the
opposite, namely that the political situation evolved, the cities
flourished anew, because daily life and working conditions were
improved by something?
 &HT;    In the centuries before 1000, a new triennial system of crop
rotation was slowly adopted, allowing the land to be more fruitful.
But cultivation requires tools and working animals, and on this
front there were breakthroughs too.
 &HT;    Just before the year 1000, horses began to be fitted with iron
horseshoes (up until then, the hooves were bound with cloth) and
with stirrups. The latter, of course, were more for the benefit of
knights than for peasants.
 &HT;    For the peasants, it was the invention of a new kind of collar
for horses, oxen and other beasts of burden that proved
revolutionary. The old collars put all the strain on the animal's
neck muscles, compromising its windpipe. The new collar involved
the chest muscles, increasing the animal's efficiency by at least
two-thirds, and permitting, for certain tasks, horses to replace
oxen (oxen were better suited to the old type of collars, but they
also worked at a slower pace than horses). In the past horses had
been yoked in a horizontal line, now they could be yoked in single
file, significantly increasing their capacity for pulling.
 &HT;    Around this time, plowing methods changed. Now the plow had two
wheels and two blades, one for cutting the earth and the other _
the plowshare _ for turning it over. Though this ``machine'' was
already known to Nordic people as early as the second century B.C.,
it was not until the 12th century that it spread throughout Europe.
 &HT;    But what I really want to talk about is beans, and not just
beans but also peas and lentils. All these fruits of the earth are
rich in vegetable proteins, as anyone who goes on a low-meat diet
knows, for the nutritionist will be sure to insist that a nice dish
of lentils or split peas has the nutritional value of a thick,
juicy steak.
 &HT;    Now the poor, in those remote Middle Ages, did not eat meat,
unless they managed to raise a few chickens or engaged in poaching
(the game of the forest was the property of the lords). And as I
mentioned earlier, this poor diet begat a population that was ill
nourished, thin, sickly, short and incapable of tending the fields.
 &HT;    So when, in the 10th century, the cultivation of legumes began
to spread, it had a profound effect on Europe. Working people were
able to eat more protein; as a result, they became more robust,
lived longer, created more children and repopulated a continent.
 &HT;    We believe that the inventions and the discoveries that have
changed our lives depend on complex machines. But the fact is, we
are still here _ I mean we Europeans, but also those descendants of
the Pilgrim Fathers and the Spanish conquistadors _ because of
beans.
 &HT;    Without beans, the European population would not have doubled
within a few centuries, today we would not number in the hundreds
of millions and some of us, including even readers of this article,
would not exist. Some philosophers say that this would be better,
but I am not sure everyone agrees.
 &HT;    And what about the non-Europeans? I am unfamiliar with the
history of beans on other continents, but surely even without
European beans, the history of those continents would have been
different, just as the commercial history of Europe would have been
different without Chinese silk and Indian spices.
 &HT;    Above all, it seems to me that this story of beans is of some
significance for us today. In the first place, it tells us that
ecological problems must be taken seriously. Secondly, we have all
known for a long time that if the West ate unmilled brown rice,
husks and all (delicious, by the way), we would consume less food,
and better food.
 &HT;    But who thinks of such things? Everyone will say that the
greatest invention of the millennium is television or the
microchip. But it would be a good thing if we learned to learn
something from the Dark Ages too.

strong exporter of dry edible beans. But in pinto beans, exports
dropped 30 percent in 1996. Surging sales to Mexico (up 603

 Editors: See THE LOCAL ANGLE box below  
 &HT;    __  The Bible as civic blueprint ... John Winthrop and the `City
on a Hill'  __
 &HT;    
 &HT;    To consider the most influential sermon of the second Christian
millennium is, for most of us, to think of those larger-than-life
preachers who enjoy a modest immortality in the anthologies and
surveys of American history, literature and religion.
 &HT;    Chief among them is probably Jonathan Edwards, whose sermon
``Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God'' was imposed upon
generations of high school students as an example of Puritan
preaching. Unfortunately, with a single stroke, that sermon has
perhaps managed more than any other to ruin the reputations both of
Puritanism and God.
 &HT;    Today's students of America's ongoing culture wars might point
to Harry Emerson Fosdick's 1923 sermon, ``Shall the Fundamentalists
Win?'' as the defining word in the conflict between liberals and
conservatives for America's soul. And there is not a person alive
today who has not heard, at least in part, Martin Luther King's
1963 elegy on the American dream uttered at the foot of the statue
of Abraham Lincoln.
 &HT;    These three all have their claims upon the American imagination,
but in naming the best sermon of the last 1,000 years, my vote is
for none of them.
 &HT;    Instead, when I think of a definitive sermon I turn to that
formative moment in 1630, when the layman Robert Winthrop, governor
of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, preached to his fellow immigrants,
while still at sea aboard the ship Arbella.
 &HT;    ``Christian Charity: A Model Hereof,'' is what Winthrop called
his sermon, and it would have languished in obscurity, known only
to an elite class of Puritan scholars, were it not for its
felicitous use of a biblical image _ that of the ``city set on a
hill'' _ to describe the moral purpose of the Pilgrims' adventure
into the unknown.
 &HT;    That image, familiar to generations of Christians from Jesus'
``Sermon on the Mount'' in Matthew's gospel, is what gave
Winthrop's sermon life, while also giving a new context to
Matthew's text.
 &HT;    And it provided perhaps the most enduring metaphor of the
American experience, that of the exemplary nation _ the ``city on a
hill'' _ called not to prosperity and private gain but to virtue
and mutual support.
 &HT;    Indeed, when in 1961 John Fitzgerald Kennedy addressed the
Massachusetts legislature as its favorite son and president-elect,
he, son of a different collection of immigrants to the New World,
cited Winthrop's sermon as the text for his new administration.
Ronald Reagan, as Garry Wills reminds us, adopted Winthrop's vision
as his own, with a little help, of course, from speechwriter Peggy
Noonan.
 &HT;    Both Gandhi and Abe Lincoln have been claimed as the moral
tutors for Martin Luther King's ``I Have A Dream,'' his ringing
ideal of the American experience. But I would argue that it was
Winthrop's sermon that was the rhetorical ancestor of King's finest
oration.
 &HT;    True, by standards of contemporary preaching, Winthrop's sermon
is long, argumentative and complex, qualities that give preaching a
reputation for tediousness. It does not read like an inspirational
tract, and there is no appeal to cheap emotion or sensation.
 &HT;    It reads like a lawyer's brief, actually; Winthrop was a lawyer
trying to make the best possible case for the legitimacy of the
Puritan enterprise. He did this on the basis of a new Christian
conscience upon which would be founded a new social contract, the
likes of which the world had not yet seen.
 &HT;    Winthrop's idea of civic virtue was derived not from secular
models of political economy but from the biblical principles of
justice and mercy: ``There are two rules whereby we are to walk one
towards another: justice and mercy.'' These were not abstract
virtues, but social necessities if, in fact, the mixed society of
poor and rich over which he presided was not to fracture into
self-interest groups.
 &HT;    In a less than ideal society, one which Winthrop and his
co-religionists would have understood as fallen, these virtues were
essential to mutual survival and prosperity. And if Massachusetts
was to be an improvement upon experience, the whole of society and
not just the church must be animated by them.
 &HT;    Some have argued that the Puritan ideals of Winthrop were naive
and utopian, suited only for a religious fantasy world of the weak
and like-minded. But what runs through his sermon is a painfully
honest realization of the powerful seductions of self-interest and
ambition.
 &HT;    It is Winthrop's sense of sin that animates his plea for civic
virtue. He understood that a rampant individualism was as dangerous
to the common good as the familiar threats of peril, famine and
pestilence.
 &HT;    When he asks, ``What rule must we observe and walk by in cause
of community peril?'' he answers his own question, ``The same as
before (justice and mercy) but with more enlargement towards others
and less respect toward ourselves.'' And he cites examples of the
primitive church which sold all and held everything in common:
``Neither did any man say that which he possessed was his own.''
 &HT;    Mutuality was the cohesive principle: ``This sensibleness and
sympathy of each other's condition will necessarily infuse into
each party a native desire and endeavor to strengthen, defend,
preserve and comfort the other.''
 &HT;    Having established mutual love as the model of Christian
charity, he summarizes the object of the enterprise: ``The end is
to improve our lives, to do more service to the Lord, the comfort
and increase of the body of Christ whereof we are members, that
ourselves and posterity may be the better preserved from the common
corruptions of this evil world to serve the Lord and work out our
salvation under the power and purity of his holy ordinances.''
 &HT;    Any other course would cause the shipwreck of the new society.
The only way to prevent such a disaster was to ``Follow the counsel
of Micah, to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our
God.
 &HT;    ``For this end we must be knit together in this work as one man,
we must entertain each other in brotherly affection, we must be
willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities. For the supply
of others' necessities we must uphold a familiar commerce together
in all meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality; we must
delight in each other, make others' conditions our own, rejoice
together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having
before our eyes our commission and community in the work ...''
 &HT;    This seems an impossible task for mere human beings. It had not
worked before, and the eyes of the world would look with cynical
interest for the failure of such a noble ambition: ``We shall be as
a city set on a hill, the eyes of all people upon us.''
 &HT;    But failure would be failure for all time, Winthrop intoned, and
so success was the only moral option. The choice was between new
life and old death, and the choice was obvious.
 &HT;    Ending his sermon with the appeal of Joshua to the Israelites as
they stood on the brink of the promised land, Winthrop concludes:
``Therefore, let us choose life, that we and our seed may live by
obeying his voice and cleaving to him, for he is our life and our
prosperity.''
 &HT;    Winthrop's is a layman's vision for a new civil body politic.
Even today, that vision still lives and awaits its fulfillment. A
sermon that is as powerfully relevant to the future as it was at
the moment of its utterance, nearly four centuries ago, and whose
impact can be measured across the nation-states of the world,
deserves not only to be remembered but to be regarded as the
prophetic utterance that it was, and is.

RISK-TAKING ACTRESS LIVES HERMITIC EXISTENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What is reality?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate psychedelic era question is back in vogue again,
what with mind-bending, is-it-real-or-is-it-virtual movies like
``The Matrix,'' ``Open Your Eyes'' and David Cronenberg's latest,
``eXistenZ,'' filling theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The same question applies to ``eXistenZ's'' star, the
professionally provocative, personally subdued Jennifer Jason
Leigh. In her work, she's been as bold as an actress can be, even
in an age when outrageous risks have been a badge of artistic
seriousness. But off screen, the 37-year-old actress is a shy,
bookish homebody whose idea of a good time is playing with her dog,
immersing herself in research and nerding around on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really need to be flamboyant,'' she explains. ``Plus,
I don't have the energy for it, let alone the inclination.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more contradictions. Though she's a child of Hollywood
_ Dad was the late actor Vic Morrow, Mom is screenwriter Barbara
Turner, and she took the middle name as a tribute to family friend
Jason Robards _ the actress has always leaned creatively toward the
independent film movement, especially its most extremely
independent faction. And even on the rare occasions when she's made
studio pictures, Leigh has opted for dramatically interesting over
star-making roles.
</P>
<P>
   From her earliest work as one of TV's first anorexics in ``The
Best Little Girl in the World,'' Leigh has created an indelible
gallery of troubled women. There was one of the movies' most
memorable pregnant teen-agers in ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.''
There have been enough dysfunctional relations to fill a Corleone
family reunion (``Sister, Sister,'' ``Georgia,'' ``Dolores
Claiborne,'' ``Bastard Out of Carolina''), and she's played enough
numbed-out sex workers to stock an escort service (``Miami Blues,''
``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' ``The Men's Club,'' ``Short Cuts''). The
list of self-destructives ranges from ``Single White Female's''
psycho roommate to the brilliant Dorothy Parker (``Mrs. Parker and
the Vicious Circle'') to ``Cabaret's'' Sally Bowles in the hit
Broadway revival.
</P>
<P>
   Having just come off that demanding, audience-interactive
musical _ her first major live theater job _ Leigh looks
particularly waiflike, having chopped off most of the hair she dyed
black for the role. Anything that dark can't be bleached back to
her natural light blond, she explains, so the hair was just one
more sacrifice made for her art.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of dedication, coupled with her willingness to
push the behavioral envelope, that convinced Cronenberg that Leigh
could bring his ``eXistenZ'' to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer playing the lead in this movie was not just about
acting, but the kind of tone and ambience she can create,'' says
Cronenberg, whose films _ ``Dead Ringers,'' ``Videodrome,'' ``Naked
Lunch,'' ``Crash'' _ mix astute philosophical speculation with
alarming, grotesque imagery. ``She can be beautiful and sexy and
glamorous, which she is in this movie, but also nerdy and shy and
withdrawn. She can do all of that stuff totally convincingly and
then morph from one of those moods into the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh agrees that the collaboration with the biotech-obsessed
Cronenberg was a match made in cyberpunk heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's just got such an original vision, full of
extraordinary details,'' she says. ``I love working with people who
really stick by their vision _ and it's something that they want to
do, not something they're hoping to please a bunch of people with.
And sometimes there were three levels of reality going on, which
made it challenging but also lots of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the strange, near-future world of ``eXistenZ,'' which opens
Friday, Leigh plays Allegra Geller, an introvert who blossoms in
the elaborate, make-believe worlds of the best-selling
virtual-reality games she creates. By this time, games have evolved
beyond computer and video screens into semi-organic entities that
plug into players' bioports (insertion jacks mechanically installed
at the base of their spines), so the hallucinatory program can
interact with the players' central nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   This lucrative, addictive technology has entranced millions and
inspired a Realist underground of radicals opposed to people
spending their consciousness in this virtual dream world. They've
put a price on Allegra's head, and with an inexperienced bodyguard
(Jude Law) she tries to escape their assassins both inside and out
of the dimension of her new game, eXistenZ.
</P>
<P>
   Got that? If not, rest assured that there are more twists
involved. Some pretty gross specifics, too, ranging from fleshlike
game pods to a weapon called a gristle gun to the sweet-and-sour
mutant amphibians served in a cyberspace Chinese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurant was pretty disgusting, yeah,'' Leigh admits.
``The stuff on that plate was edible, but it smelled ba-a-ad. Lucky
for me, Jude had to eat most of it _ and he's a vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross or not, Leigh committed to Cronenberg's project fully; so
fully, in fact, she had to sacrifice her part in the last film by
the ultimate independent filmmaker, Stanley Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh had filmed a few scenes with Tom Cruise for the maestro's
two-years-in-the-making erotic thriller ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' But
when the perfectionist director wanted to reshoot them months
later, she was in the middle of ``eXistenZ's'' Canadian production
and could not leave for Kubrick's London set. Her scenes were
reshot with Cruise and another actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge disappointment, but what can you do?'' she says
stoically. ``The thing for me to hold up is that I had the
experience of working with him, and I loved it. That was not
disappointing; he was such a mensch, sweet and nothing like the
stories everyone hears about how he was so hard to work for. He was
quite open, let us improvise; it was so luxurious. He cared so much
and was so smart and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick died in March, hours after completing his final cut of
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' In honor of the secretive genius's wishes,
Leigh refuses to divulge any story information about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   She is thrilled to mention her next project, though, a film
scripted and about to be directed by her mother, in which Leigh
plays a hotel chambermaid who takes way too much interest in the
guests' personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh admits that after creating a wide array of bizarre
characters, finding roles that suit her tastes is getting harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate generic anything because I don't feel anything from
it,'' she says. ``And I don't want to repeat, so I really look for
things that I have an immediate response to and I think are really
interesting. Sure, it's not easy, because I have done a lot. But
choosing roles is not really a cerebral process for me. I just read
something and think, `Oh, I've got to do this character.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh has stuck to her guns throughout a distinctive career and
maintained her personal equilibrium along the way. A lot to be
proud of _ or at least enough to make her feel comfortable about
herself. But Leigh admits that she's still painfully self-conscious
around people, especially when she doesn't have scripted dialogue
to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less nervous about it, but I'm still very shy outside of
work,'' she confesses. ``I am proud of my work and happy about my
life. But I guess I just don't feel that articulate, so I always
feel like I'm not expressing myself in the best, most evocative
manner. All the things I feel proud about in my acting, I don't
think I do justice when I try to describe them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh sells herself short, and you wish she wouldn't. But at the
same time, you don't want her to change anything that keeps her
more interesting than she even realizes. &QL;

 &HT;    Cadillac Voodoo Choir: `We are rock stars'
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For a band that likes to bare its chest hair,
and that gets the award for the local act most likely to see female
fans baring their chests, the five members of Cadillac Voodoo Choir
are actually pretty down-to-earth guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put this in your article and write it as the headline,''
drummer and CVC mouth Taxi Haskell says excitedly, into his third
or fourth cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cadillac Voodoo Choir are rock stars. We are rock stars,
because no one else is doing it these days.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, pay attention to the down-to-earth thing now. Four of the
five members of Cadillac Voodoo Choir are from Atlanta, Ga. They
range in age from the pouty-lipped, Steven Tyler-looking singer
Chad Drummond's 23 years to Haskell's 32. Their first show in
Austin was in front of a couple thousand people two years ago
opening for Ian Moore. It was some intro. A year later, the band
moved to Austin and started opening for the few other local bands
that could draw crowds, like Storyville, the Ugly Americans and
Breedlove. It also hit the road, mostly around Texas, living it up
as if it were Aerosmith traveling in an Econoline. Stories abound
about sexual encounters in Houston and onstage debacles in Abilene.
The word ``humping'' comes up often.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cadillac Voodoo Choir released its first CD,
``Boomtown Flood'' _ a fiery, ambitious album that has since landed
a rock nomination with the independent Grammy Awards _ the group
had earned enough exposure in Austin to be thought of as either the
most happening new local band or the most overblown, ostentatious
rock act that ever took stage at the Saxon Pub (and that's saying a
lot).
</P>
<P>
   It's when they're defending themselves against the latter
sentiment that the members of CVC show their humble side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the reasons we've done so well in Austin is
because we're genuine about what we do,'' said keyboardist Danny
Smith, who, along with Drummond, Haskell and recently reacquired
guitarist Brian Huffman is part of the original CVC lineup that
dates back five years (new bassist Jason Crow is from our area).
``We play the same kind of music we played in Atlanta five years
ago. If we had tried to change to be in line with what's on the
radio, we would have been miserable. We play the kind of music that
we want to play even if it's not the trendy thing right now, and we
put on the kind of show that we want to put on no matter what
anybody says about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell, interjecting as he always does, was quick to address
those who have anything negative to say about CVC 's classic-rock
sound. A band that falls and occasionally stumbles somewhere
between the Stones, the Allman Brothers, Aerosmith and James Brown,
they of course are inundated with comparisons to a fellow Atlanta
band, referred to several times in our interview as
``you-know-who.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a band from where we're from, and having the influences
that were practically shoved down our throats for better or worse,
how could we not sound like `said band?' '' Haskell said. ``That's
like being a band from Austin and not saying Stevie Ray Vaughan
influenced you. It would be a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the post-script of our interview, after the tape
recorder was off, that Haskell finally said you-know-who's name for
the first time. It was also the first time he put down his
rock-star guard and showed his unassuming side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for not comparing us to the Black Crowes,'' Haskell
said, pointing out to me that I hadn't actually said the band's
name, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard thing for a band. Rock 'n' roll is about 49 percent
idolatry, and to play music from the heart and perform on stage in
a way that seems natural, musicians want to do it like their
heroes. If CVC is guilty of anything, it's that they do it too
well.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell is right, though, Cadillac Voodoo Choir deserves more
than a Black Crowes comparison, probably as much as the Crowes
deserved more than the Stones. During our interview, an Otis
Redding disc came over Shady Grove's outdoor speakers and Drummond
_ quiet the rest of the interview _ sang along to himself. Songs
like ``Red Dress'' and ``You'' on the CVC's album show off his and
Smith's affection for R&AMP;B and soul. Haskell repeatedly mentions the
Georgia Satellites and Mother's Finest, barroom-style Southern
groups heard in his group's songs such as ``New Age'' and
``Treehouse Blues.''The overall mix on the album is at times
unique, with horn parts thrown in and special attention paid to
rhythm. There may be more spunk than original spark to the group,
but it's a lot of spunk.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, maybe the members of Cadillac Voodoo Choir shouldn't
concern themselves so much with the originality thing. For a band
said to have several labels knocking at its door, a band with so
many female groupies purportedly in its reach, there are more
important things to focus on. Before he let down his guard, Haskell
seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can handle the Stones or Aerosmith comparisons,'' he said.
``These are the bands we admire. Those guys hold the torch, and let
me tell you, there are five guys from Atlanta and Austin who are
going, `Can I hold that for a while?'

 &HT;    Cancer support group channels energy into cookbook
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Erica McVicker's co-workers liked her better bald than
wearing the wig that gave her a big headache.
</P>
<P>
   And her sister was kind enough to listen to all the medical
jargon when McVicker was too overwhelmed to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a diagnosis of breast cancer three years ago, the
Atlanta resident needed a way to listen and vent to women who could
understand her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But a support group?
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of going and sitting in a room with other women
with breast cancer was just too heart-wrenching for me,'' McVicker,
45, said.
</P>
<P>
   What she found instead is electronic communication with women
from Alabama to Australia who've found many other common interests,
including food, and have just published a fund-raising cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   McVicker's sister, Susan Antinori, also of Atlanta, found
Sapient Health Network, a Web site (now www.webmd.com) that offers
information on many chronic medical conditions and online chatting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's a stranger when you go on the board there. You can go
in, or you don't have to. You can stay away for three weeks. People
ask about you but they know you need the downtime,'' McVicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of treatment for more than two years, the systems
administrator for the Bondurant, Mixson &AMP; Elmore law firm continues
to check in with her online friends, many of whom she has met in
person.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the chat group had its second face-to-face meeting.
When McVicker told friends and family of her plans to go to
Memphis, Tenn., she said some wondered about the safety of
in-person meetings with people met online. Others wondered aloud:
``Are you going to sit around and be morose and show your scars?''
</P>
<P>
   What she found, instead, were instant friendships and a
surprising dose of humor, hope and curiosity about the women's
condition. Food, too, seemed to be a constant topic _ perhaps
because they are women, many with families to nourish, McVicker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their energies were funneled into a cookbook, ``Hope, Laughter &AMP;
Delicious Dishes.'' The just-published book has more than 450 of
their best recipes, plus 35 of their breast cancer stories of hope.
Profits from the book will raise money for the Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation, which funds research and awareness
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to talking about it and wanted to do a little
something, maybe, to say we're doing our part to get rid of this
nasty disease,'' Sue Biley said.
</P>
<P>
   Members worldwide sent recipes and stories to Biley in Iowa, who
added many of her own and sent them along to Sharon Ann Basile in
New Jersey, who got them ready for publication.
</P>
<P>
   For McVicker and others whose stories are included in the book,
the support has been invaluable. The only negative, she says, is
watching as more and more women are diagnosed and come to the Web
site looking for information and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day new people are asking for help to deal with this
aspect of chemo or radiation, to ask, `Are my eyelashes going to
go, too?' Or, `Is there anybody out there like me?'''
</P>
<P>
   There is, she assures.

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A Jasper County judge agreed Tuesday to watch
more than 11 hours of videotaped newscasts and review piles of
newspapers before deciding whether the second capital murder trial
in the dragging death of a black man should be moved.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Monte Lawlis said he would announce his
decision Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., a 32-year-old ex-con from Sulphur
Springs, is set to go on trial May 17. He is one of three white men
accused of beating James Byrd Jr., chaining him by the ankles and
dragging him behind a pickup truck last June 7. Byrd, a 49-year-old
divorced father of three, was decapitated when his head slammed
into a culvert. His dismembered body was dumped in the middle of
the road outside a rural black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's co-defendant and fellow white supremacist, John William
``Bill'' King, 24, was convicted in Jasper earlier this year and
sentenced to death. The third man, 24-year-old Shawn Berry, will be
tried later.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's change of venue hearing, originally scheduled for
Monday, was postponed one day to avoid coinciding with the
anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the 1993 Branch
Davidian fire near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   That anniversary date, along with a threat by a racist Texas
prison inmate that there would be more violence in Jasper on April
19, prompted some parents to keep their children home from school
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a small group of media outside the courthouse, the
town of 8,000 was quiet on Tuesday, and school officials said the
1,080 students, nearly a third of the town's enrollment, who were
absent Monday were back in class Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As he was escorted to the front door of the Jasper County
Courthouse, a handcuffed Brewer, wearing khaki slacks, a white
shirt and a bulletproof vest, faced the photographers and held up a
handmade sign fashioned from a manila envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the lady folk who are mothers: Happy Mother's Day,'' it
said. It was signed ``Russell,'' with the outline of a heart and
the initials ``TMP'' for Tammy Perritt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my girlfriend,'' he told reporters in the courtroom,
handing over the sign for closer inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Perritt, who sat in the courtroom with a friend, Kara Pruitt,
approached the rail during a break and hugged and kissed Brewer for
several minutes. John Brewer, 27, patted his brother's arm and his
head as the defendant buried his face in his girlfriend's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray called the
exchange and Brewer's sign a defense tactic to ``invoke sympathy
and to humanize'' the defendant, but Brewer's lawyers denied that
they had put him up to the publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's court-appointed attorney, Doug Barlow of Beaumont,
asked the judge to review videotapes, Internet stories and
newspapers from as far away as the Caribbean islands before making
a decision.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered one witness to support his contention that a
Jasper County jury would feel pressured to ``vindicate'' their
community and cleanse its tarnished reputation by convicting Brewer
and giving him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the people of Jasper County would like to be as
fair as possible,'' said Melody Celli, an advertising and media
consultant from Beaumont. ``But with the media microscope they've
been under, I don't believe they could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called seven witnesses during the hearing who
testified that county residents could judge Brewer's case on the
facts and could acquit Brewer if the state fails to prove its case
against him.
</P>
<P>
   He said later that the county should have no problem calling 500
potential jurors. Of those, he said he expects ``175 to 200 bodies
to show up'' when jury selection begins.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's not enough for a lawyer to say I want it moved out of
here. It's not enough to say there was a lot of publicity. You've
got to prove facts,'' Gray said after the hearing. ``We put people
on the stand who have credibility and have actually talked to
people in the county and we asked them their opinions on whether he
can get a fair trial. Every one of them said he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow said he also tried to get local people to testify in
favor of moving the trial to Beaumont or some other city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are very reluctant to come forward. No one really wants
to sign on board to testify in this case,'' he said. ``If this case
does not set the standard'' for moving a trial, Barlow added,
``then there is no standard.''

 &HT;    Suspect indicted in Georgia church fires case
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 36-year-old Indiana man was indicted Tuesday for
setting fire to three rural churches in North Georgia over the
Christmas and New Year's Day holidays, including one that took the
life of a volunteer firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ballinger of Youngstown, Ind., has been in custody in
Indianapolis since February for allegedly setting seven fires in
southern Indiana. Authorities do not believe there was any racial
motivation for the arsons; instead, the suspect started the fires
simply because the churches ``had a religious purpose,'' said
Richard Deane, the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has been well aware of a string of church fires in
the South and in other parts of the country, which has created a
justified sense of danger and concern for many who attend churches
of all denominations and backgrounds,'' Deane said. Concerns over
church fires prompted the formation in 1996 of a federal task force
to investigate any suspected arsons at houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-count indictment charging Ballinger with seven Indiana
fires was returned Tuesday, at the same time he was formally
charged in Atlanta with three counts of arson and three counts of
destroying religious property. Ballinger came to the attention of
investigators in Indiana after he was hospitalized for burns in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to pursue the death
penalty against Ballinger for the death of the firefighter Kenneth
Loy Williams, 27, of Bold Springs, Ga. Williams was killed in the
New Year's Eve fire at the 100-year-old New Salem Methodist Church
in Banks County, Ga. when the fellowship hall roof collapsed on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Deane said Ballinger will be brought to Georgia ``as
expeditiously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger also is charged in Georgia with setting fire to
Amazing Grace Baptist Church in Murray County on Dec. 23, and the
Mountain View Baptist Church in Murray County on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Two other North Georgia churches also burned during the holidays
_ the Johnson United Methodist Church in Oconee County on Jan. 1
and the Sardis Full Gospel Church in Walton County near Between on
Christmas morning. Ballinger is not charged in those fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other arsons continue to be the source of investigation,''
Deane said.
</P>
<P>
   All five churches in Georgia were small, rural and more than 75
years old. Four of the fires were started about 1 a.m. in the
pulpit area by someone who broke into the churches, investigators
have said.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech football coach relegated to sidelines
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech football coach George O'Leary will have
to coach the 1999 opener at Navy from the press box instead of from
the sidelines, because of an NCAA infraction.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, found guilty of a secondary violation, also will be
barred from coaching in the team's final scrimmage Saturday and
from recruiting off campus next month. Georgia Tech was informed
Tuesday by the NCAA committee on infractions of the sanctions for
providing former player C.J. Williams with a loan.
</P>
<P>
   The coach was out of the office and could not be reached for
comment But athletic director Dave Braine said he hopes that the
ruling ends the matter, which became public in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be disappointed if it did not,'' Braine said. ``I think we
have gone overboard in our handling of this. We've taken care of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary gave Williams, a running back 1993-96, a loan of $200 to
$400 to cover dorm-room damage expenses in spring 1996. According
to the school's internal investigation, Williams needed to pay a
fine within two hours in order to enroll, and the loan was repaid
within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of NCAA rules to provide assistance to
athletes not available to the general student body. However, the
NCAA found that O'Leary's action was not a major violation, which
could have led to probation for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no recruiting advantage involved,'' Braine said.
``The only reason George made the loan was to help the young man
register for class. C.J. was already at Georgia Tech, there was a
timing factor with C.J. coming to George at the last minute, and
the loan was repaid promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   After the NCAA notified Tech in January 1988 that it was looking
into the matter, Tech hired the law firm Long Aldridge &AMP; Norman to
investigate and filed a report with the infractions committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved that the committee agreed with our finding that
the violation was secondary in nature,'' Braine said. ``This keeps
alive the fact that Georgia Tech is one of the few schools in the
nation that has never been on probation in any sport.''

 &HT;    STANLEY CUP CAPSULES
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH VS. NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   Records: Pittsburgh 38-30-14, third in Atlantic; New Jersey
47-24-11, first in Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Pittsburgh 6-10-6, New Jersey 15-4-3
</P>
<P>
   Season series: New Jersey won 4-1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: Pittsburgh is 60-44 with two Stanley Cups;
New Jersey is 41-34 with one Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: The Devils turned into a more wide-open team this
season under coach Robbie Ftorek and set an NHL record with 28 road
wins; they were 28-10-3 on the road, 19-14-8 at home. Goalie Martin
Brodeur rebounded after a slow start and has a 1.84 playoff GAA.
New Jersey shouldn't have a problem against the Penguins, whose
best player (Jaromir Jagr) has been feuding with their coach (Kevin
Constantine). The Pens' power play is successful at only 17.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: New Jersey in six games.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO VS. OTTAWA
</P>
<P>
   Records: Buffalo 37-28-17, fourth in Northeast; Ottawa 44-23-15,
first in Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Buffalo 9-8-5, Ottawa 10-5-7.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Ottawa won 1-0-4.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: Buffalo is 28-32; Ottawa is 8-10.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Enjoy goals? You might want to turn away. Buffalo's
Dominik Hasek and Ottawa's Ron Tugnutt figure to keep scoring to a
minimum, as evidenced by the last three meetings _ all 1-1 ties.
All five meetings this year went into overtime. The Senators were
winless in their final four (0-1-3) to blow a chance for the best
record in the conference, but were outscored only 6-4 in those
games. Each team has a 40-goal scorer _ Ottawa's Alexei Yashin,
Buffalo's Miroslav Satan _ but the Senators' overall speed should
be the difference. However, all predictions involving Hasek are
subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Ottawa in six games.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON VS. CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Records: 39-30-13, third in Northeast; Carolina 34-30-18, first
in Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Boston 13-6-3, Carolina 7-8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Even 2-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: Boston is 28-39; Carolina/Hartford is 5-8.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Boston and Greensboro, N.C., are at opposite ends of
the spectrum in terms of hockey interest. The Hurricanes probably
won't even sell out their scaled-down capacity of 11,000 in their
temporary home. Just as well. Carolina enters the playoffs as a No.
3 seed for winning the Southeast but has the conference's
eighth-best record. They will get Keith Primeau back from a back
injury but are without injured defenseman Sean Hill. The Bruins
surprisingly struggled against Carolina this year but enter with
one of the league's hottest goalies (Byron Dafoe) and best
postseason coaches (Pat Burns). Boston is superior in penalty
killing (89.2 to 85.3) and power play (17.7 to 11.0).
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Boston in five games.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA VS. TORONTO
</P>
<P>
   Records: Philadelphia 37-26-19, second in Atlantic; Toronto
45-30-7, first in Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Toronto 11-9-2, Philadelphia 7-9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Philadelphia won 3-1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: Philadelphia is 29-22 with one finals
appearance; Toronto is 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: The ``good'' news for Flyers fans is that Eric
Lindros _ he of the recent collapsed lung and severe blood loss _
still believes he will be able to return later in the playoffs. The
bad news is that Philly might not make it past the first round.
Despite its success against Toronto this season, the Maple Leafs
have a big edge in goaltending (Curtis Joseph vs. the Flyers' John
Vanbiesbrouck) and have been the healthier and stronger team down
the stretch. Philly's best scorer, John LeClair, has been slowed by
back problems and Mark Recchi is coming off a concussion. Home ice
could be key: Flyers were 21-9-11 at home but only 16-17-8 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Toronto in six games.
</P>

 &HT;    Sears retirees plan to protest cuts in life insurance at annual
meeting
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An angry group of retired employees from Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. is gearing up to take on Chief Executive Arthur
Martinez next month in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Sears retirees gathered Tuesday at First Baptist
Church in Decatur to plan a protest at the company's annual
shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for May 13 at the Atlanta
Apparel Mart. The Atlanta group is taking part in a nationwide
fight by thousands of retirees who are trying to restore the value
of life insurance policies cut by Sears in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sears reduced life insurance benefits from an average of $17,000
to $5,000 as part of a cost-cutting effort. The cut, which affects
84,000 retirees, spurred hundreds of protests nationwide and led to
the formation of a National Association of Retired Sears Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the mistakes Sears has made, the worst mistake was
losing 84,000 of its best friends,'' said Clifton Hooks, who flew
in from Michigan to help rally the Atlanta protest. ``We had a love
affair with Sears until they tried to take what was rightfully
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits had been part of retirement packages for 50 years.
Retirees say they paid into the program for 10 years or more before
they retired and were promised throughout their careers that life
insurance benefits would stay intact.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears, which has battled consumer
lawsuits and financial trouble in recent years, said the cuts are
needed to keep the company competitive. The company said it was
spending almost twice as much as competitors on retiree benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In their 15-month campaign, the retirees have mustered support
from 221 local retiree clubs in 49 states. The national
organization says it represents 133,000 retirees, including about
1,000 in metro Atlanta. Up to 300 protesters could show up at the
annual meeting in Atlanta, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees have also taken their fight to court. In January, a
U.S. District Court in Illinois granted class-action status to a
lawsuit against Sears filed by a former store manager.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ In his 50s, Arnaldo Hernandez still moves with an
easy, athletic stride, his long arms swinging in graceful arcs, the
same way they did in 1969, when he pulled off the rare feat of
playing all nine positions for one of this country's fabled
baseball teams, the Villa Clara Azucareros.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez is long past his playing days, and because he came
of age at the start of Fidel Castro's 40-year Cold War with the
United States, he was never given a chance in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fate, though, has paid him back handsomely for that misfortune,
because the aging Cuban pitcher has two sons pitching in the major
leagues. Orlando Hernandez won a World Series ring on the 1998
Yankees and Livan was the most valuable player in the 1997 World
Series as a right-hander for the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be a big leaguer,'' Hernandez said in an
interview in a cafe on a Havana rooftop earlier this month. ``What
I couldn't do, my two sons have done. I'm proud. In fact, I think
proud is too small a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnaldo Hernandez does not pretend to be a perfect man or to
have conducted himself as an exemplary father. He has left more
than one wife, remarrying and moving to another city. And he is
honest and modest enough to concede that he did not personally
train the two pitchers when they were boys, instead leaving that up
to the government's baseball academies.
</P>
<P>
   But the father nevertheless instilled in his sons a deep love
and commitment to baseball, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they saw was a glove, a ball, a bat,'' he
said. ``This talent comes partly from me, but there is a part that
comes from the will to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   That will to succeed included the daring to escape Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Livan left first, deserting the Cuban national team in
Monterrey, Mexico, on Sept. 27, 1995, and signing with the Marlins.
Two years later, Orlando fled after he had been suspended from
Cuban baseball on charges that he had planned to defect like his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Livan, who at 22 became the youngest pitcher to start a World
Series game, won two games as the Marlins outlasted the Indians.
Orlando, who was signed by the Yankees soon after he arrived in
March 1998, was standing on the steps of New York's City Hall with
a World Series title under his belt eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   But their stories really begin long before, on the bedraggled
diamonds of Cuba, where they learned their craft at the hands of
trainers of their father's generation.
</P>
<P>
   And the elder Hernandez at least helped shape them.
</P>
<P>
   He played the game hard for 14 years, until an injury finally
sidelined him in 1979. He won four national championships and
finished with a .282 batting average. It was the elder Hernandez
who first earned the moniker, El Duque, for his magnanimous
behavior in the clubhouse in the 1970s. After retiring from play,
the original El Duque coached teams in La Isla de Juventud and Las
Tunas in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left his first wife, Maria Julia Pedroso, when Orlando
and his older brother were 5 and 6 years old. But he maintained a
relationship with the boys, and when Orlando became a teen-ager, he
went to live with his father in La Isla de la Juventud. Arnaldo was
managing the Isla's top-tier club.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said it then that he persuaded Orlando that he had a
good enough arm to become a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a shortstop, but I told him he had to be a
pitcher,'' he recalled. ``I saw that in La Isla, he was not going
to become a player, so I sent him back to Havana, to the baseball
academy, with Pedro Chavez, a famous player and a friend of mine,
and they accepted him and he started working as a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only so much advice the new El Duque would listen to.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Duque is the kind of person that you can tell him he should
do something, but he will try to test it himself first,'' Hernandez
said. ``If it gives him results, he will follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez played a more influential role in Livan's life. Livan
was born to Hernandez's second wife, Mirami Carera, in 1976, in
Villa Clara. He was a rotund little boy, but his father saw
potential in his agile movements and encouraged him to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never thought he would be a pitcher,'' Hernandez said.
``When he was little, he was fat, fat, fat. People told me I would
have a great cook on my hands. I told them he was a great
ballplayer.''

   Livan lived with his father until he was 10. By then, Hernandez
was coaching a team of teen-agers in Las Tunas. But he, never
feeling entirely comfortable coaching his own boys, sent Livan off
to a superior program in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sincerely, I never trained a son of mine, because even if they
had talent, the whole world would say, no, he's playing because
he's your son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys rose quickly in the Cuban baseball world, becoming
aces on the Cuban national team. By the mid-1990s, Orlando had
become the most popular pitcher in Havana, while his brother was a
star on the Santa Clara team.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed four years ago when Livan was first contacted
by a Miami agent for players, Joe Cubas, while he was training with
the national team in Japan, the elder Hernandez said. Livan
confided in his father, saying he had been contacted by a big
league team and was thinking of defecting. Orlando had advised
Livan not to go, but the elder Hernandez, having spent his best
years isolated in Cuba, felt a tug of sympathy for Livan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I wouldn't oppose it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livan walked away from the team while playing an exhibition game
in Monterrey in September. The defection hurt Orlando more than
anyone else, his father said. The authorities summarily suspended
him from baseball, accusing of him of plotting his own escape.
Family members said Orlando felt cornered, unable to practice the
sport that meant more to him than anything. In late 1997, he
decided to risk a forbidden crossing of the Straits of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to help him, and encourage him, because here he could
do nothing,'' the elder Hernandez recalled. ``Here they had
unjustly suspended him, for life, and he was born to play
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Hernandez said, he doesn't have much to do. He helps
his youngest son, Marlon, 14. ``The boy has a rock for an arm,'' he
said, slapping his own right arm.
</P>
<P>
   He also dreams of the day when he might make a trip to America
to see his older sons play in person. He says he speaks to Orlando
from time to time on the telephone. He has been trying to get a
tourist visa, as well as permission from the Cuban authorities to
travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until those documents are in hand, he is condemned to daydreams
about sitting in the stands and watching his sons take on big
league players. His only solace is an occasional televised
broadcast at a tourist hotel. He spends most of the North American
baseball season in hotel bars, hoping to persuade a friendly
bartender to let him see a game with the Marlins or the Yankees on
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to a hotel and I ask for a beer and I watch,'' he said,
shrugging sadly.

IN ITS DEBUT, A BIG PRIZE FOR FREEDOM HELPS WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Calif., Uruguay)   (bl)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lannan Foundation of Santa Fe, N.M., announced Tuesday that
it would give its first $250,000 Prize for Cultural Freedom to
Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano. As part of the award, one of the
cultural world's largest monetary prizes, the foundation will also
donate $100,000 to three charities of Galeano's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Galeano, 58, is best known for his trilogy, ``Memory of Fire,''
which consists of poetic vignettes about the history of the
Americas and indigenous peoples. It won the American Book Award in
1989. In 1974 he fled Uruguay after protesting government violence
and corruption. After a coup in Argentina, Galeano fled again, to
Spain, where he lived until he returned to Uruguay in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In a representative passage in ``Faces and Masks,'' the second
book in the trilogy, Galeano writes of the death of the
19th-century naturalist Aime Bonpland, who knows ``that ants and
people will not stop being born; that there will be new clover
leaves and new oranges or suns on the branches; and that foals,
newly upright on their mosquito legs, will be stretching out their
necks in search of a teat. The old man bids farewell to the world
as a child does to the day at bedtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which is family-run, said that the prize
recognized those ``whose extraordinary and courageous work
celebrates the human right to freedom of imagination, inquiry and
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation president J. Patrick Lannan Jr. said: ``We think he's
a great writer. Galeano has had a much greater impact than just the
field of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Galeano began publishing political commentary and cartoons in a
Uruguayan socialist weekly at the age of 13. Later, he became
director of the daily Epoca and editor in chief of the University
Press of Montevideo. Reached by telephone in San Antonio, he said
that the charitable portion of his award would go to three
Uruguayan institutions, the Cinemateca Uruguaya, for promotion of
animation cinema; the Fundacion Vivian Trias, which promotes
readings and discussions in history and politics, and the political
and cultural weekly magazine Brecha.
</P>
<P>
   Lannan said that when he called Galeano with the news of the
award, ``he was incredulous. In fact, it wasn't clear initially how
much money I was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really have a great statement,'' Lannan said. ``He
was just very, very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Galeano said that his new book, to be published in English next
year by Holt Metropolitan, was titled ``Upside Down.'' He described
it as ``a portrait of the world at the end of the millenium.'' The
book is in the same vein as ``Memory of Fire,'' he said, ``about a
world that despises honesty but ill treats work and workers and
rewards lack of scruples.''
</P>
<P>
   With assets of about $220 million, the Lannan Foundation has
given away $70 million since 1986. It gives away $12 million to $14
million yearly, for programs including its Literary Awards, ranging
from $75,000 to $100,000 each, and grants for new and experimental
art and recently, for indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   In the past the foundation has given money to projects that had
difficulty getting support elsewhere because of their political
content. In March, after the National Endowment for the Arts
withdrew a grant for an English translation of a children's book
written by the Mexican guerrilla leader known as Subcommandante
Marcos, the foundation donated $15,000 for the project. When the
Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington canceled an exhibition of
Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs in 1989, the
foundation gave $35,000 to the Washington Project for the Arts to
exhibit them.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was begun in 1960 by Lannan's father, the son of
an Irish cabinetmaker. He had made a fortune as an investor and was
a director of International Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Corp. Two years
ago the foundation moved from Los Angeles to Santa Fe, where it is
housed in three 19th-century buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Recently it announced it was taking a one-year hiatus to rethink
its mission, though it will support continuing projects like the
writers' awards and grants to American Indians. Lannan said that in
the future the Cultural Freedom Prize might not go to someone in
the arts but rather ``to someone in indigenous populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize awarded to Galeano is among the largest of its kind.
Among family foundations, the Heinz Family Foundation also gives an
annual $250,000 award, primarily for humanitarian aid efforts. The
Nobel Prize in Literature is worth close to $1 million.

RUSSIA EASES OFF ON OPPOSITION TO KOSOVO BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia is still angry about NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia. But suddenly, the chill is gone _ or at least some of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it seemed every time a senior Russian official
expressed opposition to NATO's airstrikes, some ominous threat
would follow: retargeting its nuclear weapons, joining a loose
federation with Yugoslavia, readying warships for the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin turned down the temperature this week. While
continuing to denounce the airstrikes, Moscow is no longer
underscoring that World War III is imminent. The change comes as
former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's new envoy
for talks on the Kosovo crisis, has taken the lead in crafting the
tone of Russia's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who has a personal relationship with many Western
leaders from his more than five years as Russian premier, on Sunday
ruled out a Russian military response to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While reiterating that Russia wants the airstrikes against
Yugoslavia stopped, Chernomyrdin has signaled that Moscow may be
ready to coordinate with the West and put pressure on Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions for a halt to
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is widely believed to have gotten the job for
domestic reasons. Commentators say President Boris N. Yeltsin,
using one of his favored tactics, was looking to stem the steadily
rising influence of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov by replacing
him with Chernomyrdin as Russia's point man on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, the change has had a pronounced effect.
Primakov has made a career of opposing US initiatives as a way to
improve Russia's international stature. His ``peace mission'' to
Belgrade last month, accompanied by Russian army and intelligence
chiefs, looked more like a gesture of political and military
support for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolic of Primakov's approach to the Balkan crisis was the
U-turn he made the night NATO airstrikes began, turning his plane
to Washington back to Moscow in haughty protest that won praise at
home but set the stage for confrontation between Russia and the
West. Since then, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has issued a steady
stream of Cold War-style rhetoric to denounce NATO's airstrikes,
while denying Western charges of ethnic cleansing of Kosovar
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Communist and Nationalist politicians have called for Moscow to
get involved militarily to help Yugoslavia, a fellow Slav and
Orthodox Christian state. Last Friday Yeltsin warned NATO
escalation could drag Russia into fighting and lead to a third
world war. The Kremlin also said Yeltsin supported a Yugoslav
effort to join the loose Russian-Belarus union.
</P>
<P>
   The Slavic alliance is a popular idea in Russia, but there are
signs the Kremlin is beginning to worry that uniting with
Yugoslavia would spoil Moscow's credibility as a potential peace
broker in the crisis. Tuesday, Yeltsin backed away from the idea of
an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complicated matter,'' Yeltsin's spokesman quoted
the president as saying. ``Haste will do no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also tempered his daily criticism of NATO with an appeal
to regional governors not to let anti-American sentiments get out
of hand. ``We must not overdo it,'' the president told 19 governors
at a suburban retreat. ``Russia is part of Europe and cannot afford
to isolate itself from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A hint of Russia's new approach Tuesday was also offered by
Alexy II, patriarch of Russia's Orthodox Church. At a service
Tuesday in Belgrade Alexy II condemned NATO's bombardment. But he
also urged Serbs to do all they could to help ethnic Albanians
return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, meanwhile, Tuesday met with the leaders of Georgia
and Azerbaijan, and Wednesday is scheduled to visit Ukraine. All
three countries have protested the Slavic Union idea. All three
maintain a partnership with NATO, and their presidents will attend
the alliance's 50th anniversary celebrations in Washington this
week. Russia suspended its relationship with NATO over the
airstrikes, but Chernomyrdin's trip indicates Russia's desire to
minimize its differences with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's close ties with Russia's powerful state gas
company Gazprom give him added leverage in his negotiations. His
close relationship with Vice President Al Gore implies better
coordination between Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that will matter if Chernomyrdin's peace efforts
fail. The possibility of a NATO ground war remains a serious
concern among the Russian leadership _ both Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Monday that NATO ground troop
operations in Serbia would escalate the war.
</P>
<P>
   If Chernomyrdin cannot forge a deal that halts the conflict,
Moscow's war of words could return in full force.

<P>
   An imperceptible mist of toxic chemicals in the air we breath
exposes the majority of New Englanders to an elevated risk of
cancer, including perhaps 4,500 who will develop some form of the
disease as a result, according to a groundbreaking new report by a
national environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Environmental Defense Fund estimates that 360 of
every million Americans develop cancer as a result of these air
toxics, many of which are unfamiliar to the general public. But
rates vary widely from cities such as New York, where the rate is
four times the national average, to rural Essex County, Vt., which
is five times below the average.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of urban Connecticut and Massachusetts face this
region's greatest risks from these chemicals, according to the
report, thanks largely to motor vehicle tailpipes. The most
contaminated counties in New England, Fairfield County, Conn., and
Essex County, Mass., lay along major transportation routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers show that cars, trucks and small businesses tend
to be responsible much more of the nation's air toxicity than is
generally recognized,'' said David Roe, attorney for the New
York-based Environmental Defense Fund. ``Up to now, lack of
information has meant lack of attention to some of the biggest
causes of toxic air.''
</P>
<P>
   Although environmental officials have long targeted air
pollution such as summertime smog, the new report looks at a less
well understood part of the problem: the poisoning that occurs from
exposure to 148 different chemicals, many with obscure names such
as 1,3-butadiene, produced by motor vehicles, industry smokestacks
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   States don't regularly test for most of these air toxics, and
scientists are unsure of all their effects.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, federal and state officials, along with fellow
environmentalists, praised the Environmental Defense Fund report,
posted on the internet at www.scorecard.org, as a powerful new tool
that will allow people to get detailed information on the
contaminants in their local air and compare it to other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critically important that we get this issue on people's
radar screens. This is the first time that we and the public have
had any real numbers,'' said John DeVillars, regional administrator
for the US Environmental Protection Agency. ``Imperfect as the
numbers may be, they nevertheless demonstrate that this is a
significant problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Defense Fund report actually completes a job
begun by EPA researchers who calculated the levels of air toxics in
every census tract in the country, using 1990 pollution estimates.
But, under attack from urban mayors and scientists who questioned
whether the report was reliable, the EPA did not release their
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Environmental Defense Fund obtained the EPA
research through a freedom of information request, and found that
the 1990-based pollution estimates were still generally accurate
today. The environmentalists then used federal guidelines to
estimate the risks from breathing these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government created this information, but in some
ways, was frightened by its power,'' said Jason Grumet, executive
director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management
in Boston, which advises states on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Today, EPA agrees that its ``Cumulative Exposure Project'' is
generally not outdated, based on limited monitoring for air toxics
around the country. However, they say their pollution estimates are
not reliable below the county level.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Defense Fund report is ultimately an
indictment of motor vehicles, which account for 60 percent of the
cancer and non-cancer risks from air toxics across the country.
Only one of the top five hazardous chemicals _ a banned dry
cleaning fluid called carbon tetrachloride _ is not found in
tailpipe exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to New York City, which has the highest air toxics
levels, New England's air is relatively clean. Only Connecticut
(420 cancers per million residents) and Massachusetts (370 cancers
per million residents) had cancer risks that exceeded the national
average, while residents of Maine faced a risk of cancer from air
toxics that is about half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the country's most contaminated places, the risks of
breathing are negligible compared to other high hazard activities
such as cigarette smoking. Nearly 150,000 of every million
cigarette smokers will die of cancer as a result of their habit.
</P>
<P>
   However, compared to the federal goal of providing clean air to
breath, the United States is failing. Almost 6 million people in
Massachusetts alone and 220 million people nationally live in
neighborhoods where the lifetime risk of cancer is at least 100
times the goal spelled out in the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   For New England, all those air toxics translate into roughly
4,500 cancers among current residents, led by the 2,200 cancers in
Massachusetts and 1,400 in Connecticut, according to the report. In
addition, the region's residents face a significant but harder to
quantify risk of diseases other than cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, many of the policies that states and federal
agencies are pursuing against smog and other forms of pollution are
also expected to help reduce toxics, said DeVillars of EPA. For
example, EPA will soon require cleaner cars and cleaner fuel
nationally , while the state of Massachusetts will hold hearings
next week on more intensive vehicle emissions testing.
</P>
<P>
   And Nancy Seidman, deputy director of the Bureau of Waste
Prevention in the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection, said she hopes the Environmental Defense Fund report
will give even greater urgency to controlling vehicle pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it does encourage people to think about how they use
their cars, (and) whether there's opportunities to combine trips or
take mass transit,'' Seidman said.

DRUG-TV (Washington) - The federal drug czar's office is spending
its money in some unexpected ways. We profile a unique project
designed to get the nation's television networks (including ABC and
especially those like WB that cater to teen markets) to feature
anti-drug messages in their programs. We'll look at how scripts are
being altered, and whether Hollywood feels threatened or censored.

 &QL; 
NETGROWTH (Phoenix) -The Phoenix area is among the top 10 percent
of the nation in terms of Internet access, according to a study of
``Goverment Technology Magazine.'' Each day, 37 million Americans
sign on to the Internet from home, nearly twice the number a year
earlier, according to the study. By JONANTHAN SIDENER. Story will

 &QL; 
EDIT-HOCKEY (Phoenix) - When the National Hockey League first began
expanding out of its northern, Canada-centric roots, purists feared
the dire consequences of diluting sparse talent. Where Maurice
``Rocket'' Richard once flew, thugs would now reign. They were
right and wrong. What the purists failed to account for, however,
was the expanding base of thugs in the stands. And in the press
boxes. In short, they didn't account for hockey being played before
Texans.Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Locked away in the memory of a government computer
are election results that Congress doesn't want the voters of the
nation's capital to see.
</P>
<P>
   No one has seen them, in fact _ not the city's election
officials, whose computer recorded the votes; not the members of
Congress, who control the political life and the pocketbook of the
capital; not the federal judge who, after five months, still has
not ruled on whether anyone should see them.
</P>
<P>
   They are the results of a referendum last November to decide
whether marijuana should be legalized in the District of Columbia
strictly for medical uses, such as for people with AIDS. In a city
with the highest number of AIDS-related deaths per capita in the
country, the issue resonated with a special urgency.
</P>
<P>
   A simple keystroke on an election-board computer would reveal
the political will of more than 140,000 city voters. But a
conservative Congress wary of any move toward legalizing drugs
refused to appropriate money to pay for the vote count _ less than
$500, according to the election board; $1.64, according to
referendum supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this great democracy of ours, where we are espousing
democracy around the world and we don't let the citizens of our
nation's capital count the votes of a democratically held
procedure, to me, that is unconscionable,'' said City Councilwoman
Carol Schwartz, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for mayor last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Few can point to something like this ever happening before in
which an election is held, but the votes never are counted and the
results never announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has happened in the United States,'' said
Austin Ranney, an expert on elections and referendums, at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``In that sense it's unique.
There have been instances elsewhere in the world, but under highly
volatile circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as wars and coup d'etats. Neither applies here, although
advocates of statehood for the District of Columbia sometimes
wonder whether they ever will see a time when Congress does not
overrule even local taxicab regulations.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activist Steve Michael launched the petition drive to get
the medical marijuana question on the ballot to help district
residents with the disease. Before Michael died of AIDS in the
middle of the drive, he made his partner, Wayne Turner, promise to
take over the effort, because he knew that, by law, the sponsor had
to be a living city resident.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is angry at being dismissed as one ``these
drug-legalization people'' by U.S. Rep. Robert L. Barr Jr., a
Georgia Republican. ``This is for people who are very seriously and
terminally ill, not for people with hangnails,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken figure familiar to anyone who followed the
impeachment of President Clinton, Barr was one of the House
prosecutors in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   A former federal prosecutor, Barr sponsored an amendment to the
city's annual appropriations bill that outlawed the use of federal
money on any ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana. It
passed in August by a voice vote with little debate. Barr could not
be reached for comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   The election board held the referendum anyway, because by the
time Congress passed the budget, the ballots already had been
printed using the city's 1998 federal appropriation. Barr's
amendment prohibited use of 1999 money.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a year that Congress had waded into an
AIDS-related funding issue for the District of Columbia. Last fall
Rep. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas and Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, both
Republicans, were authors of measures to ban federal money for
needle-exchange programs in the capital for intravenous drug users.
Supporters argue that such a program would cut down on transmission
of AIDS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have passed medical marijuana referendums in
recent years, including California, Arizona, Alaska, Nevada,
Washington and Oregon. Supporters say that marijuana use helps ease
suffering from AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis, migraine headaches
and glaucoma. Medical and scientific groups have offered qualified
endorsements for at least further research.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine
concluded last month that the active substance in marijuana might
be ``moderately'' useful in treating pain but that smoked marijuana
had little future as a medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tough one for me,'' said Schwartz, who backed the
referendum when she ran for mayor last fall. ``But more and more
it's proving that (marijuana) does offer a great deal of relief to
those who are suffering. I have friends going through chemotherapy.
This was only thing that allowed them to keep food down. We know
that people who are that sick can often starve to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly what was happening to Michael, the original
sponsor of the initiative. Suffering from AIDS wasting syndrome, he
dropped nearly 60 pounds in just a few months. Michael hated
marijuana, but in an ironic punctuation to his own crusade, Turner
said, he turned to it for relief.
</P>
<P>
   But the politics that silenced the outcome of the referendum
quickly expanded the debate. The American Civil Liberties Union
sued the city's election board, charging that it violated the
voters' First Amendment rights. Even City Hall agreed and, though
it was being sued, filed a brief in support.
</P>
<P>
   Referendum supporters called Barr's amendment a gratuitous slap.
Congress, which has veto power over laws in the district, could
have just as easily rejected the marijuana measure if it passed _
and exit polls on Election Day predicted it would be approved by
nearly 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an outrage within an outrage within an outrage,'' said
Art Spitzer, legal director for the national capital area office of
the ACLU. ``First D.C. citizens don't get a vote in Congress.
Second is that Congress doesn't let the local D.C. government pass
even the most local trivial laws without review. The third level of
outrage is that Congress would interfere this way within the
election process.''
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone waits, as they have for five months, for a federal
judge to rule on the ACLU lawsuit. The decision probably will be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   For Turner, who took up his friend's banner, the delay has had
profound and tragic meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my world, in the world of AIDS, where time is crucial, I've
lost probably about five to 10 friends in that time,'' he said. ``I
feel a lot of anger. But I'm clinging to my faith in democracy
right now. I have to. I have no choice.''

REPORT SEES DROP IN DEATH RATE, INCIDENCE FROM CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a report that suggests that the United States has ``turned
the corner'' on cancer, the government says both the death rate and
incidence of new cancer cases declined significantly for all types
of the disease between 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``cancer report card'' says the rate of new cancers
has gone down an average of nearly 1 percent a year over the study
period and that the mortality rate has dropped a little more than
0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results are published in the current Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, which also included an editorial lauding the
report.
</P>
<P>
   But the study results also came Tuesday with a warning. Unless
an alarming increase in teenage smoking can be reversed, the
researchers said, declining lung cancer rates _ a big part of the
improving cancer picture _ will probably start rising again.
</P>
<P>
   The report was compiled by the American Cancer Society, a
private organization, and three government groups: the National
Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is astonishing that almost half of all high school children
in America currently use some form of tobacco,'' Dr. Howard Koh, a
medical oncologist and the public health commissioner for
Massachusetts, said in the editorial.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, Koh said in a telephone interview, the tobacco
industry was allowed to make a product that drove ``a cancer that
used to be rare into our leading cancer killer in men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a phenomenal 73 percent increase in smoking among
teenagers between 1988 and 1996, said Barbara Rimer, director of
the division of cancer control and population sciences at the
National Cancer Institute. ``It's outrageous . . . it's
horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do something about these high school students;
otherwise we will have another lung-cancer epidemic,'' said Phyllis
Wingo, lead author of the report and director of surveillance
research at the cancer society.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the report's accompanying editorial said America
``has turned the corner'' on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Another report in the same issue of the journal reported that
seven European studies show that smoking cigars, cigarillos, and
pipe tobacco is almost as closely linked to lung cancer as smoking
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Because lung cancer accounts for 14 percent of new cancer cases
and 28 percent of cancer deaths, the biggest impact on cancer can
be made by fighting tobacco use, the main report said. About 90
percent of lung cancer is caused by smoking cigarettes, cigars, and
pipes and by second-hand exposure to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The gains made against cancer vary by type of cancer, gender,
age, race, and ethnicity. Overall, the greatest decline in
incidence has been among men, who have higher rates of cancer than
women.
</P>
<P>
   But some cancers _ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma _ are not
showing improvements. Both the incidence and the death rate from
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have continued to rise, although the rate of
increase appears to have slowed recently, Wingo said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   With melanoma, incidence continued to rise almost three percent
a year, while the death rate held steady. Like lung cancer, noted
Koh, melanoma is a highly preventable cancer. About 70 percent of
cases are linked to excess sun exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures show striking disparaties in lung cancer between
men and women. The incidence of lung cancer went down an average of
2.6 percent per year for men, but went up 0.1 percent for women,
noted Rimer. And the death rate for lung cancer went down 1.6
percent for men but went up 1.4 percent for women.
</P>
<P>
   That's because men started smoking earlier in the century and
started quitting sooner as well. Women are about ``a decade behind
in stopping,'' Rimer of the NCI said, although researchers are
starting to see the numbers improve for younger women (aged 40 to
59).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined among
adults in the last 25 years, but this trend has stalled in the past
four to five, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   For colorectal cancer, the news is more gender-balanced.
Incidence and death rates declined for both men and women. It's too
soon to tell whether this is due to increased screening.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer also declined in incidence and mortality,
although this was not statistically significant, noted Rimer. For
years, the incidence had been rising, but much of that rise was
probably due to increased screening with a test called PSA. The
peak incidence was in 1992, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer incidence remains unchanged, but death rates have
declined at about 2 percent a year since 1990. Part of that, cancer
epidemiologists believe, is due to increased use of screening
mammograms, which about two-thirds of women over 65 now get. Part
of the improvement in death rates is also probably due to more
widespread use of treatments such as chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But the breast cancer mortality rate continues to show a racial
disparity. Black women are somewhat less likely than white women to
get the disease, but they are more likely to die from it.
</P>
<P>
   With leukemia, overall mortality is down 0.3 percent, and
incidence is down 1.1 percent, with no large gender differences.
``We honestly don't know why there has been a decrease in
mortality,'' said Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings underscore the remarkable progress we've made
against cancer, but it also reminds us that our battle is far from
over,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala
in a statement released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For children younger than 15 years old, the incidence of cancer
declined 0.4 percent a year between 1990 and 1996 and mortality
decline 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest decrease in overall incidence of cancer has
occurred since 1992, the year in which incidence rates peaked.
</P>
<P>
   The report also analyzed cancer data for whites, blacks,
Asians/Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaskan Natives and
Hispanics. There were large differences in incidence by race and
ethnicity, with the highest incidence rates for blacks for all the
major types of cancer except breast cancer.

RARE RIGHT WHALE FOUND DEAD OFF CAPE COD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just days after Massachusetts issued a warning for boaters to
watch for Northern right whales swimming in Cape Cod Bay, one of
the extremely rare animals has died off Wellfleet, Mass. Biologists
won't know the cause until an autopsy is performed.
</P>
<P>
   The dead animal, part of a group of 21 right whales that have
been feeding in eastern Cape Cod Bay, had no obvious signs of
injury. But researchers said that about half of all whales killed
by ship strikes suffer mainly internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The whale, nicknamed Staccato, had been observed by researchers
since 1974. She had borne at least six calves, making her one of
the most productive females among the remaining 300 right whales.
Although she was at least 30 years old, right whales can live to be
70 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known her for a long, long time. It's a sad loss,'' said
Amy Knowlton, a right whale researcher at the New England Aquarium
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the number of right whales has sunk so low that
the loss of even one whale, especially a female, is a cause for
concern. The species has been shrinking in the 1990s, due mainly to
collisions with boats, according to a recent study by researchers
at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial observers spotted the whale Tuesday, floating about five
miles off Great Island in Wellfleet, just outside of an area where
the state Division of Marine Fisheries had urged ``extreme
caution'' by boaters because of an unusually large number of right
whales congregated there.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency response team from the Center for Coastal Studies
in Provincetown, Mass. reached Staccato by Tuesday afternoon, but
there was nothing to do for the animal except tow the carcass
ashore for an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service said it was
unlikely the autopsy could be performed until Wednesday. The Center
for Coastal Studies planned to tow the carcass to Truro, Mass.
where the analysis of the 40 foot-plus animal could be done on the
beach.

PRAYER SERVICE OVER POLICE SHOOTING MARKED BY A SIMPLE HUG 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a two-hour service filled with preaching, prayer
and psalms about healing and reconciliation, the most profound
statement came from a simple, silent gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist
Church, who less than a year ago denounced Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
as a racist, stepped off the podium at St. Patrick's Cathedral on
Tuesday and walked over to the first pew to shake the mayor's hand.
The two men ended up in a cordial embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing unites us like the humble, simple act of prayer,''
Butts told the crowd of about 1,500, including a wide array of New
York's religious and political leaders, who had gathered at the
invitation of Cardinal John O'Connor to help repair a city scarred
by the Feb. 4 police shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was not listed on the program but was invited to
say a few words after the extraordinary handshake-turned-hug,
responded with perhaps his most conciliatory comments since the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our similarities are much greater than our differences,''
Giuliani said humbly. ``We're children of the same God. The mayor
needs to recognize that. The police do. And the citizens of the
city do.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 weeks after Diallo, a 22-year-old West African
immigrant, died in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment in a
barrage of 41 police bullets, the service aimed to shift civic
discourse over the incident from the fiery civil disobedience in
front of police headquarters to a more spiritual, forward-looking
sense of unity. Clergy from all faiths sat side by side, in robes
of black, magenta and white, vestments of gold, green and burgundy,
each offering similar messages about the common origin of all
people, regardless of race or belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a time for protest and a time for prayer,'' said
O'Connor. ``Today is a time for prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the Talmud and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter
from a Birmingham Jail, reading from the Q'uran and Corinthians II,
ministers and rabbis, imams and elected officials, police officers
and a high school valedictorian took turns at the microphone. Among
the dignitaries in the audience were Police Commissioner Howard
Safir; Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson; and Mark Green, the
city's public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   In the ecumenical semicircle of clergy, the haberdashery
revealed the diversity of the service, from the crimson skullcap of
the Episcopalian bishop, E. Ron Taylor, to the gold cone atop the
head of Shayk Abd' Allah Latif Ali, from Sister Loretta Richards'
navy headscarf to Rabbi Robert N. Levine's knit yarmulke and the
large black hood of the Armenian Rev. Sooren Chinchinian.
</P>
<P>
   They offered prayers for Diallo's family, and for the four
police officers indicted on second-degree murder charges in his
death. They appealed for peace and justice, dignity and equality.
</P>
<P>
   But the fresh scars from weeks of tense and heated debate over
race and policing remained open and on view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I feel authority seems to be at odds with society?''
asked Lorenzo Laboy, a Puerto Rican senior at Rice High School
whose harassment by the police was featured in an articles in The
New York Times last month. ``We don't want to be the scapegoat for
society's problems. Are the leaders of tomorrow going to have to
solve a problem that the leaders of today have been unwilling to
solve?''
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the service were Diallo's parents, who
met with the cardinal last month, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has
led dozens of demonstrations against police brutality since the
shooting. Sharpton said in an interview afterward that he boycotted
the event because the program did not include families of victims
of brutality or ministers who had been among the nearly 1,200
people arrested protesting the shooting last month. Representatives
of his National Action Network had been asked to give the
invocation but canceled at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like me saying I'm going to have a reconciliation service
on Yugoslavia and not invite the Albanians,'' Sharpton said. ``I
always like to see people act civil to each other, but I definitely
don't think it should be billed as reconciliation around Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   The embrace between Giuliani and Butts, he added, ``has as much
to do with the police brutality movement as Yogi Berra making up
with George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts stunned city officials and black leaders alike last spring
when he called Giuliani a racist who was on the verge of turning
New York into a fascist state. Butts, whose political alliances
have included Gov. George Pataki but excluded Sharpton, has
previously spoken out about the Diallo case but has not been a
leader in the protest movement.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Tuesday afternoon that Butts' gesture ``was part
of the spirit'' of O'Connor's interfaith service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reciprocated in trying to demonstrate whatever differences
we have we should put aside,'' he said. ``We both worship the same
God.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was the theme of nearly every speech at the cathedral, as
ministers and lay people pointed out that the diversity of New York
City _ and, indeed, the world _ had grown from a common seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go through justice to get to peace,'' the Rev.
James Goode, a Franciscan friar, said in a sermon that earned
several standing ovations. ``Are we willing to be a little
uncomfortable, so we can all be a little more comfortable?
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we willing to give up for the cause of justice? What
are we willing to give up to raise up one another?'' he demanded of
the audience. ``Let us never be so busy fighting each other that we
don't realize it is far more important to fight for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Henry, 59, a cosmetologist who lives in East Harlem, said
attending Tuesday's prayer service was a natural extension of her
marching over the Brooklyn Bridge behind Sharpton last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe God is sending out a message with Amadou Diallo,''
she said. ``We need a total circle to correct the injustice of New
York. People need to understand, enough is enough. We need to make
sure people hear all of the messages of today.''

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The moment he crossed into Albania and
registered with police at the shabby border station about 10 miles
east of here, Ymer Behrami was given four blankets, a large green
tarp, and what he believed was a chance for him and his family to
leave behind the madness in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But he had no idea that by passing into Albania he was now
engaged in a new struggle _ to provide for the seven children on
his wagon. As it turned out, the apartment he expected to be
waiting for him in Albania never appeared. Obtaining food, even a
piece of bread, forced him to fight and claw like an animal. The
intimidation and humiliation he thought he had left behind with the
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo found him again, only this time from his
own side.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, he heard Albanian soldiers bark orders at him and
saw Albanian children taunt him with the three-fingered Serbian
salute. He watched his children shiver with cold and cry from
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   And after surviving the threats and beatings of Serbian police,
he was among those rounded up by armed members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian rebels, who questioned him and
frightened him so much that after he was released he took his
family and fled yet again.
</P>
<P>
   For every one of the more than 600,000 Kosovo Albanians expelled
by Yugoslavs over the last three weeks, the escape from Kosovo was
but a single point in a long exodus of terror and pain, preceded by
months of anxiety and followed by long days of disappointment and
vulnerability. Their journey did not start at the border, nor end
there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was natural for Behrami, a stern and stoic 58-year-old
of Albanian descent whose family had been in Kosovo for many
generations, to feel the bright, warm sun of midafternoon and think
he was lucky still to be alive. The last nine months had been a
relentless round of intimidation and fear, starting with the rifle
shots and mortar rounds he heard approaching his village, Kotore, a
rebel stronghold southwest of Mitrovica, last July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was fighting and they started to bomb,'' he recalled.
After two days of listening to the Yugoslav shells come nearer,
Behrami felt he had to flee. He packed his wagon and hitched it to
his 1978 C-355 Ursus tractor, with a lucky horseshoe hanging over
the radiator grill. He took one, last, heart-searing look at his
home, the product of 40 years of working hard in an ore- processing
plant and on his beloved farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good water, beautiful mountains, big trees,
everything,'' he said. He had built three houses for his large
family, solid houses of stone and cement. He had eight cows and
boasted that they gave so much milk the pails overflowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said, ``paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that his Serbian neighbors were suspicious and
jealous, even after he had lived near them for so many years. As he
left for the last time, they came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbors were wearing the uniforms of the Serbian army,''
he said. ``They beat us, and put a knife under my chin and told me,
``Go to NATO. Go to the USA and let them help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Creeping undetected along a mountain path, he drove 10 hours to
his older sister's house in Bujora, within the resource-rich
northern part of Kosovo that the Yugoslav government is intent on
keeping. But it was already crowded with refugees. He went on to
his daughter's house in the city of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   During the nine months he stayed there, the days rang with rifle
fire, and the nights were lit by mortars and flames. Last week
Serbian police, some in black ski masks, returned to Mitrovica,
systematically crisscrossing the city in search of ethnic Albanians
in hiding. Finally, at about 10 a.m. on April 15, they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up the street walking,'' he said, describing an
almost tranquil scene that contrasted greatly with the events
unfolding, ``and when they saw me they shouted, `What are you doing
here? You must leave the house and leave Kosovo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they would eventually arrive, he had loaded his wagon
weeks before. Forced to decide what cherished parts of his life in
Kosovo to take with him, and what to leave behind, Behrami had
chosen carefully.
</P>
<P>
   He took what he thought would be useful things, like an ax, a
small stove and a sack of flour to make bread. He took blankets and
cushions for the 21 people in his extended family who would ride on
the rattling wooden wagon.
</P>
<P>
   And Behrami brought along a small wooden cradle, called a
``djep'' (pronounced dyep). Not because he expected to need it _
the youngest of his 10 children is 9 years old. But because for
him, as for many Kosovo families, the djep is a symbol of the
future, wherever one might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we left the djep, the Serbians would end up burning it,
just like they have destroyed everything else,'' he said. ``Now
they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police watched and waited until they left. It took about
10 minutes. They started heading toward the city of Pec, but were
stopped by police and forced to wait with other refugees overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that they found Aslan Hasani, 48, who is married to
Behrami's younger sister. Hasani's family had taken refuge in the
city after having been forced from his own village, Rezane, near
Mitrovica, by Yugoslav forces on September 15.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-school biology teacher with brown, tightly curled hair,
Hasani looked as if he were already half dead. He had spent a
horrible night tortured by doubts about his wife and son, whom he
had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   For six days before the Serbs showed up, Hasani's son Bajram,
16, had suffered severe stomach pains. Hasani was reluctant to
bring him to the hospital in Mitrovica and run the risk of
encountering police.
</P>
<P>
   Finally his wife, Naile, took the boy to the hospital and stayed
with him until he received the necessary appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   She was still there when police banged on the door of their
house. ``I asked them if I could go to the hospital to tell my
wife,'' Hasani said, his eyes reddening. ``The policemen said no,
`You can only go to Albania.'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Two days and two nights later, having been robbed and beaten by
police twice on the way, and having eaten nothing but hard bread
and salt, Hasani cared for his other four children and worried
about the part of his family that had been taken from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are dead,'' he said from atop the wagon hitch on
which he rode Saturday afternoon on the approach to Kukes, in
northern Albania. ``I'm afraid that since she doesn't have money to
pay the hospital, they will do something to her and to our son.''
As the tractor neared Kukes, the family got its first glimpse of
what life would be like for them in Albania. At a bend in the road,
the Italian government had built a refugee camp, surrounded by
barbed wire. Tractors and wagons were scattered everywhere. There
was no clear way to get in _ or out _ and no official to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Behrami, who had driven all the way from Mitrovica, finally got
off the tractor. ``What can I do now?'' he asked his
brother-in-law. He spoke through the barbed wire to someone in the
camp, asking first for information about relatives, then about
conditions in the camp. With optimism draining from his angular
face, he looked around and sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Three rifle shots sounded just then, and not far away he could
see an Albanian guard chasing after local children who had stolen
something from the camp. He adjusted the dirty black beret he never
removed and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to Kukes,'' he quietly told one of his sons. ``We
will have to pay for a room, and it will be very expensive, but we
cannot stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimly, he moved the tractor forward again. He fell silent a few
minutes later when he saw the chaos of the unorganized tractor
encampments that have sprung up around Kukes. Unlike the official
camps, which are at least organized, if inadequate, these
unofficial camps are nothing more than open fields. The refugees
organize themselves, if ``organize'' can be used to describe the
utter disorder of tens of thousands of lost families struggling to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Behrami is the unquestioned patriarch of his family, a strong
figure with a steely gaze who makes all decisions. Now he was lost,
and the uncharacteristic indecision seemed to sap his strength. ``I
don't know where to stop,'' he told his sons on the tractor.
``Where do we go?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a painful scene for the family, lasting until one son,
Lavdim, whose arm had been fractured by a blow from a Serbian
policeman, gestured for his father to pull into a vacant spot
alongside the road.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children did not get down from the wagon. Behrami
immediately ventured into the muddy field to find food. A bread
truck came and tried to distribute some hard loaves, but the
distributors haughtily told the mob that no bread would be given
out until they formed a single line. Behrami pushed his way to the
front, and his hand was upraised and pleading when the truck driver
pulled away to teach the disorderly refugees a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Behrami lined up again, and this time he came back with a
few unwrapped loaves. He broke off a piece and ate it, not with
pleasure but to fortify himself for the next fight.
</P>
<P>
   After insuring that everyone in the family had bread, he
wandered into town, stopping to ask peddlers and old men sitting on
stoops about finding shelter. With less than an hour left before
nightfall, he resigned himself to sleeping in the muddy field.
</P>
<P>
   While Behrami searched the field for a site that blocked the
fierce wind, Lavdim drove the tractor. But the boy was
inexperienced and nearly tipped the wagon over. Dark was
approaching, and a crescent moon was already cut out sharply in
front of the towering mountains. The women asked when they would
leave the field. Behrami had to tell them they would not leave that
night.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew that after being squeezed into the wagon for two
days, they had to have room to stretch out. He and his
brother-in-law, Hasani, wearily began to unload the tractor when a
stranger offered to let them use a nearby empty wagon. Behrami
gladly accepted and sent the women and children over. He spent his
first night in safety sleeping in his wagon under the green tarp
given to him at the border.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next day was a continuation of the last: fruitless searching
for a room, continuous worrying about his family. ``I am a family
man,'' he told a peddler who promised to bring him information
about an available rural house. ``If we must live here without food
and without shelter we will die.'' He had not spoken to a single
official or relief worker.
</P>
<P>
   Walking to another encampment in a city park, he found a friend,
who took Behrami to his married daughter, Fidaije, from whom he had
been separated in the refugee column. She had come with her husband
in their own tractor, bouncing along on one tire because a Serbian
policeman had shot out the other after she said she did not have
money to give him.
</P>
<P>
   For a second night the extended family slept in the wagons _
Behrami's brother-in-law, Hasani, and that side of the family in
the borrowed wagon at the muddy field; Behrami's wife and children
in a garbage-filled lot in the center of Kukes. There he was
offered the use of another empty wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, after the rains stopped, Behrami trudged
once more through the dilapidated city searching for a room, hoping
to get his family under a roof somewhere. Still he had not spoken
to any relief worker.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged, he returned to the tractor at midday to find a
thuggish-looking man accusing him of having taken his wagon the
night before without permission. A contingent of Kosovo rebel
soldiers, heavily armed and wearing new uniforms and identification
tags, came up to Behrami and order him to go with them. In Kukes,
local authority has been almost completely usurped by the rebels,
whose presence in the city is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nightmarish repeat of what he had been through before
in Kosovo. Without a chance to tell his wife anything, Behrami was
taken away. With his hands in the pockets of his coat, his beret
firmly on his head, he walked with them, hunched over, not looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers took him around the corner to a local outpost where
the man who made the complaint against him gestured threateningly
with a large wrench. The rebels chased away observers. Then, moving
quickly, they hustled Behrami into a small red Lada sedan,
squeezing him into the back seat with three rebels, their automatic
rifles planted between their legs. As the car sped off, the rebels
looked menacingly at passers-by, while Behrami stared blankly
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said that Behrami returned a few hours later and
parked the tractor in a lot somewhere. Then, along with the members
of his side of the family, he took a bus to the capital, Tirana.
This is something he had said repeatedly he would not do; the
rebels had obviously changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The djep was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   As they had begun several days before, the family was ending
this part of its sad odyssey split apart. Behrami left for Tirana
without a word to his brother-in-law, who was still in the first
borrowed wagon on the edge of the muddy field. Paralyzed by worry
over the fate of his wife and son in the hospital in Mitrovica, he
had done nothing to secure a home. He worried that his family would
be put out of the wagon that night.
</P>
<P>
   But then the owner of the wagon he had been using, who had
already found shelter in a rural village, came along. He and Hasani
met for the first time. They shook hands, and smoked a cigarette.
``We have very little,'' said the owner, Hatim Merdiu, who came
from the Kosovo village of Brodosane, near the Albanian border.
``But we must take care of each other.'' He told Hasani to stay in
the wagon as long as he needed.
</P>
<P>
   People who arrived in the camps after him told Hasani they heard
that his son was dead. Some said they had seen two bodies in his
house. He tried not to believe them. His responsibility now was to
care for his four other children, little ones who cry at night for
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Advam, 4, has the same curly hair as his father. He
is a dirty-faced imp with eyes that have already seen things a boy
should never see. Hasani said he regretted that he had not brought
any toys for the children to play with, but there had been so
little time, and so little space, for anything that was not
essential.

   The sun came out, and the air turned warm. Advam took from his
pocket his own treasure, a set of marbles. He knelt down and shot
one expertly, knocking another into a puddle. And there, at that
moment, in the mud and waste, it appeared he had made a home from
the fury of war.

CORRECTING THE ERRORS OF A BENEFACTOR'S WAYS 
</HEADLINE>

   WINTERTHUR, Del. _ Henry Francis du Pont probably did not know
where history ended and fantasy began when he devised the American
period rooms for the museum here that bears his name. Apparently
nobody else has known the difference either. Museum officials long
insisted that the rooms reflected life in America between 1640 and
1860.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 years after du Pont's death and nearly 50 years after
his mansion became the Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum,
visitors are being told that, yes, du Pont erred. But guides will
point out the inaccuracies in only 20 of his favorite rooms among
the museum's 175. They have been returned to the way he had
arranged them, mistakes and all. They had been changed over the
years as masterpieces were refurbished, added or taken away to be
shown elsewhere. While experts have rarely doubted the authenticity
of the furniture, they have questioned the decor of some rooms
because objects were shown in ways that did not always jibe with
historical data.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that were supposed to simulate those in homes of Colonial
or Federal America were actually arranged in ways that were unheard
of until the Victorian era, the turn of the century or even modern
times. The placing of furniture in conversation groupings, for
example, was introduced in the mid-19th century. Oriental rugs came
into use 50 years later. Crystal chandeliers throughout a house
were a bounty too costly even for aristocrats 200 years ago, and
the 15 at Winterthur may represent the total number that existed in
homes throughout the colonies. Cut flowers in punch bowls first
became popular in the flapper age. About the same time, high chests
and wing chairs were moved from bedrooms to parlors, since bed
linens by then were stored elsewhere and potties were gone from
such chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Lanmon, the director and chief executive officer of
Winterthur, prefers to look upon du Pont's decorating errors as
``misconceptions.'' Lanmon had learned of them while he was a
graduate student at Winterthur in the 1960s and later a curator,
and he wanted to address the inconsistencies when he returned as
the museum director in 1992. They also concerned Brock Jobe,
another Winterthur alumnus, who returned to the museum as deputy
director for collections in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both came in with the same idea in mind,'' Lanmon said.
``And we were both eager to make sure that du Pont would be better
understood and appreciated for assembling the largest and one of
the finest collections of American decorative arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Du Pont became a nonstop collector of Americana beginning in
1919, when he bought an 18th-century maple table. He insisted on
authenticity and the finest quality in the furnishings that he
purchased for the period rooms. `` du Pont often told others that
he wanted the style of these rooms `to be the way it was in early
America,''' Lanmon said. ``But Winterthur is still primarily a
collection of objects, not period rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rooms, he added, expressed du Pont's taste. ``This is
how the rich lived in du Pont's world,'' Lanmon said. ``He
entertained the nobility of Europe and the wealthy of America in
what he viewed as his country house, until it became a museum. He
made early America fit that mold.''
</P>
<P>
   What the decor of houses in America looked like before 1860 was
not known until the 1970s, when several scholarly books on the
subject were published. Lanmon and his colleagues struggled with
the prospect of correcting the historical inaccuracies in the rooms
before going ahead with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to make them as accurate as you possibly can,''
Jobe said. ``But the reality is that du Pont had created spaces
that, architecturally and from a furnishings standpoint, were
extremely challenging to retrofit as they might have been in an
earlier era. Historical accuracy is a moving target. The way a
period room looks reflects an understanding of history at the time
it was created.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything was returned to the rooms. Absent are the
gooseneck lamps: du Pont had them placed in the bedrooms when
guests arrived and had them whisked away after dinner when he led
guests on a tour of the house only to have them brought back when
everyone turned in for the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, guides used flashlights to lead visitors through
the rooms, but once a new lighting system is in place, Lanmon wants
to see the flashlights done away with. ``For years visitors had
complained that they could not see the furniture across the room
and the paintings on the walls,'' he said. ``When our lighting
program is completed in 2001, I want to see a great bonfire of the
flashlights.''
</P>
<P>
   The new lighting has already improved the visibility in these
rooms and, on completion, will brighten the rooms throughout the
museum. A series of computerized floodlights and spotlights,
concealed in tracks above the ceilings in the rooms, will simulate
several levels of illumination: natural light, candlelight or, on
occasion, a more intense light equal to that available in modern
offices.
</P>
<P>
   In whatever light, these rooms bristle with one man's ideas of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's celebrate this man's taste,'' Jobe said. ``It's the glue
that holds this place together.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WU-CHINESE-FILMS (Undated) _ Wu Tianming is well acquainted with
the whims of fortune: During the 1980s, as an acclaimed director,
he headed Xian Film Studio, the cradle of the New Chinese Cinema,
which burst upon the international scene with the force of a
revelation. Less than a decade later, he was reduced to running a
video store in Los Angeles. Today, Wu, at 60, is once again working
as a director in China. On a recent visit to New York, he looked
back on these twists of fate with remarkable good humor. By leslie
Camhi.

   NICHOLS-AWARD (New York) _ Mike Nichols, having moved from comic
duologues with Elaine May from their student life at the University
of Chicago, to theater (winning seven Tony's as a Broadway director
and one as a producer) to film, will be honored by the Film Society
of Lincoln Center on May 3 with an annual lifetime achievement
award that first went to Charlie Chaplin in 1972 and was given to
Martin Scorsese last year. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWAN-LAKE-BALLET (Undated) _ George Balanchine once told Peter
Martins: ``You know, dear, we should call all ballets `Swan Lake.'
People will come.'' Martins certainly hopes people will come to the
complete ``Swan Lake'' he is staging for the New York City Ballet.
It opens the company's spring, 50th-anniversary season at the New
York State Theater on Thursday night and will be performed through
May 9. By Jack Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-ARCHIVE (New York) _ Four centuries of ballet tradition
and evolution are encoded in the bodies and minds of the dancers'
teachers and coaches: in Frederic Franklin, one of the last of the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo stars of the 1930s, in the great Soviet
ballerina Irina Kolpakova, who performed with the Kirov Ballet in
Leningrad from the 1950s through the mid-1980s, and in Georgina
Parkinson, a leading ballerina with England's Royal Ballet in its
late glory days through the 1970s. The first recorded attempts to
codify dance steps in a script of symbols occurred in mid-15th
century Italy. Today, whole ballets and modern-dance works are
written out and quickly retrievable in computer programs, down to
the smallest steps and gestures and most complex positionings and
travels of dancers across the stage. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-BOOK (Undated) _ Harold Bloom, in his recent book,
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human,'' leaves no doubt of his
irritation with most of the interpretations he has encountered in a
lifetime of worshiping the plays; for him, the more daring the
attempt, the more excruciating the experience. Here and there in
his 741 pages, Bloom dredges up a kind word about a legendary turn
by an actor whom he has never seen _ Kean or Irving as Shylock _ or
a production that he saw long ago: most memorably for him, the
Henry plays with Ralph Richardson as Falstaff and, incidentally,
Laurence Olivier alternating between Hotspur and Shallow. By Walter
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DUKAS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If the average American knows the name
of the French composer Paul Dukas at all, it is probably in
connection with an image of Mickey Mouse, wearing a baggy red robe
and a wizard's hat, battling anthropomorphic broomsticks to the
strains of Dukas' ``Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Walt Disney's use of
that piece in the movie ``Fantasia'' made Dukas more famous than he
might have dreamed, or even hoped. By David Mermelstein.
</P>
<P>
   GUBAIDULINA-MUSIC (Undated) _ A woman among composers; a
freethinker among Soviet apparatchiks; a Christian among atheists;
an Easterner, half Tatar, among Europeans; a modernist among
reactionaries, and a reactionary among modernists, Sofia
Gubaidulina has lived with many conflicts, both with the outside
world and within herself. Her arrival, in her 50s and 60s, at
moments of extraordinary musical power has been a triumph of
persistence and self-searching. Ms. Gubaidulina, now 67, has become
a great light, and her achievement has happily been matched by
steadily increasing public recognition, which reaches a culmination
in New York on Thursday evening, when two big new works will be
presented almost simultaneously: ``Two Paths,'' at Avery Fisher
Hall, and ``In the Shadow of the Tree,'' at Carnegie Hall. By Paul
Griffiths.
 &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC-IDENTITY (Undated) _ ``Identity is the crisis can't
you see,'' declared the female singer Marion Elliott, better known
as Poly Styrene, in a 1978 punk rock song. Proving the prescience
of Ms. Elliott's words, a number of musicians have begun to explore
notions of identity, so often a part of pop music's appeal, by
adopting not just one pseudonym but many. They make the continual
reinventing of musical personas perhaps as entertaining and
meaningful as the music itself. By Michael Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DUPONT-MUSEUM (Winterthur, Del.) _ Henry Francis du PONT
probably did not know where history ended and fantasy began when he
devised the American period rooms for the museum here that bears

Museum officials long insisted that the rooms reflected life in

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEWSROOM (Undated) _ On ``The Newsroom,'' Ken Finkleman's
dry, riotous take on a Canadian television news organization, any
war, plane crash or nuclear accident had better have the right spin
potential if it hopes to compete for attention with who gets the
prime indoor parking spot or which assistant to hire, the black
lesbian or the blond ski bunny. A huge hit on Canadian television,
``The Newsroom'' made its way south to PBS in 1997 (last New Year's
Eve, WNET in New York reran all 13 episodes back to back) and has
recently been released in a four-tape set by Acorn Media. By Peter
M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   MAD-TV (Los Angeles) _ ``Mad TV,'' is a sketch-show series that
Quincy Jones and David Salzman proposed in 1995 as a way for Fox
television to siphon away the X-chromosome contingent from NBC's
``Saturday Night Live'' audience. (``Mad TV'' starts at 11 p.m., a
half-hour before ``Saturday Night Live.'') But if the boys and
girls in baggy jeans whooping and hollering in the bleachers at a
Friday night taping are any indication, the show has become a big
draw for 12- to 17-year-olds of both sexes. By Margy Rochlin.

NEW RULES RESOLVE US-EU INTERNET PRIVACY DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New rules drafted this week by the US Department of Commerce and
the European Union to ensure the privacy of people who exchange
information over the Internet may provide Europeans with additional
protection while leaving Americans to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, announced Monday, are intended to resolve a dispute
between the Unilted States and Europe over the best way to
safeguard privacy on the Internet. Last October, the EU set strict
limits on the ways that companies in Europe can use personal
information obtained from customers. For instance, such data cannot
be shared with a third party without the subject's permission. But
the United States does not have similar regulations, so American
firms can resell customer information without permission.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a touchy problem because, through the Internet,
Europeans can buy goods from American firms not subject to European
privacy law. European governments and privacy activists warned that
unless American Internet companies adopted EU-style privacy rules,
they might be barred from selling to EU citizens. But the Clinton
administration insists that the Unilted States should retain its
policy of letting businesses set their own privacy standards. ``We
have a long history of voluntary regulation,'' said Commerce
Department spokesman Morrie Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union have been negotiating
to find a way around this, by designing a ``safe harbor'' _ a set
of rules for American companies that will bring them into adequate
compliance with European standards. Firms that want to sell to
Europeans over the Internet will be expected to adhere to these
safe-harbor rules.
</P>
<P>
   The latest draft of the rules would require firms to provide
notice to customers if they plan to sell personal information to
third parties. Customers would be able to refuse permission by
``opting out'' of such an arrangement, perhaps by checking a box on
a Web page asking that the information not be shared. If the box is
not checked, the company would be free to share the data. But in
cases involving very sensitive information, such as religion,
political views, or sexual practices, there could be no sharing of
the information unless a consumer specifically grants permission, a
practice called ``opting in.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, information could be shared only with other
companies that had agreed to follow the same privacy rules as the
firm collecting the data. Consumers would also be guaranteed the
right to see their data files and correct erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   American privacy activists have long sought federal legislation
that would require all US companies to adhere to such practices.
But the safe-harbor rule would not be mandatory for American firms
when they do business with Americans. That doesn't sit well with
Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing the consequences of the lack of a coherent
privacy policy in the United States,'' said Rotenberg, who argues
that the US government is trying to avoid a disruption in trade
with Europe, without improving privacy protections for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Under-Secretary of Commerce David Aaron will meet with EU
representatives next week to continue negotiations on the
safe-harbor rules. The Commerce Department hopes to complete the
text next month and sign a binding agreement during a US-EU summit
meeting June 21.

U.S. PARATROOPERS ENTER TIRANA TO GUARD HELICOPTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Hundreds of paratroopers from America's elite
rapid-response force have begun arriving at the scruffy airport
here, but their assignment _ standing guard over Apache helicopters
that have not yet arrived _ only underscored the improvisational
nature of NATO's strategy against Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of a battalion from the 82nd Airborne Division
was not announced by the Pentagon, but the paratroopers were
spotted at the airport, identifiable by their distinctive unit
patch, with the airborne tab and a double A in a circle, dating
back to a World War I detachment known as the ``all-American''
division.
</P>
<P>
   One brigade of the 82d Airborne is kept on constant ready alert
at all times as a quick-response force to a crisis anywhere in the
world, marking the division as one of the Army's most respected,
powerful fighting organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But, at least for the moment, their job here is not combat.
Instead, they will be, in effect, policemen far behind the lines
for the 48 Apache attack helicopters that were expected here any
day for the past two weeks. While these troops usually are reserved
for more complex operations, military officials said they were
called upon in this case because they were the only unit that could
be deployed quickly enough to protect the Army helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a query, the Defense Department confirmed that
700 soldiers from the division's 3rd Brigade, second battalion of
the 505th Parachute Infantry, had been dispatched here to provide
security for the Apaches. The troops were mostly infantry, but also
included military police, intelligence officers, supply experts and
medics, the Pentagon said.

   Despite four weeks of NATO air and missile strikes, the Serbian
forces have continued unabated in their brutal campaign to drive
ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo province. In the last month they
have forced 600,000 refugees across the borders, NATO says, and
relief officials fear hundreds of thousands more are on their way
or in hiding, without food or water, in the forest and mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, far from being crippled by the assault, have poured
thousands of reinforcements into Kosovo, increased their use of
helicopters, mixed military vehicles into refugee convoys and
stepped up their sweeps to drive out ethnic Albanians, NATO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the failure of the air strikes to stop the Serbian
campaign to depopulate Kosovo _ largely carried out in small-scale
tactics of a handful of armed, masked men terrorizing villages _
the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, asked not only for more
planes but for first 24 then 48 Apache attack helicopters, which
are capable of close-in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches, with a reputation as tank-killers from the Persian
Gulf war, could operate either on their own or in support of
attacking ground troops. They have what the military calls a
``stand-off capability,'' meaning they can fire their rockets at a
target from as far as three miles away. The helicopters operate in
tandem with batteries of rockets with a maximum range of 180 miles
that are designed to knock out air defenses before the packs of
helicopters attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the Apaches were clearly an afterthought, not part of the
original plan. Clark and other commanders are reportedly furious at
the repeated delays in getting the Apaches here. The helicopters
are now believed to be at a U.S. military base in Italy, but even
after they arrive in Albania, military officials say, it could take
a week or so to get them operational.
</P>
<P>
   With the ramshackle airport here consumed with bringing in
relief supplies and ferrying some of the goods up to the isolated
mountain border point near Kukes, where there are more than 100,000
refugees in makeshift camps, there has been speculation that the
Apaches would be based farther north, near Lezhe, at an old
military airfield variously marked on maps as Gramsh or Gjader that
was used by U.S. planes operating over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited arrival of the Apaches has become a matter of
consuming interest here. Albanians and Kosovo refugees fervently
believe it will mark a turning point; American television networks
begin staking out the airport at dawn each day in hopes of new
pictures. There was a brief flurry of excitement Tuesday morning
when television personality Geraldo Rivera, broadcasting live from
a rooftop, spied two of the large helicopters constantly ferrying
relief supplies and mistakenly announced the Apaches had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that, over time, the troops from the 82nd
Airborne could become the nucleus of a ground force, if the event
the alliance decides to add ground troops. Already, at a more
tightly guarded section of the airport, there are men whose
insignia marks them as members of the Army Special Forces or of the
Recon Marines.
</P>
<P>
   But a ground deployment could face formidable obstacles as the
Serbs dig in, mining roads and hiding their tanks and artillery in
civilian buildings. NATO officials now say they believe there are
40,000 Serbian troops in Kosovo. A standard military rule of thumb
says the ratio of attackers to dug-in defenders should be
three-to-one, which would mean a force of 120,000. U.S. doctrine in
the Gulf war, however, called for an absolutely overwhelming force,
even against an Iraqi enemy that folded in the first hours.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, at the rate Kosovo is being depopulated, by the
time such a force could be assembled it is unlikely there would be
any ethnic Albanians left to protect.

<P>
   Several of the nation's big banks reported sharply higher
earnings Tuesday, with one of the biggest, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
posting robust trading gains comparable with the outsized results
already turned in by most of the country's big trading houses.
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting from an unusually strong trading season spurred by a
rebound from the global financial crisis of last fall, Chase said
first-quarter net earnings leapt 61 percent, to $1.17 billion, or
$1.32 a share, from $725 million, or 80 cents a share, in the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's operating income, a more accurate reflection of the
company's core earnings strength than net income, rose a more
modest 11 percent, to $1.17 billion from $1.05 billion. Net income
in the comparable quarter a year earlier included a reorganization
charge of $521 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chase, the country's third-largest bank by assets, beat
analysts' expectations of $1.25 a share, the stock was sharply
lower Tuesday as investors appeared to be concerned about the
unpredictability of such big trading returns and Chase's ability to
maintain its earnings momentum. The shares, which have more than
doubled in the last year, fell $2, to $83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given how everyone has been blowing through their numbers, I
think there were higher expectations for Chase,'' said Sally Pope
Davis, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``But nobody should
complain about these numbers, because they're very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase's revenue in the quarter rose 11 percent, to $5.14 billion
from $4.62 billion in last year's first quarter. Revenue from the
New York bank's global corporate business, Chase's most important
segment and the one that includes trading, rose 8 percent, to $2.6
billion, while profits in the unit rose 11 percent, to $882
million. Trading revenue rose 21 percent to a record $837 million.
But investment banking fees fell 12 percent, to $317 million, on
weakness in the leveraged-finance business.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer unit, Chase's other main business, saw sales climb
12 percent, to $2.16 billion. But that business is much less
profitable than Chase's corporate business, generating earnings of
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Corp., the fourth-largest bank in the country and the
product of last year's merger of Bank One and First Chicago NBD
Corp., also reported strong earnings Tuesday. It said profits
jumped 23 percent, to $1.15 billion, or 96 cents a share, from $933
million, or 78 cents a share, in the first quarter last year. The
Chicago-based bank said that on an operating basis, earnings rose
nearly 16 percent, to $1.05 billion, or 88 cents a share, from $909
million, or 76 cents, meeting analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the shares slipped 25 cents, to $59, Tuesday as investors'
confidence in the bank weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One's stock was severely battered in the wake of last
year's merger as questions arose about the company's ability to
rein in expenses and still increase revenue, although it has
recovered smartly in recent months. But while yesterday's results
showed renewed expense discipline, Bank One still reported numbers
that, in Wall Street parlance, were ``noisy.'' The results included
$360 million of one-time gains offset by merger and restructuring
charges of $204 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also posted a big increase in nonperforming assets, a
harbinger of possible lending problems. It had $1.15 billion in
nonperforming assets in the quarter, up from $819 million at the
end of last year and far above the $670 million at the end of 1997.
Bank One said the recent surge was a result of $302 million of
problem loans to financial services and energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, were cautiously optimistic about the
bank's outlook. ``The issue still is whether the company will grow
the rest of the year,'' said Henry Dickson, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``So far, I think the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. of San Francisco, the seventh-largest bank in
the country, said its first-quarter earnings rose 29 percent, to
$884 million, or 53 cents a share, from $684 million, or 41 cents a
share in the comparable quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   The results exceeded analysts' expectations of 50 cents a share,
sending the bank's shares up $1.25 Tuesday, to $42.375. Wells
attributed its strong performance to solid growth in mortgage
lending and returns from venture capital investments.

LYCOS TOPS YAHOO IN INTERNET RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, Internet company Lycos Inc. has said its on-line
audience would soon surpass that of industry bellwether Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   According to a leading Internet ratings firm, that's exactly
what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   New figures from Media Metrix Inc. found that 51.8 percent of
the nation's Internet users visited a Lycos Web site last month,
compared with 50.8 percent for Yahoo. New York-based Media Metrix
is generally considered the most trusted source of data on the
popularity of the top Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Metrix survey found that just under 32 million people
visited Lycos-owned sites in March, compared to 31.2 million
visitors to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world and just about every one in it said I was quixotic
in my quest to pass Yahoo,'' said Lycos chief executive Bob Davis
from company headquarters in Waltham, Mass. ``And here we are and
we've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos's growth has been driven by a series of acquisitions of
other major Internet companies, such as the Tripod and Angelfire
Web site hosting services, the WhoWhere Internet directory service,
and the Wired Digital news service, as well as the Lycos and Hotbot
Internet search sites.
</P>
<P>
   Each site is run as a separate entity, but all are linked under
an entity known as the Lycos Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Metrix ratings for Lycos are based on the total
visitors to all sites in the Lycos Network. By contrast, Yahoo
builds all its services around a single core site.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is presently moving to close its controversial deal to
merge with media properties now owned by USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report Tuesday on the CNBC financial news TV
channel, USA Networks chief executive Barry Diller is in talks with
possible partners who may join his bid for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Diller refused to comment to CNBC on the report, which raises
the possibility that the USA/Lycos deal could be restructured.
Major shareholders have bitterly criticized the deal, saying it
offers too low a return to Lycos shareholders. Lycos's largest
shareholder, CMGI Inc., an Internet venture capital firm, opposes
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock closed down $1 7/8 to $73 7/8 on the Nasdaq .

 &HT;    Third time will be charming _ if not 'dangerous' _ for Red Wings
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Detroit Red Wings overcame a 41-year NHL title
dought in 1997 that had turned Motown into Woetown, and then last
season they had to face several emotional obstacles to accomplish
the rare feat of consecutive Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Red Wings prepare to open the defense as two-time
hockey kings, they find themselves in an unenviable position. Many
people expect them to win it all, when reality screams otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations probably weren't as high last year as they are
now,'' Wings general manager Ken Holland said Tuesday. ``But now
we've won it two straight years, and we made all those deals at the
deadline and people expect us to do it again. But every team out
there is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some more than others. Detroit drew Anaheim as a first-round
opponent, which _ despite the Mighty Ducks' possession of two of
the league's top scorers, Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya _ should
send the Red Wings into the second round. But some people think
that Colorado, the stronger team for most of the season, could end
Detroit's reign there.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, in fact, was only the third-best team in the Western
Conference during the season, behind the Avalanche and the Dallas
Stars. Colorado added high-scoring Theo Fleury to an already deep
lineup, and the Stars added Brett Hull in the offseason and
recorded a franchise record 51 wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings had to scramble to finish that high. They went
9-2-1 after a flurry of trades just before the deadline added Chris
Chelios, Wendel Clark, Ulf Samuelsson and Bill Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings did not have the best regular-season record in either
of their title seasons, but their road to the finals probably
wasn't this difficult. If they can pull it off, they would be the
first team team to win at least three straight Cups since the New
York Islanders won four in a row,1979-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've reached a point as a team where we really judge
our season on the postseason,'' forward Brendan Shanahan said.
``And that's a nice place to be. It says something for where we are
as an organization. We've kind of raised the bar and raised the
level of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   By the admission of players and coaches, that attitude hurt the
Wings for most of this season. Holland's late-season deals added
depth to a roster that had been hurt by injuries and other moves,
but more importantly it seemed to wake up players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't necessarily make the trades to get the rest of the
team to respond,'' Holland said, ``but it certainly worked out that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland also knows better than to assume a series win over the
Ducks. In 1994, Detroit lost in the first round to San Jose. The
NHL playoffs annually presents upsets on the scale of the NCAA
Tournament. Last year, Colorado lost in the first round to
Edmonton, and New Jersey was stunned by Ottawa. Both losing head
coaches, Marc Crawford and Jacques Lemaire, lost their jobs despite
having won Stanley Cups. Detroit's Scotty Bowman isn't going to get
fired if the Wings lose, but he could retire, regardless of the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This year's playoffs won't feature the NHL's all-time greatest
scorer, Wayne Gretzky, nor probably its current greatest player,
Eric Lindros, who is recovering from a collapsed lung and whose
Philadelphia team has a collapsed defense. The Flyers, who face
Toronto, might not make it out of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round will feature Dallas trying to avoid another
playoff collapse, Ottawa trying to prove that its 103 points in the
regular season wasn't a fluke and Dominik Hasek again trying to
carry the Buffalo Sabres on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Holland is anything but overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've done for six months means nothing,'' he said.
``All you have to do is come off your game a little, and in 10 to
12 days your season is over. People think we're an overwhelming
favorite to beat Anaheim because we've won two Cups. But I don't
buy it.

 &HT;    NHL PLAYOFF CAPSULES
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON VS. DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   Records: Edmonton 33-37-12, second in Northwest; Dallas
51-19-12, first in Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Edmonton 10-9-3, Dallas 12-8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Dallas won 3-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: Edmonton is 27-31; Dallas is 36-32 with one
finals appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Edmonton stunned Dallas in the opening round two
years ago. Don't expect a repeat. The Oilers' goaltending has been
inconsistent all season, thanks to the free-agency loss of Curtis
Joseph. The Oilers are young and fast but short on experience and
point production, particularly with injuries to Bill Guerin. While
Edmonton loses players to the open market, Dallas gains them (Brett
Hull, Ed Belfour). The Stars had the league's best record,
including a franchise-record 51 wins, allowed the fewest goals
(168, 2.05) and appear primed for a title run. The absence of
suspended captain/defenseman Derian Hatcher shouldn't make a huge
difference this round.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Dallas in five games.
</P>
<P>
   SAN JOSE VS. COLORADO
</P>
<P>
   Records: San Jose 31-33-18, fourth in Pacific; Colorado
44-28-10, first in Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: San Jose 11-7-4, Colorado 14-6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Colorado won 3-1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: San Jose is 13-18; Colorado/Quebec is 33-25
with one Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: With a hot Patrick Roy in goal and forwards who seem
to have committed themselves under first-year coach Bob Hartley,
the Avalanche would have been among the Cup favorites even before
adding Theo Fleury at the trading deadline. Forward Vincent
Damphousse was a nice pickup for the Sharks, but their only hope in
this series is if goalies Mike Vernon and Steve Shields can shut
down the Avalanche's deep attack. Down the stretch, Shields was
10-2-3 and Vernon 0-4-1, but the latter is expected to start the
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Avalanche in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM VS. DETROIT
</P>
<P>
   Records: Anaheim 35-34-13, third in Pacific; Detroit 43-32-7,
first in Central.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: Anaheim 9-9-4, Detroit 12-8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Detroit won 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: Anaheim is 4-7; Detroit is 67-44 with two
Stanley Cups and one finals loss.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: The Red Wings won eight in a row after late-season
trades for Chris Chelios, Wendel Clark, Ulf Samuelsson and Bill
Ranford. The deals mostly woke up others on the roster, leading to
better defensive play by the defenseman and forwards. Anaheim
doesn't have the depth to compete: the attack is limited to two
players, Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, who combined for 86 goals
during the season but figure to wear down against coach Scotty
Bowman's rotation of lines. The Mighty Ducks went only 1-5-2 in
their last eight and are 1-10-3 all-time at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Detroit in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS VS. PHOENIX
</P>
<P>
   Records: St. Louis 37-32-13, second in Central; Phoenix
39-31-12, second in Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter: St. Louis 11-8-3; Phoenix 9-11-2.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: St. Louis won 2-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs in decade: St. Louis is 33-37; Phoenix/Winnipeg is
10-16.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: The Coyotes are the best example of why the early
part of the season should be ignored. They played .800 hockey
(15-3-2) through 20 games, then .468 (24-28-10) the rest of the
way. Worse, they have lost their second-best player, forward Jeremy
Roenick, for the playoffs with a fractured jaw and they weren't a
high-scoring team to begin with. Phoenix's best hope is for a
tight-checking, low-scoring series, punctuated by the goaltending
of Nikolai Khabibulin. But the Blues have a solid attack with Pavol
Demitra, Geoff Courtnall and Pierre Turgeon, and Al MacInnis
anchors a strong power play.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: St. Louis in six games.

 &HT;    Report says secretaries will become coordinators
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology and an increasingly mobile work force will
transform many of today's secretaries and administrative assistants
into information coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six years, information coordinators will be the
``ground control'' for the rapidly evolving workplace, according to
a report on the office of the future. ICs will serve as the
critical communication link among far-flung employees, people
working on projects and telecommuters. They will also provide
training for teams working on new technologies, according to the
report by OfficeTeam, an international staffing company in Menlo
Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will provide the necessary human element to `smooth out'
electronic communication,'' said Diane Domeyer, executive director
of OfficeTeam.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Office of the Future: 2005'' forecast comes as many of the
nation's estimated 3 million office professionals mark Professional
Secretaries Day today.

   The OfficeTeam study found that administrative assistants will
have a major impact on selecting and implementing new technologies,
according to 56 percent of the 150 executives at the nation's top
1,000 firms. They also will assume more responsibility in an
entry-level way for Internet research, desktop publishing, help
desk or computer training and assistance as well as Web page
development. They will also be called on to manage more projects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to technical competence, people skills will be at a
premium, the study found. Seventy-seven percent of the 1,400 chief
information officers polled said that increased use of technology
will require workers to communicate more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it could well be your interpersonal and communication
skills that make or break your career,'' the study concludes.
</P>
<P>
   OfficeTeam commissioned an independent research firm to get a
realistic snapshot of the workplace in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the office of the future looks like, according to
the research, as well as some of the top concerns:
</P>
<P>
   _ E-mail and videoconferencing will be the leading forms of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wireless communication, voice-activated technology and
personal digital assistants will be the three most prevalent forms
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-managed work teams will increase productivity.
Eighty-four percent of executives believe employees have adopted a
better attitude toward teamwork in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offices will be smaller and more people will telecommute.
Workspaces will also be open to accommodate teams of workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Balancing work and family will be the No. 1 career concern,
surpassing competitive pay and job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt that technology will virtually transform
the office of the future, with technical skills a prerequisite for
career success,'' the report noted.

 &HT;    Third time will be charming _ if not 'dangerous' _ for Red Wings
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Detroit Red Wings overcame a 41-year NHL title
dought in 1997 that had turned Motown into Woetown, and then last
season they had to face several emotional obstacles to accomplish
the rare feat of consecutive Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Red Wings prepare to open the defense as two-time
hockey kings, they find themselves in an unenviable position. Many
people expect them to win it all, when reality screams otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations probably weren't as high last year as they are
now,'' Wings general manager Ken Holland said Tuesday. ``But now
we've won it two straight years, and we made all those deals at the
deadline and people expect us to do it again. But every team out
there is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some more than others. Detroit drew Anaheim as a first-round
opponent, which _ despite the Mighty Ducks' possession of two of
the league's top scorers, Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya _ should
send the Red Wings into the second round. But some people think
that Colorado, the stronger team for most of the season, could end
Detroit's reign there.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, in fact, was only the third-best team in the Western
Conference during the season, behind the Avalanche and the Dallas
Stars. Colorado added high-scoring Theo Fleury to an already deep
lineup, and the Stars added Brett Hull in the offseason and
recorded a franchise record 51 wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings had to scramble to finish that high. They went
9-2-1 after a flurry of trades just before the deadline added Chris
Chelios, Wendel Clark, Ulf Samuelsson and Bill Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings did not have the best regular-season record in either
of their title seasons, but their road to the finals probably
wasn't this difficult. If they can pull it off, they would be the
first team team to win at least three straight Cups since the New
York Islanders won four in a row,1979-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've reached a point as a team where we really judge
our season on the postseason,'' forward Brendan Shanahan said.
``And that's a nice place to be. It says something for where we are
as an organization. We've kind of raised the bar and raised the
level of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   By the admission of players and coaches, that attitude hurt the
Wings for most of this season. Holland's late-season deals added
depth to a roster that had been hurt by injuries and other moves,
but more importantly it seemed to wake up players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't necessarily make the trades to get the rest of the
team to respond,'' Holland said, ``but it certainly worked out that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland also knows better than to assume a series win over the
Ducks. In 1994, Detroit lost in the first round to San Jose. The
NHL playoffs annually presents upsets on the scale of the NCAA
Tournament. Last year, Colorado lost in the first round to
Edmonton, and New Jersey was stunned by Ottawa. Both losing head
coaches, Marc Crawford and Jacques Lemaire, lost their jobs despite
having won Stanley Cups. Detroit's Scotty Bowman isn't going to get
fired if the Wings lose, but he could retire, regardless of the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This year's playoffs won't feature the NHL's all-time greatest
scorer, Wayne Gretzky, nor probably its current greatest player,
Eric Lindros, who is recovering from a collapsed lung and whose
Philadelphia team has a collapsed defense. The Flyers, who face
Toronto, might not make it out of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round will feature Dallas trying to avoid another
playoff collapse, Ottawa trying to prove that its 103 points in the
regular season wasn't a fluke and Dominik Hasek again trying to
carry the Buffalo Sabres on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Holland is anything but overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've done for six months means nothing,'' he said.
``All you have to do is come off your game a little, and in 10 to
12 days your season is over. People think we're an overwhelming
favorite to beat Anaheim because we've won two Cups. But I don't
buy it.

 &HT;    CONGRESS STRUGGLES FOR RESPONSE TO BALKAN FIGHTING
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid disarray in Congress over what to do about the
undeclared war against Yugoslavia, a bipartisan group of senators
led by John McCain, R-Ariz., introduced a resolution Tuesday
authorizing President Clinton to use ``all necessary force.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, the House Republican leadership said it
would allow a vote next week on whether to bring U.S. forces home
under the War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in the middle, lawmakers led by Sens. Max Cleland,
D-Ga., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, are pressing the president to
provide ``clear and distinct objectives'' and tell Congress what
``defines the endpoint'' for the military operation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to be released Wednesday, the senators reminded
Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen of a measure passed
last year requiring the administration to give such information
whenever deploying more than 500 personnel on a military mission.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear whether any of the efforts would bring
decisive action.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he hoped his resolution ``will encourage the
administration and our allies to find the courage and resolve to
prosecute this war in the manner most likely to result in its early
and successful conclusion.'' Presumably, that would include ground
troops if Clinton changed his mind and decided to employ them.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a presidential candidate and a consistent voice of
concern on the Balkan crisis, told his colleagues, ``Our central
purpose is to encourage Congress to meet its responsibilities,
responsibilities that we have thus far evaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was unclear when the Senate leadership would permit
a vote on the proposal, which is cosponsored by Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del. and several other members.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers said they were in no hurry to make a final
determination on a war that many say they prefer to leave as the
president's responsibility for now, despite widespread
dissatisfaction with its conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't get to the floor very soon,'' Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla., said of McCain's plan. Nickles said he would not
want to see the resolution approved, but neither would he want it
to be defeated because of the message it might send to President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain responses to the escalating crisis came as a new
delegation of lawmakers returned from a fact-finding tour of the
Balkans, voicing fresh concerns over the Clinton administration's
handling of the crisis. Some members took note of the arrival
Tuesday morning of 24 Apache attack helicopters and the troops to
support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Apaches, we're coming as close as possible to a
ground war,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ala., the Appropriations
Committee chairman and one of the leaders of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch critic of the NATO air war in the Balkans, Stevens
said he returned believing that ``the stubbornness of the State
Department has got us into a war that I don't know how we're going
to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Stevens and other Republican leaders made it clear that
they intend to grant the Clinton administration's request for $6
billion for the Balkans operation and to double or even triple the
size of the spending package. House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, has suggested that $10 billion may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have also used the request as an opportunity to
blast the Clinton administration's record on defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a period when the U.S. military has conducted some two dozen
``operational events,'' Armey charged, ``the Clinton-Gore
administration has drastically reduced our military capabilities''
and reduced the armed services by more than 800,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
   That criticism has become a refrain among Republicans amid
widespread reports of shortages of spare parts, recruitment
shortfalls, and, most recently, the admission that supplies of
air-launched cruise missiles are running out.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Cohen conceded last week to the Senate Armed
Services Committee that the air war in the Balkans, which is
expected to involve close to 1,000 U.S. warplanes if all of NATO's
requests are filled, has been a drain on resources.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., a member of the weekend congressional
fact-finding mission to visit U.S. troops and refugee camps in the
Balkan region, echoed the call for increased military funding.
``Our nation is involved in a war that has greatly depleted our
defense resources and has jeopardized campaigns in other regions of
the world,'' he said. ``We have no choice other than to replenish
our resources.''

 &HT;    2 plane crash victims were veteran pilots
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Veteran pilots Ted McFann Sr. and Dan Bouck flew
together Monday in a simulated dogfight over Bartow County.
</P>
<P>
   Bouck, 51, worked for Sky Warriors, an Atlanta company that
sells combat flight fantasy experiences. McFann, 60, was a
third-time Sky Warriors customer.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were killed when their military trainer crashed Monday
afternoon while engaged in a mock dogfight with another plane. The
two people in the second plane returned to Fulton County
Airport-Brown Field unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said the T-34
model A plane crashed at 12:51 p.m. The single-engine plane, built
in 1957, smashed into trees in a field about 10 miles north of
Cartersville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigator Phil Powell said investigators are examining
the plane's systems and fractures in the wreckage to determine what
caused the crash. Powell said he had brief statements from
witnesses and planned to conduct further interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Warriors issued a written statement that said: ``Our
heartfelt sympathy is extended to the families and friends of those
on board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sky Warriors has operated without incident for eight years,
and everyone associated with the company is both shocked and
saddened by what has occurred. It is truly a tragic loss for our
closely bonded squadron.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McFann and Bouck were members of the Delta Airline Pilots
Association in Atlanta. Andy Deane, ALPA union spokesman, said
McFann was a major volunteer in the group and was well liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Capt. McFann from the time I started flying 24 years
ago in Miami,'' Deane said. McFann served on various committees and
as a representative to the Master Executive Council, which governs
ALPA, a pilots labor union with about 50,000 members in the United
States, Deane said. Atlanta is the largest council.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very polished and professional,'' Deane said, ``in fact
so much so one of his last positions with us was chairman of the
professional standards committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee deals with the professional conduct of flight
crews. Dean described McFann as ``thorough and hard-working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very hard worker for the interests of Delta pilots,''
Deane said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after McFann retired more than a year ago, he still
attended ALPA meetings and social events.
</P>
<P>
   McFann and Bouck's attraction to Sky Warriors is natural, Deane
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us come to the job from a military career,'' he said.
``If you're not shooting real bullets at each other, it's an
incredibly exhilarating sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the romance of WW I and open cockpits, the Red
Baron and dogfights, ... there has been a romance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Lynch, a close friend of the McFann family, said the
retired pilot was ``very important in a lot of pilots lives. Ted
was always there for them.'' She said he served in the Navy, but
did not fly in wartime. McFann's son works for Delta, but not as a
pilot, she said.
</P>
<P>
   McFann, who lived in Alpharetta, was born in Marion, Ohio, and
served in the Navy. He was an officer with the Miami Police
Department before joining Delta in 1966. He was honored for 31
years of service when he retired in 1997. When he retired, he was
flying international flights on a L-1011 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Alpharetta Presbyterian Church and is
survived by his wife, Barbara; a daughter, a son, grandchildren and
a sister. The funeral is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sturniolo, a Delta pilot who was based in Miami with
McFann, has known him for about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted was very outgoing,'' he said with a chuckle. ``He was
always heard in an audience. He was the consummate master of
ceremonies. I saw him master a major retirement party of 600 people
_ he commanded attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturniolo said McFann liked to tell a story about when he was a
motorcycle cop in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``While working, he was actually run over by a Orange Bowl
float. He liked to tell that story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouck's family could not be reached for comment. Funeral
arrangements for the Atlanta resident have yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, a Delta spokesman, said Bouck had worked for the
Atlanta-based airline for 21 years. He was based in Atlanta and as
captain flew 767s and 757s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding that several Delta pilots are involved
with the Sky Warriors,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three actual-flight air combat simulation firms
in the country including Sky Warriors. The FAA classifies these
operations as flight instruction businesses. Its only stipulation
is that there must be a certified flight instructor in each
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The combat simulators themselves have rigid safety rules.

BRAZILIAN GOVERNOR DELAYS GM AND FORD PLANS TO BUILD FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Citing the pressure from other priorities on
his state's finances, an opposition governor in southern Brazil has
disrupted plans by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. to build two
car factories regarded as prototypes for automobile manufacturing
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   GM has delayed by at least six months its plans to produce
compact cars at a plant code-named the ``Blue Macaw'' project in
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state. The delay could
affect the automaker's plans for similar factories in the United
States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has put on hold plans to build a plant for its ``Project
Amazon,'' also intended to produce inexpensive small cars.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10,000 jobs related to the factories and more than $1
billion of investments are at stake as the two leading automakers,
already frustrated by a plunge in car sales as Brazil struggles
with recession, seek an agreement with Olivio Dutra, the outspoken
Workers Party governor of Rio Grande do Sul, an industrial state of
10 million people bordering Argentina and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Dutra, who took office in January, suspended an accord that his
predecessor had made with GM and Ford to provide the two companies
with about $280 million of financing and infrastructure in exchange
for their decision to build the factories near Porto Alegre, the
state capital.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rising stars of the Workers Party, the main organized
opposition to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government,
Dutra contends that his state needs the money previously designated
for the factories to finance programs in education, health care and
housing. His statements, peppered with nationalistic sentiment,
have resulted in an impasse between the state government and the
two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The president of GM's Brazilian subsidiary, Frederick Henderson,
said in an interview that ``there are certain things we need like
gas, waste-water treatment, roads and electricity, to proceed.''
Without the government's help in finishing these projects, the GM
factory will not be ready to produce cars until mid-2000 _ about
six months later than expected, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the car producers and Dutra is part of a
wider argument, in which several Brazilian states have resorted to
unorthodox measures to shore up their finances. Another governor,
Itamar Franco of Minas Gerais in central Brazil, declared a
moratorium on his state's debt payments to the federal government
at the beginning of the year, a decision that contributed to a
market panic and a currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Dutra also threatened to default on his state's debt, although
he backed off after pressure from Cardoso. He has since refocused
his energies on GM and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's conflict with the automakers is complicating what
until recently were plans for the two advanced factories, which
have been closely followed by world automakers. GM's Blue Macaw
plant is designed to function as a ``factory condominium,'' as
described by Henderson, in which 16 suppliers operate on the same
site. GM has hoped to produce as many as 150,000 compact cars
annually at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   At the nearby site for the Ford factory, where only the ground
has been prepared for construction to start, suppliers are also
expected to be more involved in production. The Ford plant was
scheduled to start production in 2001, with annual output of
150,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the factory is in such an early stage, representatives
from the state government have said there is a possibility that
Ford may switch the location to another state. Officials from
Ford's Brazilian subsidiary declined to comment on their
negotiations with Rio Grande do Sul.
</P>
<P>
   Dutra has tried to explain his actions by saying that the
incentives granted by the previous governor, Antonio Britto, were
unrealistic, given Rio Grande do Sul's need to provide improved
basic services to the people. In addition, the state government
faces a budget deficit of roughly $60 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luiz Vianna Moraes, the state development secretary
responsible for negotiating directly with GM and Ford, said that as
a result of Britto's concessions, ``now we're paying the price.''

NATO'S ABILITY TO CUT OFF YUGOSLAV FUEL SUPPLIES IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as Defense Secretary William Cohen asserted
again Tuesday that NATO was succeeding in cutting off the supply of
fuel for Yugoslav troops, a growing number of U.S. and European
military experts and planners say that goal will not be reached for
many months, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take months at the very least,'' said a NATO military
official. ``Yes, the oil refineries are destroyed and so are some
oil storage depots but the Serbs will continue to have the fuel
they need for months and months.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the flow of fuel needed to run Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's war machine has become a top goal of the
alliance's air campaign. But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said Tuesday that the diplomats coming to the NATO summit meeting
in Washington this weekend have yet to agree on how to solve ``the
problem of oil coming into the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem centers on how to block oil shipments
arriving at the port of Bar in Montenegro, one of two republics
remaining in Yugoslavia, along with the larger Serbia. Since the
air war began, an American analyst said Tuesday, 8 to 10 oil
tankers have docked at Bar and delivered 40,000 to 45,000 metric
tons of refined fuel, or roughly 300,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tankers came from Greece, Russia and Ukraine, the
analyst said. But the ``biggest culprit'' was a merchant tanker,
the Kaliope, flying the Panamanian flag. It is a newcomer to the
Adriatic Sea and has been operating along the coast and picking up
cargo from other tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO air strikes recently cut off the pipeline connecting
Bar to Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, the oil has had to be
shipped overland for use by Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of the United States, the NATO allies are
considering setting up a naval picket line outside Bar to prevent
tankers from delivering oil. But European political leaders,
especially the French, are worried that any naval blockade would
widen the war and require approval by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But as military experts point out, the problem is larger than
the port of Bar. Aware of the debate and the vulnerability of Bar,
Milosevic is already trying to bring oil in through other coastal
ports, the American analyst said, and on overland routes through
neighboring countries like Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Serbs' campaign of ejecting Albanians from the
Serbian province of Kosovo requires very little fuel compared with
traditional military campaigns. And Serbian troops in Kosovo are
dug in with stockpiles of food and supplies, including fuel.
Finally, even in classic air wars, cutting off fuel supplies is one
of the trickiest endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely crazy,'' said Elliot Cohen, who directed the
Pentagon's study of the air war in Iraq. ``During World War II, it
made a difference because the Germans had to consume a lot of fuel
to wage war. The Serbs barely have to drive around.''
</P>
<P>
   While the allies have convinced Croatia, a former Yugoslav
republic, to cut off its pipeline to Serbia, it still receives fuel
smuggled in from the Serbian area of Bosnia, another former
republic, and from Bulgaria. With such porous borders, experts
argue, the allied campaign to choke off the fuel supplies would be
far more effective if ground troops were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air war will cut off enough fuel so that the Serbs won't
be able to resist a ground war,'' said Michael O'Hanlon of the
Brookings Institution. ``But they'll have enough to defeat the
KLA,'' the Kosovo Albanian rebels, ``and complete ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials deny that is the case and argue that something
has to be done to cut off supplies brought through the port and by
smugglers across the borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true you don't need tanks to run unarmed women and
children out of villages,'' said a Pentagon spokesman. ``But it
would make no sense to ignore those oil supplies coming in when
we're trying to destroy Milosevic's ability to retain control over
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf War Air Power Survey, the definitive Air Force study
of the war, Cohen found that even though the allies waged a far
more intense air campaign and the air strikes ``succeeded in
reducing the flow of supplies'' from Iraq to Kuwait, the Iraqis
nonetheless had enough fuel and other supplies ``to sustain an
inert army.''
</P>
<P>
   To underline that point, Cohen quotes one of the commanders of
the air war in the gulf, Charles Horner, then a lieutenant general,
on the shortcomings of an air war on its own in cutting off the
supplies of fuel and other essentials of warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that does a campaign against transportation systems
had better beware!'' he said. ``It looks deceivingly easy. It is a
tough nut to crack.``
</P>
<P>
   Other experts argue that the heavy concentration on the fuel
supplies is a surrogate for the bombing campaign the alliance
military planners wish they could wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a surrogate, a stopgap, for the targets they can't
hit, `` said William Arkin, an air power expert. ``When you set up
a targeting strategy where leadership, electricity and other things
are off the list, then you hit what you can hit.``

PHILIP MORRIS CITES PROFIT GAIN FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showing considerable strength despite financial pressure from
shrinking demand for cigarettes and the cost of tobacco-related
lawsuit settlements, Philip Morris Cos. said Tuesday that its
first-quarter profit rose 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Profit from operations rose to $1.96 billion, or 80 cents a
diluted share, from $1.93 billion, or 79 cents a share, in the
quarter a year earlier. That met analysts' estimates, according to
First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings. Revenue rose 6.1
percent, to $19.5 billion from $18.4 billion
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $1.79 billion, or 73 cents a share, up from $1.38
billion, or 57 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results came even as the company paid out $1.1 billion to
the 46 states involved in the $206 billion settlement of
tobacco-related litigation last November. Moreover, operating
income in its domestic tobacco business fell 7.3 percent, to $1
billion, at a time of shrinking sales and intense promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They earned slightly more money, even after incurring that
$1.1 billion,'' said Marc Cohen, a tobacco analyst for Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. ``That's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason, he added, was that sales of cigarettes were
stronger than expected after a large price increase, which was
announced on the heels of the settlement last fall. Even though
Philip Morris' domestic cigarette sales volume fell, he said, it
dropped less than expected. ``There was great concern earlier this
year that we would see massive volume declines as a result of price
increases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more of those sales were higher-priced Marlboros,
rather than less-expensive brands. The market share of the heavily
promoted Marlboros rose 2.2 percentage points, to 36 percent, while
that of Basic, a low-budget brand, rose just 0.1 percent, to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been concerned about a trading-down that might occur,
so they put Marlboro on special,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global
consumer products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``What they got
instead was a trading up. The percentage of volume in the premium
end actually increased.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's international tobacco profits grew slightly, with
slumping demand in markets like Russia, Germany and Brazil erasing
much of the gains made elsewhere. Sales in Korea, Singapore,
Malaysia and Thailand rose, the company said, although overall
international volume declined 11.2 percent in the quarter.
Operating income rose nine-tenths of a percent, to $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Miller Brewing Co. unit, where lagging performance
led to the dismissal of three top executives earlier this month,
had a 6.3 percent increase in operating income. Shipments of Miller
Lite, the flagship brand, fell 1.2 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Income at Kraft Foods North America, which makes products such
as Oscar Mayer meats and Velveeta, rose 5 percent, which analysts
said was somewhat weak. ``It appears that the underlying growth
rate is still 2 to 3 percent, and that there was some
inventory-building in the fourth quarter,'' Cohen said. ``Broadly
speaking, the categories looked strong, although Maxwell House was
soft.'' The company's Post cereal brands also declined in volume,
which the company blamed on ``aggressive competitive activity and
an overall decline in the ready-to-eat cereal category.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods International increased its operating income by 5.1
percent in the quarter, although lower costs were offset in part by
shrinking sales volume in Eastern Europe and Latin America. The
division also spent heavily to advertise its brands.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Philip Morris rose $1.125 Tuesday, to $34.25.

STITH TOUTS AFRICAN NATIONS' INVESTMENT POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of prodding banks to reinvest in the inner city,
Charles R. Stith has found another marginalized constituency to
trumpet to US investors _ the entire continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Stith assumed the job of US ambassador to Tanzania last August
amid the turmoil after a terrorist bomb struck the embassy in Dar
Es Salam within hours of a twin bombing in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for the former Boston minister and black
activist to have been mired in security issues the past eight
months. Then there was Clinton's trip _ the first visit of a US
president to Africa _ to help coordinate earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Stith, 48, has kept his focus on what he sees as a much
greater threat to Africans than terrorist bombs over the long term
_ being marginalized in a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Africa has not had the infrastructure or the
regulated banking system to rate equal footing with trading
partners around the world, Stith said Tuesday at a lunchtime speech
to the World Affairs Council in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Germany's former enemies gave the recovering
nation a debt ceiling of 3.5 percent on loans from the the allies
to rebuild the country. But no cap has ever been set on African
countries that have been forced by famine and war to rely heavily
on western lending.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania itself, although stable for the past 30 years, has been
spent most of that time under socialist rule. It still suffers, he
said, ``from a socialist hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   The past weighs heavily on the economy: Tanzania presently
spends three times more money on debt service to various countries
than it does on educating its children.
</P>
<P>
   How, Stith asked, will Tanzania's workers ever compete in a
global economy if they are not schooled to do so?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to turn handouts to hand-ups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stith said the bombing itself was a sign of change in Dar es
Salaam, the Tanzanian capital. Terrorist violence had been
sporadic, he said, evident from the translation of the name itself:
``city of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bomb went off on Aug. 7, it was clear that the rules
had changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shift to a market economy in 1986, and more recently
to a multiparty government, Tanzania had become more vulnerable to
the rebels it used to accommodate in its socialist days, Stith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as capitalism takes root in Africa, some of the
continent's most promising business and academic leaders are taking
advantage of newly opened borders to flee.
</P>
<P>
   One tally holds that more than 30,000 Africans with doctorate
degrees live outside the continent, Stith said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep budding business leaders in Africa, Stith said, banks
must be backed by enough foreign capital to give customers the
confidence that they can keep their money in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Stith said he learned that lesson from an embassy employee who
was so afraid to put his savings in a local bank that he sought to
keep it in the ambassador's safe.
</P>
<P>
   There are promising developments, however, that should encourage
investment, Stith said. Mining exploration has skyrocketed over the
past six months, reflecting confidence in stability.
</P>
<P>
   And the entire continent has been buoyed by President Clinton's
visit, highlighting US interests in a long-term investment in
Africa, Stith said.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has a long way to go if it is to close the
``gap between rhetoric and reality,'' in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to `talk the talk,' he said. ``Now we need to
`walk the walk.' ''

TRYING ON NEW NAMES TO PLUMB THE MYSTERY OF ``I''  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Michael Kramer is the pop-jazz producer at nytoday.com, a New York
Times web site.  
 By MICHAEL KRAMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Identity is the crisis can't you see,'' declared the female
singer Marion Elliott, better known as Poly Styrene, in a 1978 punk
rock song. Proving the prescience of Ms. Elliott's words, a number
of musicians have begun to explore notions of identity, so often a
part of pop music's appeal, by adopting not just one pseudonym but
many.
</P>
<P>
   They make the continual reinventing of musical personas perhaps
as entertaining and meaningful as the music itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hip-hop producer Robert Diggs (known as RZA), the
underground rocker Will Oldham (Palace) and the electronica
experimentalist Paul Miller (DJ Spooky aka That Subliminal Kid),
among others, move through multiple aliases as if names were so
many outfits in a costume closet.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that pop music is as much about role-playing as
instrument playing, they raise intriguing questions about identity.
Is a person by any other name still the same person? Can a renamed
individual actually become someone new? Or do musicians with more
than one name become something in between?
</P>
<P>
   Using aliases to refashion identity has a long history in
popular culture, from Hollywood actors to pulp fiction authors. In
pop music, some names have been humorous, as in the Big Bopper
(Jiles Perry Richardson). Others have transformed musicians into
more marketable entities: Gordon Sumner became Sting, Steve
Georgiou became Cat Stevens, Mary O'Brien became Dusty Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Not until recently, however, have individual musicians employed
so many different pseudonyms, and rarely have they used them so
often to examine identity.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say they're the first musicians to experiment with
more than one pseudonym. In the 1970s, David Bowie (born David
Jones) recreated himself as Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane and the
Thin White Duke. But Bowie's name changing always came across as
self-indulgent and commercially calculated.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the current batch of multiple
pseudonym-takers is that they seem less concerned with the
stylishness or financial success of their alter egos than with the
simple thrill of continually concocting new versions of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Something very American and democratic also unites them. In
their hyperkinetic fashion, these musicians echo a practice of
taking new names that runs deep in American culture, from European
immigrants eager to assimilate to African-Americans reacting
against the legacy of slavery. They enact a kind of egalitarianism,
the longheld American dream that given identities matter less than
self-invented ones.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, their multiple aliases are reflective of modern
developments like the Internet, in which identity becomes a
scrambled, many-layered thing of alternate e-mail names and
disembodied chat room exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named everything like Adam named things in the Garden of
Eden,'' Diggs, said last year, referring to how he and the members
of the loosely affiliated group he leads, the Wu-Tang Clan,
recreate themselves and their environs from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   When Diggs put on a mask, took on a new moniker and released an
album called ``RZA as Bobby Digital in Stereo,'' his behaviour
harked back to the Mississippi blues guitarist Charlie Patton. In
the 1920s, Patton also concealed his face and took on a new name,
the Masked Marvel.
</P>
<P>
   But while Patton's disguise was merely a promotional gimmick _
his record label gave away free recordings to anyone who could
identify the singer _ Diggs' alter ego is more complicated. Bobby
Digital is a full-fledged fictional character, the street-tough
protagonist (played by Diggs) of a direct-to-video movie. The
pseudonym is also an allusion, at once casual and coldly high-tech,
to Diggs' actual name.
</P>
<P>
   Playing himself once removed, Diggs obfuscates his true
identity. Behind his mask, he teases listeners. Is the real Diggs
the violent, low-down Bobby Digital or the artistic, sophisticated
RZA? Shifting between his alter egos, Diggs manages to become a
sort of trickster figure, changing names and shapes like a video
game superhero.
</P>
<P>
   Oldham pursues a similar strategy of multiple aliases. Recording
his quirky songs _ which can resemble the folk-rock musings of Neil
Young _ Oldham has employed different pseudonyms for a decade. He
possesses a fine sense of the absurd, releasing solo albums under
the name of Palace Brothers and group efforts, recorded with his
actual brothers, under the name Will Oldham.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as Palace, Oldham now calls himself Bonnie Prince
Billy, an apparent nod to Prince (born Prince Rogers Nelson), a
musician infamous for changing his name to an odd symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics on Oldham's album aren't related to anyone in actual
life, he said recently. Yet his songs are rife with what seem to be
ironic self-references. Characters like Stable Will, Billy Riley
and Pushkin Will make appearances, suggesting that Oldham himself
is a central, if fictionalized, figure in his own work; a listener
doesn't know which is part of the allure of Oldham's songs.
</P>
<P>
   Oldham's many pseudonyms, like his songs, possess a spiritual
component. For him, changing names is, as he put it, ``religious
more than anything.'' Going one step farther than the country
singer Hank Williams, who used the alter ego Luke the Drifter to
tell tales of sin and salvation, Oldham adopts multiple names to
make himself timelessly enigmatic yet ultra modern.
</P>
<P>
   While Oldham can strike a rustic pose with his pseudonyms,
Miller uses his aliases to create an air of science fiction. ``For
me it all comes down to the word persona,'' he said. ``It comes
from the word per, which means person but also means through, and
sona, which is like sonar _ sound waves _ so persona means a person
moving through sound waves.''
</P>
<P>
   While his etymology may be suspect, Miller makes music that does
seem to move through sound, creating evocative but disembodied
sonic collages under the guise of his two-pronged alias (Spooky
comes from a television commercial and That Subliminal Kid from a
William S. Burroughs novel). He also writes articles under his
given name.
</P>
<P>
   While his writing can be almost musical in its stream of
consciousness, the music Miller makes is highly abstract and
theoretical, sampling other recordings to comment on their cultural
significance. Moving among his aliases, he confounds the
traditional roles of performer and critic.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the disorienting world of multiple aliases created by
Miller, Diggs, Oldham and others like the rappers Keith Horton
(Kool Keith, Dr. Octagon, Black Elvis) and Russell Jones (Ol' Dirty
Bastard, Big Baby Jesus, Osirus), the quandary of identity can
appear to take place in a funhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Because they use so many pseudonyms, even their given names seem
to become distorted images of the actual person, who can never
truly be recognized. These musicians make identity something
joylessly unstable, forever mutating and ultimately mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common thing to change your name,'' one of pop music's
most famous name-changers, Bob Dylan (ne Robert Zimmerman), said in
a 1978 interview with Playboy magazine, adding: ``It isn't that
incredible? Many people do it. Names are labels so we can refer to
one another. But deep down inside us, we don't have a name. We have
no name.''

`MAD TV': IT'S SOMETIMES LIVE! IT'S ON SATURDAY NIGHT! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 25)  
 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for The New York Times Arts and
Leisure section was about actor Sean Hayes.  
 (bl)  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the Hollywood sound stage where ``Mad TV'' is
filmed, a pair of sketches were being shot recently that perfectly
encapsulated this late-night show's fascinating inconsistency. In
one of the pop culture parodies at which the show excels, series
regular Aries Spears was using an impression of hothead
prizefighter Mike Tyson to spoof a Gap clothing commercial. ``This
is easy!'' Spears exclaimed in a high-pitched lisp, shortly after
burying his head into the neck of one of the extras swing dancing
around him, then rearing back with a bloody prosthetic ear jiggling
from his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, the ``Mad TV'' gang went to work on the other
kind of bit they are known for. In ``Singing Telegram
Misadventures,'' a ball-gowned psychotic (Nicole Sullivan) kidnaps
a man (Pat Kilbane), forces him to warble ``Happy Anniversary''
with her to a married couple (Andrew Bowen and Debra Wilson), then
whips out a gun and kills everyone in the room. At the end,
inexplicably, the ``Yo quiero Taco Bell'' Chihuahua appears. If
ever a sketch was destined to elicit a ``huh?'' instead of laughs,
this was it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, erratic quality is de rigueur for the sketch-show
genre. It's all about the overall content: if the touchdowns are
memorable enough, it's worth sitting through the incomplete passes.
The young male demographic has grasped this about ``Mad TV'' since
1995, when Quincy Jones and David Salzman pitched the series as a
way for Fox to siphon away the X-chromosome contingent from NBC's
``Saturday Night Live'' audience. (``Mad TV'' starts at 11 p.m., a
half-hour before ``Saturday Night Live.'')
</P>
<P>
   But if the boys and girls in baggy jeans whooping and hollering
in the bleachers at a recent Friday night taping were any
indication, the show has become as much a draw to 12- to
17-year-olds, of both sexes. And now ``Mad TV'' is gaining among
18- to 49-year-olds as well, showing 18 percent growth in this age
group _ a group that includes grown-ups heretofore considered far
too loyal to ``Saturday Night Live'' ever to switch to an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mad TV'' cast and creative staff have detected other
evidence of rising popularity: thank-you notes and
cellophane-wrapped muffin baskets have arrived at their office,
expressions of gratitude from some of Hollywood's hottest producers
for how deftly they satirized their films or television shows. For
a hard-working group that has always lived with the threat of
cancellation and borne the indignity of having an already spartan
budget whittled down to about $700,000 per episode (``Saturday
Night Live'' reportedly spends twice as much), finding itself the
hip underdog is a sweet morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, when I came to `Mad TV,' it was like we were
Juliette Lewis in `The Other Sister' _ the retarded one that nobody
talked about,'' said Terry Sweeney, a ``Saturday Night Live''
alumnus and now a ``Mad TV'' staff writer. ``Now we're like
Cinderella. We're just trying to get past our big, ugly stepsister,
`Saturday Night Live,' and get to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact reasons behind this change aren't clear. There is the
theory that the three new cast members _ Michael McDonald, Mo
Collins and Andrew Bowen, each of whom arrived with a clutch of new
characters _ meshed so perfectly with the seven established
principal players that the whole became greater than the sum of its
parts. Some point to this season's hiring of Dick Blasucci as
executive producer. Blasucci, a veteran of the hallowed comedy show
``Second City TV,'' encouraged the actors to collaborate more with
the writing staff, a group of 10 who are mostly in their 30s and
notably not part of the Ivy League baby mafia that seems to have
taken over television comedy. He also managed to get the network to
lift its most degrading mandate: to mimic ``Saturday Night Live''
by opening the show with famous guest hosts, even though ``Mad TV''
could usually attract only not-quite-brand-name stars like Adam
Arkin and Pam Grier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has taken over, but it's hard to put my finger on
what,'' said Blasucci, sitting in his office, which is wallpapered
with colored index cards that itemize each cast member's repertory.
Under Alex Borstein's name, for example, Blasucci had printed:
``Janeane Garofalo, Rosie O'Donnell, Mary Bono, Chelsea Clinton,
Miss Swan.'' The last is an original creation that Ms. Borstein
worked up with a couple of the writers, a quietly stubborn Asian
manicurist at the Gorgeous Pretty Beauty Nail Salon who speaks
English only well enough to drive listeners around the bend. To get
the outburst of applause that typically greets a ``Saturday Night
Live'' favorite, like Molly Shannon's implosive Mary Katherine
Gallagher, Ms. Borstein need only step from the wings dressed in
Miss Swan's trademark rainbow plaid apron. And she is but one of a
stable of characters that the ``Mad TV'' cult can call its own.
</P>
<P>
   Almost weekly, for example, the 6-feet 4-inch Michael McDonald
daubs rouge on his cheeks and claps on a grayish Prince Valiant wig
to play Stuart, a wriggling man-baby who is always defying adults
in a creepily soft whisper. Blasucci said he became convinced of
Stuart's breakout potential in January, when his 12-year-old
daughter, Maria, began reporting to her parents that ``Stuart is
huge'' among her classmates. When reached by telephone, Maria
seemed understandably wary of an adult reporter who would call and
ask her to verify her Stuart-love. But she wasn't shy about why she
and her friends' way-past-bedtime viewing preferences don't include
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not funny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ms. Blasucci is only contributing to a debate that
has long raged on the Internet as to which show is better.
``Saturday Night Live'' has the glitz factor that comes with
celebrity hosts and high-profile bands. ``Mad TV,'' about half of
whose skits are pretaped (the other half are shot before a live
audience), has the luxury of editing out a botched line reading;
blunders on ``Saturday Night Live'' are there to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad TV'' isn't above presenting the occasional political
sketch, like ``Something About Monica,'' a fusion of the Farrelly
brothers' hit movie and the Lewinsky scandal. (Instead of a terrier
chewing on Ben Stiller's leg, the skit had Hillary Rodham Clinton's
teeth clamped on her husband's ankle.) But the show tends to leave
the topical satire to ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the typically male-dominated sketch comedy world,
Terry Sweeney believes that ``Mad TV'' has an edge. Rarely are
women in the cast stuck playing hastily conceived ancillary roles:
the nagging housewife or the ditzy girlfriend. Indeed, when they
are stuck, it's at the epicenter of a sketch that can't be saved.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mad TV' is just more woman friendly; on `SNL,' the men are
always being characterized as a woman's victim,'' said Sweeney,
whose most notable character during his ``Saturday Night Live''
term was that of Nancy Reagan. ``Here, we're not hostile to women.
We just make them powerful in themselves, and the world is just
going to have to deal with them.''

APOSTLE OF INNER STRUGGLE AND REDEMPTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman among composers; a freethinker among Soviet
apparatchiks; a Christian among atheists; an Easterner, half Tatar,
among Europeans; a modernist among reactionaries, and a reactionary
among modernists, Sofia Gubaidulina has lived with many conflicts,
both with the outside world and within herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her arrival, in her 50s and 60s, at moments of extraordinary
musical power has been a triumph of persistence and self-searching.
Ms. Gubaidulina, now 67, has become a great light, and her
achievement has happily been matched by steadily increasing public
recognition, which reaches a culmination in New York on Thursday
evening, when two big new works will be presented almost
simultaneously: ``Two Paths,'' at Avery Fisher Hall, and ``In the
Shadow of the Tree,'' at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Paths,'' for two violas and orchestra, will be played by
the New York Philharmonic, with its front-desk violists, Cynthia
Phelps and Rebecca Young, as soloists and Kurt Masur conducting.
The work was commissioned by Masur's wife, Tomoko, who was herself
a violist.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Shadow of the Tree'' also has multiple solo parts, but
in this case they are played by one musician, Kazue Sawai,
performing on Japanese instruments: koto (the floor-level plucked
harp), bass koto and zheng (a similar instrument, but Chinese
rather than Japanese and with a wider range). Here the commission
came from the orchestra of Japanese radio, the NHK Symphony, which
will be conducted by Charles Dutoit.
</P>
<P>
   That both scores should be concertos is no accident. For Ms.
Gubaidulina, the relationship between soloist and orchestra,
whether combative or consolatory, provides an image of the
individual in the world and of the truth to be found amid what she
has called the ``staccato'' of life.
</P>
<P>
   And it was with a concerto, ``Offertorium'' for violin and
orchestra, that she began to gain attention outside Russia.
Composed in 1980, ``Offertorium'' was taken around the world by
Gidon Kremer, who recorded it at the end of the decade. By then,
thanks to glasnost, Ms. Gubaidulina was at last receiving official
acclaim in Russia, but in 1992 she left for a new home in Hamburg,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offertorium'' is typical of Ms. Gubaidulina's work, in that it
is a journey through conflict toward new knowledge and
illumination, it uses a wide range of musical means, and it
justifies that range as a crucial necessity to a composer intent on
immediate expressive force.
</P>
<P>
   She exhibits no commitment to fine style. The characteristics of
her music are instead abruptness, ripped change and a finish that
is often rough, raw and ragged. ``Offertorium'' sounds like a page
torn ruthlessly from a book: a book whose subject would have to be
the spiritual life. It even makes the tearing sound, as it breaks
away from a Bach theme orchestrated by Webern _ two composers Ms.
Gubaidulina reveres above all others _ and embarks on a quest for
its own continuation and its own way to end.
</P>
<P>
   Along the line of Ms. Gubaidulina's artistic journey,
``Offertorium'' was a message from halfway. She was born nearly 50
years before, in 1931, in Chistopol, the daughter of a
Tatar-Russian couple. Her childhood years were spent largely in the
nearby big city, Kazan, in an environment that the musicologist
Theo Hirsbrunner has described in terms that surely came from the
composer herself: ``Life there ... was rather uninteresting: no
trees in the backyard, just a patch of grass here and there _ yet
the sight of the sky with its passing clouds captivated the child.
A buffoon played the accordion, and Gubaidulina danced to its
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Dance, as an image of the body and therefore the soul in perfect
tuning, has stayed with her; among her recent pieces is ``Dancer on
a Tightrope'' for violin and piano, the latter mostly strummed. And
the accordion has stayed, too, for several of her works use the
instrument in its ethnic Russian form, the bayan.
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond these examples, many of her scores carry traces, in
their long sustained tones and their orchestral clamor and wheeze,
of the dancing girl and the folk musician.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gubaidulina started her conservatory studies in Kazan soon
after World War II and completed her education at the Moscow
Conservatory between 1954 and 1963. She remained in the capital,
though without much encouragement or support.
</P>
<P>
   Her regular studies seem to have been less important to her than
the contact she made with Philipp Herschgowitz, a Webern pupil who
was a vital source of instruction to young Russian composers at a
time when anything in non-Russian music since Debussy was virtually
proscribed. Her straying from ``the bright, pleasant aspects of
life'' was noticed by an early reviewer, but Shostakovich privately
expressed to her his hope that she would continue on her ``wrong
course.''
</P>
<P>
   She did. As a result, her works were rarely played and never
recorded. As another result, she had to earn her living by writing
film scores. Her achievements in this area include the music for
Rolan Bykov's ``Scarecrow'' and a number of collaborations with Ida
Garanina on animated films. But this sort of work was not a chore:
it provided her with another kind of education, since the need to
match music to gesture gave her a strong sense of how instruments
can speak and how music can mimic physical action or, by extension,
movements of the mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Neglect also proved useful to her, throwing her back on herself,
alone or in the company of a few colleagues. With Alfred Schnittke
and Edison Denisov, both recently deceased, she was a leader of the
quiet musical opposition, and she made up for the lack of
performances by forming an improvisation group with the composer
Viktor Suslin and the ethnomusicologist Vyacheslav Artyomov, whose
collection of instruments from the Caucasus and Central Asia gave
the group a wide sound-world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The works Ms. Gubaidulina wrote in the 1960s and early '70s
already reveal her liking for the soloist-accompaniment format of
the concerto, song or instrumental piece with piano, but not until
the later '70s was she able to make her expressive purposes
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hour of the Soul,'' of 1976, was an early instance: a
half-hour percussion concerto in which the soloist stirs up the
orchestra; eventually a mezzo-soprano emerges, singing verses by
Marina Tsvetayeva. Like most of Ms. Gubaidulina's pieces before and
since, ``Hour of the Soul'' was written for a particular player, in
this case Marek Pekarski, so that, in the composer's words, ``only
at the end does the truly feminine nature appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gubaidulina would almost inevitably have been drawn to
explore in her music issues of maleness and femaleness, and ``Hour
of the Soul'' is by no means the only work in which she has done
so. But she adopts a rather conventional position in expressing the
contrast in terms of dynamism and stasis, rationality and
irrationality, thought and feeling, and it would be hard to
identify her musical voice as that of a woman and therefore unlike
those of such contemporaries as Schnittke, Henryk Gorecki or Giya
Kancheli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Paths,'' the Philharmonic work, looks at another polarity,
for this double concerto is a double portrait of Martha and Mary,
the sisters of St. John's Gospel. These were women who had, as the
composer puts it, ``two ways of loving: to love taking upon oneself
worldly cares and by so doing insure the foundation of life, and to
love dedicating oneself to the sublime, to experience together with
the Beloved the route of terrible suffering to the cross, so as to
procure light and blessing for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild gestures in the orchestra _ loud swirls and anapaest
rhythms _ provoke a response from the two soloists, a response they
deliver alone. The second viola, as Martha, starts in the middle
register and almost at once slides down toward the bottom of the
instrument's range. The first, as Mary, begins just above her
sister and moves higher.
</P>
<P>
   Both sisters are not only much quieter than the orchestra but
much slower and more centered, in keeping with the composer's
archetypal view of sexual differences. It will be interesting one
day to hear the work performed by male soloists with a woman
conducting.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a sequence of variations. The orchestra returns
to attack mode, and this time the violists' move together in
response. Mary, in her higher register, makes downward slips;
Martha, below, starts to lift, and the two flow side by side in
duets.
</P>
<P>
   Then woodwind soloists enter the conversation. Once the
unaccompanied viola duetting has been restored, the two soloists
crisscross through pitch space over a percussive ostinato, and
these mirroring upward-downward movements spread into the
orchestra. After this tumult, the Martha violist settles on a theme
she will hold to the end, while the Mary figure pursues her lyrical
flights. A last cruel orchestral outburst does not stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Shadow of the Tree'' also has a binary contrast, but
now between whole ensembles. A little more than half the orchestral
strings play in normal tuning, the rest being tuned a quarter-tone
down.
</P>
<P>
   The koto and bass koto are aligned with the first group, as are
the winds and tuned percussion instruments. (Ms. Gubaidulina,
herself a percussionist, uses large percussion sections in both new
works.) But the zheng's intonation places it with the ``mistuned''
strings, which are said to represent ``a region of shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   The work begins in light and ends there, on the same note played
on the koto with the kind of undulating insistence by which Ms.
Gubaidulina gives her simple musical facts the force of freshness.
But along the way, the shadow comes into its own, and the soloist
is able to move from one side to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow music is not particularly negative or sinister, and
its effect is not so much to contradict the light as to gentle it.
So one may come to understand, with the composer, ``that shadow is
the sphere of existence from which life emanates, and even light.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial contradictions _ between shadow and light, between
Eastern and Western instruments, between improvised and notated
music (in the solo part) _ come to seem less important than the
equal necessity of both aspects. And though ``In the Shadow of the
Tree'' may, from its title, contain some Christian reference, Ms.
Gubaidulina's message lies at this other level, at once more
abstract and more immediate.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same message she has always delivered in her best
works, a message of fierce struggles and ecstatic coming home.
</P>

HARVARD TO ABSORB RADCLIFFE COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Radcliffe College, founded 105 years ago to
educate a gender Harvard University rejected as ``too
promiscuous,'' said Tuesday it would cede the education of
undergraduate women to its long-time male partner.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the merger between Harvard and Radcliffe
ends nearly two years of secretive and sometimes strained
negotiations, during which the colleges' trustees themselves were
unclear whether they were arranging a marriage or a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe officials termed the arrangement a union, ``the end of
a very long engagement.'' And like the most old fashioned of
marriages, the key issues were dowry and status. Harvard will
absorb Radcliffe's $450 million in endowment and real estate.
Radcliffe is to become an institute for advanced studies with a
focus on women, gender and society on a par with Harvard's law,
medical and business schools.
</P>
<P>
   For Harvard, it is a significant step toward solving its long
standing ``women problem,'' which by the college's own admission
has left women feeling less invested in the nation's oldest
university, both as undergraduates and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe forces Harvard to institutionalize its commitment to
the study of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This places the responsibility on Harvard for making sure
undergraduate education is excellent both for women and men,'' said
Harvard President Neil Rudenstine, ``The creation of an institute
with absolutely major resources, that's a major event. We're really
creating something significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, approved by the governing boards of the
two colleges last week, Harvard will absorb Radcliffe's assets into
its own $13 billion endowment. Women students who have until now
applied and paid tuition to Radcliffe and gotten a degree signed by
the presidents of both colleges will be students exclusively of
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe will give up its legal independence and lose the name
college in its title, becoming the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced
Studies. Harvard officials said it was one of only four such
institutes in the nation and the only one focused primarily on the
study of women. While the new Radcliffe will not grant degrees it
will now hire faculty for the first time. When Radcliffe was
founded its classes were taught by Harvard professors in their off
hours. The Institute will also offer a place for professors and
artists from any field and any institution, including Harvard, to
spend their sabbaticals.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe's three research institutes will be absorbed into the
new creation. President Linda S. Wilson will step down replaced by
a new dean who for the interim will be Mary Maples Dunn, the former
president of Smith College and now head of Schlesinger Library at
Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has promised a $300 million endowment to the new
institute. The size of the new Radcliffe faculty is to be
determined in discussions beginning this summer. The two colleges
will also decide whether Harvard will be allowed to solicit
donations from women who graduated before 1977. The 1976 agreement
that made Harvard classes coeducational prevented Harvard from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world the negotiations may have seemed like
bickering over seating arrangements at the same elaborate dinner
table; women students have been admitted jointly to Harvard and
Radcliffe since the mid 1970s. But to many, the discussions neatly
symbolized the long-standing conflict over the status of women at
the nation's oldest university. Radcliffe said Harvard didn't
understand, Harvard officials asked what all the fuss was about. In
a report on the status of women two years ago, Harvard said the
continued existence of Radcliffe as an undergraduate school
confused students and alumni. Radcliffe reminded people that
Harvard had not been hospitable to women _ an image Harvard was
trying to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know quite how to define a full commitment to
women when we haven't been able to demonstrate that,'' said
Rudenstine, ``It's been hard for Harvard to know what it could and
should do without treading on Radcliffe's territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe alumni and officials however worry that Harvard wanted
to do away with Radcliffe entirely, or reduce it to an ``affiliate.
At several points during negotiations, concerned that Harvard was
not taking seriously the need to focus on women, Radcliffe
threatened to walk out on Harvard entirely. And as late as early
this month, people close to the negotiations were suggesting
Radcliffe might become an entirely separate entity granting its own
graduate degrees and hiring its own faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for me was the understanding of the
mission,'' said Dunn. ``To make certain that everyone involved at
Harvard and Radcliffe understood that this new institute would
continue to have a primary concern with issues having to do with
women. It isn't just that they write it down on a piece of paper
but they understand it and internalize it. That happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wilson said that the new institute would merely enhance
Radcliffe's role within Harvard. ``The new incarnation will make
the commitment to women much more obvious,'' Wilson said.
``Physically we're not moving, but symbolically becoming part of
the university means our ability to contribute will be larger.
Moving inside will give Radcliffe greater statute. This will be
alongside the nine other schools at Harvard and contributing to
each.''
</P>
<P>
   If Radcliffe had gone it alone, its current programs on the
study of women might have been marginalized. Merging with Harvard
gives it the extra stability of the university's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe's officials also noted the endowment of the new
Radcliffe will be larger than the endowment of the design,
education and divinity schools at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both Harvard and Radcliffe tried Tuesday to
reassure nervous alumni who had turned out for discussions about
Radcliffe's future in ten cities nationwide last fall. ``It will
continue to be a warm welcoming community,'' said Nancy-Beth Gordon
Sheerr, head of Radcliffe's Board of Trustees, ``by the nature of
what's going on here, and the people brought here to work on the
issues of women, gender and society.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the new position of Radcliffe reflects the
uncertain place of women's colleges nationwide. Leaders of the
other traditional seven sisters Tuesday affirmed the importance of
single-sex education. But they also said they did not believe
Radcliffe was selling out on the education of young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radcliffe is embarking on a new period in its distinguished
history that I'm sure will enable it to play a significant
leadership role in defining and examining the role of women in
society,`` said Judith R. Shapiro, president of Barnard College.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As the 20th century fades away, so too does the international
consensus on when to get involved in another state's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO _ with little discussion and less
fanfare _ have effectively abandoned the old U.N. Charter rules
that strictly limit international intervention in local conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   They have done so in favor of a vague new system that is much
more tolerant of military intervention but has few hard and fast
rules. What rules do exist seem more the product of after-the-fact
rationalization by the West than of deliberation and pre-agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of the old rules on peacekeeping and peacemaking _
under which most bloody conflicts were simply ignored as ``domestic
matters'' _ should not be mourned. Events since the end of the Cold
War starkly show that the old anti-interventionist regime has
fallen out of sync with modern notions of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Kosovo illustrates this disjunction and America's
new willingness to do what it thinks right _ international law
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of ethnic cleansing in the Serbian province was well
publicized. As Slobodan Milosevic thumbed his nose at the
international community, pressure built to use force against him,
whether the U.N. Charter allowed it or not. Thus when the Western
allies launched air strikes, the move was largely popular.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, technically legal under the old U.N.
regime. After all, Kosovo is still part of Yugoslavia. No
cross-border attack _ the one circumstance where the charter allows
an international military response _ had occurred, and the Security
Council had never authorized NATO military measures.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Kosovo, justice _ as it is now understood _ and the U.N.
Charter seemed to collide. But it is not only that the U.N. Charter
prohibits intervention where enlightened states now believe it to
be just. Its problems run even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   For the charter is grounded on a premise that is simply no
longer true _ the assumption that the core threat to international
security still comes from interstate violence. What's more, thanks
to Cold War deadlock and the veto power held by the Security
Council's five permanent members, the old rules never even
prevented interstate violence in the first place _ witness
Afghanistan, Vietnam and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Just as generals too often refight the last war, when the
drafters of the U.N. Charter set its limits on state power, they
responded to the crises precipitating World War II, without
anticipating those that would follow it.
</P>
<P>
   They devised a legal regime they hoped would govern the use of
force for generations to come _ recognizing all states as sovereign
equals, prohibiting interference in their internal affairs, and
permitting the nondefensive use of force only when authorized by
the U.N. Security Council, and then only in limited circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recurrent problem, which is intrastate violence, is not
addressed effectively by the charter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Haiti, Somalia and Rwanda _ all conflicts within a
single country _ when the international community stepped in to
halt the slaughter of civilians, it did so without the blessing of
international law. Although intervention was authorized by the
Security Council, its consent flew in the face of the constraints
of the charter and 40 years of U.N. precedent that virtually
ignored civil war and instability.
</P>
<P>
   The charter regards internal violence as a question of
``domestic jurisdiction'' only _ that is, beyond official
international concern.

<P>
   When American embassies were bombed in Kenya and Tanzania last
August, world attention focused entirely on the propriety of
American air strikes against perpetrators allegedly ensconced in
Afghanistan and Sudan. The idea that the United Nations might
actually DO something to combat such bombings was never even
raised, so conditioned had observers become to expect it to do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the United Nations ever been effective in curbing interstate
violence, its charter's anachronistic focus might be tolerable. But
it was not.
</P>
<P>
   The charter generated no formal international response to Soviet
intervention in Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan, none to
American intervention in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama or
Nicaragua, and none to that of India in Goa, Indonesia in East
Timor, China in Tibet, Argentina in the Falklands or Vietnam in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic historians have yet to identify a single instance of
interstate violence that was actually stopped by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The West's new rules of thumb on intervention accord less
deference to the old idea of sovereign equality _ the erstwhile
notion that all countries, large or small, are equal in the eyes of
the law. The new posture recognizes the hollowness of this concept,
accepting that all states are not in fact the same in their power,
wealth, or commitment to human rights or peace.
</P>
<P>
   The new system acknowledges something else the U.N. Charter
overlooks: that the major threats to stability and well-being now
come from internal violence as or more often than they do from
cross-border fighting _ and that to be effective, international law
needs to stop the former as well as the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cost of abandoning the old anti-interventionist
system will be offset by the benefits of the newly emerging one
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, replacing a formal system with a set of vague,
half-formed, ad hoc principles can be dangerous. Untested rules may
have unexpected consequences, and justice formed on the fly may
come to be resented. But the failings of the old system were so
disastrous that little will be lost in the attempt to forge a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   No one, as yet, has devised safeguards to guarantee that power
will not be abused by the strong, that coercion will not be
misdirected to undermine the values that it was established to
protect. Until such safeguards are devised, the global rule of law
will remain a dream.
</P>
<P>
   But what of justice? Can it be achieved in the meantime? That a
new interventionist regime might not at the outset be a legal one
does not mean that enhanced global justice need remain a fantasy.
International justice can in fact be pursued ad hoc, without a
fully functioning legal system.
</P>
<P>
   This evidently is what NATO and the United States have recently
set out to do. And they have achieved some success: A child saved
from ethnic cleansing in Kosovo by NATO's intervention is no less
alive because the intervention was impromptu rather than part of a
formal system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is dangerous for NATO to unilaterally rewrite the rules
by intervening in domestic conflicts on an irregular, case-by-case
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The test of the new interventionism is not whether it can be
contrived to generate immediate popular support. Of course it can,
at least in influential Western publics, in ways known to all
military planners and their publicists: with smart-bomb strikes
portrayed in the media as being undertaken only after patience has
run out. Such attacks are a swift, short, and successful method of
punishing a demon and vindicating international honor.
</P>
<P>
   They produce few (CNN-reported) civilian deaths and still fewer
Western casualties. The script for successful military spinning is
no state secret.
</P>
<P>
   But that script is not the best way to give a new
interventionist regime long-term acceptance. The real test of a new
system will be whether succeeding generations throughout the
community of nations _ not simply in centers of wealth and power _
believe the system and the actions it prescribes to be just.
</P>
<P>
   Even if its purposes are widely approved of, sooner or later the
exclusionary decision-making process is likely to create
resentment, particularly as inevitable foul-ups occur and lives are
lost through error and oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, it turns out, requires legitimacy; without widespread
acceptance of intervention as part of a formal justice system, the
new interventionism will appear to be built on neither law nor
justice, but on power alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, unless a critical mass of nations accepts the
solution that NATO and the United States stand ready to offer, that
solution will soon be resented.
</P>
<P>
   But the new interventionists should not be daunted by fears of
destroying some lofty, imagined temple of law enshrined in the U.N.
Charter's anti-interventionist proscriptions. The higher, grander
goal that has eluded humanity for centuries _ the ideal of justice
backed by power _ should not be abandoned so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving justice is the hard part; revising international law
to reflect it can come afterward. If power is used to do justice,
law will follow.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As the 20th century fades away, so too does the international
consensus on when to get involved in another state's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO _ with little discussion and less
fanfare _ have effectively abandoned the old U.N. Charter rules
that strictly limit international intervention in local conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   They have done so in favor of a vague new system that is much
more tolerant of military intervention but has few hard and fast
rules. What rules do exist seem more the product of after-the-fact
rationalization by the West than of deliberation and pre-agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of the old rules on peacekeeping and peacemaking _
under which most bloody conflicts were simply ignored as ``domestic
matters'' _ should not be mourned. Events since the end of the Cold
War starkly show that the old anti-interventionist regime has
fallen out of sync with modern notions of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Kosovo illustrates this disjunction and America's
new willingness to do what it thinks right _ international law
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of ethnic cleansing in the Serbian province was well
publicized. As Slobodan Milosevic thumbed his nose at the
international community, pressure built to use force against him,
whether the U.N. Charter allowed it or not. Thus when the Western
allies launched air strikes, the move was largely popular.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, technically legal under the old U.N.
regime. After all, Kosovo is still part of Yugoslavia. No
cross-border attack _ the one circumstance where the charter allows
an international military response _ had occurred, and the Security
Council had never authorized NATO military measures.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Kosovo, justice _ as it is now understood _ and the U.N.
Charter seemed to collide. But it is not only that the U.N. Charter
prohibits intervention where enlightened states now believe it to
be just. Its problems run even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   For the charter is grounded on a premise that is simply no
longer true _ the assumption that the core threat to international
security still comes from interstate violence. What's more, thanks
to Cold War deadlock and the veto power held by the Security
Council's five permanent members, the old rules never even
prevented interstate violence in the first place _ witness
Afghanistan, Vietnam and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Just as generals too often refight the last war, when the
drafters of the U.N. Charter set its limits on state power, they
responded to the crises precipitating World War II, without
anticipating those that would follow it.
</P>
<P>
   They devised a legal regime they hoped would govern the use of
force for generations to come _ recognizing all states as sovereign
equals, prohibiting interference in their internal affairs, and
permitting the nondefensive use of force only when authorized by
the U.N. Security Council, and then only in limited circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recurrent problem, which is intrastate violence, is not
addressed effectively by the charter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Haiti, Somalia and Rwanda _ all conflicts within a
single country _ when the international community stepped in to
halt the slaughter of civilians, it did so without the blessing of
international law. Although intervention was authorized by the
Security Council, its consent flew in the face of the constraints
of the charter and 40 years of U.N. precedent that virtually
ignored civil war and instability.
</P>
<P>
   The charter regards internal violence as a question of
``domestic jurisdiction'' only _ that is, beyond official
international concern.
</P>
<P>
   When American embassies were bombed in Kenya and Tanzania last
August, world attention focused entirely on the propriety of
American air strikes against perpetrators allegedly ensconced in
Afghanistan and Sudan. The idea that the United Nations might
actually DO something to combat such bombings was never even
raised, so conditioned had observers become to expect it to do
nothing.

intervention in Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan, none to
American intervention in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama or

Timor, China in Tibet, Argentina in the Falklands or Vietnam in
Cambodia.

 Y-COX &HT;    Job descriptions may have changed, but secretaries remain
 &HT;    By Julie Kemble Borths
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Shorthand and mimeograph machines may be extinct
but there are still secretaries powering most businesses. Like
Thelma Landis, they just do it now with computers and e-mail and
fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   Landis has seen it all in 50 years as a secretary, one of 3.4
million in the U.S. according to the International Association of
Administrative Professionals. While many go by other titles like
administrative assistant and office managers, their roles in all
kinds of businesses are celebrated today on Secretaries Day.
</P>
<P>
   And next week, Landis retires with a sense of pride: being a
secretary is important to the running of a business, Landis said.
``Just doing the general work that comes in,'' she said. ``That's
what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Landis, that eventually meant handling probate work for the
firm, recently merged and renamed the Equity Land Title Agency in
Two RiverCenter. Such responsibilities were part of a natural
progression for a woman who always wanted to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of going to college but I couldn't afford it,'' she
said. ``And I was from a small town (Pitsburg in Darke County) and
I didn't know too much.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Landis went off to Miami-Jacobs College and learned typing
and shorthand for a year. She walked into the Brooks T. Carson &AMP;
Sons office, then one of the largest real estate title firms in the
area, and evolved along with the business.
</P>
<P>
   For Landis, most of the changes in those years had more to do
with technology than anything else. First there were adding
machines and manual typewriters with carbon paper. Later there were
copying machines that needed a messy gel applied with each use. And
now, Landis' tidy office overlooking Main Street in downtown Dayton
includes a computer with e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just the machines that changed over the years.
Landis said the real estate world changed too and she always kept
up.
</P>
<P>
   One of her bosses, attorney James C. Kiefer, said that's what
has made Landis so valuable. ``She has more knowledge than anyone
else. Sometimes, when I wasn't available, attorneys would just call
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis said she has never stopped learning about the detailed,
complex world of real estate law.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always found the work very interesting because of the
law aspect,'' she said. ``But I never went in for studying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Kline has worked with Landis since 1984. ``She's taught me
everything I know here,'' Kline said. ``And she's the world's
nicest person. She doesn't have a gossipy bone in her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis said gossiping or playing office games never appealed to
her. Brought up on a farm, she retained a strong work ethic. A bit
embarrassed, but also a bit proud, she said she never took a sick
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to be real organized,'' she said of balancing her
work life with her life at home. For 48 years, she's been married
to Ted Landis Sr., a former Drexel Elementary teacher and a
minister at several churches. They sent a son and a daughter to
college and now have four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1950s, when many mothers did not work, Landis said
she continued on the job. ``It was a way of life,'' she said. ``I
had a commitment to my job, my family and my church.''
</P>
<P>
   That commitment is missing in younger people Landis sees working
today. ``You have to be on time, do the best you can, be
conscientious,'' she said. ``But sometimes, all (people) seem to
want is a paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   But after 50 years of balancing it all, Landis said she's
looking forward to devoting more time to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I won't do my laundry at night anymore,'' Landis smiled.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The rumbles of yet another nationalist earthquake are shaking
the former Yugoslavia. Rising from the fetid hovels of Pristina and
the concrete-block family farms of rural Kosovo is the newest
political and military force to beset the Balkans _ the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), known to Albanians as the Ushtria Clirimtare
e Kosoves.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of this militant armed group, now numbering
several thousand fighters, has dimmed hopes that even a compromise
agreement with Belgrade could be successfully implemented.
Emboldened by NATO's March bombing of the Serbian military, the KLA
will wage a protracted guerrilla war in the Serbian province that
could ignite a wider war in neighboring Macedonia and Albania,
potentially even dragging in Greece and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is uncompromising in its quest for an independent Kosovo
now and a Greater Albania later. And it has, to the consternation
of Washington's would-be peacemakers, supplanted the ineffectual
leadership of the moderate voice of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is important out of all proportion to its size _ not
merely because it will probably eventually get Kosovo to secede
from Serbia, but because it now represents the aspirations of most
Kosovar Albanians. To understand the current conflict in Kosovo and
America's stakes in its resolution, one must understand the KLA,
how it came into being, who leads it, what drives it and why it now
speaks for a majority of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Even a truly vicious, Bosnia-like wave of atrocities by the
Serbs in reprisal for NATO's attacks will only pour fuel on the
separatist fire. The grim reality is that we had better get to know
the KLA _ because it is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians have grown increasingly embittered. By
attempting to include the KLA in the peace process that began in
February at the French chateau of Rambouillet, the Western alliance
is working feverishly _ even as it bombs the Serbs _ to blunt the
momentum toward a war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The allies want NATO troops to separate the province's warring
factions, although Belgrade is wary. The underlying idea behind
creating a theoretically temporary, NATO- enforced military
protectorate in Kosovo is to buy time for a three-year transition
period in which ethnic Albanians will be allowed to elect a
parliament and other governing bodies _ meeting enough of their
aspirations, it is hoped, to keep Kosovo from seceding.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Western alliance's response to the
Kosovo crisis, however ragged, shows that some lessons have been
learned from the bumbling in Bosnia. The Europeans no longer talk
about handling matters alone but demand the presence of the United
States. Threats have been backed up by force.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a consensus that if some kind of a solution is not
found soon, the fighting inside Kosovo _ an area the size of
Connecticut _ will accelerate and make future intervention
difficult, if not impossible. Even the Pentagon officials who
fought like wildcats to keep U.S. forces out of Bosnia accept that
some 4,000 U.S. troops will have to be deployed in Kosovo to make
any peacekeeping force credible.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in Bosnia, the West is wedded to a solution that might
have worked earlier in the conflict but is now untenable. Serbian
ethnic cleansing has taken on a somewhat different character in
Kosovo than in Bosnia. In Kosovo, Serbian ethnic cleansing is to a
large degree tactical, designed to deny the rebels succor from
civilians and therefore aimed primarily at the inhabitants of KLA
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb campaign has been more than brutal enough to make
autonomy for Kosovo a nonstarter. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who make up 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants, cannot remain
in Serbia after the horrific recent bloodshed, the displacement of
a quarter of a million people, and the razing of scores of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   They do not trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic or the
Serbs _ and given Belgrade's bloody campaigns against ethnic
minorities over the past decade and its habit of breaking
agreements, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have been radicalized, and their new voice is the
KLA. Rugova, the old pacifist, is more a symbol of outmoded
moderation than a leader.
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring the plight of the Kosovar Albanians for nearly a
decade, the West lost much of its credibility before NATO began
bombing. Many Albanians feel let down by the world and their own
meek leaders. What is most striking, then, about the KLA
insurrection is not that it occurred but that it took so long to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fighters are the province's new power brokers. Whatever
political leadership emerges in Kosovo will come from the rebel
ranks, and it will be militant, nationalist, uncompromising and
deeply suspicious of all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies, preoccupied with tracking militant
Islamist groups and Iranian agents in Bosnia, were caught off guard
by the Kosovo rebel force's emergence, strength and popularity.
Indeed, some diplomats argued as late as last year about whether
the shadowy group really existed _ even as small armed bands roamed
Drenica in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first KLA armed attack took place in May 1993, killing two
Serb police officers and wounding five more. But the rebel group _
its membership largely drawn from a few clans in Kosovo and
radicals in the Albanian diaspora _ was founded eight years ago.
Most of its leadership has spent years in prison for separatist
activity, many having been jailed earlier by Tito's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Like all revolutionaries who have spent years underground or in
jail, the KLA leaders are wary of the outside world and given to
secrecy, paranoia and appalling mendacity when they feel it serves
their interests, which is most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA splits down a bizarre ideological divide, with hints of
fascism on one side and whiffs of communism on the other. The
former faction is led by the sons and grandsons of rightist
Albanian fighters _ either the heirs of those who fought in the
World War II fascist militias and the Skanderbeg volunteer SS
division raised by the Nazis, or the descendants of the rightist
Albanian rebels who rose up against the Serbs 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although never much of a fighting force, the Skanderbeg division
took part in the shameful roundup and deportation of the province's
few hundred Jews during the Holocaust. The division's remnants
fought Tito's Partisans at the end of the war, leaving thousands of
ethnic Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by KLA commanders to dress their police in black
fatigues and order their fighters to salute with a clenched fist to
the forehead led many to worry about these fascist antecedents.
Following such criticism, the salute has been changed to the
traditional open-palm salute common in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   The second KLA faction, comprising most of the KLA leaders in
exile, are old Stalinists who were once bankrolled by the
xenophobic Enver Hoxha, the dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
This group led a militant separatist movement that was really about
integration with Hoxha's Albania. Most of these leaders were
students at Pristina University after 1974, when Belgrade granted
the province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Yugoslav oversight, the university imported thousands
of textbooks from Albania, all carefully edited by Hoxha's
Stalinist regime, along with at least a dozen militant Albanian
professors. Along with its degree programs, Pristina University
began to quietly school young Kosovar leaders in the art of
revolution. Not only did a huge percentage of the KLA leadership
come out of the university, but so, ominously, did the ethnic
Albanian leadership in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The two KLA factions have little sympathy with or understanding
of democratic institutions. Split bitterly between radical left and
radical right, they are now arguing over whether to carry the
fighting to the pockets of ethnic Albanians who live in western
Macedonia and neighboring Montenegro. The only thing they agree on
is the need to liberate Kosovo from Serbian rule. All else,
menacingly, will be decided later. It is not said how.
</P>
<P>
   Given these deep divisions, it is no accident that the KLA has
failed to create a political organization or even a vague platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we have an ideology,'' Jakup Krasniqi, the
KLA's mercurial spokesman, told the Albanian-language daily Koha
Ditore on July 12, 1998. ``And in fact we do not have time for such
things even if we were interested in them, because we have our main
job to do, which is the task of liberation.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   I first stumbled into the Kosovo Liberation Army in February
1997, shortly after a police car was ambushed by armed
``terrorists,'' as the Serbs called them.
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed ethnic Albanians equipped with automatic weapons
were killed in the firefight. I took a taxi that had seen better
days to attend the wake for one of them.
</P>
<P>
   As I approached the village of Orlane, a few lean men in track
suits were standing about 20 feet apart on either side of the dirt
road. Several of the mourners proved hostile, lashing out at my
translator as a ``spy'' for Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   That day in Orlane, with its crude outhouses, simple wooden
structures and roaming flocks of goats and noisy chickens, offered
a glimpse into an armed rebellion that was still a year away.
</P>
<P>
   The slain man, Zahir Pajaziti, 34, had studied English at
Pristina University before dropping out. He had never held a steady
job and had been on the run for several months, appearing
unannounced at night, armed and in uniform, to visit his family and
then disappearing before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   He and his two companions had been stopped by police, who
apparently were looking for them, and were killed inside their car.
Mourners told of other small bands setting up roadblocks to collect
``war taxes'' and holding political meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to penetrate the group from the inside. Only in
Switzerland, where there was less danger in speaking with a foreign
reporter, did it prove possible to establish links with the
organization. This proved easier than I expected, in large part
because the KLA had then built close ties or melded with much of
Rugova's League of Democratic Kosovo (LDK).
</P>
<P>
   Once the rebellion erupted a year ago, local LDK leaders
immediately picked up weapons and became commanders of village
units. By the time of the uprising, Rugova had lost control of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   Through the LDK, I arranged a meeting with a rebel commander in
Geneva _ the first such meeting with the press. My interlocutor was
nearly killed some months later when two men with ski masks arrived
at his unmarked office in Geneva and pulled out pistols with
silencers. The assistant who answered the bell, although shot in
the stomach, managed to slam shut the security door, no doubt
saving the official's life. The would-be assassins were never
apprehended. The office has since been closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel a deep, deep sense of betrayal,'' the KLA man told
me, echoing a sentiment that seemed to speak for most ethnic
Albanians. ``We mounted a peaceful, civilized protest to fight the
totalitarian rule of Milosevic. We did not go down the road of
nationalist hatred, always respecting Serbian churches and
monasteries. The result is that we were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace negotiations, which dealt with Bosnia but not
Kosovo, ``taught us a painful truth, (that) those that want freedom
must fight for it. This is our sad duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians, with understandable rage, did not grasp
why the Bosnian Serbs, responsible for some of the worst acts of
genocide since World War II, were handed nearly half of Bosnia at
Dayton. The recognition of Radovan Karadzic's gangster statelet,
Republika Srpska, was the final insult. It shattered all hopes for
peaceful change in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Young Albanians have bitterly repudiated not only Serb rule but
also Rugova's older, urbane and educated leadership. Pristina's
elites, they say, have betrayed the Albanian cause.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, 1998, in the town of Jablanica, 30 miles north of
Dakovica, I bumped into a group of surly KLA fighters, dressed in a
motley collection of uniforms and equipped with an odd assortment
of hunting rifles, pistols, automatic weapons and hunting knives.
Killings by Belgrade, and the the humiliation of 10 years of abuse,
had left them seething with resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our territory,'' said a gaunt, nervous rebel with a
scraggly black beard and a chrome-plated pistol protruding from his
belt. ``We are through with these Albanian intellectuals in
Pristina, with journalists, diplomats, and everyone else. No one
saved our women and children from slaughter. Now it is up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the uprising in Kosovo last spring, the KLA had only a
couple hundred members. The most prominent inside Kosovo was Adem
Jashari, a gruff, taciturn peasant who, with his brother Hamza, had
been on the run from Serb authorities for months. They were among
the handful of militants who founded the KLA in 1991 before it
mushroomed into a popular army, much like the Islamist resistance
in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, they came closest to running the
organization, and many of their lieutenants and relatives _ at
least the ones that have survived _ now run the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried fruitlessly over three days in late 1997 to speak to
the Jasharis, spending one afternoon pleading with Shaban, their
70-year-old father, to pass on a message. He refused. His sons were
increasingly wanted men. Just a few weeks before, on Nov. 28, 1997,
uniformed KLA fighters had, for the first time, appeared before a
large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before some 20,000 mourners at the funeral of a schoolteacher
slain by the Serbs, two KLA leaders delivered a rousing call for
liberation that was greeted with a roar of approval and thunderous
chants of ``KLA! KLA! KLA!''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Ramadan ended I was called to Geneva and told
that on Feb. 17, I should be waiting outside the old religious
school in Pristina at 8 a.m. I would be allowed to bring a
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   At the assigned hour, Wade Goddard, our photographer, and I
stood in the cold as two young men, both in jeans and wearing
combat boots, walked swiftly toward us. ``Be here at three o'clock
tomorrow, and make sure you are not followed,'' said one in broken
English. In less than a minute, they had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next morning darting in and out of taxis and
walking through back alleys to make sure we were not being tailed.
A KLA official in Switzerland, in an insight into what has become a
respectable intelligence network, had thoughtfully provided me with
the name of the undercover cop who hung out in my small hotel in
Pristina to report on my activities.
</P>
<P>
   As we traveled the next day to Prekaz, the small town in central
Kosovo that was the Jasharis' headquarters, the group's well-oiled
underground network was evident. Men along the road signaled with
their hands that the way was clear of Serb checkpoints. When we
entered Prekaz, the driver honked the horn three times, and a group
of about a dozen men emerged from a shed to watch us.
</P>
<P>
   We turned up into a field covered with a thin layer of snow and
were stopped by a half-dozen heavily armed men in camouflage
uniforms. All wore on their shoulders the red-and-black KLA patch
with the double-headed Albanian eagle.
</P>
<P>
   We were escorted through the fields and along dirt roads. As our
patrol walked over the thin layer of snow, I noticed that no one
seemed to find the presence of the rebels unusual; even the
children hardly gave us a glance. We reached a small stone
farmhouse surrounded by a wooden fence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, on cushions set on the floor along the wall, were Adem
and Hamza Jashari. The room, filled with acrid cigarette smoke, was
lit by a single kerosene lamp. Two burly bodyguards, clutching
automatic weapons, stood by the door. The two dirt roads leading
into the village had also been closed after we passed by bands of
armed fighters.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first and last interview the Jasharis would
give to a reporter. In three weeks, I would be standing over their
bodies in a warehouse. Adem's neck had been slit, probably after he
had died of multiple bullet wounds. Shaban, his elderly father with
whom I had spent an afternoon, lay not far away.
</P>
<P>
   There were 51 corpses, 20 of them members of the Jashari clan,
many of them shot in the head at close range. About two dozen of
the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were
blackened by the flames that had engulfed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But that day, the encounter with the Jasharis offered a
revealing look at the contrasts within the KLA. Adem, with his
drooping bandito mustache and hostility, had none of Alban's
polished charm. The fighters around him were suspicious peasants,
prone to lash out at everyone, including Rugova, who was not part
of their inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that they would never flee from the village if it
came under attack. Most, in fact, died in their homes, as have
scores of other Kosovar Albanians who have yet to master the basic
tenets of guerrilla warfare.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As late as April 1998, Belgrade, blind to the looming rebellion
of young Albanians against Serb brutality, blithely continued to
rule Kosovo like a colonial backwater. On several occasions, as a
foreign correspondent for The New York Times, I saw two or three
beefy Serb police officers walloping young ethnic Albanians with
their clubs in the center of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   I once watched a cop shove a young boy of about 10, who held a
small wooden tray of individual cigarettes for sale, onto the
sidewalk. The cop laughed as the frightened child scrambled to
rescue the cigarettes from the mud puddles. Many of the Serb police
were sent to Kosovo as a demotion or a punishment for misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorite pastimes was to set up roadblocks and
collect money from a long line of cars for invented traffic
violations. Drivers that did not have money or did not pay had
their documents seized.
</P>
<P>
   All this, however, paled in comparison with the brutal treatment
in Serb jails. People were beaten, tortured (usually while chained
to radiators) and held incommunicado for days and weeks. Some
simply vanished. Bejram Shehi, 39, a laborer in Switzerland, came
home last year to visit his family and was arrested by Serb police.
They accused him of carrying in money for the KLA. He had a black
hood pulled over his head, was handcuffed and was then pushed
through the back door of the police car onto the car floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joked that they were taking me to see the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' he said. ``We drove for about an hour. I was
taken out and brought to a basement, where I was stripped and
handcuffed to a radiator. I stayed like this for five days. They
beat me until I fainted, all the time asking about the Kosovo
Liberation Army, who belonged to it, how it raised money abroad,
and where it got its weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day he was forced to sign a confession. ``I
promised to collaborate with them, and they gave me the name of a
police contact,'' he said, unfolding a small slip of white paper
from his wallet with a Serbian name and phone number written in
pencil.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, meanwhile, lived as if Kosovo were the raj, with all
civil and state jobs and a private police force to ensure their
privileged status in the birthplace of modern Serb nationalism.
Milosevic, presiding over a decaying economy, clung to the millions
of dollars a year in hard cash brought in by Kosovo's massive
Trepca mine complex, valued at $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The mine alone made him loath to give up the province to the
ethnic Albanians; the ultranationalist bigotry he had ridden to
power reinforced his obstinacy. Kosovo came to have the elements of
a political time bomb, ticking louder and louder while the world
looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   I had my first encounter _ indeed the first interview by any
reporter _ with a rebel commander in April 1997. I'd been standing
with one of the top officials of Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate
Albanian leader. We were in front of the McDonald's in downtown
Geneva on a rainy afternoon. He told me that at 6 p.m., in the
Buffet des Premieres Classes at the Geneva train station, I would
find a man seated in a front booth with a copy of the Journal de
Geneve. The paper, I was told, would be completely unfolded. I was
to come alone. The conversation would take place in French.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few ethnic Albanian reporters had spoken to the
Jasharis, the clan that made up much of the KLA at the start of the
rebellion, none dared write about them or the KLA. This deeply
angered the Jasharis and aided my efforts to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the station and saw a lean man in his late
thirties dressed in black jeans, a gray jacket and a purple
T-shirt. He looked up and motioned for me to follow him out the
door. We weaved quickly through the crowds outside the station
until we came to another cafe, where he took a seat along the back
wall facing the door.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel, who gave his nom de guerre as Alban, would within a
year lead a group of a few hundred fighters over the border from
northern Albania into Kosovo. The last I heard, he was commanding a
large unit in the province.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke quietly and without rancor. He said that, like most of
the leadership, he had spent years in prison for separatist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no Tito,'' he said. The KLA leadership, he told me,
was divided between about 30 people, with no paramount leader.
These men were drawn primarily from the 5,000 or so ethnic
Albanians who had fought for the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In another era the Jashari clan, which oversaw a large
black-market smuggling network, would have faded away into local
folklore. The Balkans are filled with small-time renegades who
combine criminal activity with thin, separatist ideologies.
Instead, by leveling Prekaz with 20 mm antiaircraft cannons and
killing more than 50 people, including many old people, women, and
children, the Serbs made the Jasharis into martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1998, U.S. Special Envoy to the Balkans Robert
Gelbard gave what many have interpreted as a green light to
Belgrade to go after the rebel bands by announcing in Pristina that
the KLA ``is without any question a terrorist group.'' He went on
to add that the United States ``condemns very strongly terrorist
activities in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks Serb forces had turned Prekaz into a smoldering
ruin, killed close to a hundred people, and ignited the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the Jashari compound was flattened with mortar
and cannon shells, I wandered among the piles of brick and cement.
In the ruins of one room lay a blackened book with a map that
showed a Greater Albania that included Kosovo, parts of Serbia,
much of Macedonia and parts of present-day Greece and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The map was drawn up on July 1, 1878, when the bajraktars, or
clan chieftains, from the Turkish realms of the southwest Balkans
founded the League for the Defense of the Albanian Nation. The book
was a potent reminder of what the war was about _ especially since,
with most ethnic Albanians concentrated in homogeneous areas
bordering Albania, the drive to extend Albania's borders remains
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   That drive is not only a wider threat to European stability but
also to Albanian moderation. Kosovar Albanians in exile _ and even
some who have gone back to fight _ express deep frustration at the
provincialism of the leadership within Kosovo, but to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the KLA, especially those who have not lived abroad,
are convinced that they have embarked on the century-long dream of
a Greater Albania. Many KLA commanders tout themselves as ``a
liberation army for all Albanians'' _ precisely what frightens the
NATO alliance most.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians were spurred by the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia.
Croatia and Serbia, whose political ideology is often overtly
racist, unleashed a war in the early 1990s largely against unarmed
civilians to try to form ethnically ``pure'' enclaves and states.
Militias stormed through minority communities in drunken frenzies,
looting, burning, raping and murdering. They set up detention
centers, carried out mass executions and ignored tepid
international protests.
</P>
<P>
   But after Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, Rugova
insisted on a very different road to independence, a Gandhi-like
plan to withdraw from all state institutions and create a parallel
government. His was to be a peaceful revolution and an example of
civility and tolerance that would earn the backing of the Western
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The former literature professor, with his glasses constantly
sliding down his nose and a scarf loosely draped around his neck,
has the distracted look of an aging Left Bank poet. Remote and out
of touch, he rarely leaves his small office in Pristina, even to
attend a funeral a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rugova's leadership, the ethnic Albanians had set up their
own schools, clinics and a shadow administration that levied taxes,
drawing on the resources of a diaspora of more than 600,000 ethnic
Albanians in Europe and some 300,000 in Canada and the United
States. The civil resistance lasted nearly a decade. Streams of
delegations from Kosovo traveled to Scandinavian countries to take
expenses-paid seminars in nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   But the protest, unsustainable in the long term and a victim of
international indifference, collapsed. Its death notice came after
the 1995 Dayton agreement was swiftly followed by the European
Union's recognition of Yugoslavia _ even though Yugoslavia had
failed to meet an EU demand to first resolve the Kosovo issue.

<P>
   Both the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo are now
confident that force of arms can solve the impasse between them.
Despite NATO's air strikes, neither side has much incentive to lay
down its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have huge stockpiles of heavy weapons they have yet to
unleash, while the KLA has a large reserve of volunteers and a
porous border with Albania to smuggle in supplies and newly trained
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in for a long fight, the KLA probably has 30,000
automatic weapons, made available at bargain prices after Albanian
military arsenals were looted in the chaos after the spring 1997
economic meltdown. The rebels have made a concerted effort to
acquire German antitank weapons, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles
and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, by launching the current rebellion, taking on
the Serbs and drawing international attention to the conflict, the
rebel group has done more in a year to further the cause of
independence for Kosovo than Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader,
was able to do over the preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Washington insists on adhering to the principle that
all states in the former Yugoslavia be multiethnic, there is little
hope of a resolution. And as long as Belgrade is permitted to
station troops in Kosovo, which is part of the current agreement,
neither NATO soldiers nor Kosovar Albanians will be safe. Building
any kind of lasting peace or democratic institutions will be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomatic efforts designed to keep the Serbs and the
ethnic Albanians in the same country mirror the fruitless peace
efforts carried out during the first three years of the Bosnian
war. The refusal to accept the creation of ethnically ``pure''
enclaves _ a decision that is strategically and morally
understandable _ leaves diplomats paying homage to multiethnic
institutions, however hollow, and lofty democratic ideals that
nearly all Balkan leaders detest.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo can remain a Serbian province and the two groups can live
together, this reasoning goes, if only the ethnic Albanians are
given a little more freedom. Given that between 1966 and 1989 an
estimated 130,000 Serbs left the province because of frequent
harassment and discrimination by the Kosovar Albanian majority,
this is at best naive.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement for which NATO went to war proposes to
deploy some 30,000 NATO troops and allow ethnic Albanian police to
take over security functions in Albanian-majority areas. The plan
would gradually cede local police control to the KLA, which would
probably comprise most of the force.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbia would keep troops in the province and handle security
along the borders _ especially the border with Albania, where the
KLA has set up logistics bases and smuggling routes for weapons and
fighters. The plan also calls for a phased disarming of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would be extremely hard to implement under a rebel
command that has spent the last three years preparing for war. The
KLA is wildly unlikaely to hand over its guns, especially given
Milosevic's pattern of ignoring formal agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The latent nationalism among most Serbs, coupled with the
disturbing belief that they were the real victims in Yugoslavia's
wars, is aroused by each Western attack. Belgrade knows that NATO
has no desire to become the air wing of the KLA. Anything much
short of all-out war on Yugoslavia only consolidates Milosevic's
grip on power and allows him to unleash his forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The West's blundering peace initiative has reminded the KLA not
to rely too much on NATO. The alliance was palpably reluctant to
move against the Serbs, although they have flagrantly violated the
agreement made last October to cease hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the October pact, NATO bombed to get Belgrade to sign
on to the Rambouillet deal _ a shift not lost on the Kosovar
Albanians. Milosevic, for his part, has driven NATO crazy since the
Kosovo crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hill, the current U.S. Kosovo mediator, has carried out
fruitless shuttle diplomacy since last spring; on his latest trip
to Belgrade, Milosevic did not even meet with him. Put bluntly, the
Serb leaders stiffed the United States. The KLA is correctly
distrustful of Western intentions and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   That distrust led to the decision by the KLA not to sign the
Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks last February _
which, in turn, let the alliance off the moral hook. Kosovar
intransigence gave the West the excuse it was looking for not to
implement the October agreement and deepened the already wide rifts
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   If the West's peace push eventually dies, as now appears likely,
the KLA leaders will swiftly become utterly disenchanted with the
West and turn to Islamic radicals ready to back another battle by
Muslims against Orthodox Christians. The Serbs, whose information
is admittedly often unreliable, say that Islamic charities in the
Persian Gulf are giving millions to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have detected ties to Islamist
organizations and suspect that some money has been forwarded to the
KLA. I saw bearded mujahideen, who did not look Albanian, wandering
around the staging areas in northern Albania, a hint that there may
be some truth to these assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also contend that the KLA has about 1,000 foreign
mercenaries from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia
and Croatia, as well as British and German instructors. Most of the
mercenaries are probably Albanian nationals, especially former
Albanian army officers, police officers and members of the state
security services.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is clearly preparing for a long slog. It has tried to
recruit ethnic Albanian veterans in Croatia, who formed two
battalions in Croatia's war against the Serbs. In early February,
Yugoslav officials said that they had seized $500,000 worth of
weapons, ammunition and uniforms for the KLA that were smuggled in
from Croatia in a truck.
</P>
<P>
   There are rebel training camps now in Albania _ apparently in
Ljabinot, near Tirana _ as well as ones I saw in Tropoja (near the
Yugoslav border), Kuks, and Bajram Curi.
</P>
<P>
   Were the conflagration to result in the deployment of
peacekeeping NATO ground forces _ a proposition that should not be
taken lightly _ it would have risks that were not faced in Bosnia.
Kosovo, unlike Cyprus and Bosnia, has no fixed lines dividing the
antagonists. The province's battle lines resemble the constantly
shifting sands of Central America's 1980s guerrilla wars: a stretch
of road that is safe in the morning can be deadly in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an insurrection rather than a war between
armies, rebels can be farmers one day and combatants the next. They
will be impossible to define.
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the waters further, the KLA is poorly led, with no
central command and little discipline. Many villages have formed ad
hoc militias that, while they identify themselves as KLA, act
independently.
</P>
<P>
   I found that KLA commanders often spent as much time trying to
find out what these militias were doing _ closing down unauthorized
roadblocks and curbing excesses by local warlords _ as they did
fighting the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem facing any peacekeeping force will be
defining who belongs to the KLA and who does not. The Serb soldiers
and special police, in uniform and headquartered in barracks, will
prove far easier to monitor, if not always control. But the overall
picture is one of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, by contrast, the front lines had changed little by
late 1992, and the war often resembled World War I clashes on the
western front, albeit on a much smaller scale. Hundreds of people
were wounded or killed in the trench warfare, but the trenches
themselves moved little.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, at least by the fall of 1995, conditions were much
riper for peacemaking. The Bosnian Serbs, battered by two weeks of
heavy NATO bombing, were a spent and broken force. On the other
hand, even after this spring's NATO air strikes and ruthless
Serbian attacks, Kosovo's combatants may still have vigor to spare.
Kosovo has not yet been granted the dubious blessing of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs appear to believe that the problem requires not
negotiation but more force. Morale among the Serbs is low, and
there are steady reports of desertions. The heavily mechanized Serb
patrols stick to the blacktop roads while the KLA controls a
network of back dirt roads that often skirt police checkpoints. And
Belgrade's decision to scorch villages is only flooding the rebels
with recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At this late stage in the game, a NATO deployment _ if Milosevic
can somehow be bombed into accepting it _ will over the short term
save lives, just as it did in Bosnia. But it will not bring back
the autonomy that Tito, the last of the Habsburgs, oversaw with
such skill.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the stationing of international troops may prevent
all-out fighting and provide the breathing space to negotiate a
workable solution. But given the deep rifts between the sides, the
latter is hardly likely.
</P>
<P>
   The international community would then face the stark choice
between remaining in Kosovo for a long time or pulling out after
the proposed three-year period, with the likelihood that those on
both sides of the divide would again pick up their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it will come to this: Led by the KLA, Kosovo will
separate from Serbia, whether by negotiations or by violence.

 &HT;    Stockpiling money in preparation of Y2K not a good idea, Federal
Reserve employees say
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Federal Reserve Board and financial
institutions want the public to know their money isn't going to
disappear or become inaccessible once the clock strikes midnight on
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the banking industry on Tuesday gathered at the
Cincinnati office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to
deliver a message: They are ready for Year 2000, or Y2K, on all
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry has tackled the technological issues of Y2K
and will soon shift to educating the public about what it doesn't
need to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Henshaw, vice president in charge of the Federal
Reserve's Cincinnati office, wanted to emphasize that customers
don't need to hoard money for fear that they won't be able to get
to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is already talking with the armored carrier
industry to make sure that banks get the money they need when they
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we'll have plenty of cash. There is no
need to take currency outside insured institutions,'' Henshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bud Burkle, vice president of Banking Supervision at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said he thinks once all is said
and done, Y2K is going to be a non-event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't promise that there won't be a few glitches somewhere
. . . (but) that happens without Y2K,'' Burkle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board's next check on the Y2K compliance of
all banks is June 30. About 95 percent of banks have been given a
satisfactory rating, a passing grade of sorts, by the regulating
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an industry, we're way ahead of the curve,'' said Bob
Elberfeld, a vice president of Firstar Bank in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon (Ohio) Citizens National Bank re-created itself as a
second bank for testing purposes, operating on critical dates such
as Dec. 31, Jan. 1 and Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked to make sure that everyone's accounts were still
there,'' bank President and Chief Executive Stephen Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Stamen, president and chief executive of Second National
Bank in Greenville, has said, ``Community banks are as well
prepared as larger banks. We're not that far from being able to do
things manually if we need to. But we don't need to. Our bank is
well prepared.'' Consumer tips
</P>
<P>
   Be aware of scams. Report scam artists who offer to ``hold''
your money through the date change or offer any ``Yokeproof''
investments, products or services.
</P>
<P>
   Never give out your Social Security number or bank account
number over the phone unless you are the one initiating the call or
you are sure the person with whom you're speaking is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Keep good records of all your banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Consider asking your lender for a printed history of the
payments on your mortgage, car loan or other debts.
</P>
<P>
   During the date change, take out as much cash as you would for
any holiday weekend.

STITH TOUTS AFRICAN NATIONS' INVESTMENT POTENTIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of prodding banks to reinvest in the inner city,
Charles R. Stith has found another marginalized constituency to
trumpet to US investors _ the entire continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Stith assumed the job of US ambassador to Tanzania last August
amid the turmoil after a terrorist bomb struck the embassy in Dar
Es Salam within hours of a twin bombing in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for the former Boston minister and black
activist to have been mired in security issues the past eight
months. Then there was Clinton's trip _ the first visit of a US
president to Africa _ to help coordinate earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Stith, 48, has kept his focus on what he sees as a much
greater threat to Africans than terrorist bombs over the long term
_ being marginalized in a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Africa has not had the infrastructure or the
regulated banking system to rate equal footing with trading
partners around the world, Stith said Tuesday at a lunchtime speech
to the World Affairs Council in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Germany's former enemies gave the recovering
nation a debt ceiling of 3.5 percent on loans from the the allies
to rebuild the country. But no cap has ever been set on African
countries that have been forced by famine and war to rely heavily
on western lending.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania itself, although stable for the past 30 years, has been
spent most of that time under socialist rule. It still suffers, he
said, ``from a socialist hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   The past weighs heavily on the economy: Tanzania presently
spends three times more money on debt service to various countries
than it does on educating its children.
</P>
<P>
   How, Stith asked, will Tanzania's workers ever compete in a
global economy if they are not schooled to do so?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to turn handouts to hand-ups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stith said the bombing itself was a sign of change in Dar es
Salaam, the Tanzanian capital. Terrorist violence had been
sporadic, he said, evident from the translation of the name itself:
``city of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bomb went off on Aug. 7, it was clear that the rules
had changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shift to a market economy in 1986, and more recently
to a multiparty government, Tanzania had become more vulnerable to
the rebels it used to accommodate in its socialist days, Stith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as capitalism takes root in Africa, some of the
continent's most promising business and academic leaders are taking
advantage of newly opened borders to flee.
</P>
<P>
   One tally holds that more than 30,000 Africans with doctorate
degrees live outside the continent, Stith said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep budding business leaders in Africa, Stith said, banks
must be backed by enough foreign capital to give customers the
confidence that they can keep their money in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Stith said he learned that lesson from an embassy employee who
was so afraid to put his savings in a local bank that he sought to
keep it in the ambassador's safe.
</P>
<P>
   There are promising developments, however, that should encourage
investment, Stith said. Mining exploration has skyrocketed over the
past six months, reflecting confidence in stability.
</P>
<P>
   And the entire continent has been buoyed by President Clinton's
visit, highlighting US interests in a long-term investment in
Africa, Stith said.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has a long way to go if it is to close the
``gap between rhetoric and reality,'' in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to `talk the talk,' he said. ``Now we need to
`walk the walk.' ''

RUSSIA SEEKS MEDIATING ROLE IN KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Four weeks after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, Russia
_ one of the few countries to have lent a sympathetic ear to
Belgrade and turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities in Kosovo
_ is now eagerly auditioning for the role of mediator.
</P>
<P>
   While his Communist-nationalist opposition keeps itself busy
with dreams of a Slavic union, President Boris Yeltsin has moved
Russian diplomacy onto more pragmatic ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after a telephone conversation with President
Clinton, Yeltsin sent his newly named special Balkans envoy, former
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, on a tour of Russia's
neighbors, seeking support for Moscow to lead the way out of the
impasse in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a another sign of Russia's stepped-up diplomatic activity,
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to visit Moscow in
late April.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Russian journalists Monday, Yeltsin stressed
Moscow's readiness to play the role of intermediary between the
NATO alliance and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a role
that Western leaders have said they would welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready,'' he said in off-the-cuff remarks, reported in
Russia newspapers Tuesday. ``They know that, and in that context,
we are collecting points. Good points.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has much to gain if it succeeds in brokering a political
settlement in Yugoslavia. By playing its part in bringing peace to
the Balkans, Russia would be able to reclaim an important role in
world affairs, a role that it realized with a jolt it had lost when
NATO ignored Moscow's opposition to the use of force in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And in openly soliciting Moscow's services, the West has already
signaled its interest in drawing Russia out of its isolation, and
in reinforcing Yeltsin's tattered credentials as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin still has to walk a fine line at home, where he has
been pressed in by a tide of anti-Western feelings let loose by
televised images of NATO airplanes bombing a fellow Slavic nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For political reasons, Yeltsin is trying to differentiate his
position from one staked out by the Communists, by trying to find
an active role for Russia in seeking a political solution,'' a
Moscow-based Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kremlin on Monday, Yeltsin said that Milosevic would
never capitulate, and that Russia will not stand by and watch
Kosovo turned into a NATO protectorate. But he also cautioned the
journalists not to exaggerate the prospects of a union linking
Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, a proposal that has been
enthusiastically endorsed by the opposition-dominated Russian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider it,'' he said. ``That's it. We cannot discard
it now because then we would abandon Milosevic. And we want to
embrace him a bit more closely. And hold him tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what Yeltsin had in mind with his bear-hug imagery was not
immediately clear. But according to Russians and Western diplomats,
Moscow clearly hopes to use its access to Milosevic to persuade him
to open peace negotiations on terms likely to be accepted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin doesn't want to be locked in an embrace with Milosevic
that is not under his control,'' the Western diplomat said. But as
many here have noted, it is still not clear what leverage Moscow
has over Belgrade, if any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has no influence over Belgrade, as Milosevic has proven
over the years,'' said Maksim Yusin, a foreign-affairs analyst for
the newspaper Izvestia. ``He has used Russia only when he wants to
frighten the West. Otherwise, he is always ready to play behind our
backs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the war, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov came back empty-handed from a diplomatic mission to
Belgrade. According to Yusin, Primakov then floated a proposal
involving the partition of Kosovo but apparently that idea was
rejected by Milosevic, perhaps because it came too early in
Belgrade's campaign to push Albanian Kosovars out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yusin, the main bargaining in any future
negotiations will likely be over the makeup and command structure
for international security forces to be deployed in Kosovo. NATO
has insisted on sending in its own force, under its own command,
but a parallel force, including Russian troops operating under
another flag, may be a negotiable point.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Chernomyrdin is seen in Moscow as a ploy by
Yeltsin both to open a new diplomatic front with NATO countries,
and to counterbalance the Russian Foreign Ministry, which has
remained the domain of Primakov, the former foreign minister known
for his hard-line stance.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have criticized the appointment, noting that
Chernomyrdin, with his affable manner and fumbling speech, will be
too compliant with the Western leaders he came to know as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nonprofessional in diplomacy has only two options _ to
please everyone or agree with the strongest,'' said Dmitri
Gornostayev, a commentator for the Independent Newspaper, which has
been harshly critical of NATO's campaign. ``Both options would lead
to an impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks, Russian officials have toned down the harsh
Cold War language that characterized their first response to the
NATO strikes. But the anti-Western mood in the country is still
strong, as Russian politicians and much of the media continue to
focus on the damage caused by NATO bombs, treating reports of
Serbian-led atrocities in Kosovo with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But there were new signs this week that Russia is now willing to
hear other views of the situation in Yugoslavia. Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, who is to set off soon for a tour of the Middle East,
met Tuesday with members of the Islamic Conference Organization,
and listened as Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi of Iran condemned
the ethnic purges in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting on Tuesday first with Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze in Tblisi and then with Azerbaijan President Heydar
Aliyev in Baku, Chernomyrdin heard both leaders condemn both the
NATO strikes, and the ``ethnic cleansing and genocide'' in Kosovo,
words that Moscow has until now refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is to go on Wednesday to Kiev, the Ukrainian
capital, where he is to meet with President Leonid Kuchma, who
despite pressure from Moscow, will be leaving this week to attend
NATO's 50th anniversary meeting in Washington. Chernomyrdin's next
stop on his diplomatic search is still not known.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's isolation not only from its erstwhile Western partners
but also from its former Soviet neighbors was brought home recently
at a summit meeting of the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, where leaders of the former Soviet republics shunned
Moscow's harsh language, and adopted a generally worded resolution
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of a subtle shift in Russian public opinion, the
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksei II, arrived
Tuesday in Belgrade with a message in which he for the first time
suggested that Russia's Eastern Orthodox brethren in Serbia bear a
share of the responsibility for the tragedy that has befallen their
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``See to it that reconciliation and accord triumph,'' Aleksei II
told a crowd in Belgrade, according to a report by the Russian news
agency Interfax. ``Then nobody can reproach you for sinful deeds in
vindicating their own sin.''

CLINTON, DEMOCRATS HOPE CASH KEEPS FLOWING AT HOUSTON FUND-RAISER 

</HEADLINE>

and ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton drops by La Colombe d'Or in
Houston Wednesday evening, he won't be just sampling the French
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   As he has so many times in the past the president will be
prospecting for cash in the Lone Star State, this time on behalf of
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip comes at a time when Democrats are competing for
scarce campaign dollars. The state Democratic Party's fortunes have
never been lower, and Republican Gov. George W. Bush has been
vacuuming up campaign funds for his expected presidential bid. Of
the $7.6 million that Bush has raised for his exploratory committee
this year, $4 million came from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many wealthy Democrats would rather give to
congressional campaigns where they are assured the money will
remain in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly competition for campaign money in Texas
these days,'' said Houston political consultant Nancy Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sims said corporate executives, lawyers and others in
Texas who want to nourish simultaneous bonds with Republican and
Democratic leaders will continue to find a way to signal their
support for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas is still viewed as a gold mine by national Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent election cycle ending last December, the
national Democratic Party and its candidates scooped up more than
$16 million from Texas, about 40 percent of all money raised in the
state over the two-year period, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics. Only in New York, California and Illinois did
the party do better.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is the top city for Democratic fund-raising, followed by
Dallas, San Antonio and Beaumont-Port Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee alone raised $1.4 million
during the 1997-98 election cycle from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official reason for Clinton's one-day visit to
Texas is to dedicate the new Austin-Bergstrom International
Airport, he will spend the bulk of his time raising money.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, after the airport event, he will attend a fund-raiser
at the home of Roy Spence, the advertising executive who has known
Clinton since the two worked on George McGovern's presidential
campaign in 1972. With a minimum contribution of $1,000 required
and a crowd of 125 expected, the event should generate $250,000,
according to DNC officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the fund-raiser will be a more intimate _ and more
lucrative _ affair with 30 to 40 people expected at La Colombe
d'Or. The price of admission: $20,000 a couple. And Democrats hope
to raise $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event is hosted by Kenneth Bailey, a successful trial lawyer
whose law partner is John Eddie Williams, one of five attorneys
sharing a $3.3 billion fee because of their role in a recent state
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is a generous contributor to Democrats, giving $70,000
alone to the Democratic National Committee in the last election
cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. His law
firm, Williams &AMP; Bailey, gave a total of $250,000 to the DNC during
the cycle, more than any other individual or group.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokesman Peter Kauffmann said the
Texas Democrats' troubles do not seem to have rubbed off on the
fund-raising circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly didn't have any trouble filling these two
fund-raisers,'' he said, adding that the president still remains a
big draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to go to events where he speaks,'' Kauffmann said.
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raiser Clinton headlined for Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro last September netted about $250,000 for
Mauro's campaign, despite a disastrous finish at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president's approval rating has declined in Texas
since his impeachment ordeal, according to the latest Texas Poll.
The survey of 1,003 Texans found that 48 percent believe he is
doing a good job as president while 49 percent disapprove of his
job performance. In a previous survey, conducted during the Senate
impeachment trial, Clinton's job approval stood at 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And many Democrats are unhappy that DNC fund-raisers tend not
only to siphon money out of the state for projects that do not help
elect local candidates but also end up hampering other fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't do well,'' one top Democratic House aide
said of the national party's fund-raising events in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the congressional Democrats need all the cash they
can raise to help retake the House in 2000. If Democrats hope to
regain the House they cannot afford to lose the 17 seats they now
hold in Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Furthermore, the aide said, Democrats are focusing on keeping
control of the Texas House and retaking the state Senate to ensure
the party can play a role in congressional redistricting after the
2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, some Texas Democrats say they prefer to give
to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which earlier
this month hosted a series of fund-raisers in the state that
generated more than $1 million.

ROAD TO THE CUP BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even a week beyond the staggering loss of Wayne Gretzky to
retirement, the National Hockey League tries to get its legs back
with the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,107-game prelude to the postseason ended Sunday, only
hours after the Great One took his final, tearful twirl around
Madison Square Garden. Wednesday night, the long winnowing process
begins, with 16 teams facing the difficult prospect of winning 16
more games to clinch the Cup. One qualifier, the San Jose Sharks,
won only 31 games the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to believe the final standings, the New Jersey Devils
will meet the Dallas Stars in the best-of-seven finals some six
weeks from now. Ah, but this is playoff hockey, where things seldom
go according to form. First-round upsets are de rigueur, often
spiced with curious (the buzz adjective for ``expletive deleted'')
officiating and bizarre goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins should beat the Carolina Hurricanes, but weren't we
saying the same thing last year when the Black-and-Gold met the
Washington Capitals? If not for Tim Taylor's interloping toe, the
Bruins might have won. Instead, they were rubbed out in six games
and the Capitals went on to play the role of clay pigeons in the
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   So it begins. By no later than June 19, the final Stanley Cup
champion of the 1900s will be crowned. Gretzky, the greatest
point-getter the game ever knew, got his name on four of those
Cups. But in '99, No. 99 has left and gone away. Never has a second
season begun with such a tinge of sadness. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey (1) vs. Pittsburgh (8) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four years after carrying the Cup around Exit 16W, the Devils
are poised for a long postseason run. We were saying the same last
year, of course, but their offense disappeared in Round 1 as they
lost to the Senators in six games, outscored, 13-12. Don't look for
the same choke. They've got a more balanced, more aggressive attack
under coach Robbie Ftorek, and there's a tendency to forget that
Martin Brodeur ranks among the game's top 3-5 netminders. Are they
unbeatable? No. But it's a talented, smart squad that easily could
see its No. 1 seed hold up through the first three rounds. The
Penguins have the best player in the world, Jaromir Jagr, and they
spice up the offense with the ever-enigmatic Alexei Kovalev, one of
the world's great one-on-one performers. Tom Barrasso isn't
Brodeur's match, but he won two Cups in Pittsburgh's heyday and
still has the skills to carry a club in a series. But the Penguins
have issues, such as their continuing odyssey in bankruptcy court
and a lack of depth among the forwards and blue liners. Watch for
Scott Stevens to be behind the Washington blue line every time Jagr
is on the ice. And look for Devils forward Peter Sykora to be the
offensive star he never has been in the playoffs. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey injuries: None.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh injuries: Neil Wilkinson (groin pull); Jeff Serowik
(concussion).
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Devils, 4-1-0
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Devils in 6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ottawa (2) vs. Buffalo (7) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate pick 'em, no matter that the Senators led the
conference for much of the second half. The Sabres could show up
with the Hamilton-Wenham Knights skating the wing, and as long as
Dominik Hasek is in their net, they'd enter the series even money
(witness: the 1998 Czech Republic gold-medal Olympic squad). The
Senators softened up a little over the last month and slipped to
the No. 2 seed, but they've got perhaps the best overall speed in
the Original 27. They had a nasty habit of giving up the game's
first goal late in the season, and they don't want to be handing
Hasek 1-0 leads with, say, 3:27 clicked off the clock. The Sabres
can't come close to matching the Senators for mobility and depth
among the forwards, and Michal Grosek, perhaps their best power
forward, followed a strong start this season with overwhelming
mediocrity. However, ex-Oiler Miroslav Satan finished with a
slightly surprising 40 goals (suppose the Oilers would send back
Barrie Moore and Craig Miller for that kind of touch?). Ottawa will
pressure the puck with one of the game's best forechecks _ sprung
from a basic trap _ and hope to pick apart a sometimes vulnerable
defense. The Sabres will try to use their edge in the muscle
department, because the Senators don't have an enforcer. But the
Rob Rays and Paul Kruses of the world don't mean much in April and
May anymore. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo injuries: Joe Juneau (concussion).
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa injuries: Shawn McEachern (groin pull); Andreas Johansson
(back spasms).
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Senators, 4-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Senators in six. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (3) vs. Boston (6) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are, and forever will be, the Forever .500s, the one-time
Hartford Whalers, and here they are _ in their first postseason
visit since '92 _ to face their archenemy from the Hub. If not for
the NHL's seeding method, which awards divisional winners the 1-2-3
spots, the Canes would have been the No. 8 seed and played the
broad-shouldered Devils, and the Bruins would be opposing the
Flyers. They've tried, but the Canes haven't been able to make that
big roster upgrade to be someting other than also-rans (remember
the failed attempt during the '98 Olympics to woo Sergei Fedorov
away from the Wings?). The Carolina offense revolves around two
pivots, Keith Primeau and Ron Francis, and Primeau has been
suffering of late with a bad back. If he's not in top shape, the
Canes will have an extremely difficult time generating a bona fide
attack. Just as Byron Dafoe is the key to Boston's game, the Canes
are nowhere without Arturs Irbe in their cage. Dafoe has the extra
incentive of never having won a postseason series. This should be a
breeze for the Bruins, provided that two-line attack they fashioned
late in the season doesn't fail them now (read: if Joe Thornton's
shoulder is a problem, the offense could hiccup badly). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston injuries: Joe Thornton (shoulder); Tim Taylor (groin
pull); Shawn Bates (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   Carolina injuries: Keith Primeau (strained lower back); Ray
Sheppard (strained neck); Sean Hill (fractured jaw); Glen Wesley
(sprained ankle); Nolan Pratt (sprained shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Even, 2-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Bruins in five. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Toronto (4) vs. Philadelphia (5) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Clarke's worst nightmare. The Flyers' general manager
didn't chase Curtis Joseph in the free-agent market and CuJo went
home to Ontario and backstopped the Leafs back to franchise status.
The Flyers instead paid to bring in John Vanbiesbrouck, a move that
had Clarke briefly ordering rookie Jean-Marc Pelletier into action
in a prolonged late-season slump. The Leafs made serious strides
this year with Pat Quinn behind their bench, CuJo in net, and Mats
Sundin joining another free agent, Steve Thomas, in shaping a
formidable No. 1 line (with a vareity of right wingers). Behind the
blue line, the Leafs are lacking, although ex-Ranger Alexander
Karpovtsev (picked up for Mathieu Schneider) wasn't the bust
everyone thought, and Bryan Berard makes up for a lot of his
negatives with his positive offense. The Flyers got some good news
over the weekend: Mark Recchi, having suffered two concussions in
23 days, was cleared to play (his dizziness and nausea weren't
caused by the concussions). Nonetheless, they must move ahead
without their captain, Eric Lindros, who continues to build his
strength back after suffering a collapsed lung on April 1. Even
with Lindros at full strength, the Flyers fell apart in the second
half, and even with some of the games most talented forwards,
they're looking at a short postseason. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toronto injuries: Alyn McCauley (concussion); Igor Korolev
(fractured finger).
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia injuries: Eric Lindros (collapsed lung).
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Philadelphia, 3-1-0.

RUSSIA SEEKS MEDIATING ROLE IN KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Four weeks after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, Russia
_ one of the few countries to have lent a sympathetic ear to
Belgrade and turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities in Kosovo
_ is now eagerly auditioning for the role of mediator.
</P>
<P>
   While his Communist-nationalist opposition keeps itself busy
with dreams of a Slavic union, President Boris Yeltsin has moved
Russian diplomacy onto more pragmatic ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after a telephone conversation with President
Clinton, Yeltsin sent his newly named special Balkans envoy, former
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, on a tour of Russia's
neighbors, seeking support for Moscow to lead the way out of the
impasse in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a another sign of Russia's stepped-up diplomatic activity,
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to visit Moscow in
late April.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Russian journalists Monday, Yeltsin stressed
Moscow's readiness to play the role of intermediary between the
NATO alliance and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a role
that Western leaders have said they would welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready,'' he said in off-the-cuff remarks, reported in
Russia newspapers Tuesday. ``They know that, and in that context,
we are collecting points. Good points.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has much to gain if it succeeds in brokering a political
settlement in Yugoslavia. By playing its part in bringing peace to
the Balkans, Russia would be able to reclaim an important role in
world affairs, a role that it realized with a jolt it had lost when
NATO ignored Moscow's opposition to the use of force in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And in openly soliciting Moscow's services, the West has already
signaled its interest in drawing Russia out of its isolation, and
in reinforcing Yeltsin's tattered credentials as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin still has to walk a fine line at home, where he has
been pressed in by a tide of anti-Western feelings let loose by
televised images of NATO airplanes bombing a fellow Slavic nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For political reasons, Yeltsin is trying to differentiate his
position from one staked out by the Communists, by trying to find
an active role for Russia in seeking a political solution,'' a
Moscow-based Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kremlin on Monday, Yeltsin said that Milosevic would
never capitulate, and that Russia will not stand by and watch
Kosovo turned into a NATO protectorate. But he also cautioned the
journalists not to exaggerate the prospects of a union linking
Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, a proposal that has been
enthusiastically endorsed by the opposition-dominated Russian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider it,'' he said. ``That's it. We cannot discard
it now because then we would abandon Milosevic. And we want to
embrace him a bit more closely. And hold him tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what Yeltsin had in mind with his bear-hug imagery was not
immediately clear. But according to Russians and Western diplomats,
Moscow clearly hopes to use its access to Milosevic to persuade him
to open peace negotiations on terms likely to be accepted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin doesn't want to be locked in an embrace with Milosevic
that is not under his control,'' the Western diplomat said. But as
many here have noted, it is still not clear what leverage Moscow
has over Belgrade, if any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has no influence over Belgrade, as Milosevic has proven
over the years,'' said Maksim Yusin, a foreign-affairs analyst for
the Russian newspaper Izvestia. ``He has used Russia only when he
wants to frighten the West. Otherwise, he is always ready to play
behind our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the war, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov came back empty-handed from a diplomatic mission to
Belgrade. According to Yusin, Primakov then floated a proposal
involving the partition of Kosovo but apparently that idea was
rejected by Milosevic, perhaps because it came too early in
Belgrade's campaign to push Albanian Kosovars out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yusin, the main bargaining in any future
negotiations will likely be over the makeup and command structure
for international security forces to be deployed in Kosovo. NATO
has insisted on sending in its own force, under its own command,
but a parallel force, including Russian troops operating under
another flag, may be a negotiable point.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Chernomyrdin is seen in Moscow as a ploy by
Yeltsin both to open a new diplomatic front with NATO countries,
and to counterbalance the Russian Foreign Ministry, which has
remained the domain of Primakov, the former foreign minister known
for his hard-line stance.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have criticized the appointment, noting that
Chernomyrdin, with his affable manner and fumbling speech, will be
too compliant with the Western leaders he came to know as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nonprofessional in diplomacy has only two options _ to
please everyone or agree with the strongest,'' said Dmitri
Gornostayev, a commentator for the Independent Newspaper, which has
been harshly critical of NATO's campaign. ``Both options would lead
to an impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks, Russian officials have toned down the harsh
Cold War language that characterized their first response to the
NATO strikes. But the anti-Western mood in the country is still
strong, as Russian politicians and much of the media continue to
focus on the damage caused by NATO bombs, treating reports of
Serbian-led atrocities in Kosovo with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But there were new signs this week that Russia is now willing to
hear other views of the situation in Yugoslavia. Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, who is to set off soon for a tour of the Middle East,
met Tuesday with members of the Islamic Conference Organization,
and listened as Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi of Iran condemned
the ethnic purges in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting on Tuesday first with Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze in Tblisi and then with Azerbaijan President Heydar
Aliyev in Baku, Chernomyrdin heard both leaders condemn both the
NATO strikes, and the ``ethnic cleansing and genocide'' in Kosovo,
words that Moscow has until now refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is to go on Wednesday to Kiev, the Ukrainian
capital, where he is to meet with President Leonid Kuchma, who
despite pressure from Moscow, will be leaving this week to attend
NATO's 50th anniversary meeting in Washington. Chernomyrdin's next
stop on his diplomatic search is still not known.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's isolation not only from its erstwhile Western partners
but also from its former Soviet neighbors was brought home recently
at a summit meeting of the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, where leaders of the former Soviet republics shunned
Moscow's harsh language, and adopted a generally worded resolution
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of a subtle shift in Russian public opinion, the
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksei II, arrived
Tuesday in Belgrade with a message in which he for the first time
suggested that Russia's Eastern Orthodox brethren in Serbia bear a
share of the responsibility for the tragedy that has befallen their
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``See to it that reconciliation and accord triumph,'' Aleksei II
told a crowd in Belgrade, according to a report by the Russian news
agency Interfax. ``Then nobody can reproach you for sinful deeds in
vindicating their own sin.''

 &HT;    Deans discuss challenges facing business schools
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deans of the nation's business schools, laboring in
the eye of technological change, gathered in Atlanta this week to
grapple with the problems of teaching business leaders even as the
environment churns around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Technology Revolution in Management Education'' is the
theme of the meeting of some 1,000 deans and other policy-makers in
higher education whose three-day meeting at the Atlanta Hilton
concludes today.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the International Association for Management
Education were augmented by delegates from more than 30 countries,
underlining the international thrust of business education in the
growing global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the individual challenges business colleges face, on the
undergraduate and graduate levels, are ways to use computer
networks to upgrade traditional teaching in classrooms and to reach
students in remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   At a roundtable, deans from Duke, Georgetown University,
University of Maryland, Colorado State, Boston University and
University of Florida discussed the challenges of teaching
management in the turmoil of a constantly changing technology
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major challenges facing the schools and the business
of educating managers are the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobilizing the latest teaching technology, such as software
for teaching on the Internet, including full-motion video,
archiving, and live discussions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding, training and keeping the informed and skilled
teachers needed to to keep curriculum fresh and pertinent to the
latest needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dealing with the growing influx of students from abroad, all
seeking to learn American secrets of management.
</P>
<P>
   _ Apportioning resources among the various tasks such as
undergraduate education, graduate education and response to
specific needs of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keeping clear the distinction between education _ the
traditional role of colleges and universities _ and training, which
has mostly been the job of businesses and industries.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all institutions are now adopting programs like the
Georgia Tech system for teaching by using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the University of Florida is just embarking on a
program to put subject matter on the Internet and also conduct live
``discussions'' among students and teachers on various business
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to award the Masters in Business Administration
to students who will gather on campus only about eight times,''
said John Kraft, dean of the business schools at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Another twist on the traditional MBA is the global program
operated by Duke, where graduate students, who come from around the
world, actually do their studies during intensive residential
programs on various continents to catch the international flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Frank, dean of business at the University of Maryland,
said one-third of his applications for advanced business training
are from abroad, with a substantial portion from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 39 percent of the enrolled students are women,'' he
added, ``and 29 percent are minorities, including
African-Americans, Hispanics and other groups _ and the faculty
very much reflects the diversity of the students.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar patterns were evident on campuses around the country,
the deans said.
</P>
<P>
   Deans who discussed their programs agreed that the new shifting
demands on teaching resources required new team teaching tactics,
more cooperation among departments, including the library
resources, as well as team approaches to student learning.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Adams of Duke pointed out that technology enables business
schools such as his to offer advanced education in cities like
Frankfurt, Germany, where Duke is setting up an auxiliary program.
Frankfurt is a major industrial and transportation hub without a
business school. Duke is located in small-town North Carolina with
a ``podunk'' airport, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Frankfurt business will work with a Duke because we have
something they don't have in their city,'' Adams said, and that
pattern could affect various schools around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hand-wringing over new approaches, bigger missions
and more complex challenges for colleges, the institutions are
helped by remembering their primary charge, the educators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is what we are about, teaching students how to
think, analyze and so on,'' said Louis E. Lataif, Dean of Boston
University's school of management, ``and we should leave the
training to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Others gave a different spin: In the hierarchy of functions, the
university does best at education and research, with the echoes
from those activities resonating down the line in training and
other programs more dependent on the moment-by-moment changes in
technology and needs.
</P>
<P>
   But the way those functions are delivered could radically change
in the next several years. ``Those who will be delivering it may
not be seated around this room today,'' Lataif said. ``It could be
Microsoft hiring faculty as consultants to teach management to its
computer executives.''

WESTERN CONFERENCE 

</HEADLINE>
   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... Toronto in six.  Dallas (1) vs. Edmonton (8) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most lopsided matchup of the first round. Dallas (114
points) was a powerhouse, finishing first overall in league
standings. The Stars may have overpaid for aging free agent Brett
Hull, but his play with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen gave head
coach Ken Hitchcock not only a prolific trio (84 goals), but also a
disciplined defensive line, an unexpected two-for. Derian Hatcher
will miss the Stars' first five postseason games, part of his
sentence for an ugly elbow that left the Coyotes' Jeremy Roenick
with a fractured jaw. Hatcher is a key loss back there, but the
Stars are fortunate to be getting him back at all _ the hit was far
worse than the one Dale Hunter put on Pierre Turgeon a few years
ago, leading to Hunter's suspension for a quarter-season. Can Eddie
Belfour truly be a Cup-winning netminder? This could be eagle-eyed
Eddie's last chance to prove it. Meanwhile, ex-BC Eagle Bill Guerin
was the Oilers' No. 1 scorer until he suffered knee damage in a
leg-to-leg collision with the Sharks' Marco Strum. He's down until
at least Game 4. The Oilers easily handed the Flames in the
end-of-season Battle of Alberta, but they're much too thin on
offense and may or may not have a No. 1 goalie (Tommy Salo? Bob
Essensa?) even to wish upon beating the Stars. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas injuries: Dallas: Brian Skrudland (torn rib cartilage);
Richard Matvichuk (groin and knee); Pat Verbeek (sprained left
knee)
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton injuries: Bill Guerin (knee); Josef Beranek (knee).
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Dallas, 3-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Dallas in four. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (2) vs. San Jose (7) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche were slow to get going, but rookie coach Bob
Hartley survived his club's early lethargy and saw GM Pierre
Lacroix pull off the late-season trade for Theo Fleury that makes
this an interesting postseason package. Not a bad power play: Joe
Sakic between Peter Forsberg and Claude Lemieux, with Fleury and
Sandis Ozolinsh at the points. Ex-BU Terrier Ted Drury made a
legitimate Rookie of the Year statement with 20 goals, 44 points,
his playing time affected by a star-studded cast up front.
Ozolinsh, an early-season holdout, revived the offense immediately
upon coming to contract terms. In net, Patrick Roy remains the key,
his skills still sharp enough to pull off another Cup. Sharks head
coach Darryl Sutter keeps talking about going with Mike Vernon in
net to start the series. Curious, because Vernon was 0-4-1 in his
last five games while ex-Sabre Steve Shields was almost CuJo-like
down the stretch when the Sharks desperately needed points. The
trade-deadline acquisition of Vincent Damphousse helped bring
together a sporadic offense (definition of sporadic: Joe Murphy the
top goal-scorer with 25). The picture would be brighter here if
Gary Suter hadn't been lost for the season after biceps surgery.
They're moving up, but it won't be this year. &QL;

   Detroit (3) vs. Anaheim (6) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in their red-hot era of the '50s, the Wings never won three
straight Cups, but even their boastful late-seson maneuverings
don't categorize them as ``favored returnees.'' Remember, they
picked up Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark, and Bill
Ranford at the trade deadline in one of the boldest and broadest
roster upgrades in memory. OK, they're better, and they could win
again, but they by no means are to be considered the conference
heavyweight. The Avalanche play with more eagerness. The Stars have
someting to prove: that the regular season wasn't a fluke. In the
end, the Wings will need big performances out of Fedorov and
Brendan Shanahan, neither of whom had commanding regular seasons,
both of whom could be moved if the Wings don't make a serious run
here. Teemu Selanne's 47 goals led the Ducks and also the league,
making him the first winner of the Rocket Richard Award. With Paul
Kariya and Selanne, there is a lot to like about the sons of
Disney, but not enough (their 83 points wouldn't have gotten them
into the East playoffs). They're about one line and a pair of
defensemen away from getting in with the likes of Detroit,
Colorado, and Dallas. It could be a wait. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit injuries: Uwe Krupp (back).
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim injuries: Steve Rucchin (strained groin).
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Detroit, 3-1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Detroit in 6. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (4) vs. St. Louis (5) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That flying elbow Hatcher delivered to Roenick's noggin
fractured JR's jaw in three places, broke or cracked eight teeth,
and cut the Coyotes' playoffs chances off at the knees. The ex-Jets
had the best first half in franchise history, began to erode in the
second half, then crumpled with the Hatcher hit. Captain Keith
Tkachuk likely now will have either Robert Reichel or rookie Daniel
Briere dishing him the puck; neither can provide the fire and drive
that Roenick brought to the pivot. Once more, too much falls to
Tkachuk (reminiscent of Winnipeg days) and, once past him, it all
falls to goalie Nikolai Khabibulin. The Cup won't come to cactus
country this spring. The Blues patched up their net (remember when
they hustled to get Jim Carey?) with the surprising return to form
of Grant Fuhr. Ex-Bruin Geoff Courtnall shook off concussion
symptoms and got back in just before the close of the season to
finish with 24 goals. In all, it's a surprisingly perky offense,
led by Pavol Demitra (37 goals, 89 points), Pierre Turgeon (31, 65)
and big-shooting Al MacInnis on the blue line. The Blues just
barely would have qualified in the East, but they're plucky enough
to win at least one round in the wild West. &QL;

 Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the Spanish director Julio Medem.  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wu Tianming is well acquainted with the whims of fortune: During
the 1980s, as an acclaimed director, he headed Xian Film Studio,
the cradle of the New Chinese Cinema, which burst upon the
international scene with the force of a revelation. Less than a
decade later, he was reduced to running a video store in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wu, at 60, is once again working as a director in China.
On a recent visit to New York, he looked back on these twists of
fate with remarkable good humor. What's the secret of his
equanimity? ``I'm very easy-going,'' he explained through a
translator. ``I have no heart and no lungs.'' Meaning? ``I don't
let things get to me. There's an old Chinese poem that says, `If
you've been through the big wave of the ocean, the quiet water of
the river cannot disturb you anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks,'' Wu's first film in a decade, opens in New
York on May 9. Set in Sichuan province in the 1930s, it follows an
itinerant street performer, Old Wang (Zhu Xu), who earns a meager
living astounding crowds with his skill at ``changing faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Using elaborate sleight of hand, practitioners of this folk art
change masks as if by magic. Master Lliang (Zhao Zhigang), a
celebrated female impersonator in a local opera company, admires
Wang's artistry, but Wang declines the offer to join Lliang's
wealthy troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he longs for a male heir to inherit the secrets of his
skill. On the black market, Wang meets Doggie (Zhou Ren-ying), a
7-year-old put up for sale by his destitute father. An ecstatic
Wang buys him, but soon discovers that his new ``grandson'' is
really a girl, an inappropriate heir and a worthless creature on
the scale of China's social values.
</P>
<P>
   There his troubles begin. Doggie and Wang suffer extreme
misfortune, but they're bound by love and by their common fate as
outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   A simple, sensitive film, ``The King of Masks'' draws upon Wu's
deep understanding of rural Chinese culture. ``He's a country
boy,'' said Donald Gibbs, a professor of Chinese language,
literature and film at the University of California at Davis, where
Wu has been a guest lecturer. ``He's very earthy and unpretentious.
He speaks the language and understands the heart of mainstream
country China in a way that city folks never will. That's his gift,
that's who he is, and his films reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu was born in China's Appalachia, the poverty-stricken,
agrarian north of Shaanxi province. He began his career in the
province's capital as an actor at Xian Film Studio; in 1966, when
the Cultural Revolution short-circuited his plans to study film in
Beijing, he spent years at home reading about filmmaking in secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many educational books were destroyed, but film manuals were
spared, because film didn't seem to matter much,'' he said with
some amusement. ``And then, there were so many books, the Cultural
Revolution people could not burn them all.''
</P>
<P>
   During those dark years, Wu's father, a former revolutionary and
devoted government official, died shortly after being jailed on
trumped-up charges of treason. Wu himself suffered public
humiliation. In his 1987 film, ``The Old Well,'' a young man dies
in a tragic accident; party officials attend the funeral to report
allegations of his licentious behavior. ``That's what those times
were like,'' Wu said. ``People would even accuse the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cultural Revolution subsided, Wu was finally able to
attend the Beijing Film Academy. After graduating in 1976, he
returned to Xian and received his first solo directing credit for
``River Without Buoys'' (1982), a spectacular popular success about
three men who share their experiences of the Cultural Revolution as
they pilot a raft down the Pushui River.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he made ``Life,'' which focuses on a village
schoolteacher who is torn between his intellectual urban
aspirations and his love for a peasant woman.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Life's' appeal was so broad,'' Gibbs recalled, ``that
intellectuals and city people loved it, and peasants would place
gifts of vegetables and poultry at the door of Wu's studio with
notes saying, `Please let us know what happened to the
characters.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the head of Xian Film Studio, Wu also promoted artistic
freedom; he was open to the fresh ideas and daring approaches of
younger directors. His film ``The Old Well,'' about a man striving
to find a new source of water for a village nestled high in stony
mountains, starred a young actor named Zhang Yimou.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang is better known as a member of the ``Fifth Generation'' of
Chinese directors, who got their start at Xian Film Studio and went
on to capture world attention. Films like Zhang's ``Red Sorghum''
(1988), a sensuous rural epic culminating in the Japanese invasion;
Tian Zhuangzhuang's ``Horse Thief'' (1986), an austerely beautiful
film about Tibetan nomads in the 1920s, and Chen Kaige's ``King of
Children'' (1987), which focused on a schoolteacher sent to the
countryside during the Cultural Revolution, were all produced at
Xian. Their spectacular visuals and unorthodox subject matter
reflected a radical break with prevailing codes of Socialist
Realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fifth Generation drove home the idea that the official
Socialist version of reality was not only boring but a lie,'' said
Xudong Zhang, a Rockefeller Fellow in the humanities at New York
University and a specialist in Chinese cinema. ``They tried to
uncover a deeper reality by inventing a new cinematic language, a
new visual culture, and by turning our gaze to truths that had been
concealed. Their utopian energy was directed against an ossified
state bureaucracy. These Fifth Generation directors were not
exactly political dissidents, however; for a brief period in the
1980s, the critique of Chinese tradition in their films fit in well
with Deng's ideology of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu was visiting the United States in the spring of 1989 when the
events of Tiananmen Square unfolded. He remained in this country
for five years. Returning to China to make ``The King of Masks'' in
1994, he found a culture in the throes of economic and social
transformation. ``I don't understand why, all of a sudden, Chinese
people seem to have grown so cold,'' he said. ``That's why I wanted
to make this film, to show that love and warmth are more important
than tradition or money.''
</P>
<P>
   China's new entrepreneurial spirit has had mixed results for the
nation's vanguard cinema, which now finds itself competing with
Hollywood products. Like many recent films by Chinese directors,
``The King of Masks'' was primarily financed by nonmainland
sources, in this case the Hong Kong-based Shao Brothers film
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom-line concerns have not prevented the rise of a ``Sixth
Generation'' of Chinese directors, however, whose documentary style
and focus on private, ephemeral experience stand in sharp contrast
to that of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the irrepressible Wu keeps working. He has just
completed China's most popular television soap opera ever, and is
directing another _ 36 episodes about a century in the lives of
three families living near the Yellow River. (He expects about 32
episodes to remain when the censors finish their work.) Like Old
Wang in ``The King of Masks,'' he changes faces but maintains a
deep simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the film's broader message,'' he said. ``In life in
general, you have to keep changing faces in order to survive.''

MASSACRE VICTIMS IN RWANDA SEEK JUSTICE IN VILLAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By IAN FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda _ The word gacaca in the Kinyarwanda language
spoken here refers to the grass that village elders once sat on as
they mediated the disputes of rural life in Rwanda: a cow trampled
someone's crops, or bad blood arose between two families.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rwandan government is proposing a modified version of
gacaca to settle one of the most contentious issues left from the
mass killings of 500,000 or more Tutsi in 1994: how to judge the
125,000 people, almost all Hutu, still in jail and charged in the
massacres and other crimes of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, under which local communities would judge suspects
outside the justice system, is still amorphous. But it has raised
strong feelings in Rwanda, where the wounds from 1994 are still
fresh and relations between the two ethnic groups are far from
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, a town meeting in Kigali was devoted to gacaca
(pronounced ga-CHA-cha), and it went on for three and a half hours.
People watching on television and listening to radio called from
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic bishops recently expressed their concern about
gacaca to the prime minister, worrying that it ``might become an
instrument of injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the proposal's strongest supporters are urging caution
because the approach does not rely on impartial panels to judge but
on people from the very communities where the crimes took place.
Many Hutu worry that the tribunals will devolve into a witch hunt.
And many Tutsi worry that suspects may get off easy in communities
that are predominantly Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of ethnic tension which is persistent in the
population,'' said Aloys Habimana, director of the Rwandan League
for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. ``And as far as they
are unable to overcome this, it will be difficult for them to be
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Habimana stands firmly behind the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that they will be 100 percent fair,'' he said.
``But in the situation where we are, we will have to accept certain
risks. Even the trials we have now, can you say they are 100
percent fair?''
</P>
<P>
   What prompted the government to make the proposal was that the
justice system has proved unable to judge so many people.
</P>
<P>
   The number of suspects jailed on charges connected to the
killings has slipped to just under 125,000, from 130,000 several
years ago. In the last two years only 1,274 people have been tried,
Habimana said. At that rate, as Rwandans are fond of pointing out,
it could take a hundred years to complete the trials.
</P>
<P>
   And last year alone, 2,500 suspects died in the 19 prisons,
largely of AIDS, tuberculosis or typhoid, according to Penal Reform
International, which runs programs here.
</P>
<P>
   Many prisoners think gacaca is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we go to the place we are born, people can say, this man
has done nothing,'' said Azalyas Rukizangabo, 54, who is accused of
killing two women and has been in jail for three years.
</P>
<P>
   But in Nyarubuye district, a police prosecutor, Abbey Alphonse
Mazi-mpa-ka, said the massacres were too serious to be settled by
gacaca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gacaca is the reconciliation between the victim and the
criminal,'' he said. ``After negotiating, you reconcile. But how
can a person negotiate with someone who did these acts of bloodshed
and sexual torture? It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The justice minister, Jean de Dieu Mucyo, said gacaca is aimed
not only at clearing the prisons but also at speeding
reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. It would not begin until
next year at the earliest, and the government is first planning a
test run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the truth coming out, everyone is holding feelings
inside and it's really oppressive to the heart,'' Mucyo said. ``But
if the truth can come out, everyone can know what happened: `This
one killed my brother,' or `My son is in jail for this reason.'
</P>
<P>
   ``With the truth coming out, everyone will be relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed model for gacaca is much like Rwandan society
itself: highly organized and hierarchical. The charges would be
broken down into four categories. Hearings would take place on four
administrative levels, depending on the seriousness of the crime,
with judges elected from each community.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious accusations _ murder, planning murder, rape _
will remain in the justice system. The death penalty applies only
to such serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mucyo said that anyone in the community would be allowed to
present evidence, and that defendants would be allowed to mount a
defense, all without trained judges or lawyers. A majority of the
judges on the panel would then decide guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics worry that without lawyers, the accused will be
unable to represent themselves adequately. Others say gacaca has
been a way for communities to solve their own problems, usually
minor ones, and they question how that applies in a society where
so many people are new to Rwanda. Some 800,000 Tutsi exiled for a
generation in neighboring countries have returned since the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities have been destroyed and families have been
destroyed,'' said Michele Wagner, professor of African History at
Indiana University of Pennsylvania, who studied gacaca as a United
Nations worker several years ago. ``And the strength of the
community is at the core of what gacaca is.''
</P>
<P>
   But its supporters say there are few good options.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give it the benefit of the doubt,'' said Klaas De
Jonge, coordinator for Penal Reform International in Rwanda. ``They
have to resolve it. It is necessary for reconciliation between the
two groups. It is necessary for the economy. I think they will come
up with something reasonable.''

 &HT;    Elder-Beerman exceeds earnings expectations
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. topped analysts
estimates by 2 cents a share in fiscal 1998 by reporting year-end
earnings per share of $1.76, including special charges.
</P>
<P>
   Net income totaled $25.5 million compared with a net loss of $29
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding several one-time charges, the Moraine-based retailer
reported net profit per share of 95 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus estimate of three analysts was that the chain
would earn 93 cents a share, excluding unusual charges, according
to First Call Corp., a Boston-based analyst monitoring service.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, the chain, with 60
department stores across eight states, earned $1.51 per share
including special items. Without those items, the company earned 66
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimated the company would earn 64 cents in the fourth
quarter, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter, including special items, was $23.8
million. In the fourth quarter a year ago, the company posted a net
loss of $16.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time adjustments to income include costs to assimilate
the Stone &AMP; Thomas stores; a gain on sale of real estate, and a
favorable settlement of bankruptcy-related items.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick J. Mershad, chairman and chief executive, said 1998
was a record year for operating performance. ``I am proud of what
we have achieved on both a financial and operational basis,
particularly in light of our recent history. Since emerging from
bankruptcy on Dec. 30, 1997, we have been entirely focused on
growing and developing the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mershad predicted a 2 percent to 3 percent gain in sales from
stores open a year or more this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three stores in the works are in Warsaw, Ind., Frankfort, Ky.,
and an unnamed location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus this year will be on flawless execution of our
business strategies throughout our organization, merchandise
planning enhancements and development of new design and customer
service concepts for our new stores,'' Mershad said. ``We are very
excited about developing these new store concepts. Although this
means our new stores will not open until late third or early fourth
quarters, we expect to learn much in these stores that we will be
able to implement over time in our existing stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Elder-Beerman shares (NASDAQ: EBSC) closed Tuesday at 9, up .
The 52-week trading range is 7-29.

SEND IN THE SWANS: AT 50, CITY BALLET EMBRACES A CLASSIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Balanchine once told Peter Martins: ``You know, dear, we
should call all ballets `Swan Lake.' People will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Martins certainly hopes people will come to the complete ``Swan
Lake'' he is staging for the New York City Ballet. It opens the
company's spring, 50th-anniversary season at the New York State
Theater on Thursday night and will be performed through May 9.
</P>
<P>
   But during a recent interview at the State Theater, Martins
revealed that the popularity of Tchaikovsky's classic is not his
sole reason for producing it.
</P>
<P>
   Martins admires the ballet's passionate score and its story of
how Prince Siegfried becomes enamored of Odette, a beautiful
princess transformed by Rothbart, a sorcerer, into the queen of the
swans. She can permanently regain human form only if a lover stays
true to her.
</P>
<P>
   But when Odile, Rothbart's daughter, disguises herself as
Odette, the deceived Siegfried pledges himself to her instead.
Odette and Odile are usually danced by the same ballerina, the dual
role displaying her dramatic and technical powers.
</P>
<P>
   Martins, the City Ballet's ballet master in chief, first staged
``Swan Lake'' in 1996 for the Royal Danish Ballet, with which he
danced before coming to New York in 1969. The invitation from the
Danish company to create a full-evening ballet initially befuddled
Martins, who specializes in short works and had no large-scale
plans. Then, after realizing that the Danes had not performed
``Swan Lake'' for many years, he fell under the ballet's spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``His `Swan Lake' was a success,'' said Erik Aschengreen, the
dance critic for the Copenhagen newspaper Berlingske Tidende, in a
telephone conversation. ``It challenged the dancers, and energized
them, too.'' But Aschengreen indicated that its nonrealistic
scenery had surprised audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Copenhagen and New York productions are designed by Per
Kirkeby, a Danish painter. ``His `Swan Lake' is unlike any other,''
Martins said. ``Some people may see it and wonder, `Where's the
lake?' But others will marvel: `Look at the lake! Isn't it
divine?'''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long loved to look at ``Swan Lake.'' The San
Francisco Ballet staged the first complete production in the United
States back in 1940. American Ballet Theater and the various
touring Ballets Russes troupes regularly performed the second act
from the 30s through the early 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1951, the New York City Ballet has danced a one-act
version by Balanchine. Martins said that although he had been
inspired by Balanchine, he was not directly borrowing from that
staging. With ``Swan Lake,'' City Ballet now has productions of all
three of Tchaikovsky's ballets in its repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, ``Swan Lake'' is an ugly duckling. Tchaikovsky's
first ballet , it was the last to achieve success. Staged by a
minor choreographer named Julius (also occasionally known as
Wenzel) Reisinger, it received its premiere by the Bolshoi Ballet
in Moscow in 1877, and made little impact there.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, two major St. Petersburg choreographers for the
Maryinsky Ballet collaborated fruitfully with Tchaikovsky: Marius
Petipa, who created ``The Sleeping Beauty'' in 1890, and Lev
Ivanov, whose ``Nutcracker'' of 1892 followed the specifications of
Petipa, who had fallen ill.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about ``Swan Lake,'' Petipa examined the score and liked
it. Yet Tchaikovsky died in 1893 before they could plan a
production. The next year, Ivanov aroused interest in the music by
choreographing the second act for a memorial program.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1895, the Maryinsky offered a complete ``Swan Lake''
with the first and third acts (the palace scenes) by Petipa and the
second and fourth (the lakeside scenes) by Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   This production is the foundation for any complete ``Swan Lake''
that can be considered traditional, including the one by London's
Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet that astonished New York in 1949,
and American Ballet Theater's British-based version of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ``Swan Lake'' has been subjected to much
tinkering (and, some might say, vandalism). The results have ranged
from what could be called ``Petipa-Ivanov respectfully revised'' to
such determinedly idiosyncratic efforts as John Neumeier's for the
Hamburg Ballet, which makes ``Swan Lake'' a demented vision of
Ludwig, the mentally unstable 19th-century king of Bavaria, and
Matthew Bourne's modern-dress reinterpretation with male swans,
recently seen on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Martins says his ``Swan Lake'' is basically his own
choreography, as influenced by Petipa, Ivanov and Balanchine. To
intensify its dramatic momentum, he will break the four-act work
with only one intermission.

IT'S A VERY OLD BALKAN STORY
</HEADLINE>

   Recently reading  &UR; Leo Tolstoy &LR; 's ``Anna Karenina,'' which was
published in 1878,  &UR; David Elliott  &LR; discovered some passages
relevant to today's headlines. After Anna Karenina committed
suicide (if you haven't read it, sorry to give that away), her
lover, Count Vronsky, volunteered to go to the Balkans to help the
Serbs, who were fighting the Turks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was talked of or written about just now but the
Serbian War ...'' wrote Tolstoy. It ``had become one of those
fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing
society with an object and an occupation. ... A great many people
were taking up the subject from motives of self-interest and
self-advertisement. ... The newspapers published a great deal that
was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting
attention and outcrying one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The massacre of Slavs who were fellow Christians, and Slav
brethren, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation
against the oppressors. And the heroism of the Serbians and
Montenegrins, struggling for a great cause, begot in the whole
(Russian) people a longing to help their brothers not in word but

 UNDATED: one intermission.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any producer of ``Swan Lake'' has to decide what it's all about.
``There's a moral tale there,'' Martins said. ``Life provides you
with choices, and you must make them, right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only moral ``Swan Lake'' can have. Here, for
instance, are the ideas behind another new ``Swan Lake,'' presented
earlier this month by the Tulsa Ballet: ``Its themes are impossible
love and the realization that both good and evil are inside us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those notions were advanced during a telephone interview with
Marcello Angelini, the Italian dancer who since 1995 has directed
the enterprising Oklahoma company founded in 1956 by Roman Jasinski
and Moscelyne Larkin, two veterans of the Ballets Russes.
</P>
<P>
   Act by act, producers must make important decisions. Thus,
should the first-act party include a Jester? This character,
unknown to Petipa and Ivanov, was invented by Aleksandr Gorsky for
a Moscow version of 1920. Enormously popular in Russia, the Jester
has capered his way into many later productions there.
</P>
<P>
   But American producers usually consider him superfluous.
Angelini pronounced him ``a nuisance.'' Martins, in contrast, finds
him appealing. Therefore City Ballet will have a Jester.
</P>
<P>
   Although modifications have been made in its adagio for Odette
and Siegfried, Ivanov's intricately patterned second act has been
left relatively unaltered over the years. Nevertheless, producers
have to decide what Rothbart symbolizes here. For Martins, he is
simply a wicked sorcerer. ``This is a `Swan Lake' without fancy
psychological twists or metaphors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other interpretations have been psychologically kinky. Take Erik
Bruhn's 1967 staging for the National Ballet of Canada: it made
Rothbart a woman, a Black Queen who, in murky Freudian symbolism,
served as a sinister counterpart to Siegfried's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The male Rothbart in Tulsa is an alter ego of Siegfried himself.
Angelini explained, ``Siegfried and Rothbart symbolize aspects of
the same personality, Siegfried representing the rational mind,
Rothbart representing the unconscious. And the unruly dark impulses
of the unconscious make it impossible for Odette and Siegfried to
remain together.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Martins and Angelini have Odile bewitch Siegfried in the
third act Black Swan pas de deux, in which she does 32 whipping
turns known as fouettes. At least, for Martins, she can do so if
she wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of the fouette as a step,'' he confessed, adding
``I don't really like 32 of anything.'' In Copenhagen, Martins
permitted his ballerinas to perform the fouettes if they chose; if
they declined, he invented other steps for them. He will continue
that policy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' can end in many ways. In the Ivanov version, which
Ballet Theater retains, the remorseful Siegfried rejoins Odette and
they throw themselves into the lake. Their self-sacrifice defeats
Rothbart and unites them in the afterworld.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia during the Soviet era, when supernatural themes
were suspect, Siegfried would vanquish Rothbart in a struggle; the
lovers then lived happily ever after on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Angelini conceived a happy ending of another kind. In his
confrontation between Siegfried and Rothbart, the two forces _ the
rational and the irrational _ are gradually reconciled, the ensuing
harmony causing Odette and the other swans to be human again.
Impossible love is impossible no more.
</P>
<P>
   Aschengreen called Martins' unhappy Copenhagen finale extremely
eloquent. But when asked what he plans for New York, Martin just
smiled enigmatically and said; ``If I told you how my ballet ended,
you might not go to see it. So come and find out.''

BIPARTISAN SUPPORT DEVELOPS FOR CLINTON WAR EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress struggling for consensus on future US
policy in the Balkans, a bipartisan group of senators said Tuesday
President Clinton should have available ``all necessary force'' to
defeat Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ including the use of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO must prevail in Kosovo,'' said Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat. ``Power-hungry maniacs
everywhere in the world are watching our actions in the Balkans and
gauging our resolve. They must receive an unequivocal message.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, sponsored by three Democrats and three
Republicans, does not specifically call for sending ground troops
into Kosovo. But backers said it would give Clinton the legal power
to use them if he concluded they were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can pretend to half fight a war, or to be
involved in this kind of conflict with this kind of thug and be
less than prepared to overwhelm him,'' said Massachusetts Senator
John F. Kerry, who supports the Senate measure. ``I'm not ready to
say we should send them in, but we sure as hell have to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal, which comes four weeks after NATO bombs
began falling in Yugoslavia, underscores the deep disagreement in
Congress about what form the fighting should take if the air
campaign alone does not vanquish Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott swiftly pronounced the Senate
resolution premature, noting that Clinton has not sought ground
troops and his military advisers have said there are no current
plans for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should be planning for all options, including
ground troops,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Republican.
``But I also believe that the air campaign has not yet been fully
developed.''
</P>
<P>
   And some House members said they are not ready even to consider
committing US troops to battle on the ground in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there's something about the American collective
psyche that wants immediate results,'' said Representative William
Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the House
International Relations Committee. ``This is not fast food. This is
not about instant results. I mean, we've been there 25 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative James McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he
is not willing to advocate something that, so far, the secretary of
defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very reluctant to support the use of ground
troops,'' said McGovern. ``I would urge caution here. This is not a
simple operation. This is very complicated. The geography and the
terrain is such that it would present special problems to our
troops if we would put them into hand-to-hand combat over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Senate resolution, backed by Senator John McCain, an
Arizona Republican and GOP presidential candidate, and senators
from across the political spectrum, helped amplify the argument
that NATO must demonstrate to Milosevic that it is willing to go
beyond bombardment to achieve its objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this resolution would encourage the administration and
our allies to find the courage and resolve to prosecute this war in
the manner most likely to result in its early end,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he still believes the air campaign can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it would be irresponsible not to plan for other
military options that may be necessary to defeat this enemy,''
Lieberman said in a speech on the Senate floor. ``Not only should
all options remain on the table, but all options must be adequately
analyzed and prepared. In the case of ground forces, which will
take weeks to deploy should they be necessary, we should begin now

   As some senators discussed the possibility of ground troops, the
House is preparing to debate two resolutions sponsored by
Representative Tom Campbell, a moderate California Republican, that
would either declare war on Yugoslavia or withdraw US forces.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert said that floor
debate will proceed next month unless ``other members talk Mr.
Campbell out of it'' _ something Democrats say they fully expect to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans don't want this vote because they want this to
be the Clinton-Gore war,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat. ``That's disgraceful. I wouldn't vote for
either of (Campbell's) alternatives, but it is terribly wrong for
Congress to duck this.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate passed separate resolutions last month to
support the NATO campaign, endorse peacekeeping troops, and support
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he
would want a House vote on committing ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has a critical role to play,'' said Meehan. ``This is
an important issue that deserves a full debate.''

IT'S A VERY OLD BALKAN STORY

<P>
   Recently reading  &UR; Leo Tolstoy &LR; 's ``Anna Karenina,'' which was
published in 1878,  &UR; David Elliott  &LR; discovered some passages
relevant to today's headlines. After Anna Karenina committed
suicide (if you haven't read it, sorry to give that away), her
lover, Count Vronsky, volunteered to go to the Balkans to help the
Serbs, who were fighting the Turks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was talked of or written about just now but the
Serbian War ...'' wrote Tolstoy. It ``had become one of those
fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing
society with an object and an occupation. ... A great many people
were taking up the subject from motives of self-interest and
self-advertisement. ... The newspapers published a great deal that
was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting
attention and outcrying one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The massacre of Slavs who were fellow Christians, and Slav
brethren, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation
against the oppressors. And the heroism of the Serbians and
Montenegrins, struggling for a great cause, begot in the whole
(Russian) people a longing to help their brothers not in word but
in deed.''

YUGOSLAV MOVE INTO MONTENEGRO RAISES `CLEANSING' FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROZAJ, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav military has moved into the
northeast, Muslim region of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro,
leading to fears that the ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo could
spill over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Six civilians _ including at least one woman and a 13-year-old
boy _ were killed Sunday night in the area around the Muslim
municipality of Rozaj by Yugoslav Army soldiers or paramilitary
soldiers, Rozaj Mayor Nusret Kalac said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were ethnic Albanians killed by the Yugoslav Army,''
Kalac said. ``The situation is very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian news agency Beta said Yugoslav soldiers killed four
ethnic Albanians in a firefight near Rozaj Sunday night but claimed
the four were members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Yugoslavia sent an estimated 200-300 Yugoslav
soldiers into the demilitarized zone of Prevlaka, between
Montenegro and Croatia. They also closed off the only working
border between the two lands. Montenegrin authorities said the
Yugoslav soldiers demanded that the police give up their posts to
Army control, but the police refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosaj, Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Drgisa Burzan said
he saw ``bullet holes and blood'' in the area, and met two people _
a Kosovar and a Montenegrin villager _ wounded in the
shooting.``There are no discrepancies, in my eyes, of the stories
told by them,'' Burzan said. ``We take this as an extremely serious
matter, and we will launch a full investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, frightened residents of the tiny border
villages of Kaludjerski Laz and Bukelj have fled their homes for
relative safety in Rozaj, Kalac and international observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with reports Tuesday night that the Yugoslav army has
withdrawn from two of the villages, the Kosovar refugees who
trekked for hours or days from Kosovo, hoping to find relative
safety in Montenegro, are terrified that they are again in danger _
this time, with nowhere to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very afraid, men, women and children, that we are
not safe here,'' said 47-year-old Hadzi Balaj, who arrived three
weeks ago from Istok, Kosovo. ``We are afraid they will come here,
and we wouldn't have a chance to go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Razaj has taken 30,000 refugees _ nearly doubling the size of
the town. More than 2,000 are in the Kristal camp alone, warming
their shoes in old, open-front ovens and waiting desperately for a
way to go somewhere safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen of my neighbors were killed'' by Yugoslav soldiers in
Istok, said 42-year-old Ramaj Salija. ``We are afraid the same
thing could happen here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, which, with the larger Serbia, makes up Yugoslavia,
is in a tight, and increasingly tense, position with the federal
government in Belgrade. Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic,
has been sharply critical of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
and men here are dodging the aggressive draft effort by the federal
army.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having been bombed by NATO, Montenegro has sought to
stay out of the war. Many here feel Milosevic is trying to provoke
a civil war in Montenegro, destabilizing the republic and leaving
it vulnerable to a virtual takeover by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin leadership has defiantly held off creeping
control from Belgrade, but the pro-Milosevic forces here are
becoming more aggressive, vocal, and numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Socialist Party leaders _ including representatives of what
Montenegrin authorities term ``illegal'' delegates to the federal
Yugoslav government _ are planning massive anti-NATO rallies in the
next two days.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yugoslav incursion into the demilitarized zone with
Croatia,
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Simonovic, the Croatian ambassador to the United Nations,
made an official protest to the UN Security Council, saying the
soldiers were not allowed in the area. Yugoslavia disputes the
piece of territory, which is under UN monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation at the border is delicate, sensitive, and
extremely tense,'' a UN observer told Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin police were being prohibited Tuesday from entering
the northern, Muslim village of Bukelj to assess the situation
there _ an extremely bold move against the jurisdictional right of
the local authorities over their own territory, Kalac said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Montenegrin police would not charge into the
village, which could lead to a nasty confrontation with Yugoslav
Army soldiers. ``They are trying to provoke us,'' Kalac said. ``We
want to resolve it peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the six dead are still sketchy. Kalac and
international observers say they believe the bodies have been
returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Yugoslav Army was deliberately
targeting refugees and locals in Montenegrin territory, or whether
the deaths were casualties in a Yugoslav effort to cut off the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The two villages are near Kalau Pass, the only road that
connects Montenegro with Kosovo. The Yugoslavs may have been in the
act of cutting off the food, oil and weapons route for the KLA,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The border pass also sits above Rugova Valley in Kosovo, where
KLA members are believed to be stationed.
</P>
<P>
   International observers were reluctant to call the killings and
near-emptying of these villages ``ethnic cleansing,'' noting that
the details of the incident are not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something sparked an incident, and there was some shooting,''
said Rob Breen, an observer for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees office in Podgorica. ``Were they closing
off an exit route? Who knows?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there is a great fear among refugees, as well as people in
this town'' that the Yugoslav Army may start moving against Muslims
_ both Montenegrin and Kosovar _ in Montenegro, said Vehbija Bibic.
Bibic is director of the Kristal refugee camp _ so named for the
non-operating glass factory now used as barracks for refugees.

TRAPPED STUDENTS TURNED TO TV FOR LIFE-SAVING ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you're watching, kids, turn your TV off, or at least
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of authority speaking those words Tuesday was not a
police officer but a local television news anchor in Denver,
addressing students trapped inside classrooms at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., who had apparently tuned in to TV for
information on their own life-and-death crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When masked gunmen opened fire inside a school that had
televisions in each classroom, TV news stations in Denver found
themselves drawn into the middle of the story, which at times lent
a self-consciousness to their coverage. ``We are assuming (the
gunmen) are able to watch all the coverage,'' noted a reporter for
KMGH-TV in the middle of the crisis. An anchor added: ``We would
say: `Give yourselves up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a student unable to escape from the school used a
cell phone to call KUSA-TV in Denver, whereupon he described the
terrifying scene while hiding under a desk in a locked classroom.
The student even started to say where he was before an anchor
stopped him and urged him to call 911. The student did so, but
found the 911 line jammed, and placed another call to the station,
which connected him with the emergency line.
</P>
<P>
   There was dramatic footage aplenty, much of it transmitted
nationally by the major networks, but the shootings also
underscored the role of emotional barometer that television often
plays in times of crisis, reflecting a community's horror and
incredulity. An anchor at KMGH-TV gasped, ``Look at that!'' as a
blood-streaked youth dropped from a second-story window. Her
co-anchor expressed disbelief ``that this could happen in our
area.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the moment, missteps occurred. At one point, the
information was broadcast that one youth was trapped inside the
school's ``choir room,'' a potentially risky step if the gunmen
were watching TV inside the school.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, KUSA initially urged trapped students to call
the station with information for the police on the gunmen's
whereabouts. ``Any students that might be hiding at the school,
call the station,'' said Kim Christiansen, an anchor at KUSA-TV.
``We will put you in touch with the police.''
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, Christiansen retracted those instructions,
saying to students: ``Do not call the station. Be quiet. Stay where
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   News executives at KUSA-TV could not be reached for comment, and
a spokeswoman said she did not know the reason for the retraction.
Cory Shields, a spokesman for MSNBC, which carried the KUSA feed,
said the station altered its instructions to students ``once they
realized it was a security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at KMGH-TV and KCNC-TV, the other Denver stations
that supplied footage to the networks Tuesday, also could not be
reached. NBC, CBS and ABC all interrupted regular programming to
carry the story, but the all-news cable networks _ CNN, MSNBC, Fox
News Channel and New England Cable News _ devoted the most time to
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, televised images illustrated a scene both
shocking and dishearteningly familiar: the stricken faces of
students and parents, the cluster of paramedics and SWAT teams, the
chaotic aftermath of yet another shooting inside a school.
</P>
<P>
   There were heart-rending interviews with students such as the
girl who told how she begged for her life while the gunmen waved a
gun in her face and laughed. ``Everybody near me got shot,'' she
sobbed. A teenage boy told of seeing ``a friend of mine's head
blown off.''
</P>
<P>
   The trauma was evident on the faces of those who escaped. One
student, a freshman, worriedly told reporters that ``one of my best
friends, Ashley, is in there.'' A teenage boy said bitterly that
the shooters were known beforehand as ``the scum of the school.''
Another youth reported that ``it was another casual day'' in the
moments before bullets began ``ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters struggled with their emotions in reporting the
story; others were plainly stunned. ``This is a very tense
situation out here,'' one said. ``It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   TV news cameras captured some striking sights: dozens of
students fleeing the school under the protection of a SWAT team;
three friends of the shooting suspects being ordered to lie
face-down in a field by police officers; helicopter shots of a
once-tranquil school transformed into a battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a role that often falls to local TV stations when
tragedy strikes, the Denver stations served as information
clearinghouses. They posted hotline numbers for parents to call and
reminded them to stay away from the cordoned-off school area with
the chilling words, ``Your child is in lockdown. Do not go to pick
him or her up.'' They directed students to an address for ``crisis
counseling'' near the school. And some anchors even admonished
parents who could not be reached by their children, exhorting them
to supply their offspring with a number where they could be
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed expressed an ``it-can't-happen-here''
shock at the shootings, but one man said sadly: ``We've got a great
neighborhood, but this stuff happens everyplace.''

   WASHINGTON _ With Congress struggling for consensus on future US
policy in the Balkans, a bipartisan group of senators said Tuesday
President Clinton should have available ``all necessary force'' to
defeat Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ including the use of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO must prevail in Kosovo,'' said Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat. ``Power-hungry maniacs
everywhere in the world are watching our actions in the Balkans and
gauging our resolve. They must receive an unequivocal message.''

Republicans, does not specifically call for sending ground troops
into Kosovo. But backers said it would give Clinton the legal power
to use them if he concluded they were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can pretend to half fight a war, or to be
involved in this kind of conflict with this kind of thug and be
less than prepared to overwhelm him,'' said Massachusetts Senator
John F. Kerry, who supports the Senate measure. ``I'm not ready to
say we should send them in, but we sure as hell have to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal, which comes four weeks after NATO bombs
began falling in Yugoslavia, underscores the deep disagreement in
Congress about what form the fighting should take if the air
campaign alone does not vanquish Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott swiftly pronounced the Senate
resolution premature, noting that Clinton has not sought ground
troops and his military advisers have said there are no current
plans for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should be planning for all options, including
ground troops,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Republican.
``But I also believe that the air campaign has not yet been fully
developed.''
</P>
<P>
   And some House members said they are not ready even to consider
committing US troops to battle on the ground in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there's something about the American collective
psyche that wants immediate results,'' said Representative William
Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the House
International Relations Committee. ``This is not fast food. This is
not about instant results. I mean, we've been there 25 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative James McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he
is not willing to advocate something that, so far, the secretary of
defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very reluctant to support the use of ground
troops,'' said McGovern. ``I would urge caution here. This is not a
simple operation. This is very complicated. The geography and the
terrain is such that it would present special problems to our
troops if we would put them into hand-to-hand combat over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Senate resolution, backed by Senator John McCain, an
Arizona Republican and GOP presidential candidate, and senators
from across the political spectrum, helped amplify the argument
that NATO must demonstrate to Milosevic that it is willing to go
beyond bombardment to achieve its objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this resolution would encourage the administration and
our allies to find the courage and resolve to prosecute this war in
the manner most likely to result in its early end,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he still believes the air campaign can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it would be irresponsible not to plan for other
military options that may be necessary to defeat this enemy,''
Lieberman said in a speech on the Senate floor. ``Not only should
all options remain on the table, but all options must be adequately
analyzed and prepared. In the case of ground forces, which will
take weeks to deploy should they be necessary, we should begin now
to plan for the logistics of such a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   As some senators discussed the possibility of ground troops, the
House is preparing to debate two resolutions sponsored by
Representative Tom Campbell, a moderate California Republican, that
would either declare war on Yugoslavia or withdraw US forces.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert said that floor
debate will proceed next month unless ``other members talk Mr.
Campbell out of it'' _ something Democrats say they fully expect to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans don't want this vote because they want this to
be the Clinton-Gore war,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat. ``That's disgraceful. I wouldn't vote for
either of (Campbell's) alternatives, but it is terribly wrong for
Congress to duck this.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate passed separate resolutions last month to
support the NATO campaign, endorse peacekeeping troops, and support
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he
would want a House vote on committing ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has a critical role to play,'' said Meehan. ``This is
an important issue that deserves a full debate.''

<P>
   COJIMAR, Cuba _ Gregorio Fuentes is 101 years old, but he still
welcomes paying visitors to his small living room here to regale
them with stories about Ernest Hemingway from a rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years Fuentes was the captain of Hemingway's
fishing boat, Pilar, which was anchored at times in this fishing
town on the outskirts of Havana. He claims to have inspired ``The
Old Man and the Sea,'' the 1952 novella about an old Cuban
fisherman from Cojimar who catches a giant fish and then has to
battle sharks for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuentes has not bothered to read this or any of his friend's
other books.
</P>
<P>
   ``What for?'' he said in a bellicose tone. ``I've lived them
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes is a fixture on a Cuban tourist trail dedicated to
Hemingway, an American whom Cuba flaunts as a national treasure
despite four decades of hostility between Fidel Castro's government
and the United States. This year, the centennial of Hemingway's
birth, commemorations in Cuba include an international colloquium
of Hemingway historians and ballet and symphony galas.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, who lived, wrote, drank and fished in this island
intermittently between 1932 and 1960, is hard to miss in Cuba. His
books sell in government curio shops alongside left-wing works by
Che Guevara. His likeness adorns T-shirts and billboards, and a
bronze bust of him donated by local fishermen looks out to the sea
from a small rotunda here. And his name is attached to landmarks
like parks and marinas, to fishing tournaments and to sugar-free
daiquiris.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the writer has been thoroughly exploited for tourism in
places like Key West, Fla., which drew criticism from the writer's
three sons a couple of years ago for tarnishing Hemingway's image
with too much banality, cash-starved Cuba has not let Communism
stand in the way of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of Hemingway sites, including the lush estate outside
Havana where the writer lived with Martha Gellhorn and Mary Welsh,
his third and fourth wives, cost anywhere from $15 to $40 a person.
A ``Papa Hemingway'' daiquiri (lime and grapefruit juice,
maraschino and a double shot of white rum) at his old drinking
haunts like El Floridita in Old Havana costs $6.
</P>
<P>
   And Fuentes' 45-year-old grandson, Rafael Valdes, charges
visitors $50 for 15 minutes of the captain's time, although
haggling can cut the price by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American visitors and some Hemingway family members note
a special reverence for the man in enemy territory, a personal
appropriation by Cubans of a great writer who chose to celebrate
their country in his prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there, it's like he's more of a real person,'' said Mina
Hemingway, 38, a granddaughter of the writer who lives in Florida
and has twice won the women's division of the Ernest Hemingway
fishing tournament held at Marina Hemingway in Havana. ``They seem
to have a real respect, almost awe, for him and his work.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual. In his book ``Hemingway in Cuba'' (Lyle
Stuart, 1984), the exiled Cuban writer Norberto Fuentes, no
relation to the captain, said Cuba first lured Hemingway _ who used
the island as backdrop for ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' ``To Have
and Have Not'' and ``Islands in the Stream'' _ with its abundant
marlin fishing, its beautiful scenery and its low cost of living.
But in the end, Fuentes said, ``Cuba won him completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he settled, lived, worked, made friends, enjoyed life
and transformed his surroundings into art,'' Fuentes wrote. ``What
more could a writer demand from his abode?''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cold War, and the United States' break with Cuba after
the 1959 revolution, interfered in this love affair, ``it was a
great tragedy for our family,'' Patrick Hemingway, 70, one of the
author's sons, said from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any American living in Cuba had to choose,'' he said, adding
that not being able to return to Cuba contributed to his father's
depression, which ended with his suicide in 1961. ``He really loved
Cuba, and I think it was a great shock to him at his age to have to
choose between his country, which was the United States, and his
home, which was Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of Hemingway's life on the island, where the Roman
Catholic Church keeps the Nobel Prize medal he won for literature
in 1954 and dedicated to Cuba's patron saint, Our Lady of Charity
of Cobre, is documented in black and white photographs that hang
from walls in his house and bar-restaurants he frequented like El
Floridita in Old Havana and La Terraza in Cojimar.
</P>
<P>
   Some pictures show him handing out fishing tournament trophies
to a young Fidel Castro in 1960, the only time the two met.
Although Castro has called Hemingway his favorite author, the
extent of the writer's support for the revolution has been the
subject of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures also show Hemingway carousing with the likes of Errol
Flynn and Gary Cooper. But it was his lack of pretension,
notwithstanding his fame, that makes the writer stand out for many
Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very simple,'' said Evelio Gonzalez, a tour guide at
the house on a hill Hemingway bought in 1940 known as Finca Vigia.
``His friends were fishermen. He never related to high society.''
</P>
<P>
   At the house, now a museum preserving the home just as the
writer left it (visitors can only peek from the windows), other
passions are in evidence _ bullfighting artwork, including a plate
with a drawing of a bull's head by Picasso; hunting trophies from
safaris in Africa; more than 8,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the fishing yacht Pilar, donated to the museum by
Fuentes, to whom the writer bequeathed it, sits in a special shed.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, a Spaniard who moved to Cuba as a child, said he met
Hemingway in 1928 in Dry Tortugas off Florida after both were
caught in a storm. In 1934, after Hemingway had visited Cuba
several times, Fuentes said, ``he told me I'm building a boat and I
want you to work with me and be the captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, the ``Antonio'' in ``Islands in the Stream,'' was both
skipper and cook, becoming a constant companion who took part even
in Hemingway's missions on the Pilar hunting German submarines off
the coast of Cuba during World War II. He remembers the author as
``a man apart,'' worldly and capable of immense generosity and
valor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what kind of man he was that, when we were in Africa,
he ordered us to hush and not move because he could smell the lion
that was coming to eat him up,'' Fuentes recalled recently. ``The
lion came and scratched him and he stuck his gun into its mouth and
killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere he went people treated him like a god just arrived
from heaven,'' he added. ``I myself considered him a god because he
did things I never saw anybody else do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it was Fuentes' own exploits that were immortalized in ``The
Old Man and the Sea,'' he said, specifically his experience as a
young man catching a big fish and fighting sharks all night long to
keep them from eating it. The ``Santiago'' in the novella, however,
was partly modeled after another Cuban fisherman, Anselmo
Hernandez, said Fuentes, the Cuban author.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his friend's death, the captain said, he has not
worked as skipper for anyone else. Nor has he ever thought of
writing his own book about his years with Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of secrets,'' he said, vowing never to reveal a
single one for all the money in the world.

BANKBOSTON'S JACKSON SAYS HE'LL DEPART AFTER FLEET MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After more than a decade spent reshaping BankBoston
Corp.'s public image from a Brahmin institution indifferent to the
community to a bank committed to inner-city areas and local
projects, Ira A. Jackson is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, for 12 years the face of BankBoston before activists,
charities and lawmakers, has not been offered a position at the new
company to be formed from his bank's merger with its rival, Fleet
Financial Group Inc., BankBoston said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 50, is the second major BankBoston executive who will
not join the combined company. Chief financial officer Susannah
Swihart, as previously announced, will step down after the merger
to head a foundation for the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Not a significant figure with Wall Street, but a powerful, if
controversial, lobbyist and spokesman in the company's hometown,
Jackson said he knew when he first learned of the merger in March
that he would not have a place at the new bank, which will be led
by Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibilities I have must report directly to the chief
executive and it must be honest, symbiotic, and driven by chemistry
and magic,'' Jackson said. ``That's not something you can easily
transfer to another individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has built a close relationship with Jackson's counterpart
at Fleet, Anne Finucane. Like Jackson, Finucane handles media
relations, philanthropy, sponsorships, regulatory affairs, and
community investments, as well as advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The functions that report to Ira will be reporting to Anne
Finucane, who also retains her responsibilities for marketing,
advertising, and marketing research after the merger is
completed,'' Fleet spokesman James Mahoney said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's planned departure is an early sign of changing
chemistry and culture at Fleet and BankBoston, as the two different
companies chart out how they will meld into the nation's
eighth-largest bank. Merger analysts say that setting up a
communications and public relations staff is a crucial decision
that can help shape a company's success in putting together a new
organization and crafting a new public image.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Jackson, 215-year-old BankBoston is widely viewed as
more sympathetic to community-lending projects, while
entrepreneurial Fleet, a favorite on Wall Street, is seen as a
bottom-line business.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he ``knew instantly'' that he would not be part of
the new bank when BankBoston chief executive Charles K. ``Chad''
Gifford told him in the second week of March to prepare to fly to
New York to hammer out a final agreement that weekend to merge into
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 days after the $15 billion deal was completed, Gifford
and Jackson did not discuss Jackson's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of March, the two men had a 20-minute
conversation in Jackson's 25th-floor office.
</P>
<P>
   True in spirit to BankBoston's patrician roots _ the company is
descended from the nation's oldest bank _ little was said but much
was understood, according to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad is the essence of class and good breeding and good
values,'' he said. ``We both knew what the conversation was going
to be about, and there was quiet understanding that I would be
moving on.'' Jackson, who was hired by Gifford's media-shy
predecessor, Ira Stepanian, has had a stormy relationship with the
more public Gifford, who sometimes chafed at Jackson's prominence.
Gifford will head the combined bank when Murray retires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native who attended Harvard University, Jackson oversaw
a team of 60 staffers that completely revamped BankBoston's image.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the company in 1988 at a time when it was tarnished by a
money-laundering scandal and viewed as arrogantly aloof from
community matters, Jackson later earned plaudits for helping
establish Eagle Corps, a community service unit staffed by
BankBoston volunteers, and City Year, a youth work program. He also
got the bank involved with a host of local organizations, including
the Dimock Community Health Center and The Ten Point Coalition, a
inner-city religious alliance, and won recognition for BankBoston's
community bank group, one of the nation's largest inner-city branch
networks.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when corporations around the country were drawing
increased scrutiny for their community work, Jackson helped
BankBoston win top marks among local activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote the book on corporate social responsibility,'' said
Karen Schwartman, a former BankBoston spokeswoman who worked with
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Jackson _ and there are many _ carp that he promotes
himself as much as the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But a BankBoston statement released Tuesday lavished praise on
the man and his achievements and said Jackson would continue as
chairman _ a largely ceremonial role _ of the company's urban
investment bank, BankBoston Development Corp. Jackson said he had
not yet decided where he will go after leaving when regulators
finalize the merger later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are just now starting to hammer out a new
corporate structure, Fleet and BankBoston have said they will
continue their strong involvement in community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was an administrative assistant to former Boston Mayor
Kevin H. White, an associate dean at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, and head of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue
under Governor Michael S. Dukakis before joining Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   An executive with a six-figure salary, Jackson will leave
BankBoston with a generous severance package that includes millions
of dollars' worth of stock options, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson lobbied tirelessly for his employer before
lawmakers, he said he never pushed for a position at the combined
bank. Sources said there had been no friction with Finucane, his
Fleet counterpart, because Jackson was never in the running for a
job to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became awkward, if not embarrassing, to read about
jockeying and efforts on my behalf,'' Jackson said. ``But the
decision was made a while back. I'm glad it's finally out.''

 &HT;    Student recall moments of horror
 &HT;    By Ted Taylor

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Columbine High School students Tuesday
described a scene of ``absolute fear and panic,'' after two
classmates opened fire during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolute craziness,'' said Daniel Yager, a sophomore at
the Littleton school. ``There was a riot toward the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager said he and friends were just sitting down to lunch when
school officials screamed for the students to get down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 30 seconds, everyone started running for the stairs,''
Yager said. ``At the top, we heard three or four gunshots right
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Tran was also eating lunch when he heard a small rumble
behind him. At first, he said, he thought it was a fight brewing.
</P>
<P>
   After school officials warned students, Tran's first thoughts
were, ``This can't be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, he said, students jumped up and ran for the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   On the stairs, Tran said, he heard more gunshots. ``In about one
second it went from eating lunch to something weird's going on to,
`Oh my God you're about to die. Run,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Students hurried across the street to Leawood Park, Yager said.
There, he said, six more explosions in the school could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said the students believed to be involved in the
shooting were involved in a group called the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Mike Zimmerman said the students were often picked on
for the way they dressed _in all-black, gothic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a group of outcasts basically,'' Zimmerman said.
``They kind of asked to be made fun of and picked on. It seemed
kind of obvious that something could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass shootings at Columbine High School left Denver-area
motorists driving through rush-hour traffic in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Near the school last night, the situation was still unsettled,
with one report that police were searching for parked cars that
might have been booby-trapped with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours after the shootings began, many motorists on streets
leading to the school could be seen crying and talking on cellular
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Leawood Elementary School, which is near Columbine High School,
was serving as a command post for law enforcement. Milling outside
were police, media and law enforcement officials . Many people,
including clergy members, arrived at the scene to offer whatever
assistance they could.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Poos-Benson is the pastor at Columbine United Church. He
said one of the wounded students attends his church. He expressed
the shock that undoubtedly many in this community felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you never think ... it could happen here. The
message here is that it can happen anywhere. The community together
needs to assume responsibility for their children,'' Poos-Benson
said. The neighborhood near the school can be described as upper
middle class suburban with large homes.

REPUBLICANS, SAYING CLINTON'S WEAKENED MILITARY, PLEDGE TO BEEF IT
UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ariz., Idaho, Fla., Miss.)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress, charging that President
Clinton has weakened the nation's military, pledged Tuesday to add
billions of dollars for defense to his emergency request for funds
to finance NATO's airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   They are discussing doubling the president's $6 billion
emergency request and using the money to beef up the national
arsenal. Some even talk of trying to triple the request, but say
they doubt they can win the votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say they will use hearings and debate in coming
days to challenge Clinton's conduct as commander in chief, question
the progress of the war and call for sharp increases in Pentagon
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
Clinton had created a national security crisis by misusing the
armed forces, and suggested that Republicans might scale back plans
for a huge tax cut, or cut domestic programs, to help pay for
missiles, munitions and other military needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton bled defense,'' Armey said. He and fellow Republicans
said Clinton had worn down the American military by repeatedly
using it for operations other than war, and that he had depleted
the nation's arsenal by using cruise missiles as a tool of armed
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The president has presided over ``six years of neglect'' of the
military, ``a failed intelligence system'' and ``failed foreign
policy initiatives,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   His harsh words were a preview of the coming debate over the
Kosovo conflict as Congress weighs the emergency request this week
and next.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of that debate widened Tuesday when Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination and
a former Navy aviator, offered a joint resolution authorizing
Clinton ``to use all necessary force'' to accomplish NATO's
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped his measure would ``encourage the
administration and our allies to find the courage and resolve to
prosecute this war'' in a way likely to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress think the administration has been less
than forthcoming about its plans and aims in the conflict. Now, a
growing frustration with the progress of the bombing, fed by a
perception that the need to achieve consensus among NATO's members
is hobbling the military, is stoking anger at the president,
several senators and congressmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee, said that ``what Dick Armey was expressing has
been expressed to me'' in caucuses and corridors of the Senate _
that Clinton's conduct of foreign policy has been ``depleting the
military,'' and that ``the military needed more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, whose defense subcommittee will begin to consider the
president's emergency request on Wednesday, said he could not allow
his fellow Republicans to run away with the spending bill. But
Young said the United States had been ``excessively deploying our
troops'' and ``wearing out our equipment'' under Clinton. ``We have
a lot of catching up to do'' in national defense, he said, adding
that ``the wish list'' for weaponry is long.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did not agree Tuesday how much to add to the
president's request, said Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate
majority leader. Nor are they likely to agree this week. Senior
Republicans in the Senate and the House, including Craig and Young,
said suggestions from fellow members that the emergency request
should be $15 billion, $18 billion or more were unlikely to pass
Congress. House staff members said they have heard Republican
proposals as high as $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They also have not decided what the money should buy, or where
it will come from. Many would rather dip into surplus Social
Security funds for a one-time emergency than scale back their plans
for an $800 billion tax cut over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's emergency request seeks $6.05 billion. About $5.46
billion would go to the Pentagon. Of that, $3.3 billion is for
military operations, $850 million for military contingency funds,
$698 million for bombs and missiles, $335 million for multilateral
refugee resettlement efforts and $274 million to pay for military
operations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Additional funds include $386 million for food, shelter and
water for refugees, to be meted out by the State Department and the
Agency for International Development; $150 million to help the
nations to which Kosovo Albanians have fled, and $55 million for
diplomatic operations _ like evacuating the American Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon already takes more than half of the money Congress
spends, excluding mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare
and interest on the national debt. Congress has vowed to keep
spending down and to keep its hands off extra Social Security
funds. Additional new funds for the Pentagon in coming years may
require breaking those promises or cutting popular programs,
congressional staff members said.

TRAPPED STUDENTS TURNED TO TV FOR LIFE-SAVING ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you're watching, kids, turn your TV off, or at least
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of authority speaking those words Tuesday was not a
police officer but a local television news anchor in Denver,
addressing students trapped inside classrooms at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., who had apparently tuned in to TV for
information on their own life-and-death crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When masked gunmen opened fire inside a school that had
televisions in each classroom, TV news stations in Denver found
themselves drawn into the middle of the story, which at times lent
a self-consciousness to their coverage. ``We are assuming (the
gunmen) are able to watch all the coverage,'' noted a reporter for
KMGH-TV in the middle of the crisis. An anchor added: ``We would
say: `Give yourselves up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a student unable to escape from the school used a
cell phone to call KUSA-TV in Denver, whereupon he described the
terrifying scene while hiding under a desk in a locked classroom.
The student even started to say where he was before an anchor
stopped him and urged him to call 911. The student did so, but
found the 911 line jammed, and placed another call to the station,
which connected him with the emergency line.
</P>
<P>
   There was dramatic footage aplenty, much of it transmitted
nationally by the major networks, but the shootings also
underscored the role of emotional barometer that television often
plays in times of crisis, reflecting a community's horror and
incredulity. An anchor at KMGH-TV gasped, ``Look at that!'' as a
blood-streaked youth dropped from a second-story window. Her
co-anchor expressed disbelief ``that this could happen in our
area.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the moment, missteps occurred. At one point, the
information was broadcast that one youth was trapped inside the
school's ``choir room,'' a potentially risky step if the gunmen
were watching TV inside the school.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, KUSA initially urged trapped students to call
the station with information for the police on the gunmen's
whereabouts. ``Any students that might be hiding at the school,
call the station,'' said Kim Christiansen, an anchor at KUSA-TV.
``We will put you in touch with the police.''
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, Christiansen retracted those instructions,
saying to students: ``Do not call the station. Be quiet. Stay where
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   News executives at KUSA-TV could not be reached for comment, and
a spokeswoman said she did not know the reason for the retraction.
Cory Shields, a spokesman for MSNBC, which carried the KUSA feed,
said the station altered its instructions to students ``once they
realized it was a security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at KMGH-TV and KCNC-TV, the other Denver stations
that supplied footage to the networks Tuesday, also could not be
reached. NBC, CBS and ABC all interrupted regular programming to
carry the story, but the all-news cable networks _ CNN, MSNBC, Fox
News Channel and New England Cable News _ devoted the most time to
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, televised images illustrated a scene both
shocking and dishearteningly familiar: the stricken faces of
students and parents, the cluster of paramedics and SWAT teams, the
chaotic aftermath of yet another shooting inside a school.
</P>
<P>
   There were heart-rending interviews with students such as the
girl who told how she begged for her life while the gunmen waved a
gun in her face and laughed. ``Everybody near me got shot,'' she
sobbed. A teenage boy told of seeing ``a friend of mine's head
blown off.''
</P>
<P>
   The trauma was evident on the faces of those who escaped. One
student, a freshman, worriedly told reporters that ``one of my best
friends, Ashley, is in there.'' A teenage boy said bitterly that
the shooters were known beforehand as ``the scum of the school.''
Another youth reported that ``it was another casual day'' in the
moments before bullets began ``ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters struggled with their emotions in reporting the
story; others were plainly stunned. ``This is a very tense
situation out here,'' one said. ``It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   TV news cameras captured some striking sights: dozens of
students fleeing the school under the protection of a SWAT team;
three friends of the shooting suspects being ordered to lie
face-down in a field by police officers; helicopter shots of a
once-tranquil school transformed into a battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a role that often falls to local TV stations when
tragedy strikes, the Denver stations served as information
clearinghouses. They posted hotline numbers for parents to call and
reminded them to stay away from the cordoned-off school area with
the chilling words, ``Your child is in lockdown. Do not go to pick
him or her up.'' They directed students to an address for ``crisis
counseling'' near the school. And some anchors even admonished
parents who could not be reached by their children, exhorting them
to supply their offspring with a number where they could be
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed expressed an ``it-can't-happen-here''
shock at the shootings, but one man said sadly: ``We've got a great
neighborhood, but this stuff happens everyplace.''

`SPERMINATOR BILL' BEGINS JOURNEY IN TEXAS HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With more than 3,800 Texas House bills on file
already, there's no huge clamor for more. But one member won
overwhelming approval to submit a bill well past the filing
deadline, perhaps because of its unusual nature.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed by one colleague as the ``sperminator bill,'' House Bill
3830 by Rep. Brian McCall, R-Plano, relates to ``certain
post-mortem procedures.'' It would bar harvesting a dead man's
sperm for reproductive purposes unless he gave permission while
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires that the sperm donor give written
permission before his death and that any such request come from his
spouse.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's late bill would take effect Sept. 1, if it clears the
many procedural hurdles that await. He said he's not addressing any
particular incident but is trying to keep pace with biotechnology
and to prevent possible abuses.

 &HT;    CBS to air investigation of mental health facilities
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CBS News tonight plans to report a yearlong
investigation of Alpharetta, Ga.-based Charter Behavioral Health
Systems, alleging dangerous conditions, falsification of medical
records, and lack of employee training in company psychiatric
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations _ including injuries and two patient deaths _
are part of an hourlong ``60 Minutes II'' program, reported by Ed
Bradley, to be aired tonight at 9. Charter late Tuesday filed a
motion for a temporary restraining order in Federal District Court
in Charlotte to keep the program from being aired, according to
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said it will oppose the motion. A hearing has been scheduled
for 1:30 this afternoon, CBS said. Charter officials could not be
reached for comment on the motion.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the CBS program, which focuses on children's care
in Charter hospitals, begins with a death of a 16-year-old North
Carolina youth in a Greensboro, N.C. facility last year. Tristan
Sovern died in what are called ``restraints,'' where a patient's
ankles and wrists are locked into cuffs or straps.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also shows former and current Charter employees describing
inadequate training, lack of physician supervision, and hospital
practices that endangered both staff and patients. CBS said it
interviewed dozens of employees from more than 20 Charter hospitals
in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   Charter executives said Tuesday they had not seen the program.
But they strongly denied CBS's charges of widespread problems.
Charter also said that CBS, in its reporting, may have breached
patient confidentiality laws.
</P>
<P>
   CBS bases much of the segment's reporting on a social worker,
Terrance Johnson, who wore a hidden camera during eight weeks of
employment at a Charter facility in Charlotte. CBS said Johnson was
not hired or paid by the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to great lengths to obscure the identity of any
patient who was shot,'' Bradley said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, a private company, operates 91 psychiatric hospitals in
32 states. Eleven facilities are in Georgia, with six in metro
Atlanta. It's the largest chain of private psychiatric hospitals in
the country, with annual revenues of more than $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral is 50 percent owned by Atlanta-based Magellan
Health Services, which has tried unsuccessfully to sell the
hospitals to Charter's co-owner, Crescent Operating.
</P>
<P>
   None of the employees or reported incidents used on camera
involve the company's Georgia facilities. Charter did not consent
to an on-camera interview by CBS, but instead sent a letter to the
network, saying that ``Charter's mission is to combine compassion
with the highest quality of comprehensive care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley interviews the mother of Tristan Sovern. The 16-year-old
was restrained at the Greensboro hospital, and then, according to
the CBS report, had a towel and then a sheet wrapped around his
mouth. He died of asphyxiation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Michael French, who took over as Charter chief executive and
president in October, said he couldn't comment on the death because
of ongoing legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Through Johnson's camera, CBS also shows an employee altering a
patient record.
</P>
<P>
   Any falsification of records would be grounds for firing,
Charter's French said. The company has a hotline for employees, and
family members to report any problems at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems aren't typical in our institutions,'' French
said. If they occurred, they'd be very isolated or rare, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The industry as a whole has little local or federal oversight,
Bradley reports. He also notes that at least 32 patients have died
while being restrained in facilities other than Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, meanwhile, is considering national standards on the
use of restraints and on seclusion, or being isolated in a
designated room. A series by the Hartford Courant recently
documented that 142 people have died in physical or mechanical
restraints in the past 10 years in psychiatric facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, in fact, recently announced a company-wide initiative
to greatly reduce the restraint and seclusion practice in its
hospitals. The company said it started reviewing these practices
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out as an industry leader,'' said French. He
denied the removal plan was a public relations ploy or an effort to
head off congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Young of the National Mental Health Association said the
problems described in the ``60 Minutes'' report are present _ but
not epidemic _ in psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be hard pressed to say one set of facilities is better
or worse than another,'' Young added.

FINANCIER RAISES LEVEL OF DEBATE OVER SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE
EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A billionaire Wall Street financier who raised $170
million in scholarships to send low-income children to private
schools said on Tuesday that more than a million families had
responded to his offer, or nearly one out of 50 school-children in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The financier, Theodore J. Forstmann, better known for his
leveraged buyouts of companies like Gulfstream Aerospace, Dr Pepper
and General Instruments, said he had turned his business savvy to
helping thousands of children escape failing public schools and go
to private and religious schools. But the response to his offer
surprised even him, he said, and it has added fuel to the debate
over privatization of the nation's education system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scholarships were open to students now enrolled in
either public or private schools, the majority of applicants came
from public schools, indicating a deep level of dissatisfaction
with the education they are getting, Forstmann said. The 40,000
winners, chosen over the last few days by a computerized lottery,
are to be announced on Wednesday at simultaneous ceremonies in New
York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In capturing public attention, Forstmann was armed with fervor
for his cause, his immense wealth, and a well-oiled public
relations machine, which generated public service announcements by
the baseball star Sammy Sosa, the poet Maya Angelou and the rap
artist Will Smith. In February, Forstmann benefited from a dollop
of Oprah Winfrey, who instructed viewers to turn off their vacuum
cleaners while she interviewed him. A Republican, Forstmann
assembled a board decked out with public figures in both parties,
from Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York to Gen. Colin L.
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann said the number of applicants _ 1,237,360, including
nearly one out of three qualified students in New York City;
Newark, N.J.; New Orleans; Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. _ was
even more compelling given that the scholarships will amount to
only $600 to $1,600 a year for four years, not enough to cover the
$2,500 average tuition at parochial schools, and that the winners
will be required to make a matching contribution averaging $1,000 a
year from their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   He called the response ``a cry from the heart.'' Noting that
poor students get a free public education, he added, ``So they're
quite impoverished, they get their product for nothing and they're
lining up around the corner to pay $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said that while giving out scholarships seemed
benign on the surface, they wondered what would happen in four
years, when the current funds run out. Some said Forstmann and his
partner, John Walton, heir to the Walmart discount-chain fortune,
were more likely to shore up financially ailing Catholic schools
and provide opportunities for private education entrepreneurs than
to reform the education system.
</P>
<P>
   Wittingly or not, they said, Forstmann and his associates could
become an important tool in pushing state legislatures across the
country toward the adoption of taxpayer financing of vouchers to
send children to private and religious schools. Forstmann, who is
Catholic, has supported Catholic-school scholarships in the past,
and critics of voucher proposals noted on Tuesday that Walton has
ties to a profit-making corporation, Tesseract Group, that manages
charter and public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly become a stalking horse for vouchers,'' Sandra
Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said on
Tuesday. ``Raising money for private and parochial schools is a
longtime tradition in the U.S. But now you've got people telling
parents over and over again that their kids can do better than what
they do now. It's all over television, it's on Oprah. When you
listen carefully there's something going on about getting kids out
of the public schools, and that's terribly unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the opposition acknowledges that Forstmann has elevated
the debate over whether the public schools are fulfilling their
mission of providing an equal education to all, especially black,
Hispanic and immigrant children in the inner city. Using an idea
that would warm the heart of a free-market economist _ leveraging
scholarships to help thousands of children seek a better education
_ Forstmann has tapped into the deepest fears and hopes of parents
about the future of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the applicants came from New York City, the nation's
largest school system, where 168,184 students applied, or 29
percent of the 587,092 public and private school student who met
the eligibility guidelines. Students were eligible, officials said,
if their family income was just above the cutoff for the federal
free lunch program, a measure of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had the next highest number, with 59,186 applicants, or
26 percent of those eligible, Los Angeles had 54,444 applicants, or
18 percent. In Baltimore, 44 percent, or 46,011, of those eligible
applied.
</P>
<P>
   Winners are being notified this week, before Wednesday's
ceremony. Most of the scholarships will be awarded in Los Angeles,
with 3,750; New York and Chicago will get 2,500 each and other
cities will get hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at some point the public schools start to fail our
children, and I think the third-grade is that cutoff,'' said
Shelitha Harrelson, a New Yorker whose daughter, Brittney Tucker,
was told this week that she is one of the 40,000 winners.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrelson, whose daughter is in third grade at P.S. 279 in
Brooklyn, said she hoped to use her stipend to help pay the costs
at Marymount, a Manhattan private school where tuition costs
$12,000 a year, or Epiphany, a religious school where tuition is
$4,000. Ms. Harrelson, an administrative coordinator at Polo Ralph
Lauren and a single mother, met the income criterion of $29,295 for
a family of two, just above the cutoff to qualify for the lunch
program.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   New York City's schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, who threatened to
resign last month when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began lobbying for a
government-financed voucher program, said he had no quarrel with
the fund, as long as it used private money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never claimed the public school system is a perfect
system'' Crew said. ``I think this is on the natural; it's going to
happen. It is a sign that there are people who want choice.'' Crew
said he was trying to meet that demand as well with a push to
create charter schools independent of the Board of Education and
some union rules.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Paul Vallas, the chief executive of the public
schools, said: ``I'm all for it. Here you have people from the
private sector pooling their money to help make a child's education
better. How can you be against that?''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann and Walton started the program, called the Children's
Scholarship Fund, eight months ago by contributing $50 million
each, and said they have since raised another $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the biggest privately financed scholarship
program in the country, Forstmann and his associates said, and also
dwarfs experiments with taxpayer-financed voucher programs to send
poor children to private schools in Milwaukee and Cleveland.
Neither Milwaukee nor Cleveland are among the cities receiving
scholarships, according to a list released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the fund's national board of advisers,
including Moynihan and Rep. Charles Rangel of Manhattan, said they
had signed on to the program because they saw it as a chance for
children to attend better schools than the ones they were in, not
as an attack on the public-school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against vouchers,'' Rangel said. ``I support scholarships
for public schools, private schools, and any other kind of
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he saw no long-term threat that private schools
would take over. ``We don't have enough private schools in the city
to absorb the kids even if they did have the vouchers. I'm not
concerned with people who debate these things at cocktail parties
and have their kids already in private schools. I encourage that
type of debate and discussion but I'm not turning down the
scholarships while I'm doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Shields, president of the People for the American Way
Foundation, said Walton's connection with Tesseract Group, the
for-profit education company, suggested that he could profit from
the scholarships. Walton did not return requests for comment left
at the fund's New York offices. But Forstmann said there was no
conflict. ``It seems to me so massively irrelevant,'' he said. ``Do
you know how much money John Walton's got?''
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann said he had no interest in promoting vouchers or
Catholic schools, only in challenging what he called the
government's monopoly control of education. ``We need a competitive
environment,'' Forstmann said. ``I'm in the airplane business. Let
me tell you, you don't fly a Russian airplane, which is state
sponsored.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what the alternative might be, he said: ``I'm not a
politician. I do believe that parents should have a choice, but
that's as far as I can go.''

TENNIS GURU COLLINS TO BE HONORED BY EDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With his colorful prose and trousers to match, Bud
Collins has brought unequaled exuberance and expertise to sports
journalism. At the Associated Press Sports Editors national
convention June 25, the NBC tennis commentator and Globe
correspondent will be honored with the Red Smith Award, the APSE's
highest commendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the biggest honor I've had,'' said Collins. ``I
was very pleased. I think to be voted for something by your peers
is always an honor. I knew Red slightly, but admired him mightily.
Jim Murray was a friend. I think I know all the (former award
winners) but one. I consider many of them friends. It's a nice cast
to be part of. I'm glad just to be a walk-on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Smith Award recognizes a writer who has made ``major
contributions to sports journalism.'' APSE established the award in
1981 and named Smith, a columnist for The New York Times, the first
winner. Collins also joins the elite company of Pulitzer Prize
winners Murray and Dave Anderson, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award recognizes a brilliant career in which Bud's wit,
creativity, and intelligence served his readers well,'' said Globe
editor Matthew V. Storin. ``In particular, he probably did more
than any other writer to bring the game of professional tennis to
the height of its popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins's writing has appeared in the Globe since 1963. He has
covered it all, from the Red Sox to the British Open to the
Olympics. He cited his coverage of the Vietnam War and Muhammad
Ali's career as points of pride. But his take on tennis is
legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous honor, and one Bud richly deserves,''
said Don Skwar, the Globe's assistant managing editor for sports.
``Bud is Mr. Tennis. He's known not just in the country but all
over the world as the preeminent writer and voice of the game. When
it comes to his body of work over the last 30-plus years, there's
only one way to put it: Advantage, Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Collins made his indelible mark as a tennis writer and
television commentator, leading the way for writers to showcase
their talents as broadcasters when he left the Globe as a full-time
employee in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Through his writing and TV work, Collins has become a well-known
and well-respected figure in the tennis community. The top players
past and present are never more than a phone call away. After a day
of matches last year at Longwood in Boston, fans lined up for a
copy of Collins's new book, ``The Bud Collins' Tennis
Encyclopedia,'' and a few words with the 1994 inductee into the
International Tennis Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Collins makes the game fun for the masses with his playful
nicknames and witty commentary. He brought us ``Chris America'' for
Chris Evert, the ``Bucharest Buffoon'' for Ilie Nastase, ``Fraulein
Forehand'' for Steffi Graf, and most recently ``Sisters
Sledgehammer'' for Venus and Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lucky to do both (television and sports writing) on a
national and international level,'' said Collins, who calls himself
a ``scribbler and a babbler'' with characteristic humility.
``(Covering sports) beats working for a living. I've always felt
that.''

REDISCOVERING THE WORK OF A GREAT SELF-DEPRECATOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 David Mermelstein writes about music for The New Criterion.  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the average American knows the name of the French composer
Paul Dukas at all, it is probably in connection with an image of
Mickey Mouse wearing a baggy red robe and a wizard's hat, battling
anthropomorphic broomsticks to the strains of Dukas' ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney's use of that piece in the movie ``Fantasia'' made
Dukas more famous than he might have dreamed, or even hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Dukas, who died in 1935, five years before ``Fantasia'' was
released, would probably have been appalled if he had lived to see
``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' a 12-minute symphonic scherzo,
achieve world renown. One of music's great self-deprecators, he
firmly believed that nothing he wrote was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   He destroyed much of his work and was plagued by doubts about
the music his friends persuaded him to publish. That he was also a
professional music critic, as well as a respected teacher, may have
contributed to his feelings of inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen of Dukas' well-wrought works survive, including the
ballet ``La Peri'' and one opera, ``Ariane et Barbe-Bleue,'' which
is virtually unknown in America. The Metropolitan Opera, which gave
the work's American premiere in 1911 and performed it the next
year, has since ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Keene, as general director of the New York City
Opera, longed to stage it but never managed to do so. But Sunday
afternoon, Leon Botstein will conduct the American Symphony
Orchestra in a concert version of the opera at Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Renate Behle, the Austrian soprano who will sing the female
lead, is a veteran in the part, having performed it at the Hamburg
Opera in 1997 and 1998. Though hardly a repertory staple in Europe,
``Ariane'' is occasionally staged on the Continent. It was
presented at the Paris Opera in the mid-1970s with Grace Bumbry and
at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris in 1991 with Francoise Pollet.
(In 1984, the French label Erato issued a recording of the work,
now out of print.)
</P>
<P>
   The indefatigable Botstein, who is committed to broadening the
repertory, has championed a host of neglected scores, but this is
one of his most ambitious efforts yet. ``Ariane,'' in three acts,
runs two hours without intermissions, and the role of Ariane is
strenuous. Yet Botstein believes in Dukas' opera, which he calls
``fantastically well written.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he alone in his enthusiasm. After the work's Vienna
premiere in 1908, Schoenberg, Webern and Berg congratulated Dukas.
So did Mahler, though his wife, Alma, reported that only the
opera's first act enchanted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ariane'' was of ``decisive importance'' in the development of
the Austrian-American composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Brendan G.
Carroll writes in ``The Last Prodigy,'' a recent Korngold
biography. The American film composer Hugo Friedhofer, Carroll
adds, said that Korngold had admitted to ``living off `Ariane' for
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Messiaen, Dukas' greatest student, not only praised the
opera but also found religious inspiration in it, seeing in
Ariane's quest for truth and eventual liberation an echo of the
gospels. In an essay published a year after Dukas' death, Messiaen
called ``Ariane'' a ``still misunderstood masterpiece,'' and Dukas'
music a ``magic legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ariane,'' with a libretto by Maurice Maeterlinck, relates the
grim story of Bluebeard and his wives in semi-inspiring fashion.
Though based on the 17th-century fairy tale by Charles Perrault, in
which Bluebeard has killed his many wives, Dukas' opera finds them
alive but imprisoned; Ariane discovers them through her ceaseless
curiosity.

UNDRAFTED BRUINS SIGN DEALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A slew of undrafted UCLA football players have
signed free-agent contracts and will participate in minicamps this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo signed with Atlanta, safety Tod
McBride with Seattle, guard Andy Meyers with Buffalo and tight end
Ryan Neufeld with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent was telling teams not to draft me when it got past
the fourth or fifth round,'' Meyers said. ``(As a free agent) you
have a much better chance of finding the right fit.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, kicker Chris Sailer, fullback Craig Walendy and
tight end Mike Grieb are expected to join the San Francisco 49ers,
whose personnel director is former UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agent frenzy is becoming routine in Westwood. Although
UCLA is tied with Arizona State for the most victories in the
Pac-10 in the last three years (25), the Bruins rank ninth in the
conference in draft picks produced over that period.
</P>
<P>
   The differential indicates coach Bob Toledo's staff has made the
most of the shallow talent pool inherited from the Donahue regime.
Donahue's last three recruiting classes (1993-95) have produced
just six draft picks: none in 1997,; three last year (Shaun
Williams, Skip Hicks, Chad Overhauser) and three this year (Cade
McNown, Kris Farris, Larry Atkins).
</P>
<P>
   __ QB update: Toledo wants to establish a starting quarterback
when the Bruins break spring practice May 1. At minimum, he hopes
to whittle the contenders from five to two.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, not Drew Bennett, Scott McEwan, Cory Paus, Ryan
McCann or J.P. Losman has claimed the top spot. ``There is no
clear-cut guy,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Josh Webb has joined his brother, Micah, on
the injured list _ leaving the Bruins with two scholarship tackles:
incumbent Brian Polak and redshirt freshman Blake Worley. Josh
(shoulder) and Micah (knee) are expected back for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackles Anthony Fletcher (hamstring) and Ken Kocher
(arthroscopic knee surgery) are out indefinitely. Without them,
redshirt freshman Sean Phillips, converted offensive lineman Steve
Morgan and walk-on Kory Lombard are taking the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   __ Positions to watch: At least 12 starting positions are
undecided. Here are a few spots the coaches are examining closely
(excluding quarterback):
</P>
<P>
   ++ Right guard: Jim Ghezzi, the former Glendale College star,
will give redshirt freshman Mike Saffer, perhaps UCLA's most gifted
lineman, a run for the No. 1 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Tight end: Gabe Crecion, Randy Hakes and Bryan Fletcher are
competing before heralded recruit Mike Seidman arrives in August.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Safety: Jason Stephens played well last season and probably
has one spot secured, but Eric Whitfield and freshman Audie Attar
are battling for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Defensive end: Starter Santi Hall has been suspended for
spring practice and might not return for training camp _ leaving
Travor Turner, Steve Sua and redshirt freshman Rusty Williams to
compete.

 UNDATED: ceaseless curiosity.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dukas' opera was first performed in 1907 at the Opera-Comique in
Paris, with Georgette Leblanc, Maeterlinck's companion, in the
female lead. The Met staging, with the legendary soprano Geraldine
Farrar, came four years later, conducted by Arturo Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aldrich, reviewing that performance in The New York
Times, praised Toscanini and Farrar. He found the opera as a whole
not quite worthy of ``sensation or undue excitement,'' though he
termed the score ``in many ways a remarkable achievement,'' adding
that ``there is much that is fascinating, seizing and beautiful in
the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dukas' lush and glinting strains are rife with
high-octane outbursts, both vocal and orchestral. Though the opera
is distinctly Dukas', it is punctuated by moments of Wagnerian pomp
right out of ``Die Meistersinger.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is often compared to the lone opera by Dukas' friend
Debussy, ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' which had its premiere in 1902
and also used a Symbolist text by Maeterlinck, set in a
quasi-medieval cosmos. But unlike ``Pelleas,'' ``Ariane'' was
intended for a musical setting from the start. (Maeterlinck
apparently wanted Grieg to compose the score at first.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ariane'' is perhaps closest kin of all to Bartok's one-act
opera, ``Bluebeard's Castle,'' which has received far more
attention on stage and on records. (Christoph von Dohnanyi and the
Cleveland Orchestra will give a concert performance of
``Bluebeard's Castle'' on May 8 at Carnegie Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   Both works take their inspiration from Perrault's story, and
Bela Balazs' text for ``Bluebeard's Castle'' was, like
Maeterlinck's ``Ariane'' libretto, always intended for the opera
stage.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Ariane'' (and ``Pelleas''), the action in ``Bluebeard's
Castle'' is relatively static. Bartok divides the score's vocal
honors neatly between the abusive Bluebeard and his fourth wife,
Judith, whereas Dukas lavishes most of his music on Ariane,
Bluebeard's sixth wife. In fact, Dukas' Bluebeard has a mere eight
lines in the first act, is banished altogether in the second and
stands mute on stage in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the musical styles of the two works are dissimilar, and they
differ most strikingly in the ways they conclude. In Bartok, Judith
joins Bluebeard's women as darkness descends. In Dukas, Ariane
leaves Bluebeard's castle (and his other wives) to venture into the
light.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behle, for one, likes Dukas' more upbeat ending, seeing in
it the promise of female emancipation. But she acknowledges that
the part of Ariane is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is singing and singing and singing,'' Ms. Behle said
recently from Dresden, Germany, where she was performing. ``It
doesn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   As for performing a concert version, Ms. Behle suggested that
the work might prove more effective in this sparer setting.
(Aldrich, in his Times review of 1911, implied much the same.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera is very tough to act,'' Ms. Behle said. ``So much is
poetic and internal between a husband and a wife, and it's
therefore very difficult to stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behle, who has proved a commanding Isolde, is strongly
attracted to the role of Ariane, seeing the character as
particularly vital. But she is less enamored of Dukas' score,
finding it ``romantic and beautiful'' but a pastiche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a reason it is not done very often,'' she
said. ``It is not `Pelleas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Botstein begs to differ. ``I have a lot of allegiance to
Dukas,'' he said. Besides, he added, ``we need to rescue this guy
from Mickey Mouse.''

WHY IT TAKES A VILLAGE: KIDS NEED COMMUNITY HElP TO BECOME GOOD(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children today are selfish, out of control, wild, rude, callous
and immoral _ except for our kids, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 3,000 adults polled by Public Agenda do not believe
today's children will grow up to make the world a better place.
They called teen-agers rude and kids bratty.
</P>
<P>
   However, the adults excluded their own children from negative
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers surveyed said their own parents did a good job of
raising them. It was other kids' irresponsible parents who are the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   If all kids were our kids, how much better this world would be!
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids are our kids,'' says Dr. Peter Benson, president of
the Minneapolis-based Search Institute, which was founded in 1958
to advance the well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids need us,'' Benson says. ``The key point to remember
is that we all need to take responsibility for our nation's youth.
We all have a role to play in their development.''
</P>
<P>
   Search Institute has conducted research involving nearly 600,000
young people nationwide to formulate the Healthy
Communities/Healthy Youth initiative. The goal is to provide the
training and technical assistance needed to motivate and equip
communities to nurture competent, caring and responsible children.
</P>
<P>
   The average young person has fewer than half of the 40
developmental assets the institute has identified as necessary for
healthy development. These essential ingredients range from family
support and a caring school environment to personal power and
optimism about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey of 100,000 sixth- to 12th-graders in 213 towns
and cities found that the more ``developmental assets'' young
people have, the less likely they are to use drugs and alcohol, or
to engage in sexual activity or violence.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 percent of the youth surveyed experience at least 31 of
the 40 assets. The average young person experiences 18.
</P>
<P>
   Too many young people are growing up ill-prepared to take their
place in society, says Benson, author of ``All Kids Are Our Kids:
What Communities Must Do to Raise Caring and Responsible Children
and Adolescents'' and ``What Kids Need to Succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all heard that it takes the collective efforts of an
entire community to help our young people succeed in life, but in
many cases the various sectors of a community are not equipped to
work toward a common goal or to do their part,'' Benson says.
``What we're talking about through Healthy Communities/Healthy
Youth is educating people in all corners of a community about what
they can and should do to make sure young people get what they
require to grow up to be healthy, happy, caring.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Does your child have what it takes?
</P>
<P>
   The Search Institute lists these 40 assets as crucial to a
child's healthy development. The average child experiences only 18
of them.

SEMI-DEREGULATION OF OCEAN SHIPPING: HIGHER COSTS ON THE HIGH
SEAS

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ocean-shipping business will be largely
deregulated on May 1, setting off a scramble among shipping lines
to lure customers with discounts. The same day, however, virtually
all ships carrying goods from Asia to the United States plan to
raise their rates by the same, mutually agreed, amount.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds contradictory, it is. But the state of affairs
reflects the forces buffeting the shipping business, which is now
going through some of the biggest changes in its tradition-bound
history.
</P>
<P>
   Under the partial deregulation, container shipping lines for the
first time will be able to sign individual, confidential contracts
with importers and exporters. The competition to sign up such
customers is expected to greatly loosen the grip of the cartels
that have legally set rates for ocean shipping for more than a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But the shipping industry's unusual immunity from federal
antitrust laws _ something it has enjoyed almost ever since there
were antitrust laws _ is not being eliminated. So even as they
enter a less-regulated era, the shipping lines, reeling from low
profits and overcapacity, are collectively raising rates on imports
from Asia by 30 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a clash between the old and new ways of doing
business, and no one is quite sure how it will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect that eventually container shipping will
follow the paths of airlines, trucking and railroads, which began
their deregulation two decades ago. There will be lower prices and
better service over all, but also a brutal period of mergers and
bankruptcies among the competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the continued right to set rates collectively
will blunt these effects. ``It isn't going to be airlines,'' said
Ashley Craig, a consultant at Rodriguez &AMP; Associates, a Washington
law firm that represents small importers and exporters. ``It isn't
going to be rail or trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which way shipping costs move, consumers might not
notice much difference. This is because that, for most goods, such
as imported sneakers or videocassette recorders, shipping costs
contribute only a tiny amount to the final price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with more than $400 billion in goods entering or leaving
the United States each year on container ships, even little changes
mount up. Moreover, shipping lines, pressed to cut costs further,
might make even more demands for concessions from
taxpayer-supported ports. Sea-Land Service, a unit of CSX Corp.,
and Maersk Inc. of Copenhagen, a subsidiary of AP Moller Group, are
now making such demands of the ports of New York and New Jersey and
Baltimore, which are vying for the lines' business, with jobs and
income at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing many shipping executives want right now is more
competition. The economic downturn in Asia, which has led to record
trade deficits for the United States, has also caused serious
imbalances for their lines. And the situation may well continue:
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the nation's trade
deficit jumped to a new monthly high of $19.4 billion in February,
largely on the strength of imports and the weakening demand for
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Ships bringing imports to the United States from East Asia, the
largest trade route in the world, are stuffed to capacity, but the
ships going back to Asia are half-empty. Shipping lines say they
need revenue on both legs to make a profit. And that is why they
are raising rates in the busy direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the business 30 years and the imbalance has never
been that bad,'' said Albert Pierce, chairman and executive
director of the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, the group of
carriers that decided on the May 1 rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The bulging trade deficit can be seen in the form of empty
shipping containers stacked four high on the piers at the adjacent
ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which together handle about a
third of the nation's container traffic. For many months last year,
as exports to Asia dried up, more empty containers were being sent
back to Asia than full ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 export was empty containers,'' said Harold Hilliard,
marketing manager for the Port of Long Beach, the nation's largest.
In the last few months, amid some signs of recovery in Asia, loaded
containers heading to Asia have slightly outnumbered the empties.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, imports have been unusually strong early this year as
importers ship early to beat the May 1 increase and a possible
strike by longshoremen this summer. They also fear a repeat of the
delays that occurred last year, when not enough ships and
containers were available to handle all the imports from Asia that
had suddenly become cheaper for Americans when Asian currencies
were devalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few of our Christmas decorations arrived too late for
the season,'' said John Carrier, import traffic manager of World
Bazaar Inc., a housewares importer based in City of Commerce. The
per-container price he paid rose from $1,400 to as much as $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many executives expect the same thing to happen this summer.
``The big issue this year is `I don't care what it costs, just get
me on a ship,''' said Tom Craig, head of the LTD Shippers
Association, which represents 500 small importers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the seller's market, the shipping lines said
they would raise rates by $900 for a 40-foot container coming to
the West Coast from Asia, with an additional $300 surcharge from
June through November, the peak season. That represents an increase
of 30 percent to 100 percent over current rates, which range from
$1,100 to more than $3,000, depending on the merchandise and the
route.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Camarena, vice president for operations and global
logistics for Vans Inc., a footwear company, said that shipping
contributed about 35 cents to 50 cents to the cost of a pair of
shoes; the rate increase, he said, would add 15 cents to 20 cents
to that. An executive at another footwear company cited even lower
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while consumers might not notice, even pennies matter to
corporate profit margins. Retailers ``won't even take a 15-cent
hit,'' Camarena said, worried that his company might have to absorb
the increase on millions of pairs of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   A major question, however, is whether such a coordinated rate
increase will hold under the new Ocean Shipping Reform Act, enacted
in October by Congress. These changes, the first in 15 years, will
allow importers and exporters to sign confidential contracts with a
shipping company. Big importers _ the Wal-Marts and Nikes of the
world _ are expected to obtain hefty discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Until now container shipping lines have been ``common carriers''
like the phone company, accepting all customers at published rates.
Most rates have been set by cartels known as conferences. Importers
and exporters could negotiate their own contracts, often with the
entire conference, sometimes with an individual shipping line. The
terms of such contracts were public and other importers or
exporters had the right to demand the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   The conference system has already started to fray in
anticipation of May 1. The Asia North America Eastbound Rate
Agreement, known as Anera, which sets rates for containers heading
from Asia to the United States, will disband April 30, as will its
westbound counterpart. Somewhat similar changes are occurring on
the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Anera is being replaced by the Transpacific Stabilization
Agreement, a ``discussion group'' that is housed in the same office
in San Francisco. Such groups will not have legally binding
rate-setting authority, as the conferences do. But that has not
stopped members of the group from ``voluntarily'' agreeing to raise
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping is one of the few industries _ others include Major
League Baseball and farm cooperatives _ to enjoy some immunity from
antitrust laws. First granted in 1916, immunity was apparently
rationalized as a way to prevent price wars and bankruptcies that
could lead to a shortage of shipping capacity. It applies to
regularly scheduled shipping lines, not to oil tankers and bulk
commodity carriers, which are not regulated and thus not affected
by the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The container shipping lines fought successfully to retain the
antitrust exemption in October's legislation, arguing that the
United States had to be in accord with other nations, which allow
collective rate-setting. An argument was also made that U.S.
shipping lines, which are more easily subject to prosecution by the
Justice Department than foreign companies, would be at a
disadvantage if immunity ended _ even though few U.S. lines remain.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation was pushed most strongly by big importers and
exporters, which wanted not only lower rates but also the more
tailored service they could get through contracts with a single
shipping line. While these companies wanted to eliminate the
antitrust immunity, they compromised with the shipping lines to get
the bill passed. Peter Gatti, director of policy for the National
Industrial Transportation League, which represents major importers
and exporters, said that in an era of individual contracts,
collective rate-setting would not be as important as before anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even without deregulation, the shipping conferences have been
the cartels that couldn't shoot straight. Companies added so many
new ships that overcapacity resulted, driving down prices. Some
major shipping companies, such as Taiwan's Evergreen line, never
joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been much less successful than even OPEC,'' said Torey
Presti, vice president of regulatory affairs for APL Ltd., a major
shipping line based in Oakland. Neptune Orient Lines of Singapore,
which acquired APL in 1997, lost $263 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   APL's sale left Sea-Land Service as the only U.S. shipping line
among the 10 largest global carriers serving the United States _
this despite government subsidies of about $2 million a year to
ships with U.S. flags and crews that can be turned over to the
Pentagon in times of war.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Land's operating profits, after growing for several years,
dropped by half in 1998 and there are rumors that CSX might sell
all or part of the shipping line.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Land president and chief executive John Clancey predicted
that deregulation would actually lead to higher profits for the
best shipping lines, which would be able to develop closer
relationships with key customers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Sea-Land and APL hope to offer global contracts,
rather than ocean by ocean, and to provide more sophisticated
services, such as coordinating a customer's entire supply network.
APL, for instance, is managing the shipments of parts to a General
Motors factory in Thailand, even the shipments over land.
</P>
<P>
   To speed cargo movements and cut costs, APL has also invested
heavily in cargo terminals like the one here in Los Angeles, where
200 trucks come and go each hour, picking up or dropping off
containers that are assigned spaces by a computer in a vast parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Changes to the business might be gradual, but jarring just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maritime finds it harder to change than almost anybody because
it's steeped in tradition,'' said Jil Morley, transportation
manager for Blue Diamond Growers, a cooperative of almond growers.
But with deregulation, she said, ``I'm expecting it to get more
like the real world, like the rest of the world.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's trade deficit jumped unexpectedly to
previously unheard-of levels in February as consumers bought
growing quantities of imports and declining demand from abroad hurt
exporters, the government reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit in goods and services in February surged to a new
monthly high of $19.4 billion, the Commerce Department said, $2.6
billion more than January's deficit of $16.8 billion, which itself
had been a record. Economists had expected February's deficit to be
around $16.7 billion. The figures are adjusted to smooth out
seasonal variations in trade patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Imports in February rose by $2.1 billion, to $96 billion.
Exports declined by $500 million, to $76.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The figures reflected the persistent and in some ways increasing
gap between the economic strength of the United States and the
downturns plaguing nearly all of its trading partners, from Asia to
Europe to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the world's major countries, the United States is a
magnet for imports of goods and services, helping to avert even
deeper global economic problems. With unemployment low and stock
prices up sharply since the beginning of the year, American
consumers have been spending freely, and they are finding bargains
in imports.
</P>
<P>
   But because demand for American-made goods has been diminished
by weakness in other countries, the growing trade deficit is
hurting many manufacturers and farmers in the United States and
slowing growth. Economists said declining exports appear to have
slowed the economy's expansion to about a 3 percent annual rate in
the first three months of the year from twice that in last year's
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the deficit after a year and a half of economic
upheaval around the world added to an escalating debate over how
willing the United States should be to leave its markets open to
other countries that do not fully reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like farmers, steelworkers and textile makers are already
howling about unfair competition from abroad, and making their
influence felt in Washington. The next major flash point is likely
to come in a few months, when the Clinton administration is
expected to complete a deal to bring China into the World Trade
Organization and seek approval from a deeply divided Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton used the figures announced Tuesday to bolster
his call for an overhaul of the world's financial system in the
wake of the turmoil that sped from Asia to Russia and Latin America
in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though our economy has continued to grow, we have been
affected by the Asian financial crisis as you can see by our trade
figures, by what has happened in steel and by the loss of markets
by our farmers,'' Clinton said in a speech at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that this was ``not a moment for complacency,'' Clinton
outlined a series of principles he said the United States would
advance in coming months as the major industrial nations consider
how to overhaul the financial system and avert future international
economic upheaval. They include tightening bank lending rules and
encouraging developing nations to rely less on short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of free trade have become increasingly worried about
what they see as growing protectionist pressures. Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, denounced protectionism in a speech
last Friday and made a case that while dropping trade barriers can
be painful, it ultimately adds to the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor and companies in the industries being hit
hardest continue to argue that fair trade rather than free trade
should be the nation's goal. John Sweeney, the president of the
AFL-CIO, called Tuesday's trade figures ``cause for real alarm,''
and said the worst may not yet be past for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year we lost over 350,000 manufacturing jobs,''
Sweeney said in a speech in Chicago. ``And no one knows how long we
can survive as an island of prosperity in a sea of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   With Japan still mired in recession, growth in Western Europe
slowing and Latin America struggling, some economists and business
groups said they expected demand for exports to be tepid for the
rest of the year. Rising oil prices could also make the deficit
look bigger in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit, said Gordon Richards, an economist at the
National Association of Manufacturers, ``won't improve
substantially until the world economy recovers, and that is still
some time away.''
</P>
<P>
   Other economists, however, said there were signs that the
decline in export demand had bottomed out and that manufacturing
was ready to rebound. Among the signs they cited was a rise in
export orders tallied by the National Association of Purchasing
Management in February and March, suggesting that shipments to
foreign customers could pick up in coming months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   February marked the fourth consecutive month of declining
exports, and the figures showed weakening demand in February from
most of the country's major trading partners. The deficit of trade
in goods with Mexico increased to $1.8 billion from $1.4 billion,
using figures that are not seasonally adjusted. The goods deficit
with Japan increased to $5.3 billion for the month from $4.7
billion in January. Demand from Western Europe dropped sharply,
sending the monthly deficit in trade of goods to $2.2 billion from
$1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decline in exports was in agricultural products,
including soybeans, and in commercial aircraft, a notoriously
volatile component of the figures that is almost totally dependent
on Boeing Co.'s delivery schedule for sales to foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in imports was concentrated in consumer goods,
including clothing, toys and sporting goods, with a surge as well
in the number of imported cars.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few relative bright spots was a slight decline in the
deficit with China. The goods deficit with China declined to $4.6
billion in February from $4.9 billion in January. But over the last
few years, the deficit with China has grown to the point that it
rivals the deficit with Japan as the biggest two-way trade gap.
</P>
<P>
   But with the administration about to make a push to seal a trade
deal with China, Commerce Secretary William Daley said Beijing
still had to prove that it was willing to play by international
rules and drop the barriers that have kept companies from the
United States and other countries out of its markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China wants to be a true global trading partner and a
member of the World Trade Organization,'' Daley told reporters
Tuesday, ``the Chinese government must promptly agree to open her
markets to foreign goods and services.''

A `NEWSROOM' WHERE THE NEWS IS IRRELEVANT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's always a breaking story at the nightly ``Toronto News.''
For example, George Findlay, the show's producer, throws a racist
tantrum when he doesn't get his bran muffin. Or when his BMW needs
a $3,200 muffler system. Or when he has once again hit on a woman
half his age (late 40s) and she has complained to management.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally events from the outside intrude on George's total
self-absorption, but on ``The Newsroom,'' Ken Finkleman's dry,
riotous take on a Canadian television news organization, any war,
plane crash or nuclear accident had better have the right spin
potential if it hopes to compete for attention with who gets the
prime indoor parking spot or which assistant to hire, the black
lesbian or the blond ski bunny.
</P>
<P>
   A huge hit on Canadian television, ``The Newsroom'' made its way
south to PBS in 1997 (last New Year's Eve, WNET in New York reran
all 13 episodes back to back) and has recently been released in a
four-tape set by Acorn Media. WNET plans to show the series again
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing, acting and direction appealed in every way,''
said Anne Gorfinkel, the station's deputy director for programming.
</P>
<P>
   Finkleman also conceived and wrote the show and stars as George.
A former Hollywood screenwriter (he wrote and directed ``Airplane
2''), he was driven back home in the early 90s by what he describes
as the studios' idiotic treatment of his material. Resettled in
Toronto, he sold the Canadian Broadcasting Company on a satire
about television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's idea about news being corrupt has just gotten into
the conventional wisdom,'' he said. ``There's always this need to
impose a narrative. That's what I find very destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Newsroom'' George is maniacally driven to mount
dramatizations that play to ratings. ``No need to paint ourselves
into a factual corner here,'' he says about coverage of a killer
virus. Other priorities are staying out of the way of management
and tending to personal matters, often having to do with George's
efforts to persuade women, usually virtual strangers, to go away
with him for the weekend (separate rooms, he assures them).
</P>
<P>
   As paranoid as he is sex-obsessed, George continually fears for
his position. At one point he leaves a telephone message in which
he threatens to quit. His assistants say he should have dared
management to dismiss him, which would require showing cause.
Panic-stricken, George orders a long-suffering intern to break into
the voice-mail system and erase the message.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a situation at the Pickering power plant threatens
another Chernobyl 20 minutes from downtown Toronto. In the
interests of narrative, George decides the event needs a name _
``Pickering, Mon Amour,'' someone suggests _ and, thinking the
situation could use a more sensational aura, plans to model the
story after the coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   George says he wants a ``nuclear holocaust twist to the O.J.
thing _ to crank up the old addiction.'' Later he tosses in
elements of ``Apocalypse Now'' and ``Jaws.'' No, wait, ``The China
Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone rounds up a nuclear expert to tell viewers what is
actually going on at Pickering. George, who has moved on to matters
of costume and personal appearance, says that's all right, but adds
that if the man wants to get on the air, he'd better lose the
scraggly hairdo.

TENNIS GURU COLLINS TO BE HONORED BY EDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With his colorful prose and trousers to match, Bud
Collins has brought unequaled exuberance and expertise to sports
journalism. At the Associated Press Sports Editors national
convention June 25, the NBC tennis commentator and Globe
correspondent will be honored with the Red Smith Award, the APSE's
highest commendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the biggest honor I've had,'' said Collins. ``I
was very pleased. I think to be voted for something by your peers
is always an honor. I knew Red slightly, but admired him mightily.
Jim Murray was a friend. I think I know all the (former award
winners) but one. I consider many of them friends. It's a nice cast
to be part of. I'm glad just to be a walk-on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Smith Award recognizes a writer who has made ``major
contributions to sports journalism.'' APSE established the award in
1981 and named Smith, a columnist for The New York Times, the first
winner. Collins also joins the elite company of Pulitzer Prize
winners Murray and Dave Anderson, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award recognizes a brilliant career in which Bud's wit,
creativity, and intelligence served his readers well,'' said Globe
editor Matthew V. Storin. ``In particular, he probably did more
than any other writer to bring the game of professional tennis to
the height of its popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins's writing has appeared in the Globe since 1963. He has
covered it all, from the Red Sox to the British Open to the
Olympics. He cited his coverage of the Vietnam War and Muhammad
Ali's career as points of pride. But his take on tennis is
legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous honor, and one Bud richly deserves,''
said Don Skwar, the Globe's assistant managing editor for sports.
``Bud is Mr. Tennis. He's known not just in the country but all
over the world as the preeminent writer and voice of the game. When
it comes to his body of work over the last 30-plus years, there's
only one way to put it: Advantage, Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Collins made his indelible mark as a tennis writer and
television commentator, leading the way for writers to showcase
their talents as broadcasters when he left the Globe as a full-time
employee in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Through his writing and TV work, Collins has become a well-known
and well-respected figure in the tennis community. The top players
past and present are never more than a phone call away. After a day
of matches last year at Longwood in Boston, fans lined up for a
copy of Collins's new book, ``The Bud Collins' Tennis
Encyclopedia,'' and a few words with the 1994 inductee into the
International Tennis Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Collins makes the game fun for the masses with his playful
nicknames and witty commentary. He brought us ``Chris America'' for
Chris Evert, the ``Bucharest Buffoon'' for Ilie Nastase, ``Fraulein
Forehand'' for Steffi Graf, and most recently ``Sisters
Sledgehammer'' for Venus and Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lucky to do both (television and sports writing) on a
national and international level,'' said Collins, who calls himself
a ``scribbler and a babbler'' with characteristic humility.
``(Covering sports) beats working for a living. I've always felt
that.''

 (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now is the spring of content for friends of the Bard.
With ``Shakespeare in Love'' still drawing audiences, they can look
forward to ``The Taming of the Shrew'' this summer at the Delacorte
Theater in Central Park in New York. Before that, comes a movie of
``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' with Kevin Kline as Bottom, and,
later this year, the screen will bring us Julie Taymor's version of
the rarely performed ``Titus Andronicus,'' with Anthony Hopkins as
that much-suffering monster.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a fair guess that at least one eminent Bardolator,
Harold Bloom, is reining in his expectations for these latest
attempts at casting a fresh light on the canon. His book
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' leaves no doubt of his
irritation with most of the interpretations he has encountered in a
lifetime of worshiping the plays; for him, the more daring the
attempt, the more excruciating the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there in his 741 pages, Bloom dredges up a kind word
about a legendary turn by an actor whom he has never seen _ Kean or
Irving as Shylock _ or a production that he saw long ago: most
memorably for him, the Henry plays with Ralph Richardson as
Falstaff and, incidentally, Laurence Olivier alternating between
Hotspur and Shallow.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom reports that Richardson's performance, seen at the age of
16, gave him his ``first understanding of Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   He has applause, too, for Peggy Ashcroft and John Gielgud (also
a half-century ago) in ``Much Ado About Nothing'' and for Katharine
Hepburn's 1950 ``triumph'' in ``As You Like It.'' But such praise
is rare in this otherwise praiseful work. Bloom does not make life
easy for directors and actors who perforce try to come up with
novel interpretations of a much-performed repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, in the Bloomsian view, directors and actors are doing
very badly, out of sheer incompetence or under the influence of the
hour's ideologues, be they feminists or Marxists or
multiculturalists. He allows that a few minor plays, like ``Titus
Andronicus,'' are beyond redemption and that a few major
characters, like Shylock, can hardly be represented at all in a
post-Holocaust world. But his sympathies remain firmly with the
plays, not the players.
</P>
<P>
   He charges, to take his favorite example, that ``Hamlet'' has
suffered from four centuries of misreading, culminating not long
ago in the Broadway ``travesty'' starring Ralph Fiennes mumbling
and racing through the ``To be or not to be'' soliloquy. One fears
to imagine what Bloom will make of the promised return of the play
set in the corporate 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Naming names of his least admired directors, our textualist
comes down hard on Peter Brook and Jan Kott for their ``brutal''
mishandlings of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Joining their
company are those who have made ``The Tempest'' Shakespeare's
``worst interpreted and performed'' comedy.
</P>
<P>
   George C. Wolfe is cited, with exasperation, for scoring a
success in Central Park some seasons ago by turning the half-human
Caliban into a Third World freedom fighter with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Bloom does not fail to note, the Shakespearean canon
was made to be acted well before scholars got their hands on it.
Along with playing the Ghost in ``Hamlet,'' Shakespeare left us,
through the exceedingly intelligent Dane, the pithiest and most
enduring stage direction in history: ``Suit the action to the word,
the word to the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that tag does not settle much, but it does suggest the
differing starting places for Bloom and the interpreters he cannot
abide, like ``the gender and power covens'' who have tampered with
his cherished heroine, Rosalind, and succeeded in making ``nearly
every production of `As You Like It''' _ Ms. Hepburn excepted _ a
libel on ``the most remarkable and persuasive representation of a
woman in all Western literature.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of failure, he maintains, is symptomatic of ``the
authentic decline of our cognitive and literate culture,'' under
the assault by movies, television and computers. If, as he laments,
as great a work as ``King Lear'' defies ``a Shakespearean staging
of Shakespeare,'' then the society is plainly losing its literary
tradition and probably its bearings.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the situation: Where the Bardolator dedicates himself
to defending the text against the barbarians, the directors have
the challenge of finding audience-engaging ways that reflect the
times and perhaps the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom understands this, yet takes refuge in the faith that
Shakespeare's ``more select'' admirers have always been his readers
rather than his ticket buyers, and proposes, perhaps seriously,
that the works would be better served by public readings than by
ill-directed and inadequately performed productions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you see the situation as the mandarin versus the
wrecking crew or a puritan versus the progressives, the definitions
don't get us very far. For the directorial disposition, the
familiar words on the page, however sublime, must seem a sort of
imprisonment of one's creative abilities or pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Bloomsian is committed to defending the text or his
version of it, after so many Hamlets and so many Lears the theater
people are likely to be desperate for an original if at times
dizzying spin.
</P>
<P>
   The clash is as inevitable and irreconcilable as that between
the anointed Richard II and the usurping Bolingbroke. Who is to
rule the Shakespearean kingdom? Season after season, it is not only
careers that are in opposition but entire world views.

LEWIS' WIDOW SEEKS TO BAR EVIDENCE OF DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis are expected to ask a
judge Wednesday to bar evidence of illegal drug use by her late
husband, Reggie Lewis, from an upcoming malpractice trial spurred
by his death, arguing that the allegations have been raised ``for
the sole purpose of trashing the good name, reputation and legacy''
of the former Boston Celtics star.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also argue that damaging testimony about Lewis'
alleged cocaine use ``can have no purpose other than to attempt to
intimidate (Harris-Lewis) into dropping this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has sued Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. and three other
doctors, Peter L. Friedman, Mark A. Creager and John D. Rutherford,
for failing to diagnose her husband's life-threatening heart
condition. Lewis died in 1993 shortly after collapsing on a
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for Mudge, who contends that Lewis confessed to
him two weeks before his death that he had used cocaine, argue that
Lewis impeded Mudge from making an accurate diagnosis by previously
denying his drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence Harris-Lewis's attorneys want barred from
trial is testimony by 13 witnesses, including sportscaster Bob
Lobel of WBZ-TV in Boston. Mudge's attorneys contend the witnesses
have some knowledge of Lewis's alleged cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted by the Globe Tuesday, Lobel said he was not aware he
had been named as a witness and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers filed by Harris-Lewis's attorneys, Robert G.
Harley and Bridget Asaro of New York, several of the witnesses are
expected to testify that they saw other individuals take illicit
drugs in Lewis's presence. Such testimony ``is a back door attack
on his character, which is not an issue in this case,'' the
attorneys wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense counsel would like to raise this (drug) issue before
the jury as often as possible,'' they continued. ``However, Reggie
Lewis isn't on trial here, and his reputation should not be subject
to repetitive, unsubstantiated allegations of illicit drug use.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., refused to comment
Tuesday. But in court papers, Dailey accuses Harris-Lewis' lawyers
of ``trying to inflame the court,'' calling Lewis's alleged drug
use ``well-founded and legally relevant'' to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiff has employed this tactic repeatedly to attack
the defendants and their counsel with the obvious aim of diverting
the court's attention from the real issue concerning Mr. Lewis's
history of cocaine use: whether or not Mr. Lewis's failure to
earlier disclose his use of cocaine contributed to the confounding
nature of Mr. Lewis's complex cardiac diagnosis. This issue, like
many other factual disputes in this case, ultimately is a medical
issue,'' the motion in opposition states.
</P>
<P>
   Local defense attorney Tim O'Neill, who specializes in medical
malpractice cases, said Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith is likely to
permit evidence of alleged drug use to be admitted at trial since
it relevant to the case's central issue: whether negligence by
Mudge led to Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct tells me that if the defense can connect the heart
condition to the use of drugs with reasonable scientific
evidence,'' evidence of alleged drug use is likely to be admitted,
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act the judge has to do,'' he added. The
judge must weigh whether the prejudicial value of the evidence
outweighs its value to Mudge's defense, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balancing would be tipped pretty heavily to the defense in
this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if evidence of alleged drug use were to be barred, the
result wouldn't necessarily be favorable to Harris-Lewis, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what other kinds of evidence there are, but there
may be other issues that makes Mudge's approach (to Lewis's
diagnosis) quite reasonable,'' he said. ``There may be many, many
other reasons that justified Mudge thinking the way he did.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill also said that in medical malpractice cases, juries are
told not simply to determine if a doctor made a mistake, but if the
doctor's diagnosis was reasonable given his knowledge of a
patient's condition.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, a doctor doesn't ``have to be right, he
just has to be reasonably within the range of judgment that doctors
make in these cases.''

TOO MANY STROKE PATIENTS MISSING OUT ON POWERFUL DRUG, DOCTORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Before the night was over, it seemed that
everyone at All Saints Episcopal Hospital knew about the stroke
patient who watched ``Judge Judy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lila Shaw's fondness for the feisty judge of daytime television,
backed up by a quick call to 911, helped give doctors the
confidence to use a powerful but time-sensitive, clot-busting drug
called t-PA. By midnight, Shaw was well on her way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But three years after the drug's approval, doctors say, too many
patients are missing out on its potential. Studies show that only 3
percent to 5 percent of those eligible nationwide get the
intravenous medication, according to American Heart Association
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, lying on her bed one afternoon last month, had reached for
the remote control to tape the rest of the ``Judge Judy'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could move my arm, but my hand couldn't pick it up,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When she called out to her son-in-law, her mouth wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up,'' the 73-year-old Fort Worth woman said, ``and
realized that my leg was going out, too. I was kind of dragging it
along. I managed to leap from one piece of furniture to another
until I got to the hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, t-PA must be started within three hours of a
stroke's onset. The drug is designed to attack clots in the brain's
vessels and dissolve them before too much of the surrounding brain
tissue is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Shaw's son-in-law called 911, paramedics were
standing in her bedroom, debating exactly when ``Judge Judy''
aired. The start time of the three-hour clock, doctors say, must
date back to when the patient last felt normal.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, trying to interject, held up four fingers, managing to get
out the word ``thirty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind was clear _ it didn't knock out my mind or anything,''
Shaw said. ``But I realized, though, that my arm and leg were
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, doctors say, the race against time breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Patients hesitate to go to the emergency room, unable or
unwilling to acknowledge the early signs of a stroke. A hospital
may not have the necessary specialists available to quickly examine
patients and do the necessary tests.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, formally known as tissue plasminogen activator, does
come with a worrisome catch. Even if t-PA is used by the third
hour, there is still a small risk that the powerful drug may
trigger bleeding into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a very minor bleed or it could be a
life-threatening bleed,'' said Fort Worth neurologist Krishnababu
Chunduri, who helped treat Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, about 500,000 Americans have a stroke, according to
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. A
blood clot to the brain causes about 80 percent of the brain
attacks _ a term more frequently used now to indicate the urgency
of the stroke crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chunduri, chairman of Plaza Medical Center's stroke team,
estimates that about half of his stroke patients would have been
eligible for t-PA if they had arrived at the hospital soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   But patients may not realize that they are having a stroke. An
October 1997 study published in the journal ``Stroke'' found that,
even among recent stroke patients, almost four in 10 lacked basic
knowledge of the symptoms and risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   And doctors can get nervous about administering the powerful
drug, said Dr. Errol Bryce, who helped treat Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of experience is one,'' he said. ``Fear of a worse
outcome is another one. You can actually kill the patient giving
them t-PA.''
</P>
<P>
   Before receiving t-PA shortly after 6 p.m., Shaw underwent an
examination, including a brain scan to verify that a lodged clot,
rather than bleeding, caused her stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who is quick to acknowledge that her own personality
matches the feisty judge's, said she was willing to take a risk if
it meant living with less disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very independent person,'' she said. ``It would have
been hell on earth for me to be paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   The clot-busting properties of t-PA have been demonstrated for
years with heart attack patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's 1996 FDA approval for emergency stroke treatment came
after a study published the year before in the New England Journal
of Medicine. At least one-third of the patients who got the drug
experienced a partial or complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the study showed that in about 6 percent of patients, the
medication could trigger bleeding into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After the medication started flowing into her arm, Shaw noticed
that her speech and mobility on her right side were worsening.
</P>
<P>
   She was talking more and more out of the left side of her mouth,
daughter Linda Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started telling my sister and I that she loved us,''
Simmons said. ``She said that she wanted to tell us while she still
could.''
</P>
<P>
   As she lay with her right side completely immobilized, Shaw
wondered whether she would ever be able to write again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, ``I felt an involuntary jerk or tic in my right
arm and I tried to move my fingers and I was moving them.''
</P>
<P>
   By shortly after midnight, Shaw was enjoying a sandwich and her
new-found celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became famous throughout the hospital,'' Simmons laughed,
``as the woman who watches ``Judge Judy'' and survived a stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, as Shaw was being discharged, Chunduri told
her about his mother's 1995 stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his quick response, rushing his mother to a hospital in
the middle of the night, little could be done, he said, even as her
left side became gradually paralyzed. Today, Chunduri said, his
mother depends on a walker for limited mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``With tears in his eyes,'' Shaw recalled, ``he said, `This
would have saved her.'''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Shaw saw Bryce, she greeted him with a hug and a
kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a disservice to patients not to consider this,''
Bryce said.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, Shaw's only complaint is some dizziness
related to her medications. Her family, she said, tends to fuss
when she ventures outside into the sunshine with her dogs to feed
the birds.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't bid them any mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, she hates most television.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my brain semi-intact and the wisteria and the trees
blooming, I just have to go out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Stroke Symptoms
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, go straight to the emergency room if you think
you're having a stroke. Some warning signs:
</P>
<P>
   _Numbness, weakness, or paralysis of the face, arm or leg,
especially on one side of the body.
</P>
<P>
   _Loss of balance or coordination.
</P>
<P>
   _Sudden, blurred or decreased vision in one or both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _Difficulty speaking or understanding language.

LEWIS' WIDOW SEEKS TO BAR EVIDENCE OF DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis are expected to ask a
judge Wednesday to bar evidence of illegal drug use by her late
husband, Reggie Lewis, from an upcoming malpractice trial spurred
by his death, arguing that the allegations have been raised ``for
the sole purpose of trashing the good name, reputation and legacy''
of the former Boston Celtics star.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also argue that damaging testimony about Lewis'
alleged cocaine use ``can have no purpose other than to attempt to
intimidate (Harris-Lewis) into dropping this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has sued Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. and three other
doctors, Peter L. Friedman, Mark A. Creager and John D. Rutherford,
for failing to diagnose her husband's life-threatening heart
condition. Lewis died in 1993 shortly after collapsing on a
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for Mudge, who contends that Lewis confessed to
him two weeks before his death that he had used cocaine, argue that
Lewis impeded Mudge from making an accurate diagnosis by previously
denying his drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence Harris-Lewis's attorneys want barred from
trial is testimony by 13 witnesses, including sportscaster Bob
Lobel of WBZ-TV in Boston. Mudge's attorneys contend the witnesses
have some knowledge of Lewis's alleged cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted by the Globe Tuesday, Lobel said he was not aware he
had been named as a witness and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers filed by Harris-Lewis's attorneys, Robert G.
Harley and Bridget Asaro of New York, several of the witnesses are
expected to testify that they saw other individuals take illicit
drugs in Lewis's presence. Such testimony ``is a back door attack
on his character, which is not an issue in this case,'' the
attorneys wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense counsel would like to raise this (drug) issue before
the jury as often as possible,'' they continued. ``However, Reggie
Lewis isn't on trial here, and his reputation should not be subject
to repetitive, unsubstantiated allegations of illicit drug use.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., refused to comment
Tuesday. But in court papers, Dailey accuses Harris-Lewis' lawyers
of ``trying to inflame the court,'' calling Lewis's alleged drug
use ``well-founded and legally relevant'' to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiff has employed this tactic repeatedly to attack
the defendants and their counsel with the obvious aim of diverting
the court's attention from the real issue concerning Mr. Lewis's
history of cocaine use: whether or not Mr. Lewis's failure to
earlier disclose his use of cocaine contributed to the confounding
nature of Mr. Lewis's complex cardiac diagnosis. This issue, like
many other factual disputes in this case, ultimately is a medical
issue,'' the motion in opposition states.
</P>
<P>
   Local defense attorney Tim O'Neill, who specializes in medical
malpractice cases, said Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith is likely to
permit evidence of alleged drug use to be admitted at trial since
it relevant to the case's central issue: whether negligence by
Mudge led to Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct tells me that if the defense can connect the heart
condition to the use of drugs with reasonable scientific
evidence,'' evidence of alleged drug use is likely to be admitted,
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act the judge has to do,'' he added. The
judge must weigh whether the prejudicial value of the evidence
outweighs its value to Mudge's defense, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balancing would be tipped pretty heavily to the defense in
this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if evidence of alleged drug use were to be barred, the
result wouldn't necessarily be favorable to Harris-Lewis, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what other kinds of evidence there are, but there
may be other issues that makes Mudge's approach (to Lewis's
diagnosis) quite reasonable,'' he said. ``There may be many, many
other reasons that justified Mudge thinking the way he did.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill also said that in medical malpractice cases, juries are
told not simply to determine if a doctor made a mistake, but if the
doctor's diagnosis was reasonable given his knowledge of a
patient's condition.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, a doctor doesn't ``have to be right, he
just has to be reasonably within the range of judgment that doctors
make in these cases.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Several of Turkey's veteran political leaders
are under growing pressure to resign after poor showings in
Sunday's national election.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations, if they come about, could reshape Turkish
politics, especially if they are accompanied by measures increasing
democracy within political parties.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's largest newspapers, Sabah, onm Tuesday
carried front-page photos of the center-right party leaders Tansu
Ciller and Mesut Yilmaz, both former prime ministers, and the
center-left leader Deniz Baykal, under a banner headline reading:
``Enough! The Nation Doesn't Want to See Any More of You!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop blocking Turkey's future,'' the newspaper said in a
front-page appeal to the three leaders. ``The voters have shown
that they do not want you or trust you. Recognize this and accept
the course of democracy. Please, for the love of God, leave
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper, Radikal, published a front page dominated by
photos of Ms. Ciller, Yilmaz and the leader of the
religious-oriented Virtue party, Recai Kutan. Above the photos a
headline demanded, ``What Are You Waiting For?''
</P>
<P>
   The Motherland and True Path parties led by Yilmaz and Ms.
Ciller won a total of 52 percent of the votes in the 1991 election.
They dropped to 40 percent in 1995 and barely 25 percent on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Baykal, the humiliation may have been even greater. His
People's Republican Party was established 75 years ago by the
revered founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Sunday it failed to take even the 10 percent of votes necessary to
qualify for representation in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   None of these leaders have made a public statement since Sunday,
but according to press reports all are considering quitting.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtue party finished in third place with 15 percent of the
vote, a sharp drop from the 21 percent and first-place finish
enjoyed by its predecessor, Welfare, in 1995. Its chairman, Kutan,
had predicted that his party would finish first, and pledged to
step down if it did not. Now, he appears to be reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   Young figures in the Virtue party are eager to depose Kutan and
his mostly elderly leadership team. They want to pull the party
away from its religious orientation and turn it into a
broader-based conservative force.
</P>
<P>
   These insurgents have remained largely silent until now, but
after their party's poor result Sunday they may decide to mount a
challenge. Virtue is to have a party congress later this year, and
if Kutan does not resign, the insurgents may seek to depose him
there.
</P>
<P>
   Party rebels, however, have a difficult challenge in Turkey.
Laws governing political parties are crafted to protect incumbent
party leaders. As a result, leaders often hold onto their posts for
years or even decades.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish voters in their 30s often complain that the country is
governed by a rotating clique of party leaders who were already in
power when they were children. Some dare to hope, however, that
Sunday's results may force at least a few of them from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``These leaders have been holding back the force of change here
for a long time, because they knew that if change came, they
wouldn't be able to manage it and would probably be swept away,''
said Kemal Koprulu, who heads a civic group that is campaigning for
political reform. ``Now, suddenly, a lot of people are saying that
the election laws and political party laws have to change. Things
are a lot different today than they were a couple of weeks ago, and
this is good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The election results may not look too positive at first, but
they show that a lot of votes in Turkey are roaming from one party
to another,'' Koprulu said. ``You can always get them to roam back
to the proper channel, but you have to create that channel. I think
we now have an excellent chance. In Turkey, things have to reach
the very bottom before they change, and we're pretty close to
that.''

ARIZONA SAVES MONEY BY TREATING, RATHER THAN JAILING, DRUG
OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona, the first state to begin treating all its nonviolent
drug offenders rather than locking them up, says its new policy of
diverting addicts from prison into treatment has already saved the
taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued Tuesday by the Arizona Supreme Court estimated
that the state's new program saved more than $2.5 million in its
first fiscal year of operation, which ended in June 1998, and looks
likely to reap greater savings in the future. The report determined
the savings by calculating the difference in cost between locking
up a prisoner and putting the prisoner on probation and in
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The results come as the nation's prisons and jails overflow with
1.8 million inmates, 400,000 of whom are addicted to drugs. The
White House's director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, has said he wants to reduce the prison population by
250,000 through promoting options for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   From California to Connecticut, many states now spend more on
prisons than on higher education, making the Arizona model a
conspicuous alternative to building more prisons for offenders who
committed drug-related crimes to support their habits. At the end
of 1998, New York had 22,386 drug felons incarcerated in its state
prisons at an annual cost of more than $700 million, according to
the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit group that
monitors prison sentencing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of 2,622 people on probation diverted into treatment in Arizona,
the report said said, 77.5 percent have subsequently tested free of
drugs, which is a significantly higher rate than for offenders on
probation in most other states. And 77.1 percent of Arizona drug
users on probation, who are expected to contribute to the cost of
their treatment, made at least one payment. Arizona has 25,000
people behind bars, a majority of whom have drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the drug courts springing up around the country, which
offer offenders treatment as an alternative to trial and a criminal
record, Arizona sentences drug offenders to treatment once they
have been convicted or plead guilty, but tailors the regimen to the
kind of drug dependency that the offender has.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona finances the treatment through a luxury tax levied on
alcohol sold in the state, with half of the revenue going to a
parents' commission to run drug prevention and treatment programs.
The $3.1 million in alcohol tax revenue used to treat offenders is
in addition to $3.2 million a year previously earmarked by the
state Legislature, said Barbara Broderick, the state director of
adult probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treatment works when it's done right,'' Ms. Broderick said in
a telephone interview from Phoenix. ``Early and meaningful
intervention probably has the best payback in making sure we are
safe'' from new crimes by addicts, she said. ``When I put treatment
with probation, it changes the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Broderick added, ``When we can't get someone to change,
we send them to prison. You can't continue to waste resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which Ms. Broderick edited, said that diverting drug
offenders into treatment saved Arizona $5,053,014 in prison costs
in the 1998 fiscal year. Deducting probation costs and other
expenses incurred by the Drug Treatment and Education Fund, the
program's formal name, the net saving was $2,563,062. The report
anticipated that the savings would increase in the current fiscal
year as more offenders were channeled into treatment or finished
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rudy Gerber of Arizona's Court of Appeals called the
state's new public health approach a welcome improvement over ``the
revolving-door experience of drug offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a turnstile,'' said Gerber, who has been hearing
cases of drug offenders in Arizona for 25 years. ``Many of us came
to the conclusion that we were parading them through the courts and
prisons without solving the root problem.'' Now, he said, an
offender convicted of possession of a modest amount of cocaine in
Arizona gets probation with mandatory treatment. ``The same guy in
the federal system is going to get a mandatory five-year
sentence,'' Gerber said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Supreme Court report said it costs $16.06 a day to
subject someone on probation to intensive supervision, including
drug treatment and counseling, compared with $50 a day to keep an
inmate in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Helber, the chief of adult probation for Maricopa County,
which has accounted for 56.6 percent of the arrests for drug sale
or possession in Arizona, said the new treatment approach ``has
been fantastic from the field perspective.'' He said Maricopa
County, which includes Phoenix, handles 39,000 people on probation
a year, many of whom have substance abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   Helber attributed the change in public opinion to the mounting
cost of locking up drug offenders: ``I thought it was extremely
wise of a broad base of taxpayers in an extremely conservative
state to say, we're not going to rely just on prisons anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment option was an element of Proposition 200, formally
called the Drug Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act, which
voters approved in November 1998 by 65 percent to 35 percent. The
state Legislature balked at enacting it, in part because the
referendum also endorsed the use of marijuana and other drugs for
medicinal purposes as long as two doctors prescribed it in writing.
The proposition was presented again last year to state voters, who
approved it again, this time by 57 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Blanchard, a former Arizona state legislator who is now
chief counsel for the White House's Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said that even before Arizona's program became law,
offenders convicted in the state of just possessing drugs were
rarely sent to prison, and that some offenders caught selling drugs
plea-bargained their sentences down to probation, as it happens in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   But the referendum made a sizable amount of money available for
drug treatment, Blanchard said. And mandating treatment, he said,
``caused decision makers to say now that prison isn't even an
option, so what do we do with the offenders? In the past, many of
these people would get lost in the probation system with nothing
really done.''

NATO DETAILS `KILLING FIELDS OF KOSOVO' ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four weeks into allied air strikes against
Yugoslavia, NATO officials Tuesday made the starkest accusations
yet of Serb troops conducting mass executions, gang rapes and
numerous other atrocities against ethnic Albanians in ``the killing
fields of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO report came as Serb forces expanded their aggression in
the Balkans, spreading their campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' into
the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, exchanging gunfire with the
Albanian Army along the Kosovo border, and sending 300 troops into
a demilitarized zone in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   As some senators raised the possibility of deploying US ground
forces to Kosovo, NATO authorities said the Serbian ``crimes
against humanity'' include forcing as many as 700 teenage boys to
act as human shields or ``blood banks for Serb casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, citing reports ``too numerous'' to
ignore of war crimes in Kosovo, said, ``All this means that the
killing fields of Kosovo are going to be on our minds for many
years to come, as we try to piece the full story together and
ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allegations of atrocities are based largely on military
intelligence reports and accounts from ethnic Albanian refugees.
International authorities are expected to fully investigate the
allegations when the hostilities end.
</P>
<P>
   As Serb forces appeared intent on widening the conflict beyond
Kosovo, Albanian President Rexhap Meidani said in an interview with
the Globe that officials in Albania are trying to ``keep our cool''
so as not to escalate the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   These other developments unfolded as the NATO attack against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces entered a fifth
week:
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton, meeting with former German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, reiterated his commitment ``to defeat the cynical
vision embodied by Mr. Milosevic in which the most primitive
hatreds and brutal oppression are more important than mutual
respect and common progress.''
</P>
<P>
   _ With NATO expected to weigh the possible use of ground troops
during its 50th anniversary summit starting Friday in Washington,
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said the Pentagon could ``rather
quickly'' send American ground forces to Kosovo if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic was quoted on Wednesday
as saying he had rejected a Yugoslav army order to place his
republic's police force under military command. ``It is out of the
question that the Ministry of the Interior could be subordinated to
the Yugoslav army,'' Djukanovic told the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texaco Inc. said it will halt shipments of gasoline to
Yugoslavia after admitting it made such a shipment on April 10,
nearly three weeks after the air war began. A company spokesman
said Texaco had received assurances that the gasoline would be used
only within Montenegro, which has said it is neutral in the current
conflict. However, the Texaco spokesman said the company will not
be making any further shipments there under an existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair said NATO has destroyed half
of Yugoslavia's best fighter jets, MiG-29s; 25 percent of its
MiG-21s; and 30 percent of its Super Galebs, which have been used
to attack ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair said NATO is unable to immediately help tens of
thousands of homeless ethnic Albanians who are hiding in the
mountains and forests of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO spokesman, Shea, said Serb forces are shelling many of
the homeless refugees who are hiding in Kosovo, forcing them into
the open, then marching them toward the border. ``What we are
seeing as we study these movements of people is a kind of safari
operation ongoing by the Serb security forces against the Kosovar
Albanians,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies said they have lost track of more than 100,000
Kosovars who were seen heading for the Albanian border on Saturday.
Only about 100 of the refugees reached the border.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon said muddy conditions in Albania have
delayed the arrival of 24 Apache helicopters that are expected to
significantly bolster the NATO attack on Serb ground forces in
Kosovo. Barring additional rain, the gunships should arrive by the
end of the week, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, NATO carried out daylight bombing raids on strategic
Serb military positions throughout Kosovo and continued striking
sites in Serbia Tuesday night with cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Russian diplomats met with leaders of several Islamic
nations, seeking a plan to end the hostilities in the Balkans. But
they reported no breakthrough in Russia's continuing effort to
mediate a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who met with Patriarch Alexiy II, the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, said on Yugoslav national television that
Russia will ``contribute to establishing peace as soon as possible
and to halting this aggression that is not grounded in a single
moral, legal or any other principle.''
</P>
<P>
   An Albanian hospital near the border with Kosovo reported that
two members of the Kosovo Liberation Army were killed and 13 others
were wounded after clashing with Serb forces in the region. The
KLA's Kosova Press agency reported that three of the army's ``high
officers'' were killed in the fighting that left ``many dead and
injured, especially on the side of our enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the injured KLA members were treated, Meidani, the Albanian
president, rejected the rebel group's plea for ammunition and arms
from the Albanian military. ``It is not possible,'' Meidani said.
``The problem is how to help the civilians inside Kososo, in the
mountains and in the forests. They have other channels to get
arms,'' he said of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Meidani said supplying the KLA not only would be strategically
difficult because of Serb land mines and troops along the border,
but it could be politically dangerous. He said the arms transfer
would ``be used like propaganda'' by Milosevic, who has tried to
demonize Albania as a NATO pawn.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Shea detailed allegations of
Serb atrocities in Kosovo. In recent days, he said, NATO
conservatively estimates that 3,500 ethnic Albanians have been
slain in mass executions throughout the province. About 100 adult
males ``were summarily shot dead at point-blank range'' in one
village, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Without providing the number of victims, Shea alleged that
ethnic Albanian women have suffered gang rapes in their homes and
on the roadsides. He said the women have been separated from their
families and sent to Serb army camps, where they have been raped,
and were rounded up and taken to a hotel, ``where the local
commander apparently has organized a roster of his soldiers to
allow them all an evening at the hotel.'' He also said they have
been raped at factories, ``where some hundred women remain.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO also reported that Serb troops have forced ethnic Albanian
men to dig defensive positions for Milosevic's army in Kosovo.
Other men were forced to stand in front of tanks in the rain for
two days with their hands tied behind their heads, Shea said. He
said a few of the men escaped after paying the soldiers 10,000
deutschemarks, the equivalent of $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO denounced the Serb practice of herding tens of
thousands of homeless Kosovars toward the Albanian border, then
stalling them until so many have gathered that they create chaos
when they eventually reach refugee camps on the other side. ``It's
extremely depressing that human beings are used as pawns on this
type of macabre and rather Machiavellian chess board,'' Shea said.

MARKET PLACE: NO NEED FOR MAJOR CONCERN ON INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,
is likely to jump this year, from the exceedingly comfortable 1.6
percent of last year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would not constitute a surge. But the rate of increase has
shrunk for three straight years. And in annual terms, the inflation
rate has risen only twice in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   If oil prices continue to gather steam, though, the monthly data
could even prompt headlines about inflation rising at an annual
rate approaching 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that such numbers might upset the stock and bond
markets on the days they are reported led Abby Joseph Cohen,
co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co., to warn her clients recently that investors in the coming
months should be wary of the ``noise'' in the CPI and the related
Producer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no reason to worry too much about these numbers.
The main culprit is higher oil prices, and the inflation
projections are based on the assumption that these prices will
stick, not a sure thing. Even if they do, neither the Federal
Reserve nor the bond market will get too upset if that's the only
problem, as it is not considered big enough to alter the long-term
outlook for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress in February
that several one-time factors that depressed inflation in 1998 _
including low oil prices _ would not be present this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``recent experience does seem to suggest that
the economy has become less inflation-prone than in the past, so
that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at least
for now, less than they would have been under similar conditions in
earlier cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   The March consumer price data seemed to prove him right.
Although the energy index jumped 1.6 percent _ its first increase
since October _ the overall index rose just 02. percent, resulting
in a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 percent for the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another positive sign: other commodity prices remain generally
low. Though the Bridge/Commodity Research Bureau index of 17
commodities has jumped 4 percent from the 24-year low it set at the
end of February, the index is virtually unchanged for the year _
even with oil included.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, which have added to their gains in the last week,
are up 48 percent this year, and scrap metal prices have risen 3
percent. But the prices of raw industrial materials are down 2.6
percent and food prices are off 4.7percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices paid for imports have also slumped, in part because of
the growing strength of the dollar this year, a rally many
forecasters did not expect. In March, prices of imports other than
fuel fell four-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest decline in seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising gains in worker productivity, especially this late in
an economic cycle, are also restraining inflation by partly
offsetting the increase in wages. And the pace of wage increases
themselves, despite the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years, is
slowing.
</P>
<P>
   All these positive forces have led many forecasters to dismiss
concerns about a change in the inflationary climate, even if rising
oil prices push the overall number on the CPI higher. In fact, a
move toward 2 percent would only bring the index in line with the
``core CPI,'' the index without the volatile food and energy
components. Last year, this core index rose 2.3 percent from 1997.
So the only element being lost is the extra bit of help that the
CPI got last year from plunging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market seems to share that view. Investors did push
interest rates sharply higher in January when it became clear that
1999 economic growth would be much stronger than had been expected.
But by the time oil prices began to take off in late February, the
yield on the 30-year bond had already surged to 5.70 percent. And
now with the price of a barrel of oil just shy of $18, the yield on
the 30-year bond has retreated to 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In their February meeting, Fed policy-makers said that ``a
somewhat less favorable inflation performance was viewed as likely
over the year ahead,'' according to minutes of the meeting. But
they concluded that this would not result in ``any substantial
deterioration in the inflation climate.''
</P>
<P>
   What could alter the climate? Oil prices could keep rising. But
more threatening would be a revival in other commodity prices. That
would signal a significant rebound in world economic growth, which
in turn would increase wage and inflationary pressures here.
</P>
<P>
   But it's too early to worry.

 &HT;    Lawyers in Texas dragging death want change of venue
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Capital murder suspect Lawrence Russell Brewer's
defense attorney claims the county's ``vested interest'' in the
outcome of the trial warrants moving Brewer's day in court out of
Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, a 32-year-old Sulphur Springs, Texas native, will go on
trial May 17 for the dragging murder of James Byrd Jr. on June 7,
1998. John William King in February was convicted and sentenced to
death, while third suspect Shawn Berry of Jasper awaits trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Doug Barlow on Tuesday presented reams of
newspaper articles and 11 hours of news reports as evidence of the
media saturation the killing and trial have received. He also
expressed concerns over the jury pool of 25,000 Jasper County
residents available for the trial, but his main point of contention
was the possible motive of local jurors to repair the county's
``tarnished'' image with guilty verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Jasper County is the only county in the state
with a vested interest in the outcome of these trials,'' he said.
``The people believe their reputation and image to the entire world
rest on these cases. The headlines have said the (King) verdict
pleases the community.''
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Monte Lawlis is expected to rule on the
change of venue motion on Thursday. Barlow has suggested Beaumont
as a possible location, but said he has considered Lufkin,
Nacogdoches and other East Texas sites if the venue should be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicity is not the thing we are trying to avoid,'' he said,
pointing to ``compelling'' evidence that local residents would be
affected by increased taxes due to the trials and other issues.
``If this does not set the standard (for a change of venue), there
is no standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow presented one witness, a Beaumont advertising executive,
while District Attorney Guy James Gray called seven people to the
stand to refute the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he proved facts to have it changed,'' Gray said.
``We tried to factually prove we can get a fair jury here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray called to the stand Jasper County Judge Joe Folk, Sheriff
Billy Rowles, two county commissioners and other county officials
in an effort to establish the county's ability to assemble an
impartial jury. Rowles said the venue should be changed only if
``our jury panel dwindles to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Lawlis expected to send out 500 summonses, with as
many as 200 expected to respond to the jury call.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, wearing a white button-up shirt over the electronic stun
belt around his waist, shared a lengthy hug in the courtroom with
his brother John Brewer, girlfriend Tammy Perritt and friend Kara
Pruitt. He held a handwritten sign upon entering the Jasper County
Courthouse on Tuesday morning, wishing ``all mothers a happy
Mother's Day.''

PATRIOTS TALKING TO ALLEN'S AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Terry Allen may not be what he once was, but
he might be good enough to be the Patriots' feature back for a year
or two until second-round pick Kevin Faulk can take the job.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 31, was released by the Washington Redskins Monday, and
the Patriots have already been in contact with his agent.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have much money to spend after signing Larry Whigham
(four years, $4 million, $650,000 signing bonus), Lamont Warren
(five years, $5 million, $500,000 signing bonus), and John Friesz
(two years, $1.5 million, which hasn't been filed with the league
officially), but if they can get Allen cheap, they likely will take
the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Allen was rushing for 1,200-1,300 yards a season
in the mid '90s. He has had several knee surgeries but may be able
to give New England 700-1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did sign 10 rookie free agents Tuesday, including
four defensive linemen, addressing a need that they didn't on draft
day. Backup help is needed after the departure of Ferric Collons
and Mark Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Those signed were Florida defensive end Willie Cohens, Illinois
defensive tackle Garrett Johnson, Tulsa defensive end Tim Martin,
Central Michigan defensive tackle Jonathan McCall, Auburn
cornerback Jayson Bray, Boston College guard Daniel Collins,
Florida receiver Nafis Karim, Auburn offensive tackle Kendell Mack,
North Carolina State tight end Devon Smith, and Ohio State tight
end John Lumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Cohens, 6 feet 3 inches, 265 pounds, had knee surgery in '98 but
still started 10 games. He's considered a good pass rusher, with 5
1/2 sacks in '97 and 2 1/2 last year. Johnson, 6-3, 300 pounds,
sacked the quarterback 5 1/2 times last year and is considered
someone who plays more on adrenaline than talent. McCall, 6-2, 270,
seems to be a classic tweener: too small for tackle, not quick
enough for end, and an underachiever. He did have nine sacks and 13
tackles for losses.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has had an injury-filled career and has spent much of it
as a defensive end. The 6-4, 245-pounder caught 12 passes for 146
yards in nine starts last year. Lumpkin, at 6-7, 262, is a former
Buckeye basketball player, and caught 31 passes the past two years.

 &HT;    Schott's real offense was not fitting in
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She fought the good old boys club, and the good
old boys club won.
</P>
<P>
   I will never defend the dumb things Marge Schott said. But the
last time I looked, there wasn't any rule against saying dumb
things.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she was pushed out of baseball for those and
another offense, something about fudging numbers at her former car
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was apparently much worse than George
Steinbrenner's illegal contributions to the Richard Nixon campaign
_ a federal offense _ so baseball's leadership pursued Schott as if
she were Bonnie of Bonnie &AMP; Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   And they got her.
</P>
<P>
   They made her sell her controlling interest in the Reds. And
soon they'll probably change the locks on the offices at the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I think her real offense was being a dowdy, old
woman who didn't fit into the new corporate image of baseball. She
wasn't the multi-billionaire Tribune Co., or the multi-billionaire
News Corp. or the multi-billionaire Disney Co., so she was
expendable.
</P>
<P>
   They pushed her, and she was too old and too infirm to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, guys. Well done.
</P>
<P>
   So a new era in Reds history begins, and I'm not so sure you're
going to like it. This much I'll assure you: It will cost you more
to go to a game: More for tickets, more for food, more for parking,
more for souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   More to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   All this won't happen tomorrow, but it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   We have just witnessed the demise of the last owner who not only
cared about putting a presentable team on the field, but also cared
_ not just lip service _ but cared about the well-being of the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Wait 'til you see the prices in the new park. You'll be
screaming for Marge and her dog and her eccentricities.
</P>
<P>
   Her reputation was that she didn't know what she was doing, that
she couldn't tell a hit-and-run from a squeeze play, that she was a
cartoon character with a slobbering dog.
</P>
<P>
   All of which was true.
</P>
<P>
   Also true: She never understood the need for scouts because
``All they do is watch games;'' she once named Kansas City as one
of the Reds main threats; and she actually believed her dog's hair
had more to do with the team's success or failure than the players.
</P>
<P>
   But in Schott's 13-year tenure as general partner of the Reds,
her team had an average finish better than every other team
currently in the National League Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Was that just luck?
</P>
<P>
   Or was she smarter than the rest of them?
</P>
<P>
   She kept hiring competent people; albeit after she had fired
other competent people.
</P>
<P>
   When her general manager asked her to open her checkbook and
sign a big-buck player, she did. But then she took grief for
counting staples.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in these pages, you'll find a ``chronology'' of
Schott's reign of terror and error. I wouldn't do or say any of it,
but you must realize she was and is a product of her upbringing.
Many people are able to break those ties, but she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Her people skills _ at least in dealing with employees _ were
straight out of a Dickens' novel. The people she didn't fire, she
bullied.
</P>
<P>
   She was so cheap, she squeaked when she walked.
</P>
<P>
   If not racist in her heart, she was certainly racist with her
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Should any of that disqualify her from owning a baseball team?
</P>
<P>
   It did in this man's game.

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Nadia Comenici was 16 when she achieved
international fame. Olga Korbut also was a teen-ager. No one on the
1996 U.S. Olympic gymnastics team was older than 19. Dominique
Moceanu was 14, Kerri Strug 17.
</P>

   Elite gymnasts often are young, but UCLA's Heidi Moneymaker _
considered old at 21 _ will try the unorthodox strategy of using
college as a springboard to the national team.

   But first things first. Moneymaker is the reigning NCAA champion
in the uneven parallel bars. She will defend her title, try to
capture other individual honors and lead her team to its second
NCAA team championship in the meet that begins Thursday in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Most elite gymnasts are between 14 and 16 and use college to
wind down their careers.

<P>
   It's a long shot, to be sure. Twenty-one-year-old women standing
5-feet-2 aren't usually physiologically able to perform routines as
well as the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you change your center of gravity, and things grow where
they didn't before, it takes some getting used to,'' fellow UCLA
gymnast Lena Degteva said.
</P>
<P>
   In Moneymaker's favor is U.S. Gymnastics raising the minimum
competing age to 16 for the 2000 Olympics. But since she wasn't on
the international scene when she was younger, no one has heard of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the belief that older women can't compete at the
elite level. But in a sport which seems to give advantage the
young, Moneymaker is showing age and development has its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heidi has, genetically, the bod that will be able to do
gymnastics for a long time,'' UCLA coach Valerie Kondos said. ``If
they can perform the skills, the judges appreciate the maturity an
older gymnast brings.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moneymaker's case, she lacked the poise and confidence to
execute her routines when she was 16. She wasn't interested in
pursuing a career in gymnastics growing up in Northern Calfifornia,
practicing only four hours a day, half of what the elite gymnasts
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when she competed, her body tensed up. Moneymaker suffered
from the same mental block many athletes have: they can nail
routines in practice but can't come through in big meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would get very tense and tight,'' Kondos said. ``Now we
try and focus that energy through breathing and visualizing so she
can let go in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even tendinitis in her shoulder is stopping Moneymaker,
although she said it will impede her chances of repeating as bars
champion. The vault might be the event she wins this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is stopping her,'' Degteva said. ``I know she loves
doing it more than anyone else I know.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has scrapped a long-scheduled
slate of formalities to make way for a three-hour meeting with NATO
leaders Friday to try to forge a plan for seizing the initiative in
the alliance's troubled air war with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials conceded Tuesday that a month of air strikes have
not halted Serb atrocities inside the embattled province of Kosovo,
amid signs that the repression has begun to spill over into
neighboring Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top national security officials insisted that NATO
intends to continue its strategy of steadily escalating air strikes
combined with whatever diplomatic pressure it might bring to bear
on the regime of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, the president
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing contingent of NATO ground troops in the region,
however, and two dozen Apache combat helicopters expected in
Albania over the next two days, Clinton's National Security
Adviser, Samuel E. Berger said the leaders of the 19-nation
alliance would discuss ``the full range of issues,'' surrounding
the conflict when they meet on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a working meeting of a military alliance
in the middle of a conflict,'' Berger told reporters at the White
House. ``I am confident that NATO can, must and will achieve its
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The heads of state from the 19 NATO countries, as well as 25
NATO partners, have been invited to Washington this weekend to mark
the 50th anniversary of the transatlantic alliance, created in
April, 1949. What was to be a celebratory -- and largely
perfunctory -- summit, however, has turned into something very
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a council of war,'' said Robert Hunter, former U.S.
ambassador to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials showed fresh evidence of the air
campaign's daily toll on Serbian military and paramilitary forces
in Kosovo: another dozen tanks and troop trucks destroyed, another
pair of bridges dropped, a highway overpass bombed to ruin, several
ammunition dumps blasted and more MiG-21 fighters shattered to
wreckage by laser guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is signs that we're grinding them down,''
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon. ``But it's slow and it
will require a lot more attacking on our part and NATO is prepared
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the air campaign gathered steam -- U.S. and allied
pilots flew 603 combat sorties during the 24-hour period that ended
early Tuesday, in one of the highest levels since the bombing runs
began March 24 -- NATO was working toward expanding its armada of
warplanes. The Pentagon is reviewing a request by U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, for 300 additional combat planes,
refueling tankers and other support craft, which would push the
NATO force to more than 1,000 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Romania -- a formal NATO partner but not a full member -- agreed
in principle to permit alliance warplanes to use its air space and
neighboring Bulgaria, a partner as well, was weighing a similar
request. Those developments would provide new avenues of approach
for NATO warplanes attacking Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, though, haven't stopped Serbian forces on the
ground from pressing their campaign of repression targeting ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo province. NATO officials said Serbs
continued as late as Tuesday to compile a long and growing list of
offenses ranging from mass executions and systematic rape to the
shelling of civilians and the burning of entire villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea confirmed
earlier allegations of Serbian paramilitary activity along Kosovo's
short border with Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces reportedly cleared at least three border
communities of ethnic Albanians over the past two days. Montenegro,
which has its own internal tensions between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, is the other state, along with Serbia, remaining in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said he could not confirm reports of Serbian incursions
into neighboring Croatia -- site of four years of war between Serbs
and Croats that ended as part of the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995.
Bacon warned that Serbian attacks in that region would be regarded
as ``an affront'' to the United Nations, which established a
demilitarized zone as a buffer between Croats and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a problem that the U.N. and members of the
Security Council would have to deal with,'' said Bacon.

 &HT;    Governor ready to sign school violence legislation
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio - Gov. Bob Taft is poised to sign legislation
aimed at curbing violence at Ohio's schools after the House and
Senate reached final agreement on the bill on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is glad that they were able to move on it in such a timely
manner,'' said Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman. A date for signing
the bill has not been set, said Milburn.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn said the bill's passage on the same day school violence
flared in the Denver suburb of Littleton pointed up its importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the point that if students are going to learn to the
best of their ability, they have to feel that their school is a
safe haven,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The school safety legislation, Senate Bill 1, is the second of
Taft's education initiatives to win legislative approval. The
governor last month signed into law House Bill 1 establishing the
OhioReads program, aimed at assuring that every fourth grader can
read at grade level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is equally important to provide a safe learning environment
as it is to teach them to read,'' Rep. Charles Braiding, chairman
of the House Education Committee, said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety bill would add two years to prison terms for crimes
such as assault, burglary, breaking and entering when they are
committed in school ``safety zones.'' The zones include school
grounds, school buses and school activities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the bill would empower school authorities to expel
students for up to a year for knife- and gun-related offenses that
occur at school-sponsored events off school property.
</P>
<P>
   It also permits expelling a student for up to a year for
inflicting serious physical harm on other persons or property
within the school safety zone. The maximum expulsion now is 80
days.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 93-1 for the bill Tuesday after making minor
changes to the version approved earlier by the Senate. The Senate
concurred with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray Miller, D-Columbus, cast the only vote against the
legislation, saying some punishments are too stiff and will simply
put more students on the streets and eventually in prisons. Under
the bill, a student could be expelled for a year for busting a
classmate`s nose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to far,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   House approval of the legislation came after members set aside
an amendment by Rep. Ron Hood, R-Canfield, that would have
incorporated Hood's legislation permitting Ohioans to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joy Padgett, R-Coshocton, sponsor of a competing bill to
permit the carrying of concealed weapons, successfully proposed
tabling Hood's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the place and this is not the time,'' said
Padgett.

 Learning To Sell Online
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am constructing a Web site for E-tailing my products
but know little about the subject. Are there specific associations
or publications available for small-business owners to learn the
protocol for doing business on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You might start out with ``Selling Online for
Dummies,'' (IDG Books, $24.99). Author Leslie Heeter Lundquist
concedes that new versions of specific products like Microsoft's
FrontPage software for creating Web pages may have come out since
her book was published last year. But information on getting a
domain name, setting up a Web server, creating content and
accepting payments is current.
</P>
<P>
   Lundquist was talking yesterday to U.S. Department of Commerce
officials about establishing a central clearing house to tell
small- and medium-size businesses how to conduct business on the
Web. But so far, there is no such location.
</P>
<P>
   She also suggests other information sources:
</P>
<P>
   _E-Business Advisor magazine ( &LR; www.advisor.com &LR; ) provides
articles, tips, product news and conference schedules.
</P>
<P>
   _Internet World ( &LR; www.internetworld.com &LR; ) provides plenty of
e-commerce info and tech talk.
</P>
<P>
   _CommerceNet, a Palo alto nonprofit organization that
evangelizes online commerce ( &LR; www.commerce.net &LR; ) has a full range
of information including book listings and answers to common
questions.
</P>
<P>
   _The Center for Software Development in San Jose
( &LR; www.center.org &LR; ) provides information about e-commerce, seminars
and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace Bind
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I work for a small manufacturing company that sells to
catalog companies, large department and chain stores, and smaller
retailers. We are considering getting into e-commerce but are
worried about competing with our clients for retail business. Do
you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Competing with your customers can be tricky, but Lundquist
has some suggestions to ease possible tensions:
</P>
<P>
   You might sell different products online. For example, Gibson
Musical Instruments sells new guitars though stores but has a very
successful online site ( &LR; www.gibson.com &LR; ) that sells guitar
accessories and has an online auction for used guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Another way not to undercut your wholesale customers might be to
bundle products like travel agents who provide air and hotel travel
packages. That way you are not competing by selling precisely the
same products.
</P>
<P>
   You might also contact your traditional customers and brainstorm
ways to work together. Perhaps you could sell the same items they
do, and even charge a lower price, if you help the stores out by
providing them banner ads or other promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination Crisis
</P>
<P>
   Q:I have a good job but I'd really like to start my own
business. I'm told, though, that you need to be a self-starter. I
have had a lifelong problem with procrastination. Should I forget
about self-employment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why not put off worrying about this until later. Seriously,
before you make the leap to self-employment, you might want to deal
with your procrastination problem on someone else's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland career counselor and author Marty Nemko suggests trying
one or more of these techniques to see if you can control your
propensity to put things off at your job:
</P>
<P>
   _If you are paralyzed because a task seems too big, ask
yourself: What is the next 10-second task you need to do, like
calling a supplier. That might be enough to get you rolling.
</P>
<P>
   _Allow no more than 60 seconds to struggle with a stumbling
block. Find a way around it, seek help or proceed to the next task.
</P>
<P>
   _Break a big problem into tiny tasks. For example, if you own a
small business and desperately need 20 new customers or you'll go
broke, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Instead, look up the phone
number of your best prospect and dial.
</P>
<P>
   _Realize that your excuses for putting off a task are bogus.
</P>
<P>
   To the hedonist who says ``Doing the work is painful; I always
find something I'd rather do,'' Nemko responds, ``Procrastination
is like a credit card: fun when you use it, painful when the bill
comes in.'' If you truly like pleasure more than pain, get your
work done efficiently so maximum time is left for pleasure, without
guilt or negative consequences to spoil the fun.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the ``fear-of-failure'' excuse is if you don't
try, you're guaranteed failure.
</P>
<P>
   _Try the Scarlet Letter technique. Write the letter ``P'' (for
procrastination) on your palm. This procrasti-cure may sound hokey,
but Nemko says this ongoing reminder helps some people from sliding
back into old habits.
</P>
<P>
   _Realize that sometimes procrastination is a sign that you
 &LR; shouldn't  &LR; be doing the task. How can you tell? Write the
advantages and disadvantages of doing it. Then decide.

 Microsoft Earnings Leap 43%
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp.'s net income jumped 43 percent for the third
quarter behind strong demand for its Windows NT corporate server
software and Office business programs.
</P>
<P>
   As the leading maker of personal computer software, Microsoft is
considered a bellwether for the technology sector. Its results,
which were posted after the market closed, came on a day when tech
stocks rebounded from a steep drop on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which said it benefited from rebounding sales in
Japan, posted net income of $1.92 billion (35 cents per share) for
the quarter ended March 31. That compared with income of $1.34
billion (25 cents) for the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 15 percent to $4.33 billion. Microsoft's earnings
beat the average estimate of 32 cents per share of analysts
surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with stock analysts, Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer Greg Maffei was typically cautious about revenue
growth in the next two quarters, warning as he has in the past that
the Year 2000 computer problem may delay corporate spending on
computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the evidence is anecdotal, but it appears several
large organizations are delaying projects,'' Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maffei also said he expects revenues to increase by
more than $500 million by the end of calendar year 1999 as
Y2K-budget restrictions ease. Also, he noted Microsoft will see
increased revenues from the release of Office 2000, expected to be
available in stores June 10.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter results did not include about $400 million in
revenue from pre-release sales of an Office 2000 upgrade. That
revenue will be deferred through the following quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing of Windows NT Workstation to computer manufacturers
led to a 26 percent increase, to $2.05 billion, in Microsoft's
platform product revenues. Microsoft also saw increases in
licensing of its SQL Server and Exchange Server products.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there were jitters during the quarter, the PC market
seemed to remain fundamentally healthy,'' Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   North American sales growth was moderate, but Maffei said sales
increased 22 percent in Asia during the quarter, particularly in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Microsoft benefited from a drop in PC prices
because demand for its operating software remained steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price wars are good for Microsoft,'' said Mike Stanek, an
analyst at Lehman Brothers, told Bloomberg News. ``They get their
bounty for each box, regardless of what's being charged.''
</P>
<P>
   And continued growth in sales of Microsoft's corporate products
like NT Workstation and SQL Server 7.0 are a good ``hedge'' against
any slowdown in PC sales because those products generate twice as
much profit as Windows 98, said William Epifinio, an analyst with
J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a solid performance and it was certainly nice to see
that Japan was a source of improved growth,'' Epifinio said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were released after the close of trading on Nasdaq,
where Microsoft stock closed at $83.13, up $2.13. In after-hours
trading, shares of Microsoft were at $82.12.

 EBay Delays IPO, Will Buy BabyCenter
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Web retailer eToys Inc. postponed its initial stock sale yesterday
after agreeing to acquire San Francisco's BabyCenter Inc., which
sells infant goods on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   EToys, a Santa Monica online seller of toys _ which gained
national exposure in a series of Visa TV ads last Christmas _ will
give BabyCenter shareholders a 15 percent stake in the combined
company. After the IPO, that stake could be worth $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of eToys and BabyCenter ``is a natural fit for
target marketing of consumers from womb to infant to toddler to
adolescent,'' said Ron Rappaport, analyst at Zona Research in
Redwood City. ``You'll be able to buy everything from Chewbacca
bibs to Beanie Babies jumpers to Sony PlayStations.''
</P>
<P>
   EToys had planned to sell 8.2 million shares at $10 to $12 in an
initial public offering this week. The sale, which could have
raised up to $98.4 million, will be delayed until an undetermined
date, according to Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which is handling the
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-person company eventually intends to sell more than 100
million shares, giving it a market value in excess of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers typically require a new filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission before an IPO can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter co-founder Mark Selcow and an eToys spokeswoman, both
citing the pending IPO, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But one analyst said the merged company ``adds fuel to the
fire'' of eToys' forthcoming stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It already was one of the most highly anticipated IPOs in a
maelstrom of online ventures,'' Rappaport said. ``Everyone is
treating eToys as the biggest thing since Amazon.com and eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   EToys recorded an elevenfold jump in sales, to $22 million,
during its fourth quarter, ended December 31, from the previous
quarter. In the three-month period ended September 30, the firm
logged $2 million in revenues, largely from the online sale of
Barbie dolls, Legos, Fisher-Price toys and other brand-name toys.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter had just under $5 million in maternity and baby
product sales last year. Sources said the company is in the process
of moving to a larger office, at Fifth and Bryant streets, and
beefing up its 110-person staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wean customers on BabyCenter, who then graduate to eToys.
Who knows, maybe they'll buy Wedding.com next and extend their
e-commerce site to the pre-birth market,'' said Ken Cassar, digital
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the online market for toys and infant goods will
suffice. Cassar estimates toy-related sales online will top $500
million in the United States by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic baby goods market, meanwhile, is $18 billion. U.S.
parents spend on average about $7,100 in their child's first year,
according to BabyCenter officials.

 Intel Speech Online Dispute Comes to Head Soon
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In a case seen as having broad First Amendment implications for
speech online, a state court judge will rule next week in a dispute
between Intel Corp. and a former employee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel initially sought monetary damages from the former
employee, Ken Hamidi, the company is now seeking only to make
Hamidi stop sending his mass e-mails to thousands of Intel
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In asking Sacramento Superior Court Judge John R. Lewis for a
ruling of summary judgment _ which would end the case without a
trial _ Intel on Monday said it sought only to charge Hamidi with
trespassing, not with creating a nuisance, as it had earlier
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi, 51, is a former engineer from Intel's Folsom plant who,
in his bitterness over losing a workers' compensation battle, began
sending bulk e-mail to thousands of Intel employees, saying Intel
lies and mistreats its workers. Intel warned him to stop, and when
he didn't, filed suit, saying he was trespassing by using the
company's internal network to communicate with employees. In
November, Lewis issued an injunction ordering Hamidi to stop
e-mailing Intel employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi sees the case as a fight over his right to free speech.
Groups ranging from San Francisco's Electronic Frontier Foundation
to the Harvard Law Review agree.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has said the Internet is a public forum
where free speech is protected, said Bill McSwain, an editor at the
law review. ``If Hamidi was standing in a public park and pointing
a megaphone into Intel's building, they couldn't shut him up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel doesn't view the case as having anything to do with
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not freedom of speech. It is trespass,'' said Intel
spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy cited numerous cases of Hamidi exercising free speech
without any Intel opposition: ``Hamidi has done mailings and flyers
to universities where we recruit. He's demonstrated at Intel sites.
He has exercised his freedom of speech to an amazing level. He's
been very persistent. Where we believe he crosses the line is the
e-mail, which we believe is equivalent to demonstrating in the
hallways of our building.''
</P>
<P>
   That point is still in contention. Shari Steele, an attorney
with EFF, said, ``The definition of a trespass should be a physical
intrusion, not just someone sending me a message I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamidi hasn't sent any e-mails since the November injunction. He
maintains a Web site critical of Intel at  &LR; www.faceintel.com.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to challenge the injunction,'' he said yesterday. ``I
would like to start sending e-mail to inform and educate those
Intel employees so they don't get victimized like I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest development, Intel said it dropped its request for
damages to expedite the case.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge grants Intel's motion for summary judgment next
week, then Hamidi will likely appeal. If the judge denies Intel's
motion, then the case is set for trial in July.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping its request for damages, Intel not only eliminated
the spectacle of a company with $6.1 billion in profits last year
seeking money from a bankrupt ex-employee, it also did away with
the prospect of a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Because Intel and Hamidi agree on the facts _ that Hamidi sent
the e-mails _ the only issue for the judge to decide is whether
that action broke the law. Hamidi's lawyer said not having a jury
could benefit Intel, as a jury might be more sympathetic to the
little guy taking on a big corporation.

MICROSOFT EARNINGS BEAT ANALYSTS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday again beat analysts
expectations with quarterly earnings 43 percent above those of a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly on the strength of continued strong sales of its Windows
operating systems and Office software in the quarter ended March
31, the company said Tuesday it had net income of $1.92 billion or
35 cents per diluted share, compared with $1.34 billion for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues totaled $4.33 billion, a 15 percent increase over last
year's $3.77 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts surveyed had predicted earnings per share of 32
cents, according to CBS MarketWatch. But the company, while warning
to the contrary, regularly has beat earnings estimates by 2 or 3
cents.
</P>
<P>
   So analysts were not expecting stock prices to surge when the
market reopens Wednesday. The earnings were reported after the end
of trading Tuesday, when Microsoft stock closed at $83.13, up
$2.13. It lost another dollar, falling to $82.13, in after-hours
trading, reflecting investors sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very respectable numbers,'' said Tom Hensel, vice
president of research at Everen Securities in Chicago. ``People
have to realize not every quarter is going to be a blowout for
Microsoft.'' Many past quarters have been characterized by even
higher revenues and earnings per share, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a pretty good quarter,'' echoed Scott
McAdams, president of Seattle brokerage McAdams Wright Ragen. ``I
wouldn't say it was a blowout quarter, so I don't see the stock
spiking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleased by the results, top executives at the Redmond,
Wash-based software giant said they anticipate similar numbers for
the current quarter. But chief financial officer Greg Maffei warned
that corporations delaying software projects so they can focus on
the Y2K issue may lead to a slowdown between now and the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate concerns that computers will malfunction when the year
2000 arrives, because the year 00 will confuse computers, are
diverting dollars and attention away from purchases of new
software, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread concern that the personal computer market is
declining appear to be misplaced, he said. Microsoft's revenues
from sales of operating system software to PC vendors grew 29
percent compared with the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter's growth was driven primarily by continued migration
to the Windows NT operating system, demand for the Office suite of
business applications despite an upgrade set for release in
mid-June, and strong sales of SQL Server 7, a much improved version
of Microsoft's industrial-strength database manager. SQL Server 7
shipments increased 50 percent over the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter also saw the announcement of BizTalk, which put
forth Microsoft's product strategy for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Microsoft's Asian revenues increased 22 percent over
the same period last year, to $475 million, largely on the strength
of Office sales. ``We're cautiously optimistic that maybe we're
starting to turn the corner'' in Asia, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   Key milestones in the current quarter include the shipment of
the third and final beta, or experimental, version of Windows 2000,
which will succeed Windows NT 4.0. Carla Lewis, Microsoft senior
director of investor relations, called it ``a reasonably held
industry hope'' that the operating system will ship by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the last three consecutive quarters, Microsoft has
turned in earnings per share that are at a minimum 20 percent
higher than the prior year's equivalents. Earnings per share,
adjusted for dilution, have also increased each quarter over the
past year, from 25 cents per share, except that EPS for the quarter
just ended were 1 cent less than those for the prior quarter.

FEARS GROW THAT REFUGEES ARE BEING BLOCKED FROM LEAVING KOSOVO

   LOJAN, Macedonia _ For the second day, only a few refugees
trickled through official border crossings from Kosovo while
thousands more, reporting attacks around the town of Gnjilane,
crossed at other points.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 refugees from the Gnjilane area walked into the tiny
mountain village of Malina Mala just inside Macedonia on Tuesday,
said officials for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. The
group joined 3,000 refugees who had already fled to the remote
village, where 600 families are now caring for 6,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A second group of 1,000 to 3,000 refugees from Gnjilane appeared
here in Lojan Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, roughly 100 people crossed into Kukes, Albania, and
about 150 entered Blace, Macedonia, border posts that were flooded
with refugees over the weekend, the officials said. The slow
traffic through official crossing points heightened fears that
Yugoslav forces were preventing refugees from leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of silence along the borders was accompanied by
reports of intensifying attacks by Yugoslavs in Kosovo. A Western
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said Kosovo Liberation
Army commanders were reporting that over the last several days,
Yugoslav army units had systematically shelled hills in
northeastern Kosovo where thousands of civilians were hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat said that according to the guerrilla army's
commanders, dozens of people were killed in the shelling, east of
the town of Podujevo. Thousands of others fled from the hills and
were herded into a long column by Yugoslav forces and driven south
toward Pristina, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the column is unclear. Guerrilla commanders
said it was turned back north of Pristina, said the diplomat, who
spoke with them by phone. Some of the refugees were placed around
police installations or in camps, they said. The accounts could not
be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of young men of fighting age being separated from
groups of civilians were emerging for the first time in
southeastern Kosovo, the diplomat said. Refugees fleeing attacks
around Gnjilane last Wednesday and Thursday were giving consistent
accounts of young men being forced to join work details where they
dug trenches or graves. In some cases, they were later executed,
the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, reports of the separation of men of fighting age have
emerged mostly from western Kosovo, particularly areas of heavy
guerrilla activity. Gnjilane and other towns in southeastern Kosovo
recently attacked by Yugoslav forces were not Kosovo Liberation
Army strongholds, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday night what the refugees experienced
inside Kosovo because Macedonian officials blocked aid workers and
journalists from speaking with them. After allowing one food convoy
in Malina Mala on Sunday, Macedonian officials barred aid groups
and journalists from driving into the village because it lies close
to the border with Kosovo.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere in a studio at American Ballet Theater, at
any given moment in the months leading up to the company's season
at the Metropolitan Opera House, which opens Monday, there was a
dancer waiting to learn about the history of the classical ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson would not be learned from books or written notes or
even videotapes, though all contribute to an intellectual sense of
the centuries-old art and the specific work to be studied that day.
It was a history that walked quietly through the door, turned to
the pianist and clapped its hands for the rehearsal to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries of ballet tradition and evolution are encoded in
the bodies and minds of the dancers' teachers and coaches: in
Frederic Franklin, one of the last of the Ballet Russe de Monte
Carlo stars of the 1930s, in the great Soviet ballerina Irina
Kolpakova, who performed with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad from
the 1950s through the mid-1980s, and in Georgina Parkinson, a
leading ballerina with the England's Royal Ballet in its late glory
days through the 1970s. The history lives, too, in former Ballet
Theater dancers like Kevin McKenzie, now company director, Victor
Barbee, the gifted character dancer, and Susan Jones, who is known
for her encyclopedic memory.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded attempts to codify dance steps in a script of
symbols occurred in mid-15th century Italy. Today, whole ballets
and modern-dance works are written out and quickly retrievable in
computer programs, down to the smallest steps and gestures and most
complex positionings and travels of dancers across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Films and videotapes are also useful, and Ballet Theater tapes
every rehearsal for archival purposes. But dancers say that nothing
captures the flavor and impulse of choreography as well as watching
an informed body dance it out.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pieces Ballet Theater will perform at the Met _
among them a new production of Kenneth MacMillan's ``Anastasia,''
revivals of Twyla Tharp's sassy ``Push Comes to Shove'' and Paul
Taylor's lyrical ``Airs,'' and ballets by George Balanchine and
Jiri Kylian _ were created recently enough so that the
choreographers or their hand-picked representatives are available
to restage the works.
</P>
<P>
   For others, like such classics as ``La Bayadere,'' ``Don
Quixote'' and ``Giselle'' and a revival of Leonide Massine's 1938
``Gaite Parisienne,'' the company and its dancers must rely on the
articulate bodies and memories of earlier generations.
</P>
<P>
   The highly stylized organized chaos of the Massine ballet is
very far from the experience of most dancers today, products of
training that tends to emphasize clean, forceful technique and
near-abstraction in style and dramatic expressiveness. How to pass
along the frou-frou of ``Gaite Parisienne?'' Giuseppe Picone, who
will dance the Baron in the ballet this weekend, said of Franklin.
``Anytime he moves, I can see exactly why the style.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is the key to recalling choreography for Franklin, who is
at Ballet Theater to restage ``Gaite'' and who danced the first
Baron after learning just about every other male role in the
ballet. Ms. Jones describes the process as ``hearing the rhythm of
the steps in your head to come up with the right steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The score was played wrong for the company's last revival of the
piece, Franklin said, with too many pauses and lulls that slowed
the crucial momentum of the dancing. At a rehearsal at Ballet
Theater earlier this month he stood by the piano, beating out the
rhythm with his foot and singing along.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. Soon he was dancing beside Picone and
Christine Dunham, who plays the alluring Glove-Seller, his
84-year-old body brimming with the gaiety and restless energy of
Offenbach's Paris cafe, where the ballet takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Massine everything is all at once,'' Franklin said. ``I
show them the basic things, then let them have a go at it and see
how it comes out. Though this is new for them, the Ballet Theater
dancers are used to the big old classics. They are used to roles
and strange characters on the stage, which most dancers today
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbee is there sketching out steps with his body as well as
learning Franklin's way of presenting it. Like Ms. Jones, Barbee
will now be available for teaching the ballet to new dancers after
Franklin leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Each ballet master and coach rehearses a little bit of
everything, they say, though each has an area of concentration. Ms.
Kolpakova works, for example, with the classics. David Richardson,
the assistant artistic director, is the company's Balanchine
specialist. And each dancer studies with a variety of teachers and
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Learning a role begins, of course, with learning the steps and
at times adjusting them. All is not written in stone and certainly,
as Barbee points out, it would not be possible for dancers today to
perform ``Giselle,'' the oldest ballet in the company's current
season, the way it was done at its premiere in 1841.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences have changed; dancers' bodies are different. ``We do
steps now that they didn't do 20 years ago,'' he said. ``You try to
preserve what you have learned from another generation, but you
also have to keep it going into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbee estimates that teaching a solo or small ensemble dance
can take anywhere from a half hour to two hours. But dancers must
also understand the way the step is done _ its dynamics and also
the style of the choreography _ in a particular ballet. Only 20
percent of a performance, Barbee said, is ``where do I go, and how
do I get there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ask someone to do a glissade assemble, they know what I'm
saying,'' Barbee continued, referring to a simple ballet waltz
step. ``But the glissade assemble changes according to how fast or
slow it is. Is it down into the floor or out of the floor? Is it a
liquid movement or a rock-solid movement? And if it is liquid, is
it liquid like water, mercury or silk?''
</P>
<P>
   In some modern choreography, too, the steps are only remotely
recognizable as standard ballet vocabulary learned in the
classroom. ``So how do you relay that? It can only be done through
the experience of someone who knows what the intention of the step
was. In our vocabulary there's a tremendous amount of information
lacking. And it's up to the ballet master to provide that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barbee were to write out the step sequence of a dance _ say,
the second-act adagio in ``Giselle'' _ anyone with a good knowledge
of dance could probably visualize the sequence. ``But you're not
going to read the steps and have tears come to your eyes,'' he
said. ``So how do you produce something in a performance that can
have that effect on an audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt, if I know what the moment feels like, I know
what the step is. If I've just learned the step, it means no more
to me than that adagio on that piece of paper. But once you've
discovered what a moment feels like, whether it's emotional or
physical, I think you've arrived at something you can recreate _
not reproduce _ from one performance to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   But how to transmit the quality of the moment and the history
that implicitly colors it?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Each coach has a distinctive approach. Ms. Jones is briskly
sympathetic. As a longtime corps dancer, she has a special feeling
for that important but sometimes underrated job. ``This is not just
about my ability to take 24 girls from 24 different schools and say
something in a way they'll understand so that they start to move
together,'' Ms. Jones said. ``This is about giving them the belief
that they are the support system of the entire ballet. They have to
be encouraged and inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   Working as an organism, the corps can bring an extra, though
often intangible, glow and polish to everything from classics like
``La Bayadere,'' where corps discipline is responsible for one of
the ballet's most poetic passages, to the jazzy roilings of Ms.
Tharp's ``Push Comes to Shove.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie is known for his intensive approach to dramatic
interpretation, which can range from working out the tiniest
dramatic details of each moment in a character's scene in
``Giselle,'' for example, to making sure in a plotless ballet that
dancers are aware of the space they're filling and the space that
surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the specificity that replaces the storytelling in a
story ballet,'' McKenzie said. ``There is nothing in dance that
doesn't have some form of emotional motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steps and technique are the equivalent of words and sentences.
The larger meaning comes with a ``specific blueprint'' for a role,
as he puts it, learned with the choreography as an interpretive
tool or a departure point. Absorbing the lessons of the artists
around one continues the fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   For him, Barbee and Ms. Jones, those artists included some of
the great stars of 20th-century ballet, among them Erik Bruhn,
Anthony Dowell, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Cynthia Gregory and Natalia
Makarova, who staged Ballet Theater's production of ``La
Bayadere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parkinson is known for being outspoken yet empathic, with a
sensitivity for dramatic characterization developed through work
with MacMillan and Bronislava Nijinska, a choreographer who figured
prominently in the modernist ballet experimentation of the 1920s in
Paris. The principal dancer Ashley Tuttle recalls one of the most
useful correctives Ms. Parkinson gave her, early in her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, darling, you were so (italics)boring,''(end italics) Ms.
Parkinson said, embroidering the adjective with an earthy
expletive, when asked by the then-fledgling dancer for an opinion
on a particular performance.
</P>
<P>
   The comment stung. But Ms. Tuttle, laughing now at the memory,
never forgot the lesson that the steps, which came easily to her,
were not enough. Working with Ms. Parkinson, she learned everything
from helpful tips about not straining upward when she was nervous
to the confidence to know that Ashley Tuttle had something of her
own to give to Giselle in her mad scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be much easier now,'' Ms. Parkinson once told her
after an exhaustive session on a difficult classical solo. ``And it
was,'' Ms. Tuttle said, adding that those specifics carried over
into everything else she danced.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballet Theater repertory is large, as is the roster of
principals and soloists. ``Every dancer you get is under pressure
because of the way we work,'' Ms. Parkinson said. ``There is no
really great quality time because there isn't that much time. So
they may come unsure of themselves, or not prepared to be naked in
front of you. And you have to help them to get over that. You have
to make them realize that each of them has got something to say,
and that what you're trying to do is get them in touch with that so
they can be confident and free enough to make things their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The process can be heartbreaking. With so many dancers vying for
important roles, few get a chance to do more than one performance
of a role each season, robbing them of the chance to grow steadily
in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a dancer these days is so hard,'' Ms. Parkinson said.
``We all should be allowed to make mistakes. But there isn't much
room. So all the coaching has extra pressure on it. It's not a
slow, quality process where you can build each day.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Kolpakova, dancers get a dose of vivid history along
with stylistic and technical corrections. Ms. Kolpakova trained
with Agrippina Vaganova, the seminal Soviet teacher and
theoretician. And as a Kirov Ballet dancer her roots go back to
Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, the creators of most of the
style-setting Russian ballet classics of the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kolpakova has been known to encourage dancers, often tired
at the end of a long day of rehearsals, simply to scream in order
to ``feel something'' and relax. ``Dance is theater,'' she says.
``They are afraid to lose their balance, to fall down. This is
boring, not interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a highly physical teacher who tugs, pushes and pulls at
bodies to give dancers a sense of the physicality of a step. But
she also peppers her teaching with quotations ranging from
Alexander Pushkin's immortalization of the ballerina Avdotia
Istomina in ``Eugene Onegin'' to colorful descriptive passages from
the critical writing of Theophile Gautier and Andre Levinson and
stories of her teachers and ballerinas who danced for the Czar.
</P>
<P>
   It was to Ms. Kolpakova that Susan Jaffe, a senior ballerina at
Ballet Theater, turned in 1990 when she sensed that she needed a
new direction in her dancing. Ms. Jaffe, who also studies with the
acting coach Byam Stevens, wanted to learn firsthand about
Vaganova's teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to square one,'' Ms. Jaffe recalled. With Ms.
Kolpakova, she learned to make full use of her upper body, an area
often neglected in American ballet but the instrument of expression
and nuance. She even relearned the basic arabesque.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked painstakingly for over a year. Then Ms. Jaffe
decided she needed to show Ms. Kolpakova, slowly and thoroughly,
what she had learned. She asked her voluble teacher not to say
anything at first as she worked her way from a colorlessly correct
to a nuanced technical demonstration in a process that lasted an
entire month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to erase what she had taught me so I wouldn't be a
copy,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``I had to allow my own body to take over.
It was very difficult for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kolpakova laughs, recalling what amounted to a
life-and-death struggle for both. ``She was tired and I was
picky,'' she said of Ms. Jaffe and the unusual venture. ``Then I
understood that I was in a way too much. I wanted her to do
everything. Now Susan knows. And she can teach someone else.''

 Column: AOL's Steve Case to H&AMP;Q's Dan Case: Hey, Maybe Next Year
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
It might mean nothing. Then again, it could be a sign of something.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from this year's line up at the Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist technology stock conference next week is America Online.
Management from the Internet blue chip is not slated to appear at
the annual confab being held at the Westin St. Francis hotel, where
fund managers traditionally shop for their favorite technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's decision to bypass the H&AMP;Q stock show is especially
curious since AOL Chairman Steve Case is the brother of H&AMP;Q
Chairman Dan Case. I mean, it's not like the invitation could have
been lost in the mail? (In fact, AOL was included on a
``preliminary list of invited public companies'' published by H&AMP;Q.)
</P>
<P>
   AOL presented at last year's H&AMP;Q conference, and it also told
its story to investors at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's Internet stock
conference held last month at the Snowbird ski resort in Salt Lake
City. (Geez, these fund managers really rough it, don't they?)
</P>
<P>
   And while AOL will be AWOL from this year's H&AMP;Q event, other
Internet heavyweights, such as Yahoo and Amazon.com, will be there
with bells on. Adding intrigue to all of this is the fact that AOL
is expected to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes, companies schedule their earnings announcements to
coincide with their appearances at stock conferences. This, of
course, is usually the case when news is especially upbeat. It
gives management a chance to gloat when things are going well.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, companies usually avoid stock conferences that
are scheduled prior to the release of their financial earnings when
the news is somewhat ugly or there are untoward surprises, says a
conference planner at a bulge-bracket brokerage and investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Executives don't want to be in a position to reveal financial
problems before the official release of quarterly numbers, the
source says. &UR;  &LR; The most egregious warning sign _ which I want to
emphasize does not appear to be the case here with AOL _ is when
companies scratch their appearances after putting their names on
schedules to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises a lot more red flags when a company cancels,'' a San
Francisco fund manager says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many fund managers keep track of original conference
lineups and compare them with the schedules released immediately
prior to events. And when names are missing, negative suspicions
about the canceled companies are raised, says one Silicon Valley
hedge fund manger.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, an H&AMP;Q spokeswoman says that  &LR; AOL elected not to
present at her company's conference because it appeared at the
Internet stock event in Utah last month. Presumably, AOL feels that
it just recently told its story and doesn't need to repeat it so
soon. An AOL spokeswoman was unable to respond before deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street still loves AOL. According to IBES, a financial
research firm, about 95 percent of the 41 Wall Street analysts that
follow AOL recommend its shares as a ``buy.'' Their consensus
estimate for first-quarter earnings to be released next week are 9
cents a share. Buoyed by yesterday's rebound in technology, the
company's shares soared about 12 percent yesterday to close at
$128.69.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a component of the S&AMP;P 500 and nearly every fund
manager's favorite holding, maybe you can afford to blow off a
stock conference here and there _ even if it is being thrown by
your brother.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CASE STUDY: &LR;  Speaking of H&AMP;Q and Dan Case, the San Francisco
investment bank reported earnings after the market closed of 98
cents a share for the quarter ended March 31. That beat the
Street's consensus estimate by a whopping 45 cents. Case
attributes, among other things, a ``sharp improvement in the equity
underwriting environment, (H&AMP;Q's) strong position in the market
(and) robust levels of brokerage activity`` for the stellar
performance.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q's shares jumped almost a point to $33 a share prior to the
news yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, when you look at how well the Bay Area investment
bank fared during the quarter, it makes you wonder how BankAmerica
can blame its investment banking business, namely Montgomery
Securities, for dragging down the Charlotte bank's earnings during
the same quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, from the this-town-is-too-small file: H&AMP;Q also
announced that it has named former BankAmerica Chairman and CEO
David Coulter to its board of directors. And you wonder why they
call the banking business ``clubby.''

NATO NATIONS CONTEMPLATE RECONSTRUCTION FOR BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The western military alliance has begun promoting
the idea of a sweeping reconstruction of the Balkans, even as it
destroys refineries, bridges, roads and buildings in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Though the idea is still vague, the Clinton administration hopes
that the NATO summit meeting in Washington this weekend will
produce a framework for the project, which would cover all the
countries of the Balkans, the poorest part of Europe.
Administration officials insist that carrying out any plan,
especially in the countries surrounding Yugoslavia, would not hinge
on a resolution of the Kosovo conflict or the ouster of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said Tuesday that millions of people in the Balkans are depending
on an economic rescue and could not be ``held hostage'' by the fate
of one man.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not begun to define the scale of
such a project or to focus on the nuts and bolts of how much it
would cost, which countries would participate and what the precise
goals would be. But the theme of such a reconstruction plan is as
important as the details in that it signals to Milosevic's
supporters international pressure will be brought to bear on the
region to promote economic cooperation and that Yugoslavia's future
lies with its integration into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Various European nations have talked of rebuilding the Balkans
off and on over the last few years, with little to show for it.
With the war in Kosovo now in the process of ruining the province's
capacities for production and its transportation system and
accelerating the mass exodus of its population into already
distressed neighboring countries, the alliance says it is more
determined now to seek a broad-scale permanent solution.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who discussed the rebuilding of the Balkans
privately with British Prime Minister Tony Blair two weeks ago,
first publicly raised the notion of United States participation in
the plan last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should try to do for Southeastern Europe what we helped to
do for Western Europe after World War II and for Central Europe
after the Cold War,'' he said during a speech in San Francisco in
which he focused on the future of Kosovo, which NATO has been
bombing since March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been careful to avoid describing the rebuilding as a
modern-day Marshall Plan, which invites comparison with one of the
most comprehensive _ and most expensive _ peacetime initiatives in
world history. Over four years, 16 countries rebuilt a Europe
devastated by World War II in an attempt to halt starvation,
prevent the spread of communism and stabilize the international
order to promote free-market economies. The plan, to which the
United States contributed $13 billion starting in 1948, laid the
foundation for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that the Clinton administration and the
European Union are nonetheless striving for a thematic vision
comparable to that of the Marshall Plan to signal the west's
intentions of bringing long-term stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said that to achieve
long-term stability the alliance would need to bolster the nearby
countries of Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to be confident when this conflict is over that it
will be over once and for all and the United States and its allies
won't have to once again come back with military force,'' he said,
``is going to depend a lot on the security, the stability and the
prosperity of those countries in the region which have been part of
the solution, as opposed to Serbia, which has been part of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   How much physical rebuilding of Serbia would be undertaken and
when it might begin are major political questions that the alliance
has yet to address. But Albright suggested Tuesday that it would
not necessarily depend on the fate of Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Milosevic and Yugoslavia is a part of that depends on
how this ends and whether we see a democratically elected
government in Yugoslavia,'' Ms. Albright told reporters at a White
House briefing. ``We cannot hold the whole region hostage to
Milosevic's policies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The still-sketchy plan has evolved from notions of tinkering
with ways to promote trade within the Balkans to a more expansive
economic program that would offer technical and development
assistance to the neighboring countries, compensate them for losses
in trade and help them pay off their debts. As one European
diplomat put it, ``We need something substantial to make sure we
never get into this mess again.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope any economic program would involve international
institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund as well as most if not all nations of the NATO alliance. Some
analysts involved in the planning said it could be patterned on the
smaller $5-billion, four-year plan to help rebuild Bosnia in which
several dozen agencies and nations are participating.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that the plan had emerged from discussions among
European allies and that the allies expected to delve into the
subject when the leaders of the 19 NATO countries gather here later
this week for their summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as we respond to this crisis in Kosovo,'' she said, ``we
must concern ourselves more broadly with the future of the region.
Our explicit goal should be to transform the Balkans from Europe's
primary source of instability into an important part of its
mainstream. And we must work to insure that NATO forces will not
again be called on to fight terror and destruction in this corner
of the continent. And in our discussions at the summit, we will
begin to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere and agenda of the summit meeting have changed
markedly since the beginning of the aerial bombardment of
Yugoslavia a month ago, according to National Security Adviser
Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a
great deal on the future,'' Berger said Tuesday. ``Now it's
necessary to have it focus intensely on the present as well. This
is going to be a working meeting of a military alliance in the
middle of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton briefly mentioned the NATO gathering at a
White House ceremony at which he presented the Medal of Freedom to
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the crisis in Kosovo was evidence of a need to
project Western power and values into Eastern and Southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can and must remain willing to act,'' Clinton said,
``because the work of building a new world never ends.''

ADVERTISING: TRUE NORTH AIDS MINORITY-OWNED AGENCIES AND MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Efforts to increase the consideration given to ethnic-minority
consumers are gaining momentum as one of the 10 largest agency
companies, True North Communications in Chicago, takes two big
steps to embrace media outlets and agencies specializing in
advertising aimed at minorities.
</P>
<P>
   True North, the world's No. 7 agency company, with billings
estimated at $11.6 billion, is scheduled to announce the steps at a
news conference Wednesday morning in Washington under the aegis of
the American Advertising Federation. Officials of the federation
are among the industry figures accelerating the search for ways to
increase diversity in response to intensifying pressure from
activist organizations and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of True North shows us that the greatest music
is made with many voices,'' said Vice President Al Gore in a
statement released before the news conference. ``I encourage other
companies to follow suit and sign on.''
</P>
<P>
   True North executives are to announce their endorsement of a
voluntary code of conduct to insure that agencies and media owned
by minorities get what is deemed their fair share of attention when
ad dollars are spent. True North, which owns agencies like Foote,
Cone &AMP; Belding and Bozell Worldwide, would become the first large
agency company to endorse the equal opportunities code, known as
the Kennard Principles for Fairness in Communications after Federal
Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard has taken an active role in this issue since the
commission released a study in January concluding that radio
stations with black and Spanish-speaking audiences drew less ad
revenue per listener than mainstream stations _ even in markets
where they enjoyed higher ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted to see the advertising industry moving to
address these issues,'' Kennard said in an interview last week.
``It's a great first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has called for additional research on advertiser
spending patterns in radio because the study did not specify the
origin of the revenue discrepancies between stations. But owners of
stations with programming aimed at members of minorities complained
about what they termed ``dictates'' to agencies from clients
calling for ``minority discounts'' _ paying lower rates for
commercials on their stations _ and the avoidance of stations with
Spanish-language or ``urban'' _ black _ formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those practices are pernicious,'' Kennard said, ``based on
misinformation and stereotypes. The way to solve such problems is
to shine a light on them.''
</P>
<P>
   True North's endorsement of the code is important, Kennard said,
because it represents self-regulation rather than government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with them,'' he said, referring to agencies
and advertisers, ``as opposed to dictating to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the federation in
Washington, agreed with Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marketplace solution,'' Snyder said in an interview
last week, ``not a government solution. Clients are going to act on
their own best financial interests, not on a political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also praised True North, whose agencies create campaigns
for advertisers like BankAmerica Corp., DaimlerChrysler Corp., Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. and S.C. Johnson &AMP; Son.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the turning point we've been waiting for,'' Snyder
said, adding: ``We've been encouraging agencies and clients to
really go after this multicultural audience because it is one with
a great deal of economic clout. Now I think other agencies will
follow True North.''
</P>
<P>
   The True North executives also plan to announce the formation of
a media services agency dedicated to helping mainstream advertisers
with planning and buying ad space in ethnic publications and
commercial time on ethnic television and radio networks and
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right for the times,'' said David Bell, who was recently
named chairman and chief executive at True North. ``We have a
tapestry in America, and marketing needs to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   The media services initiative, to be called New America Media
Group, will represent a partnership between two units of True North
based in New York: TN Media, which handles media planning and
buying for accounts with billings estimated at more than $2.6
billion, and New America Strategies Group, which offers
multicultural marketing consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market has reached critical mass, with buying power
greater than ever,'' said TN Media chairman Mike Drexler. ``It can
no longer be ignored or given short shrift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can make a big contribution to helping
advertisers analyze multicultural markets for their products and
services,'' he added, ``and then to place their ads to reach those
markets in the most effective way.''
</P>
<P>
   The new media group will be led by three media directors from
agencies under the New America Strategies umbrella: LaTanya Junior,
35, at Stedman Graham &AMP; Partners, specializing in campaigns aimed
at black consumers; Caleb Windover, 34, at Siboney USA, for
Hispanic consumers, and Khanh Kach, 28, at a True North affiliate,
Imada Wong Communications, for Asian-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic media have always been the extra guest at the party,''
said Al Schreiber, managing partner at New America Strategies.
``Now they'll be the guest of honor as advertisers move from token
budgets to budgets that reflect the reality of today's marketplace,
where multicultural consumers are the growth market.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CHARLIE WARD NEEDS A ROBE, AND A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl. Gretzky. Olympic Scandals. The Draft. Piazza Hurt.
Darkness Looms for Garden. Zim Sasses Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Other weird events rush past, and a columnist has to play
catchup ball. As people often ask, ``But what do you really
think?''
</P>
<P>
   1. Charlie Ward Wants Female Journalists Banished From the
Locker Room.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know what Ward is really thinking as he stares past most
people in his path. The Knicks' point guard is brooding about being
seen in a state of undress in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Ward should get a bathrobe. He should also worry more about
being seen in a state of undress on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is Ward is one of the least effective point guards in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Ward passed out quotes from the Rev. Reggie White the other day,
saying women should not be in the locker room. At least Reggie
White has a personality. At least Reggie White can play his game.
</P>
<P>
   It is people like this who give organized religion a bad face:
the widespread fear of women, the obsessive division of the world
into a few of ``us'' and a lot of ``them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a run of talented and smart guards in the past
decade: Mark Jackson, Doc Rivers, Derek Harper. I never heard them
whining about female journalists. I suggest there is a link between
Ward's lack of vision on the court and his lack of tolerance off
the court. Some of his colleagues think he's sneaky-dirty, also.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody in the front office vastly overrated Charlie Ward. Now
he should seek his level _ quarterback in the NFL Europe League.
Maybe there are no women there.
</P>
<P>
   2. Isles' Owner Rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted scouting combine of the National Football League did
its homework on Howard Milstein. His bid to buy the Washington
franchise was turned down for a rather basic reason: it was
overleveraged. However, right in its backyard, the NFL could also
see the skid-row Islanders getting worse under Milstein and Steven
Gluckstern.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise of Torrey and Arbour, Bossy and Potvin, went
downhill under an absentee owner and continued under another owner
who eventually went to jail. It continues under a bunch of
mall-builders who could not get their bulldozers chugging in the
first half-hour of their stewardship, so they gave up trying. The
sooner these guys are gone, the better.
</P>
<P>
   3. Boxing Judge Couldn't See the Punches.
</P>
<P>
   When did that ever make a difference? Every time something
ludicrous happens in boxing _ like the fraudulent draw favoring the
American, Evander Holyfield, against the Brit, Lennox Lewis: boxing
fans treat it like an aberration. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are two inherent flaws in boxing. One is that the state
should not be licensing human beings to hurt each other, unlike any
other so-called sport. The other is that the character of the
business is so marginal (boxers are usually the most decent part)
that there is no reason to expect honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing into
this sordid enterprise. For anybody who takes a match seriously, or
tries to find a redeeming path for boxing, I would use the
schoolyard phrase _ ``SUCK-UHHH!''
</P>
<P>
   4. Bulls Score 49 Points.
</P>
<P>
   The former team of Jordan and Pippen scored chump-change points
in a full game. Never mind that it was against the martial-arts
tactics of Pat Riley's Miami Heat, who scored 82 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' stunning total was the lowest for any team since the
league installed 24-second clocks to encourage the lumbering giants
to fling the ball toward the rim more quickly, back in 1954-55. The
Chicago 49ers finished 9 points below the league record for a
single quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This low figure is a tribute to Jerry Reinsdorf, who managed to
run off his championship cast but still charges big-time prices.
What a guy. The 49 points are also a tribute to the league owners,
who engineered a lockout that has produced an artistic disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The new breed of player also deserves credit for stubbornly
resisting team play, coaching tips, basic shots, correct angles off
the backboard, simple logic and basketball wisdom in favor of
degree-of-difficulty highlight-tape shots.
</P>
<P>
   Clueless players and arrogant management are leading us backward
to the era when crude pioneers stumbled around the court, whacking
each other into the potbellied stoves that warmed the drafty
arenas. The NBA values its history so much that it is trudging back
to it. At contemporary prices, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There. I'm caught up.

NEW LOW-FARE AIRLINE TO BUY AIRBUS INDUSTRIE JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Air, a start-up airline that plans to offer low-fare service
from Kennedy International Airport in New York beginning early next
year, has decided to buy narrow-body jets made by Europe's Airbus
Industrie, dealing a blow to the Boeing Corp.'s competing 737 jet.
</P>
<P>
   New Air is expected to sign a deal with Airbus as early as
Wednesday. The agreement includes firm orders for 25 A320 jets and
options and purchase rights for 50 more jets in the A320 family,
which includes the smaller A319 and the larger A321. If New Air
bought all 75 planes at list prices, the deal would be valued at
more than $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sale by Airbus, the jet consortium jointly owned by four
European companies, based in Toulouse, France, is particularly
painful to Boeing because virtually every major executive at New
Air came from carriers that fly the 737.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this, we fully expected to choose the 737,'' said
David Neeleman, the founder and chief executive of the airline,
which is calling itself New Air until it picks a flashier brand
name. Neeleman previously ran Morris Air, a low-fare carrier based
in Salt Lake City that flew only 737s. ``The more we took a look at
that airplane,'' he added, referring to the A320, ``the more we
liked it. There was unanimity among our management team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 737 was introduced in the mid-1960s. There are more than
3,300 flying today, making it the most successful commercial
airplane of all time, according to Boeing. But the A320, which was
born in the mid-1980s, has been rapidly gaining ground in recent
years. Last year, Boeing delivered the first of a new, updated
version of the 737 in order to slow the A320s advance.
</P>
<P>
   The new plane has been very successful despite several crashes
of older models for which safety officials have blamed the rudder
design. Boeing is now making a record 27 737s every month. But
studies show that the A320 has a slight edge over the 737 in new
orders and future deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Airbus delivered its 1,000th A320. In the
last year, key Boeing customers such as British Airways, UAL's
United Airlines and U S Airways have chosen the A320 over the 737.
Tuesday, Airbus announced that CIT Group, an aircraft leasing
company in New Jersey that owns mostly Boeing airplanes, had
ordered 25 planes in the A320 family.
</P>
<P>
   Both Airbus and Boeing were eager to capture New Air because
they knew whatever plane the airline chose would most likely be a
lifetime commitment. As a low-fare carrier, New Air wants to use
only one type of jet to save money on maintenance and training.
</P>
<P>
   Most low-fare carriers, notably Southwest Airlines, the nation's
largest and most successful, rely exclusively on the 737. Southwest
announced Tuesday that it had exercised options to buy six more
737s.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it will probably never be able to sell a plane to
rapidly growing Southwest still rankles Airbus. In an interview
last month, John Leahy, Airbus' senior vice president in charge of
sales, said that New Air was particularly attractive because it
would allow Airbus to showcase the A320 in New York, one of the
world's media capitals. He also predicted that Boeing would have to
build yet another version of the 737 to keep up with Airbus, a
notion Boeing has dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman said that Airbus offered very good terms for the jets.
``The price got our attention, and the product put us over the
edge,'' he said. ``We became very convinced that this was the
airplane for us regardless of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman said that he was won over by the fact that the A320
cabin is seven inches wider than the 737 cabin, allowing for
greater passenger comfort and larger overhead storage bins. He was
also impressed by Airbus' cockpit technology and the fact that the
A320 in the all-coach configuration required by New Air carries 24
more passengers than the 737, for a total of 162.
</P>
<P>
   New Air plans to power the jets with engines made by
International Aero Engines, a consortium that includes United
Technologies' Pratt &AMP; Whitney unit and Rolls-Royce.

 &HT;    Teacher acquitted of molestation in Florida case
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A jury acquitted Maurice LeFlore
Tuesday, saying even his own confession couldn't overcome gaps in
the testimony of the nine girls who claimed he molested them.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated about 3-1/2 hours before clearing the former
Riviera Beach teacher of four counts of lewd assault, one day after
the judge formally tossed seven other counts. He had faced more
than 60 years in prison, but instead is free to return to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County School District did not renew his contract
after his March 23, 1998 arrest and he said Tuesday he'll return
home to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a terribly difficult year and I'm just thankful to
God and my family for their support,'' LeFlore, 23, said. ``I
didn't do anything wrong and I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach police arrested LeFlore after several girls told
police that he fondled their breasts and buttocks and rubbed them
with his groin. In a seven-minute taped interview with police,
LeFlore confessed to touching two of his students, ages 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   But during the trial, some of the girls' statements waffled or
changed entirely, leaving Assistant State Attorney Maura McGuigan
to rely heavily on LeFlore's confession. That confession was
inconclusive, jurors said, and weakened by the lack of supporting
evidence and poor police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way they should have brought 11 counts, because
they didn't have anything to back it up,'' defense attorney Lynn
Whitfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about that statement a lot, but there wasn't an
ounce of evidence that backed it up,'' juror Mark Taggart said.
``The girls weren't believable and the police officer didn't go to
the school or spend any time investigating. But I think the real
problem is with the school.''
</P>
<P>
   LeFlore's prosecution raised serious questions about the school
system and the way it investigates accusations against its
teachers. Seven school employees, including the John F. Kennedy
Middle School principal, vice principal and three counselors, knew
about the accusations but took no steps to protect the girls,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The employees didn't call police or the state attorney's office
and they didn't call the state's child abuse hotline as required by
law. Instead, they conducted their own investigation, threatening
witnesses to recant and telling the accusers that they would report
their allegations to LeFlore.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned of the complaints after one student called 911
anonymously and police traced the call to a pay phone and found
her.
</P>
<P>
   Only one employee, counselor Rebecca Price, was fired. In
February, a judge acquitted former Principal Clifford Durden of
failing to report the incident.
</P>
<P>
   After the LeFlore verdict, McGuigan praised the girls for coming
forward against such pressure. McGuigan, who is due to give birth
Saturday, declined to hand off the case because she didn't want to
abandon the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the jury's decision, I really do, but it's
disappointing,'' McGuigan said. ``When I filed the case, the girls'
statements were very strong. I think the process (of the court
case) is what made their testimony deteriorate.''

TWO OPEN FIRE, THROW GRENADES IN COLO. SCHOOL; 25 MAY BE DEAD
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SCENE, COLO-SCHOOL-SUSPECTS) 
 (mb) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Two young men invaded a suburban high school
here at lunch time, killing as many as 25 people and wounding at
least another 20, authorities said. The two were later found dead
in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   Sowing mayhem, the gunmen threw grenades and shot students and
teachers as they moved through Columbine High School, beginning at
11:30 a.m., from the parking lot to the library and then to the
cafeteria. Students who saw them and escaped said one suspect was a
student and another was a dropout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw two kids in trench coats with guns,'' said Chris
Weischer, a reference to a group of students that some students
called ``the trench coat mafia.'' Weischer was one of several
students freed by SWAT teams four hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, FBI agents and police SWAT teams were still
moving through the school, searching for more victims and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood was going all over,'' one shaken girl said as she was
comforted by her father. Recalling the carnage in the school
library, she said, ``They were saying that they wanted Judas for
their revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers brought out one young man in handcuffs, but a sheriff's
spokesman later said it was believed that he was a friend of the
gunmen and did not take part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a nightmare as ambulances ferried
injured and dying students through this middle-class suburb
southwest of Denver past tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a
packed student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared,'' Liza Madden, a 16-year-old sophomore, said
after making her escape. ``Every time I heard gun shots I was
crying. I was so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   After police used a fire truck and an armored car to get close
to the building, dozens of students raced from the two-story
building, some slipping in the mud, others holding up their hands
in the air. The police later said they feared that the shooters
would try to escape by mingling with the fleeing students.
</P>
<P>
   One bloodied youth, an arm hanging limply from his side, broke
out a window on the second floor and climbed down into the hands of
waiting police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the hundreds of the law-enforcement officers who
responded to the carnage established a wide perimeter around the
school, stunned students and school workers gathered on nearby
streets and told of the chaos and horror.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase. Trapped
inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms and a choir
room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who barricaded herself in a bathroom said,
``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, Jonathan Ladd, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live by Denver television stations, without
commercial breaks all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Several trapped students used cellular telephones to call
television stations when they could not get through to authorities
on 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student told KUSA, a Denver television station, in a frightened
whisper. Identifying himself only as James, he added ``There are a
bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said, ``I am staying upstairs,'' then hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens said before going
to the school. The governor, who has a 16-year-old daughter who
attends a different high school in suburban Denver, said, ``We have
to ask ourselves what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon, the police briefly detained three youths in a
nearby park who were wearing camouflage pants and black jackets.
After they were released, the three said they knew the gunmen.
Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket were the words, ``Ban
Religion'' and a stop sign printed over a cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wearing masks, they were members of the `Trench Coat
Mafia,' '' said David Mesch, another student, who was searching for
his mother, an employee at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the American people will be praying for the students,
the parents and the teachers,'' President Clinton said from the
White House as television images showed police officers training
shotguns on the school.
</P>
<P>
   Those here were reminded of other recent school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the seventh time it has happened,'' one student,
Bob Sapin, told a television station minutes after watching the two
gunmen shoot students. ``I just can't believe it is happening at my
school.''

L.A. CHOOSES STADIUM SITE IN NFL BID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This city's muddled NFL bid gained clarity Tuesday
when league officials designated the aging Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum as the preferred stadium site over a waste dump in nearby
Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to understand ... that having two competing sites in
the Los Angeles area was ultimately counterproductive for Los
Angeles, because the real competition, as you all know, is
Houston,'' NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the league would select a final ownership team
rather than put the 32nd franchise up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   Though the league might get more money through a high-stakes
bidding war, which garnered a $470 million expansion fee from
Cleveland last year, NFL officials hope to create a more
cooperative spirit in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such cooperation is needed to tackle a variety of issues Los
Angeles must meet by the Sept. 15 deadline set by NFL owners, or
else Houston likely will get the team.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is providing enough safe parking close to
the Coliseum that will give fans enough confidence to ensure
selling out all games are avoiding a television blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Los Angeles bidder _ Hollywood deal maker Michael Ovitz
and investor Eli Broad _ has guaranteed sellouts as has Houston
businessman Bob McNair, who hopes to land the 32nd team.
</P>
<P>
   While Tagliabue and other NFL officials were cautious to point
out that Los Angeles has a lot of work to do, including upgrading
the Coliseum area, city officials sounded like the decision to
expand to Los Angeles has already been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``NFL football, welcome back to Los Angeles,'' said an
enthusiastic Mayor Richard Riordan. ``We can't wait to be here for
our first Super Bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that happens, Ovitz and the team of Broad and Ed Roski
must present a comprehensive business plan to NFL officials by the
end of May. The plan, which would outline anticipated ticket sales
and other revenue streams, would become the basis for determining
the expansion fee.
</P>
<P>
   The bidders also must have a development plan for the stadium
area that focuses on providing 27,000 parking places solely for NFL
games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, both sides must come up with plans for renovating the
74-year-old Coliseum, which was home to both the Rams and Raiders
before both fled for better stadium deals in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Roski has already come up with a plan to gut the Coliseum's
inner workings and replace it with a state-of-the-art stadium
surrounded by the memorable facade of a building that has housed
two Olympics Games.
</P>
<P>
   Under Roski's plan, seating would be reduced from 93,000 to
66,000, increasing the chance of sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, who dropped his plans for a Carson deal last week, said
he would come up with his own plan for the Coliseum location.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Ovitz twice called the Los Angeles Sports &AMP;
Entertainment Commission Tuesday for directions to the Coliseum for
Ovitz, who drove alone to the south-central location in his red
Porsche convertible.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tagliabue did not discount the possibility that another
ownership team would emerge. Some NFL officials have shown
interest, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley
in an ownership group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tagliabue said NFL owners have gained more confidence in the
Coliseum area since the Raiders played there before rowdy crowds
before leaving for Oakland after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, several team owners and NFL officials traveled down the
revitalized Figueroa corridor, which has seen great economic
development to the north with construction of Staples Center, a new
cathedral and additions to the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   The group, traveling in a bus, did not go farther south past the
Coliseum, where the neighborhood becomes much tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, a member of the league's
Expansion Committee that met in Los Angeles, said the final project
must spruce up Exposition Park around the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs open space and grass,'' Bowlen said. ``It can't just
be a football stadium in a sea of concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he realizes it would be hard to solicit tax
dollars for the stadium because California voters can overturn such
taxes through initiative and referendum. But he continued the
league's mantra that some public-private partnership is needed to
get a final deal done.

N.J. CONGRESSMAN LEAVES BELGRADE AFTER ``MYSTERY'' MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., left Yugoslavia Tuesday
after spending more than two days in Belgrade meeting with high
government officials on an unofficial mission whose purpose remains
a mystery to most of official Washington and even to some of his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement released Tuesday, Saxton described his trip
as a ``fact-finding mission,'' but declined to elaborate. ``It has
been an informative trip, but I am happy to be coming home,'' he
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Official Yugoslav news agencies have reported that Saxton, who
is from Mount Holly in southern New Jersey and who arrived in
Belgrade on Sunday, met with the Yugoslav foreign minister and the
president of the foreign affairs committee of the Yugoslav
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The official newspaper Politika also reported that Saxton toured
areas where NATO bombs had damaged civilian property, and that he
was traveling with an aide, Joseph Bodansky. Saxton sits on the
House Armed Forces Committee and is chairman of the House Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. Bodansky is an aide
on the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Saxton said they could not confirm those reports.
Although Saxton has been in daily contact with them, they said he
had been unwilling to tell them details of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington said Saxton's trip had taken them by
surprise. One of the few officials Saxton consulted beforehand was
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who advised him not to go, a
spokesman for the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker cautioned him that this is very, very dangerous,
since we are bombing over there,'' the spokesman, John Feehery,
said. He added, ``We're pretty sketchy on all the details of the
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional officials said they thought Saxton had gone
to Yugoslavia in hopes of negotiating the release of the three
American soldiers being held by Yugoslav forces. But Saxton's
spokesman denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Saxton did not travel to Yugoslavia to secure or
negotiate the release of the POWs,'' said Jeff Sagnip Hollendonner,
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Saxton's motivations, Hollendonner noted that
McGuire Air Force Base is in Saxton's district and would probably
send many military personnel to the Balkans if the conflict there
escalates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just airmen, they are constituents,''
Hollendonner said.

 &HT;    Shootings bring up memories of past school horrors
 &HT;    By RacheL Sauer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday's shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton
reopened wounds for residents of several American towns and cities
that experienced similar tragedies in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1997, Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro,
Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; Fayetteville, Tenn.; and Springfield, Ore.,
all have had students and teachers shot in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases it's not just the lost innocence, the feeling of
``that happens in other towns, but not here.'' Many residents of
those towns lost their feeling that their city is a safe place to
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel secure until something like this happens,''
said Craighead County, Ark., Sheriff Jack McCann. ``You kind of sit
around wondering if it's going to happen again. And there's always
that feeling that you can't believe it's happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann said Jonesboro, a town of 51,000 on the Mississippi
River, drew closer together as a result of the March 24, 1998,
shooting rampage during which four junior high school girls and one
teacher died, ``but there's a lot of anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem for people I've talked to is there's never
been an answer to why. I think if anyone could ever answer why, it
would help a lot, but I don't think that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The two boys convicted of the killings will serve five and four
years, respectively, in a juvenile detention center, and unless
Arkansas builds a facility for juvenile offenders to keep them
until they're 21, they will be released at age 18. McCann said that
fact only adds to the anger and confusion that irritates wounds
trying to heal ``because they can go to Wal-Mart the day they get
out and buy a gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   West Paducah, too, has had roadblocks that stand in the way of
the city's ability to heal. Families of three of the students
killed in the Dec. 1, 1997, attack have filed three lawsuits. One
is a $130 million lawsuit against entertainment companies that
produce violent movies and computer games, but the other two name
as many as 42 city, county and school officials whom the families
say they believe could have prevented the tragedy, said McCracken
County Judge Executive Danny Orazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going through a healing process, passing
the first anniversary, going through the Michael Carneal trial (the
boy convicted in the three student deaths),'' Orazine said. ``We
thought surely this would be the end of it, but you don't ever get
completely over it and
</P>
<P>
   then something like (the lawsuits) comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Orazine and McCann said their school districts have
implemented strong security measures: in West Paducah, at least
four security guards patrol district schools on a rotating basis,
which didn't happen before, and Jonesboro got a federal grant to
have a full-time security officer at the school where the shootings
happened. West Paducah added a security system to the high school
so any visitor has to be admitted from inside.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Rich Harrison of the Springfield, Ore., Police Department
said the biggest impact the May 21, 1998, fatal shooting of two
teens had was to change the town's attitudes about what places are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ways of when you can send your child to school and feel
100 percent sure they're going to come home at night are no longer
there,'' Harrison said. ``One of the last places you could consider
safe for your child is school, and that's no longer true.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann and Orazine said the youth of their community seemed
ready to go back to school when the schools reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably was hard to go back, but I think kids are so
active, they've got so much life ahead of them, that they handle
their sorrow differently,'' Orazine said. ``School is where their
life is, and that's where they needed to heal, but the memories and
scars they'll always have.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said dealing with the tragedy wasn't just an issue for
those with ties to the school, ``it goes out to the whole
community,'' he said. ``It goes way past the parents and students.
You don't have to have a child at that school or know somebody who
goes there to be affected. We've had to work through this is a
community and that's probably what
</P>
<P>
   Littleton will have to do, too.''

BOEING STILL WEIGHING COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF KEEPING 717 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Even as The Boeing Co. prepares a major marketing
campaign to find buyers for its slow-selling 717, executives have
the 100-seat plane squarely in the crosshairs of an initiative to
identify programs that can't make money for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs that don't cut it will either be sold off or shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sluggish orders for the Boeing plane, European rival
Airbus Industrie has decided to proceed with developing its own
100-seater. An official announcement that the A-318 will be built
is expected within days, an Airbus spokeswoman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That will make it even tougher for Boeing to win a significant
number of new orders for the 717 and keep it viable, according to
industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced there is a big market (for a 100-seat passenger
jet),'' Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the issue will be, can we or anyone build an airplane at a
cost that can be bought in quantity by people operating in that
market? That market assessment is part of what we are doing right
now...''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said Boeing will make a decision on the 717 before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Airbus is moving ahead with its A-318, which will be
the smallest member of the A-320 family.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus' supervisory board gave a green light Monday for the new
A-318 to be produced, and Airbus informed key customers that it
would be built, several news organizations reported.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has more than 110 firm orders for the jet, the Wall
Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
   That's about what Boeing has for its 717 _ 115 firm orders. But
the 717 _ launched in 1995 before Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas
_ has been in the marketplace for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The 717 is now in flight testing; the first production airplane
will be delivered to AirTran later this summer. To spur sales,
Boeing will fly the 717 to the Paris Air Show in mid-June, and
afterward will take it on a 10-day sales tour through Europe, with
visits to London, Berlin, Madrid, Athens, Milan, Zurich and
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Boeing lands new orders, analysts question whether
it can ever make money for Boeing. And that makes it a prime
candidate in the company's all-out push to identify ``value
destroying'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly questions whether the program meets the
return on investment criteria to remain part of the Boeing product
line,'' said Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragen MacKenzie. ``That will
depend on the company realizing substantial new orders. Right now,
(its current firm order of) 115 planes doesn't cut it. But even
more important is whether Boeing can get costs down to a level that
it can make acceptable returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing assembles the 717 in Long Beach, Calif., much of
the structure is produced by partners. Korean Air and Hyundai
supply the nose assembly and wing. Other major parts come from
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing made commitments to its partners to produce enough planes
to recover the costs of setting up plants to build the parts.
Analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said if Boeing ended the
program before it produced the target number of planes, which he
said is probably about 300 planes, it would have to repay
suppliers. That could amount to more than $100 million, Nisbet
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that both TWA and AirTran, who have placed a total of
100 firm orders for the 717, have options for another hundred. That
gets Boeing much closer to its target, he said, and would
significantly reduce Boeing's liability.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Boeing will likely continue production until all
existing orders are filled, Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very embarrassing, to put it mildly, if they did
not honor their contracts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If customers who have waited all these years found out they
would not get any planes, it would be very damaging for Boeing's
credibility. Boeing would have to eat a ton of crow.''

 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ They remember. Oh, do they ever.
</P>
<P>
   The overtimes. The seventh game. Joe Nieuwendyk being stoned by
Curtis Joseph from point-blank, an improbable shot slipping through
Andy Moog's legs at the other end and, finally, the sickening sound
of silence as a sellout crowd filtered out of Reunion Arena in
shocked disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   A walkover, this first-round playoff series against the Edmonton
Oilers?
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's best regular-season team knows better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no problem with keeping the focus on a daily basis,''
Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said as the Stars got ready for
tonight's Game 1 of their first-round Western Conference playoff
series with the Oilers at Reunion Arena. ``I think our team learned
a lot from that thing two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Colorado Avalanche learned, too. Edmonton was at
it again, knocking the No. 2 seed out for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done the same thing for two or three seasons now,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``They've played the regular season and struggled
at times, but this time of year they always seem to pick up their
game.''
</P>
<P>
   These things happen in the NHL, which sets the stick-and-puck
game apart from its more play-to-form counterparts in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, for instance, No. 8 Ottawa took out No. 1 New
Jersey in the East. In 1995, the New York Rangers shocked Quebec in
a similar matchup, just a year after San Jose ousted Detroit in a
1-8 pairing.
</P>
<P>
   So Dallas rolls into this series in possession of the
President's Trophy (most regular-season points) and the Jennings
Trophy (fewest goals against), mindful that none of that goes for
much when the puck is dropped this evening. The Stars remember the
sickening feeling of two years ago and insist they won't be caught
napping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of dredging up bad memories or trying to
redeem yourself,'' center Mike Modano said. ``But you remember, and
you know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Should anyone forget, a spoiler or two will be happy to come
along and refresh their memories in the weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   A look at each of the NHL's first-round series, which begin
tonight:
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE &QC; 
 &UR; Dallas (1) &QC; 
vs. Edmonton (8) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR;  &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Stars beat the Oilers in a tough five-game
second-round series last spring and went 3-0-1 against them this
season. They'll be at less than full strength with defenseman and
captain Derian Hatcher sitting out the last five of a seven-game
suspension for a hit that broke the jaw of Phoenix's Jeremy
Roenick. (Nieuwendyk will wear the ``C'' in Hatcher's absence.) Pat
Verbeek also is out, nursing a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton is hurting, too, though, with Bill Guerin (the club's
leading scorer with 30 goals and 64 points) and Josef Beranek out
with knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Joseph's play in the nets made all the
difference. He's in Toronto now, and trade-deadline acquisition
Tommy Salo _ hero of Sweden's 1994 Olympic gold-medal team but
making his first NHL playoff appearance _ is being counted on to
keep the Stars in check as the Oilers go for another upset. Dallas
counters with the one-two punch of Ed Belfour (35-15-9, 1.99
goals-against average) and Roman Turek (16-3-3, 2.08 GAA).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction: &LR;  Stars in five. &QL; 
 &UR; Colorado (2) &QC; 
vs. San Jose (7) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Avalanche rallied from a dismal start to claim
the second seed in the West. Goaltender Patrick Roy, one win short
of 100 in the postseason, is back on top of his game, and the
acquisition of right wing Theo Fleury gave an indifferent club a
much-needed lift. With the likes of Peter Forsberg (30 goals, 97
points) and Joe Sakic (41 goals, 96 points) on hand, Colorado is as
talented as any team in the NHL. San Jose, which won only one of
its last five, beat the Avalanche once in four meetings this season
and hopes to play the spoiler again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction: &LR;  Avalanche in five. &QL; 
 &UR; Detroit (3) &QC; 
vs. Anaheim (6) &QC; 
 &LR;  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR;  &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Red
Wings appeared dead in the water before trade-deadline deals
brought Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark and goalie Bill
Ranford, putting the Wings right back into the picture. A year ago,
Detroit spotted the Stars the President's Cup, then came back to
beat Dallas in a six-game Western Conference final, and no one will
be surprised if those two are the last left standing again. Anaheim
chugged in just a game over .500 (35-34-13) after a 1-5-1 finish
and is basically a two-man outfit with wingers Paul Kariya and
Teemu Selanne asked to carry too much of the load.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction: &LR;  Red Wings in five. &QL; 
 &UR; Phoenix (4) &QC; 
vs. St. Louis (5) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Coyotes won't have leading scorer Jeremy
Roenick, whose ``head got in a bad place'' between a Derian Hatcher
forearm and the Reunion Arena boards, according to the Dallas
defenseman. That makes a tough job even more difficult for a team
that lost five of its last six. Keith Tkachuk moves from left wing
to center to replace Roenick, but Phoenix will rely heavily on
goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin (2.13 GAA, eight shutouts) to keep
things competitive. St. Louis used a 6-1-2 finish to edge Anaheim
for the fifth spot and could use a big showing from veteran goalie
Grant Fuhr, who has a history of coming up big in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction: &LR;  Blues in six. &QL; 
 &UR; EASTERN CONFERENCE &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; New Jersey (1) &QC; 
vs. Pittsburgh (8) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  Wayne Gretzky thinks the Penguins' Jaromir Jagr is
the game's best young player. Unfortunately, Jagr _ in addition to
being the NHL's top scorer with 44 goals and 127 points _ also is
one of its biggest crybabies, and not a particularly bright one at
that.
</P>
<P>
   Normally tight-lipped with the North American media, Jagr told a
magazine back in the Czech Republic that Kevin Constantine isn't
much of a coach. Yo, Jaromir! It's a small world with that Internet
thing going around, eh?
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey won eight of 10 down the stretch; Pittsburgh went
2-8-2. The Devils, who set a league record with 28 road wins,
should add two to the total before closing this one out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &UR; Prediction: &LR;  Devils in four.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ottawa (2) &QC; 
vs. Buffalo (7) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Senators held the top spot in the East before
going 0-1-3 over their last four games and being passed by the
Devils in the season's final days. Ottawa's power play enjoyed only
a 14.9 percent success rate during the season, but the Senators can
lean on Ron Tugnutt (22-10-8 with a 1.79 GAA) or Damian Rhodes
(22-13-7, 2.44) to provide high-quality goaltending. The Sabres
have The Dominator _ Dominik Hasek (30-18-14, 1.87) _ but that No.
7 seed says much about the quality of the supporting cast. Still,
the teams played five OT games this season, with the Senators
getting the only win.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction: &LR;  Senators in six. &QL; 
 &UR; Carolina (3) &QC; 
vs. Boston (6) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Hurricanes are the most lightly regarded No. 3
seed in recent playoff memory, coming in first in the Southeast
Division despite winning just four more games than they lost
(34-30-18) and compiling the conference's eighth-best record. Other
than lacking talent, tradition (in their previous incarnation, they
were known as the Hartford Whalers) and fans, they have it all
going their way. The Bruins, in turn, racked up 91 regular-season
points (to Carolina's 86) and won the season series 2-1-2 but
finished just third in the Northeast Division. They dropped their
final regular-season game, to Philadelphia, but earn a better
matchup in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction:  &LR; Bruins in five. &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto (4) &QC; 
vs. Philadelphia (5) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &UR; Outlook: &LR;  The Flyers were fading from among the elite even
before Eric Lindros went out with a collapsed lung and surgery that
included the removal of a blood clot. Philly went just 7-5-3 over
its last 15 but salvaged a No. 5 seed by beating Boston in the
final game of the regular season. That might not be much of a coup,
because it set up a first-round series against a Toronto team that
scored a league-best 268 goals in support of Joseph, who won 35
games with a 2.56 GAA. The Flyers opted for John Vanbiesbrouck
(27-18-15, 2.18) in free agency last summer, and the goalie matchup
might decide which team upgraded the most.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prediction:  &LR; Maple Leafs in five. &QL;

ALBRIGHT URGES NO DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that it
would oppose any attempt in Congress to declare war officially
against Yugoslavia, insisting that such a move would help
destabilize Europe and further damage already strained U.S.-Russian
relations over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed that the NATO
alliance does not consider itself at war with the Yugoslav people
even though the alliance's bombardment of Serb military-related
targets throughout the country has continued for 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to derail a movement in the House to invoke the War
Powers Act and either declare war or withdraw U.S. forces from the
NATO operation, Albright said President Clinton would welcome
congressional support for the current ``military action.''
</P>
<P>
   But she suggested that it should take the form of a resolution
authored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., calling for the use of ``all
necessary force'' to drive Serb army and paramilitary units from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do strongly oppose a resolution that would call for a
declaration of war because we don't consider ourselves at war with
Yugoslavia or its people,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony came as Congress began to consider a $6.05 billion
emergency funding request from Clinton to help pay for the U.S.
portion of the NATO operation through the remainder of this fiscal
year if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans leaders said Tuesday that they hope to wrap up
consideration of the emergency request within the next two weeks.
But they said they hope to add substantially more funding to the
request and threatened to use the debate to bash Clinton's military
and foreign policies, not only in the Balkans but around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, for example, accused
the president of allowing military readiness to erode to a
``crisis'' point where U.S. forces cannot respond adequately to
challenges around the world. He also charged that the nation's top
military commanders had lied to Congress about the state of the
nation's defense capabilities because of political pressures from
the White House to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Describing U.S. military readiness as ``a national security
crisis'' that should be corrected with more Pentagon funding, Armey
suggested Congress might increase the president's request from $6
billion to at least $10 billion, which would be paid for from an
estimated $85 billion in budget surpluses this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the increased funding may force the GOP-led Congress to
re-evaluate plans to set aside all Social Security surpluses and to
cut taxes by $800 billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must first respond to what I believe is a critical,
dangerous emergency at this moment,'' Armey said. ``Then I'm going
to invite Congress to re-examine our priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate appropriations committees will begin
hearings Wednesday on the funding request, with initial votes on it
scheduled for next week. But a number of lawmakers said there was
no agreement over how much money or what specific programs to add
to the emergency spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions ranged from $4 billion in additional funding to as
much as $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever decision is made on funding, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said ``the American people need to understand
that it's coming out of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress began considering the emergency request as NATO
intensified its air attacks on Serb military targets Tuesday,
taking advantage of clear weather to zero in on Serb troops,
weapons and equipment in Kosovo. Allied planes also went after more
communications sites and other military facilities, including oil
and fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, allied officials
reported more ``disturbing'' incidents of Serb soldiers raping
ethnic Albanian women and using civilians as cover for some of
their military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters that Serb forces
are also shelling hillsides in an attempt ``to flush'' out hiding
Kosovar Albanians. He said once captured, they were either being
killed or placed in forced marches or on trains going to the
borders of Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said Kosovars are also being used as human shields and
forced to march in front of advancing Serb tanks with their hands
tied behind their backs. In addition, NATO officials said Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces are still carrying out mass
executions and forcing people from their homes with tear gas and
fire.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster NATO's assault on the Serbs, 24 U.S. Army Apache
attack helicopters will begin arriving in Albania Wednesday with
support troops and ground-based rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they would be deployed as soon as
possible and are expected to allow NATO to attack from low
altitudes in a way they have not yet done thus far in the allied
campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the White House, meanwhile, Clinton's top national security
advisers said the Apache deployment would harden the pressure on
Milosevic to succumb to NATO demands that he withdraw his forces
from Kosovo and allow the Kosovar refugees to return to their homes
under the protection of an international security force.
</P>
<P>
   They said NATO leaders would discuss how to bring more economic
pressure on Milosevic at the alliance's 50th anniversary meeting
beginning Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Great Britain are trying to persuade the
other allies to go along with an oil embargo that would cut off
Milosevic's ability to resupply his forces with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``His resupply of fuel has to be stopped, and we will take
measures to achieve that,'' said Defense Secretary William Cohen as
he joined with Albright and national security adviser Sandy Berger
in briefing reporters on the NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Albright described the alliance as ``rock solid'' on continuing
the Kosovo operation ``until this crisis ends on just and durable
terms.'' But she said there would be no negotiations with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic is responsible for the ``ethnic cleansing'
and all the depredations that are taking place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is that we are not going to negotiate with him.
We believe that the Serb people would be better served by having a
democratically elected government that represents their values,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also used the briefing to drive home the alliance's view
that the airstrikes are starting to pay off, despite reports that
Milosevic has sent additional army and police units into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the Serb forces think they have to put more
personnel in now shows that our campaign in fact is starting to
have an impact on them. ... As a matter of fact, they are running
short of refined petroleum. We have eliminated their refining
capacity. We have cut in half their ammunition production
capability,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NATO's claim that the air campaign is working, McCain
and other senators, who favor the use of ground troops, introduced
a resolution Tuesday that would authorize the president ``to use
all necessary force and other means'' to accomplish the NATO
objectives in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the resolution was postponed by Lott until next week.
McCain is running for president in the 2000 election.

 &HT;    Shootings bring up memories of past school horrors
 &HT;    By RacheL Sauer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday's shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton
reopened wounds for residents of several American towns and cities
that experienced similar tragedies in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1997, Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro,
Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; Fayetteville, Tenn.; and Springfield, Ore.,
all have had students and teachers shot in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases it's not just the lost innocence, the feeling of
``that happens in other towns, but not here.'' Many residents of
those towns lost their feeling that their city is a safe place to
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel secure until something like this happens,''
said Craighead County, Ark., Sheriff Jack McCann. ``You kind of sit
around wondering if it's going to happen again. And there's always
that feeling that you can't believe it's happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann said Jonesboro, a town of 51,000 on the Mississippi
River, drew closer together as a result of the March 24, 1998,
shooting rampage during which four junior high school girls and one
teacher died, ``but there's a lot of anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem for people I've talked to is there's never
been an answer to why. I think if anyone could ever answer why, it
would help a lot, but I don't think that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The two boys convicted of the killings will serve five and four
years, respectively, in a juvenile detention center, and unless
Arkansas builds a facility for juvenile offenders to keep them
until they're 21, they will be released at age 18. McCann said that
fact only adds to the anger and confusion that irritates wounds
trying to heal ``because they can go to Wal-Mart the day they get
out and buy a gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   West Paducah, too, has had roadblocks that stand in the way of
the city's ability to heal. Families of three of the students
killed in the Dec. 1, 1997, attack have filed three lawsuits. One
is a $130 million lawsuit against entertainment companies that
produce violent movies and computer games, but the other two name
as many as 42 city, county and school officials whom the families
say they believe could have prevented the tragedy, said McCracken
County Judge Executive Danny Orazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going through a healing process, passing
the first anniversary, going through the Michael Carneal trial (the
boy convicted in the three student deaths),'' Orazine said. ``We
thought surely this would be the end of it, but you don't ever get
completely over it and
</P>
<P>
   then something like (the lawsuits) comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Orazine and McCann said their school districts have
implemented strong security measures: in West Paducah, at least
four security guards patrol district schools on a rotating basis,
which didn't happen before, and Jonesboro got a federal grant to
have a full-time security officer at the school where the shootings
happened. West Paducah added a security system to the high school
so any visitor has to be admitted from inside.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Rich Harrison of the Springfield, Ore., Police Department
said the biggest impact the May 21, 1998, fatal shooting of two
teens had was to change the town's attitudes about what places are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ways of when you can send your child to school and feel
100 percent sure they're going to come home at night are no longer
there,'' Harrison said. ``One of the last places you could consider
safe for your child is school, and that's no longer true.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann and Orazine said the youth of their community seemed
ready to go back to school when the schools reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably was hard to go back, but I think kids are so
active, they've got so much life ahead of them, that they handle
their sorrow differently,'' Orazine said. ``School is where their
life is, and that's where they needed to heal, but the memories and
scars they'll always have.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said dealing with the tragedy wasn't just an issue for
those with ties to the school, ``it goes out to the whole
community,'' he said. ``It goes way past the parents and students.
You don't have to have a child at that school or know somebody who
goes there to be affected. We've had to work through this is a
community and that's probably what
</P>
<P>
   Littleton will have to do, too.''

 &HT;    Clergy members seek to make sense of tragedy
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ A Catholic church here Tuesday evening was
drawing people trying to make sense of the tragedy at Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dredon, a freshman at the school, stood next to the
baptismal font at Light of the World Catholic Church and
acknowledged to a friend that one of their best friends is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand how they could take a life like
that,'' he said. ``He never even lived his life. Now he is gone. I
just .. `` Then he dissolved into grief and was wrapped in the arms
of neighbors and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The church, about three miles from the high school, sits on a
hill overlooking the valley where the tragedy occurred. Members of
the Littleton community continued to stream into the church Tuesday
evening, passing by groups of students, faculty and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The living water (of church baptism( is real important to me
right now,'' said counselor Julie McGuire, as she helped usher
people into the gymnasium-sized church. ``That is all I can think
of now. Tonight it is grieving. Tomorrow it is life.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselors and American Red Cross officials stood outside the
church, plotting strategy. Inside, Deb Nickerson, a church
volunteer, stood behind a table that had pamphlets on mental health
information and sign- up sheets for donations and people willing to
cook meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who decided to do this,'' Nickerson said about
the meals. ``But people are just coming up and signing up without
question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded area outside the church, drivers parked their
cars wherever they could and many people milled about, not really
knowing what to say or do.

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO and Pentagon officials said Tuesday that
Serbian forces had begun driving ethnic Albanians from Montenegro,
signaling a widening of the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' actions appeared to be focused on Albanians who had
fled to Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro form what remains of the
former Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   But initial reports were sketchy and could not be confirmed on
the ground, or by other agencies monitoring developments in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the reports at a briefing in Brussels, NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea said: ``This is something rather new and distressful if
this pattern is now spilling over elsewhere into Yugoslavia. It can
only exacerbate the problem, which is already, as you know, of
alarming proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said NATO had evidence
suggesting for the first time that troops in Montenegro are driving
out Albanian refugees who had escaped from the Serbian campaign in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials also reported that NATO warplanes flew 603
missions in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, the highest
number in the four-week bombardment. Military officials said the
planes had attacked ammunition depots, an ammunition plant near
Belgrade, tanks, trucks and a high-level command post. For the
first time, NATO said it had destroyed a support site for Yugoslav
Frog surface-to-surface missiles, which have a range of 40 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Shea assailed Yugoslav authorities with the most grisly list of
reported executions, rapes and mass graves in Yugoslavia that the
alliance has issued so far. Among other horrors, Shea said Serbs
had taken about 700 Albanian youths, some as young as 14, ``either
to use as human shields or as blood banks for Serb casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   American and other allied officials have watched with growing
alarm as tensions intensify between the republican government in
Montenegro and the federal government of President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade. Montenegro, a poor mountainous region with a
population of 640,000, has been trying to forge economic ties with
the West while balking at control by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Montenegro no longer recognizes the legality
of Milosevic's regime. Its special forces have clashed with forces
from the Yugoslav Interior Ministry in recent days, and there have
been reports that the Serbs shelled refugee camps just inside
Montenegro. About 73,500 Kosovars have sought refuge in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence has reported other signs of a potential
widening of the war. For example, the Montenegrin government has
approached Croatia to buy anti-armor weapons and 2,000 sets of
fatigues for its security forces to distinguish them from the
Yugoslav military police.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, once also part of Yugoslavia, has cooperated with NATO
in its campaign, closing down an oil pipeline into Yugoslvia on
March 28.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been American intelligence reports that senior
officials in Montenegro have complained that the NATO air war has
been counterproductive, galvanizing nationalistic fervor in Serbia
and putting more pressure on the Montenegro government.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Romania's defense chiefs gave approval Tuesday
for NATO to cross its airspace if it decides to mount attacks from
the east. The decision will be put to the Parliament for a vote.
Bulgaria has already agreed to allow such overflights, though no
plans have been announced yet to use those corridors.
</P>
<P>
   And the first of 24 U.S. Army Apache helicopters remained
grounded in Italy Tuesday, awaiting clearer weather in Albania so
the aircraft and their supporting units can fly into makeshift,
mud-clogged landing areas there. Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior
officer on the Joint Staff, said the first Apaches should arrive in
Tirana, Albania, on Wednesday, barring more rain, and the remainder
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is still considering how to meet a request from
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the NATO military commander, for 300 more
American warplanes and support aircraft. Military officials have
not yet decided whether to divert the aircraft carrier Enterprise
and its 70 aircraft to the Aegean, and break a near-ironclad policy
of keeping sailors and pilots at sea no longer than six months at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise was sailing through the Suez Canal on Tuesday and
is expected to be in the Mediterranean by early Wednesday. Navy
Secretary Richard Danzig and Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval
operations, oppose extending the Enterprise's tour.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier Theodore Roosevelt is now in the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   Even as military officials said the air war is grinding down
Belgrade's ability to rearm and resupply its 40,000 troops in
Kosovo, NATO officials in Brussels described in gruesome detail the
atrocities reported from the besieged province.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said more than 3,500 ethnic Albanians had been executed as
part of a strategy by Milosevic to keep NATO off balance by
developing a ``surge capability that he can sort of switch on and
off as he desires whenever he wants to start a new flood of
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Kosovar refugees that Shea emphasized Tuesday
included the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Near Orahovac, as many as 700 Albanian men were used as human
shields last week. The men were forced to stand in front of tanks
in the rain for two days with their hands tied behind their heads.
A few eventually escaped by paying the soldiers 10,000 German
marks, about $5,400.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Pec, Serbian forces had rounded up young Albanian women and
taken them to a hotel where the local Yugoslav commander apparently
has organized a roster of his soldiers to allow them all an evening
at the hotel with the women.
</P>
<P>
   _ During Serbian raids in some villages, young women have been
gang-raped in the homes or on the roadside by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this will have to be investigated,'' Shea said. ``But
the reports are too numerous to suggest that these are completely
without foundation.''

CHINESE STOLE DATA ON ADVANCED WARHEAD, U.S. REPORT CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A comprehensive new analysis by U.S. intelligence
officials has concluded that China stole design information related
to the United States' most advanced nuclear warhead from a
government nuclear weapons laboratory, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence report is expected to be presented to the
Clinton administration and Congress on Wednesday. Previously, the
White House, citing other intelligence reports, had said that the
evidence of Chinese atomic espionage is less conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Energy Department officials have raised alarms about
evidence of Chinese espionage at the national weapons labs since
1996, a 1997 report by the CIA was used by the White House to
downplay the Energy officials' conclusions in the matter, officials
said. President Clinton also said as recently as last month that,
``It is my understanding that the investigation has not yet
determined for sure that espionage occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new assessment, the intelligence community reports on
damage done to national security from what it says is Chinese
nuclear spying. The report examines a key finding of a select
congressional committee that has investigated allegations of
illicit transfers of high technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   That committee, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
embraced the findings of Energy Department intelligence analysts
who concluded that China stole design data from the W-88 warhead
from Los Alamos in the 1980s and that the theft was critical to
Beijing's development of a modern, miniaturized nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that the new intelligence analysis includes
a broad examination of the development of China's nuclear weapons
capabilities over the last few decades. It determined that Beijing
benefited from espionage through the theft of W-88 design data from
Los Alamos. But it also found that China obtained some sensitive
nuclear data from nonsecret sources, including academic exchanges
and inadvertent leaks of information by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The new study comes in the midst of a furor over the
administration's early response to reports of Chinese atomic
espionage. Energy Department intelligence analysts initially
detected the theft in 1995, and senior White House officials,
including Samuel Berger, now the national security adviser, were
first briefed on the matter in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did not move to increase security at
national laboratories until nearly two years later. After receiving
more detailed evidence of Chinese spying in the summer of 1997, the
National Security Council sought a quick, narrowly focused analysis
from the CIA and used it to cast doubt on the troubling conclusions
reached by Energy Department analysts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Samore, a senior NSC official, relied on that CIA analysis
in September 1997 as the basis for his report to Berger that the
evidence of Chinese espionage was less conclusive than the Energy
Department had said, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Samore and Berger were deeply involved in planning
the agenda of a U.S.-Chinese summit meeting. Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin used the meeting to elevate the relations
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the White House itself has examined whether
Samore accurately portrayed for Berger the findings of the 1997
reports from the CIA and Energy Department, officials said. Berger
has been told that Samore overstated the degree to which the CIA
1997 analysis cast doubt on the Energy Department findings,
according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   An NSC spokesman, David Leavy, said Berger had the utmost
confidence in Samore's abilities, but Leavy declined to discuss the
nature of the discussions between Samore and Berger in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NSC, from Mr. Berger on down, viewed this as a very
serious matter then, and we view it as a very serious matter now,''
said Leavy. ``Mr. Berger believes Gary Samore is an enormously
dedicated professional who has spent his entire career on
nonproliferation issues and enhancing the security of the American
people, and whose integrity is unquestioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior intelligence officials now say that, while there were
differences, the 1997 CIA and Energy Department reports came to
generally similar conclusions about the damage done by Chinese
nuclear spying.
</P>
<P>
   Notra Trulock, an Energy Department intelligence official who
was in charge of analyzing the espionage evidence, told the Senate
Armed Services Committee last week that a ``even a cursory reading
of the products of both agencies will show that in fact there are
very few areas of disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Trulock added that ``these supposed differences have been
magnified by NSC and DOE officials in an effort to spin down the
potential implications of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new U.S. intelligence community study has looked at the
issue more thoroughly at the urging of the Cox committee, which has
written a still-secret report that includes information about the
theft of the W-88 design. The details of the intelligence
community's damage assessment could not be determined in advance of
Wednesday's scheduled release. Moreover, much of the study will
remain classified. Officials would not say today whether the report
addresses evidence that China has stolen other U.S. nuclear designs
more recently.
</P>
<P>
   The damage assessment, which was coordinated by Robert Walpole,
the national intelligence officer for strategic and nuclear
programs, was independently reviewed by an outside panel headed by
retired Adm. David Jeremiah.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Chinese nuclear spying has prompted a series of
investigations in both Congress and the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, General Accounting Office officials told a House
Commerce subcommittee that the national laboratories had showed ``a
lack of attention'' to grave security risks despite years of
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 20 years, we have performed numerous reviews of
security that, unfortunately, show serious weaknesses'' that have
led to ``losses of classified or sensitive information and
technology,'' Victor Rezendes, the GAO's director of energy,
resources and science issues, told lawmakers Tuesday. ``The recent
revelations about espionage bring to light how ingrained security
problems are at DOE.''

ALWAYS ASKING, WHAT IS THIS REALLY ABOUT?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Nichols is thinking about the early days with Elaine May.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did when we started was based on our student life at
the University of Chicago, so it was all so referential,'' he said,
in the droll, precise purr that makes him sound like the world's
smartest Cheshire cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were the 100 greatest books and everyone was reading
Dostoyevsky and listening to Mozart operas, and our work was all
about references and context. The interesting and strange thing
about life now is that there's no longer any context, because
there's not much of a past. The past is forgotten. I plan to do
`Titanic' again in a couple of years and everyone will say, `How
awful! So many lives lost!'''
</P>
<P>
   Our cultural life may no longer have a past, but Nichols
certainly does, having moved from comic duologues with Ms. May to
theater (winning seven Tony's as a Broadway director and one as a
producer) to film. Certainly does. He will be honored by the Film
Society of Lincoln Center on May 3 with an annual lifetime
achievement award that first went to Charlie Chaplin in 1972 and
was given to Martin Scorsese last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a recognition of 33 years of filmmaking that began with
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' in 1966, earned him an Oscar for
``The Graduate'' in 1967 and included films like ``Carnal
Knowledge,'' ``Silkwood,'' ``Working Girl'' and ``Primary Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Nichols thinks of the Lincoln Center event
more in terms of its stagecraft than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run out of geezers very fast if you do those honors
things,'' said Nichols, now 67, elongating chosen syllables like
stretched taffy. ``Elaine made a brilliant and famous speech at one
of them. She got up and said, `I love Michael because when we split
up, he always sent me a little money every month, and it made a big
difference. Recently, I've been able to make a little money on my
own by having sex with some of the guys in my building. Nothing
big. But just enough to get back my self-respect.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the award is a convenient marker for one of the more
iconoclastic careers in popular entertainment. Nichols, after all,
is the consummate New Yorker in a world defined by Los Angeles, an
intellectual who has been a success in popular culture, and an
immigrant outsider whose great gift has been to get to the heart of
American life.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, in a customary locution that skips from a small
personal observation to a big elusive thought, recalls his surprise
recently when a friend gave him a letter that Nichols wrote him
back in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at that letter because it was me already, me like
I am right here,'' Nichols said. ``Maya Angelou says this really
good thing, `When people tell you who they are, believe them the
first time.' `I didn't inhale.' What the hell were we thinking? He
told us who he is, and we paid no attention. If you pay attention,
people are telling us who they are all the time. You don't have to
judge, but you should pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   And an overview of his career is a reminder that Nichols' life
and work reflect so indelible a genetic fingerprint that the far
bigger surprise would be if the Mike Nichols of 23 and the Mike
Nichols of 67 didn't seem so much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has always thought in terms of `What is it really
about?''' said Ms. May, long since reunited with Nichols as a
screenwriter, most recently on ``Primary Colors.'' ``Whatever he
does, he makes about (italics)something.(end italics) `Working
Girl' was a wonderful little comedy, but it was really about
something. `The Graduate' was about something. His peculiar way of
looking at the world, his own tilt of the head, is always his
ability to find what things are really about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931. His
father was a Russian internist. His mother was part of a
distinguished German literary family. The family fled the Nazis,
Nichols coming over in 1939. When he arrived, he spoke only two
English sentences, ``I do not speak English,'' and ``Please, do not
kiss me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had no hair because of a rare reaction to a shot for whooping
cough, and found everything in America, Coca-Cola, Chiclets, Rice
Krispies _ foods that made strange noises or were meant to be
chewed, not swallowed _ as alien as moon rocks. On top of that, his
father died of leukemia a few years later when he was 12. He was,
in short, the ultimate outsider looking in at American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an immigrant's ear that is particularly acute
for `How are they doing it here? What must I do to be unnoticeable,
to be like them?''' he said. ``At its highest and most extreme
form, it leads to great artists like Joseph Conrad and Stoppard and
Nabokov. They've somehow both digested a new language and culture
and made it more expressive in some way. You're forever looking at
something as someone who just got here.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to private schools, Dalton and the Cherry Lawn School in
Connecticut, and was then given a scholarship to the University of
Chicago. He began as a pre-med student, planning to become a
psychiatrist, until he soon found he could not be in the same room
with a cadaver.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he found himself sharing a bench with a female student
he had recently been introduced to. He and Ms. May immediately
began improvising an encounter between two spies, and one of
comedy's legendary duos was born.
</P>
<P>
   That led to their being in Chicago's Compass Players, later to
become the Second City, and then to their stage partnership, which
ended in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He was left adrift, feeling, as he once said, like ``the
left-over half of something.'' He spent a year as an unattached
planet in New York's smart set of the moment, until he was hired to
direct Neil Simon's ``Barefoot in the Park'' with Robert Redford
and Elizabeth Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   He won Tony Awards for that in 1964 and, remarkably, for both
``Luv'' and ``The Odd Couple'' the next year, and was Broadway's
director of choice until turning to film, first with ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?'' and then with ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he went through three marriages before finally
settling down happily with the newswoman Diane Sawyer, and he made
it through a horrific episode in the 1980s when a prolonged
reaction to the drug Halcion, prescribed for sleep after minor
heart surgery, left him delusional, convinced that he had lost all
his money and was being subjected to some form of retribution for
having escaped the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nichols seems none the worse for wear; he is so skilled a
conversationalist and raconteur that Ms. Sawyer reflects the
consensus when she says, ``Sometimes I feel I should be paying
admission.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I remember one dinner where Elaine looked at Mike
and said, `You know what bothers me about God?' And Mike, without a
pause, said, `That he hates arrogance so much, but doesn't seem to
mind cruelty.' My mouth dropped open and my head fell into the
mashed potatoes, and she just said, `Exactly.'''
</P>
<P>
   He shows up for lunch at the media hangout Trattoria dell'Arte
in midtown, dressed in black linen jacket, black silk shirt, white
pants and black loafers, a little paunchier than he used to be, but
with a ruddy, ageless look that suggests one part elfin charmer and
one part Romanov prince.

 &HT;    Experts say some school crises can be avoided
 &HT;    By Ted Taylor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Schools, if they would just take the
time, have the power to help stop
</P>
<P>
   school violence, two national experts on the subject said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes a day is all it would take, said Scott Poland,
director of psychological services for the Cypress Fairbanks School
District in Houston, Texas, and an expert on school crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take 30 minutes out of the school day to work on
problem solving, anger management and violence prevention,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have to lengthen the school day to do it. The
answers to youth violence are complex,'' he said, ``and we must
address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools also must concentrate on the three ``Ps'' to ensure a
safe learning environment, said Pamela Riley, executive director of
the Center for the Prevention of School Violence, based in Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   While Riley concedes that incidents like Tuesday's shooting in
Littleton could happen anywhere, proactive measures to make sure
they don't can be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools need to be actively involved in safe school planning
efforts,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, in a telephone interview from a Winston-Salem television
station, said a school's place, including the lighting and access
to school grounds, need to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure students feel safe. Sometimes metal
detectors or cameras are needed,'' she said. ``You need to make a
way to secure the physical environment of the school but not turn
the school into a
</P>
<P>
   prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a former high school principal, also said schools needed
to provide positive relationships within the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students must have a feeling of comfort or trust,'' she said.
``When a student hears of a threat or suspects something ... they
need to be able to feel like they can tell someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she said, the true purpose of schooling needs to be
readdressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of schooling is teaching and learning,'' she said,
``not drug dealing and bringing guns to school. ``We need to
provide educators with the opportunity to get back to the business
of education and let law enforcement do their job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   School District 51 has taken a step in the right direction by
installing uniformed school resource officers in its buildings,
Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't always mean a school will be free of violence.
Columbine High School had not only a SRO, but video surveillance
cameras as well.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been a quiet year, Riley said, in terms of
schoolyard violence. The last incident similar to Tuesday happened
in May of last year when a 15-year-old shot and killed his parents
and two classmates
</P>
<P>
   in Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The respite, albeit relatively short, Riley said, showed schools
were understanding the need to look further at safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools have addressed the issues,'' she said. ``But there are
no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   The only guarantee, Poland said, is that Tuesday's massacre will
forever change those involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school and community is going to be tortured by the why
and how this could have occurred,'' he said.

 NEW YORK: Romanov prince.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And, over his seafood salad, Nichols rattles on with casual
eloquence about just about anything, from his favorite film (George
Stevens's ``Place in the Sun'') to his favorite ``Seinfeld'' (the
one where they are all lost in an endless parking garage) to the
entirely accidental way the seemingly perfect ending to ``The
Graduate'' evolved (a tribute more to the directorial unconscious
than brilliant foresight).
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, his disquisition on the Big Soap Opera,
his term for the non-stop cavalcade of media extravaganzas that
have become the culture's leading form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Soap Opera now exists in the space in which we used to
have, for want of a better word, art, fiction,'' he said. ``The Big
Soap Opera has appropriated metaphor, and one of its dangers is
that we tend to look at actual events as if they were a narrative.
Diana was heartbreaking, but it had such an effective, powerful
ending. The Senate investigation of Clinton took too long. I think
people in the polls were voting their irritation. Give us Monica as
the girl in the red velvet swing. That's what we have now. You hear
stories about Monica having had too many drinks at the Academy
Awards party and you think: `Right! That's it. That's the coda for
the story.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have something we haven't had for a long time, a
chapter of The Big Soap Opera based on something that is actually
happening, which is Kosovo. Usually, what we have is journalism
masquerading as events. It seems to be the most important thing
that's happening but, of course, it's carefully chosen out of
hundreds of thousands of things as the most powerful metaphor
going. It makes it much harder if you deal with fiction and
metaphor in your work because it's tough to compete with.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols ran into that most painfully with ``Primary Colors,''
his film of Joe Klein's anonymous roman a clef about Bill Clinton's
presidential campaign. The movie received wonderful reviews, came
out, as if choreographed, at the grand opening of the Monica
Lewinsky episode, but flopped at the box office. Apparently people
got enough of the story free on television without having to go out
and buy movie tickets.
</P>
<P>
   He is asked whether his film career ever led him to ponder a
move to Los Angeles, a question he greets with a pained expression,
as if he had been asked to recall a particularly bad meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' he said. ``There's a virus I have no protection
against if I'm there: How am I perceived? And you can do whatever
you like, put towels at the bottom of the door, not read the
trades, which I have not done for 35 years, if you're there long
enough, you will think, `But how am I perceived?' If you're
vulnerable to the virus, you've got to stay away from its matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't New York breed its own strain?
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a shrug,'' he said with a shrug. ``The thing about
status is there is always someone higher. You can finally refine it
down to two or three people _ only the Agnellis and the Mellons are
really worthy _ but it has no real meaning. In New York there are
too many people, too many movies, too many theaters, too many
restaurants, too much sex for status to ever make a difference
except to a few people high up on Fifth Avenue who care about it.
But no one knows who they are, and no one cares about what they
care about.''
</P>
<P>
   This, no doubt, is easy to say when you are Mike Nichols, you
are married to Diane Sawyer, and you do so many things well (except
roller skate, says Ms. May). His friend Nora Ephron says that when
she watches Nichols act, which he has done occasionally over the
years _ most recently in ``The Designated Mourner'' _ she sometimes
worries that ``the greatest actor of our time has spent his career
as a director.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nichols' place in the cinematic pecking order, it is hard
to be sure. A critical assessment might be that every Mike Nichols
film comes pre-certified for intelligence, wit and style, and few
directors have such a gift for getting performances out of actors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a would-be psychiatrist, Nichols' directing style is
like an elegant form of transference, where he schmoozes about his
own life and in the process invariably jars loose something in the
actors' experience.
</P>
<P>
   But Nichols made his biggest splash with his earliest films and
with ``Silkwood'' in 1983. And he has surely had his share of duds
too, like ``Day of the Dolphin,'' ``The Fortune,'' ``Wolf'' and,
most famously, ``Catch 22.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Among all the movies I've made, it's the one where I would
have done a number of things differently,'' he said of ``Catch
22.'' ``I would do it funnier, looser. I somehow found a style for
it that took care of the despairing and surrealistic aspects of it,
but discouraged the comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But personally, he says he's happier than he has ever been. He,
as always, has movies ideas stacked up like jets over La Guardia
and says he's thinking for the first time in years of perhaps
directing some plays as well. His next film is ``What Planet Are
You From?'' starring Gary Shandling as an extra-terrestrial sent to
earth to impregnate a female human for world domination.
</P>
<P>
   After that is likely to be a remake of the 1949 Alec Guinness
classic ``Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' which he describes as a
comedy about a serial killer, being written by Ms. May and starring
Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And he is producing the film of Cormac McCarthy's ``All the
Pretty Horses.'' So, with his New York shrug, he figures he has
better things to do than worry about where he stands in anyone's
film pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was directing Orson Welles in `Catch 22,' he once told
me, `All those questions about where we fit, who comes first and
who's second, leave that to them.' And when, very occasionally, in
the middle of the night, I start thinking along those lines, I
think: I'll never know. It's not important. It's nothing I can do
anything about. And whatever my answer is, it's completely
immaterial. Who was it that said: `I'm the bird. You're the
ornithologist.' That's my answer.''

NEW HOLBROOKE INQUIRY BEGINS, THIS TIME ON LECTURE FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department inspector general has opened a
new investigation of Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee
as chief U.S. diplomat to the United Nations, and is examining
whether he improperly accepted thousands of dollars for making
speeches about the Balkans when he was a special envoy to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the new inquiry could further delay
Senate confirmation hearings for Holbrooke, whose nomination was
held up for nearly eight months by an ethics investigation by the
Justice Department and the State Department. That inquiry ended in
February, when Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to settle civil
charges that he had violated lobbying laws in his contacts with the
U.S. Embassy in South Korea after having resigned from the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The latest inquiry was prompted by the publication in March of
an Op-Ed article in The Washington Post by Philip L. Christenson, a
former congressional official, according to government officials.
Christenson questioned whether it was right for Holbrooke and other
part-time envoys to receive money for speeches related to their
government work.
</P>
<P>
   After the State Department formally named Holbrooke as an unpaid
special envoy for the Balkans in October, he continued to collect
speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he delivered a speech at Stanford University, for
which he was paid $16,000. According to an article in the
university newspaper, Holbrooke used the speech to discuss his work
in trying to negotiate a peace agreement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He gave at least two other paid speeches after his appointment
as a special envoy, to the Siemens electronics company for $24,000
in October and to Pepsico for $20,000 in December. The topics of
the speeches could not be immediately determined.
</P>
<P>
   The question for State Department Inspector General Jacquelyn
Williams-Bridgers, is whether the acceptance of the speaking fees
violates federal ethics rules that bar government employees,
including special envoys, from accepting outside compensation
``that relates to the employee's official duties.''
</P>
<P>
   A violation of the rules can result in administrative penalties
like reprimands and dismissals. It is unclear how those penalties
would apply to Holbrooke as an unpaid part-time government
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said through a spokeswoman that he had no comment on
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Holbrooke who insisted on anonymity said, ``We're
confident that Richard Holbrooke followed the guidelines regarding
speeches and we're looking forward to his confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to recent disclosure statements filed by Holbrooke
with the government Ethics Office, he received $205,000 in speaking
fees last year, in addition to his $1,153,000 salary as an
investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   He also received $166,000 in advances for his book ``To End a
War,'' about his work at the State Department in 1995 to stop the
war in Bosnia. Holbrooke resigned from the State Department in 1996
to join the investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend of Holbrooke said he was highly likely to argue
that his speeches late last year were related to his book and his
work in the Balkans long before his appointment in October as a
special envoy. The news about the new investigation was reported as
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department
appeared close to an agreement to rescue the nomination, which had
most recently bogged down over an unrelated dispute over
legislation to reform the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Inspector General's office, Linda
Topping, would not confirm that a new investigation was under way
or offer any other comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a congressional official said Ms. Williams-Bridgers notified
the Foreign Relations Committee on Monday that she had opened a new
inquiry and that she hoped to complete it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the committee, which is
weighing Holbrooke's nomination, had no comment about a new
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But his spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said, ``The committee would be
shirking its responsibility if we allowed this nomination to go
forward before all the ethics questions have been answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Thiessen said the committee had not received a variety of
documents that it had requested from the State and Justice
departments about the earlier inquiry. ``We haven't had what we
would call full cooperation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany who was the architect
of the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 that ended the war in Bosnia,
has found himself as a case study for the ethical minefields faced
by former officials who agree to return to work for the government
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier investigation, prompted by an anonymous letter to
the State Department inspector general, focused in part on
allegations that Holbrooke had illegally lobbied his former
government colleagues, shortly after resigning from the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to the $5,000 settlement with the Justice
Department, Holbrooke denied wrongdoing and insisted that he had
agreed to the settlement only to avoid further delay in his
nomination.

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES REBOUND FROM MONDAY'S SELLOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of technology companies rebounded in heavy
trading Tuesday after Monday's huge selloff, and investors were
seen moving out of economically sensitive cyclical stocks, like
industrial and oil companies, which have been rallying for a week
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which is laden with technology
issues, recovered 64.03 points of its 138-point loss on Monday and
closed at 2,409.64, up 2.7 percent. And Thestreet.com's Internet
index, which fell 16 percent on Monday, jumped 35.14 points
Tuesday, or 6.3 percent, to 595.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, on the other hand, edged up
8.02 points, or less than one-tenth of a percent, to 10,448.55.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week or so of trading created a lot of extremes,''
said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``The sharp decline in leadership stocks like technology
and rise in cyclical and value stocks created a short-term
overbought/oversold excess. Today, stocks that were most oversold
had a bounce, and stocks that were bought have had some
correction.''
</P>
<P>
   A sharp rebound in stocks like America Online, Microsoft and
Dell Computer helped to push the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
up 16.69 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,306.17.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks also staged a slight recovery. At the close, the
Russell 2000 index was up 2.93 points, or seven-tenths of a
percent, to 415.34.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was heavy, with 985.4 million shares changing hands on
the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq market, volume was 1.13
billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in technology shares and the decline in cyclical and
value stocks did little to resolve debate about whether the
market's leaders have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday's selloff in technology was not so much of a top as it
was a correction in excesses,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Technology was priced for
perfection going into the earnings season and cyclicals suddenly
came out of the shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell 6.5 percent on Monday, rebounded Tuesday,
rising 2 1/8, to 83 1/8. After the market closed, the software
giant reported earnings for its third quarter that were better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which have also been battered lately, staged a
recovery Tuesday after Johnson &AMP; Johnson reported first-quarter
profits that exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson was the best-performing Dow stock, gaining 6,
to 96 1/4. Merck, another Dow component, gained 2 1/8, to 75 1/4.
And Abbott Labs rose 3 5/16, to 50 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of extreme price movement in
pharmaceuticals,'' Olesky said. ``All of it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors chose to take profits in economically
sensitive stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 2 5/8, to 81 5/8. Alcoa,
which is up more than 40 percent since the start of the year,
dropped 1 13/16 Tuesday, to 52 7/8. And big oil stocks like Exxon,
Royal Dutch Petroleum and Chevron all declined despite another rise
in spot oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's pullback, ``I think you will see more strength
in these sorts of industrial stocks,'' said Richard McCabe, chief
market analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``A lot of these big stocks
have spent the last year or more going sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, which plunged on Monday, recovered some ground
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   America Online rose 12 13/16, to 128 11/16. Inktomi gained 26,
to 115, after analysts at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. put the stock on the
firm's ``recommend'' list. Doubleclick gained 24 3/16, to 128 3/16;
E-Trade rose 16, to 89 13/16, and Amazon.com rose 13 1/16, to 172.

MICROSOFT SAYS EARNINGS OUTDO EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sailing above the price wars that have battered personal
computer makers, Microsoft Corp. reported third-quarter earnings
Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reiterated warnings that growth could slow in coming
quarters if companies defer technology purchases because of the
Year 2000 problem. But company officials said sales to Asian
markets had recovered, partly because of increased spending by the
Japanese government. Sales in Latin America, particularly Mexico
and Brazil, remain depressed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended March 31, Microsoft reported earnings of
$1.92 billion, or 35 cents a diluted share, up 43 percent from
$1.34 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 15 percent, to $4.33 billion from $3.77 billion. The
per-share figures reflect March's stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Microsoft to earn 32 cents a share,
according to First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the results were released, shares of Microsoft closed at
$83.125, up $2.125, and helped lead a rebound in technology issues
after Monday's broad selloff. But in after-hours trading, Microsoft
slipped to $82.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quarter did not have the kind of huge positive
surprise Microsoft has delivered in the past, analysts said it was
still a solid performance that should reassure technology investors
about the health of the overall computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's results again appeared unaffected by the Justice
Department's antitrust suit, which is in recess. The company also
appeared not to suffer from the much-delayed shipment of Windows
2000 as sales of the current product, Windows NT 4.0, continued to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's consistent success has a bit of a monotony about
it,'' said David Readerman, an analyst with Thomas Weisel &AMP;
Partners. ``Despite being in a bit of a product drought, with
Office 2000 just shipping now and Windows 2000 maybe by the end of
the year, they continue to crank it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter's revenue does not include unearned revenue of $400
million related to Microsoft's Office 2000 Technology Guarantee, a
program that enables buyers of Office 97 to upgrade to the new
program. This revenue will be recognized in coming quarters.
Microsoft also realized investment gains of more than $350 million
during the quarter because of unspecified stock sales.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chief financial officer Greg Maffei said in a
telephone interview that these two special items essentially
canceled each other out in terms of earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said the well-known problems of PC vendors like Compaq
Computer Corp. or IBM did not reflect weakening demand over all.
Microsoft, whose Windows 98 program runs on 90 percent of new
personal computers, saw a 29 percent increase in sales of operating
systems and applications preinstalled on new computers. Most of
this was due to increased PC shipments, but some was due to a shift
to Windows NT, which costs more, and more application sales, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to speak ill of our partners, but I think they had their
own operational ills in each case that do not speak to the overall
health of the market,'' Maffei said. ``A few highly visible guys
might have had less than stellar results, but I don't think that
speaks to overall demand. There was a lot of talk that the PC
market is in deep decline, but we didn't see that,'' he said.
Microsoft expects PC shipments to grow 16 percent to 17 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had forecast that revenue would decline by about $300
million from its second quarter; the company beat that forecast by
about $100 million. Looking forward, Maffei said Microsoft expected
fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to grow by about $500 million
compared with the third quarter, reflecting the release of Office
2000, which began shipping in April. That would correspond to
year-over-year revenue growth in the low to mid-20 percent range,
with earnings-per-share growth of about 40 percent, he said.

CHELIOS CHANGES HIS TUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Much has been made of Chris Chelios' past battles with
Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, but he went out of his way Tuesday
to praise the Anaheim standouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two great players,'' he said. ``You try to contain
them, but they are going to get their opportunities. Everybody is
aware of them, you just do the best you can.
</P>
<P>
   Chelios, now of the Detroit Red Wings, did his share of hacking
and slashing at Kariya while a member of the Chicago Blackhawks,
but he couldn't say enough nice things about Kariya on the eve of
the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the respect in the world for him,'' Chelios said.
``He's a great player, a great ambassador for the game and
soft-spoken kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelios also insisted that he would be doing nothing out of the
ordinary to stop him, especially since the Ducks' power play is so
lethal and the two-referee system will be in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be real disciplined, you've got to play it by
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough Ducks? Detroit winger Kris Draper has been quoted as
saying Kariya and Selanne don't like to be hit, but Red Wings
teammate Darren McCarty doesn't think they can be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They battle in the corners for loose pucks, plus they are
tough to hit,'' he said. ``I think the best way to combat them is
to deny them the puck. If you try to run them, you'll just end up
taking a stupid penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg said his two offensive standouts
thrive on rough play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and Teemu have played their best when it has been nasty
and intense,'' he said. ``I'm sure it's going to be like that, so
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit has great players and we are going to do our best to
hit and bang them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya certainly didn't back down when asked about being hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the physical part of the game; it gets me into the
game, gets me focused,'' said Kariya, who shattered his career high
in penalty minutes with 40 this season. ``They can think whatever
they want, it's a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya was involved in a scuffle with San Jose's Alexander
Korolyuk last Saturday and the former Lady Byng winner (for
gentlemenly play) was called for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   Some were calling it his first fight, but when asked about that,
Chelios laughed and said, ``That was no fight.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tally tandem: Selanne (107 points) and Kariya (101), finished
second and third in scoring behind Jaromir Jagr's 127.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Oluasson finished fourth in points by a defenseman with
56. His 16 goals was second to Al McInnis' 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks finished with three of the top four in power play
points. Selanne led the league with 54, while Kariya and Olausson
tied for third with 43. Selanne also led the league in power-play
goals (25).

TWO OPEN FIRE, THROW GRENADES IN COLO. SCHOOL; 25 MAY BE DEAD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) (With COLO-SCHOOL-SCENE, COLO-SCHOOL-SUSPECTS) 
 (mb) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Two young men invaded a suburban high school
here at lunch time, killing as many as 25 people and wounding at
least another 20, authorities said. The two were later found dead
in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   Sowing mayhem, the gunmen threw grenades and shot students and
teachers as they moved through Columbine High School, beginning at
11:30 a.m., from the parking lot to the library and then to the
cafeteria. Students who saw them and escaped said one suspect was a
student and another was a dropout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw two kids in trench coats with guns,'' said Chris
Weischer, a reference to a group of students that some students
called ``the trench coat mafia.'' Weischer was one of several
students freed by SWAT teams four hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, FBI agents and police SWAT teams were still
moving through the school, searching for more victims and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood was going all over,'' one shaken girl said as she was
comforted by her father. Recalling the carnage in the school
library, she said, ``They were saying that they wanted Judas for
their revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers brought out one young man in handcuffs, but a sheriff's
spokesman later said it was believed that he was a friend of the
gunmen and did not take part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a nightmare as ambulances ferried
injured and dying students through this middle-class suburb
southwest of Denver past tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a
packed student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared,'' Liza Madden, a 16-year-old sophomore, said
after making her escape. ``Every time I heard gun shots I was
crying. I was so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   After police used a fire truck and an armored car to get close
to the building, dozens of students raced from the two-story
building, some slipping in the mud, others holding up their hands
in the air. The police later said they feared that the shooters
would try to escape by mingling with the fleeing students.
</P>
<P>
   One bloodied youth, an arm hanging limply from his side, broke
out a window on the second floor and climbed down into the hands of
waiting police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the hundreds of the law-enforcement officers who
responded to the carnage established a wide perimeter around the
school, stunned students and school workers gathered on nearby
streets and told of the chaos and horror.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase. Trapped
inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms and a choir
room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who barricaded herself in a bathroom said,
``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, Jonathan Ladd, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live by Denver television stations, without
commercial breaks all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Several trapped students used cellular telephones to call
television stations when they could not get through to authorities
on 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student told KUSA, a Denver television station, in a frightened
whisper. Identifying himself only as James, he added ``There are a
bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said, ``I am staying upstairs,'' then hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens said before going
to the school. The governor, who has a 16-year-old daughter who
attends a different high school in suburban Denver, said, ``We have
to ask ourselves what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon, the police briefly detained three youths in a
nearby park who were wearing camouflage pants and black jackets.
After they were released, the three said they knew the gunmen.
Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket were the words, ``Ban
Religion'' and a stop sign printed over a cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wearing masks, they were members of the `Trench Coat
Mafia,' '' said David Mesch, another student, who was searching for
his mother, an employee at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the American people will be praying for the students,
the parents and the teachers,'' President Clinton said from the
White House as television images showed police officers training
shotguns on the school.
</P>
<P>
   Those here were reminded of other recent school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the seventh time it has happened,'' one student,
Bob Sapin, told a television station minutes after watching the two
gunmen shoot students. ``I just can't believe it is happening at my
school.''

NEW LOW-FARE AIRLINE TO BUY AIRBUS INDUSTRIE JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) (jt) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Air, a start-up airline that plans to offer low-fare service
from Kennedy International Airport in New York beginning early next
year, has decided to buy narrow-body jets made by Europe's Airbus
Industrie, dealing a blow to the Boeing Corp.'s competing 737 jet.
</P>
<P>
   New Air is expected to sign a deal with Airbus as early as
Wednesday. The agreement includes firm orders for 25 A320 jets and
options and purchase rights for 50 more jets in the A320 family,
which includes the smaller A319 and the larger A321. If New Air
bought all 75 planes at list prices, the deal would be valued at
more than $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sale by Airbus, the jet consortium jointly owned by four
European companies, based in Toulouse, France, is particularly
painful to Boeing because virtually every major executive at New
Air came from carriers that fly the 737.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this, we fully expected to choose the 737,'' said
David Neeleman, the founder and chief executive of the airline,
which is calling itself New Air until it picks a flashier brand
name. Neeleman previously ran Morris Air, a low-fare carrier based
in Salt Lake City that flew only 737s. ``The more we took a look at
that airplane,'' he added, referring to the A320, ``the more we
liked it. There was unanimity among our management team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 737 was introduced in the mid-1960s. There are more than
3,300 flying today, making it the most successful commercial
airplane of all time, according to Boeing. But the A320, which was
born in the mid-1980s, has been rapidly gaining ground in recent
years. Last year, Boeing delivered the first of a new, updated
version of the 737 in order to slow the A320s advance.
</P>
<P>
   The new plane has been very successful despite several crashes
of older models for which safety officials have blamed the rudder
design. Boeing is now making a record 27 737s every month. But
studies show that the A320 has a slight edge over the 737 in new
orders and future deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Airbus delivered its 1,000th A320. In the
last year, key Boeing customers such as British Airways, UAL's
United Airlines and U S Airways have chosen the A320 over the 737.
Tuesday, Airbus announced that CIT Group, an aircraft leasing
company in New Jersey that owns mostly Boeing airplanes, had
ordered 25 planes in the A320 family.
</P>
<P>
   Both Airbus and Boeing were eager to capture New Air because
they knew whatever plane the airline chose would most likely be a
lifetime commitment. As a low-fare carrier, New Air wants to use
only one type of jet to save money on maintenance and training.
</P>
<P>
   Most low-fare carriers, notably Southwest Airlines, the nation's
largest and most successful, rely exclusively on the 737. Southwest
announced Tuesday that it had exercised options to buy six more
737s.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it will probably never be able to sell a plane to
rapidly growing Southwest still rankles Airbus. In an interview
last month, John Leahy, Airbus' senior vice president in charge of
sales, said that New Air was particularly attractive because it
would allow Airbus to showcase the A320 in New York, one of the
world's media capitals. He also predicted that Boeing would have to
build yet another version of the 737 to keep up with Airbus, a
notion Boeing has dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman said that Airbus offered very good terms for the jets.
``The price got our attention, and the product put us over the
edge,'' he said. ``We became very convinced that this was the
airplane for us regardless of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman said that he was won over by the fact that the A320
cabin is seven inches wider than the 737 cabin, allowing for
greater passenger comfort and larger overhead storage bins. He was
also impressed by Airbus' cockpit technology and the fact that the
A320 in the all-coach configuration required by New Air carries 24
more passengers than the 737, for a total of 162.
</P>
<P>
   New Air plans to power the jets with engines made by
International Aero Engines, a consortium that includes United
Technologies' Pratt &AMP; Whitney unit and Rolls-Royce.

N.J. CONGRESSMAN LEAVES BELGRADE AFTER ``MYSTERY'' MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., left Yugoslavia Tuesday
after spending more than two days in Belgrade meeting with high
government officials on an unofficial mission whose purpose remains
a mystery to most of official Washington and even to some of his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement released Tuesday, Saxton described his trip
as a ``fact-finding mission,'' but declined to elaborate. ``It has
been an informative trip, but I am happy to be coming home,'' he
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Official Yugoslav news agencies have reported that Saxton, who
is from Mount Holly in southern New Jersey and who arrived in
Belgrade on Sunday, met with the Yugoslav foreign minister and the
president of the foreign affairs committee of the Yugoslav
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The official newspaper Politika also reported that Saxton toured
areas where NATO bombs had damaged civilian property, and that he
was traveling with an aide, Joseph Bodansky. Saxton sits on the
House Armed Forces Committee and is chairman of the House Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. Bodansky is an aide
on the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Saxton said they could not confirm those reports.
Although Saxton has been in daily contact with them, they said he
had been unwilling to tell them details of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington said Saxton's trip had taken them by
surprise. One of the few officials Saxton consulted beforehand was
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who advised him not to go, a
spokesman for the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker cautioned him that this is very, very dangerous,
since we are bombing over there,'' the spokesman, John Feehery,
said. He added, ``We're pretty sketchy on all the details of the
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional officials said they thought Saxton had gone
to Yugoslavia in hopes of negotiating the release of the three
American soldiers being held by Yugoslav forces. But Saxton's
spokesman denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Saxton did not travel to Yugoslavia to secure or
negotiate the release of the POWs,'' said Jeff Sagnip Hollendonner,
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Saxton's motivations, Hollendonner noted that
McGuire Air Force Base is in Saxton's district and would probably
send many military personnel to the Balkans if the conflict there
escalates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just airmen, they are constituents,''
Hollendonner said.

IN A VIOLENT INSTANT, ROUTINE GIVES WAY TO PANIC
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING) 
 (mb) 
 By JAMES BARRON with MINDY SINK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he heard the noise in the hall, Adam Foss leaned out of the
choir room, the room where the confident singers of Columbine High
School outside Littleton, Colo., rehearse the kinds of songs that
student choruses have sung for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he remembered seeing the barrel of a shotgun. He
remembered seeing a flash of fire. He remembered seeing a teacher
go down.
</P>
<P>
   Foss, 18, said had scrambled back into the choir room, he said.
and herded the other students into a closet, an 8-foot-by-8-foot
room where their sheet music is stored. Not knowing whether the
gunman had pushed into the choir room and was poised to blast the
closet or had gone away, Foss and his friends barricaded the door
with a filing cabinet and waited.
</P>
<P>
   The boys peeled off their shirts _ the closet was hot and
stuffy, and they dared not open the door. They lifted one or two
classmates with asthma who had trouble breathing toward the
ceiling, where the ventilation seemed to be better. Together, they
waited as the minutes ticked by on the tensest afternoon of their
lives, until the police swept through the school and shouted that
it was safe to come out.
</P>
<P>
   But in that moment early in the afternoon, the everyday routine
of high school had given way to uncertainty, and then to panic. Two
young men had invaded a suburban high school southwest of Denver at
lunch time, killing as many as 25 people and wounding at least
another 20, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students froze where they were _ by their lockers, in the
cafeteria, at their desks. Others tried to make a quick getaway,
hoping not to catch the attention of the gunmen. ``Me and my
friends got to my car and drove off,'' said a student whom The
Associated Press identified only as Janine.
</P>
<P>
   Still others tried unsuccessfully to sneak out of the school
under siege. Foss' twin brother, Nick, had been in a bathroom when
the shooting started and was grazed on the head by a bullet. He
tried to pull himself to freedom through a crawl space in the
ceiling, but as his mother explained it later, the ceiling gave way
under his weight and he tumbled to the floor in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls, shots ricocheted off lockers as the gunmen in
trench coats and combat boots opened fire with what students said
were automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them
shooting,'' another student, Jake Apoeaca, told the AP. ``He saw us
and then he started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt
threw two hand grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we
started running.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students with cellular telephones called relatives to say
that they had not been hit. Kendra Curry called her grandmother and
said that she was huddled with Adam Foss and the others in the
choir room. Curry's mother, Lorie, said that the grandmother then
let the rest of the family know that Kendra was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Columbine, hundreds of police officers from the Denver
area were preparing to retake the school, room by room. Frantic
parents were sent to an elementary school less than a mile away,
where they waited for word of their children. From times to time,
teachers at the elementary school would tell parents milling about
on the sidewalk to come in, that children had been brought there
and were inside on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   There were parents at the elementary school who could not find
their children. One woman was talking on a cell phone, crying and
saying: ``Her name is not on any list. They don't know where she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, students were running to freedom, their
hands over their heads. Some dashed out a back door and past a
yellow fire truck, while others followed police officers who were
running backward as they crossed the nearest street. The students
boarded buses in groups of 40 or so _ school buses and city buses
that had been waiting to carry them to the nearby elementary
school. First one bus, then 5 to 10 minutes later, another one.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses lumbered into the driveway at the elementary
school, red, tear-stained faces could be seen looking out the
windows, looking for parents and friends _ who were, of course,
straining to see who was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses came to a stop, the parents cried out their
childrens' names: ``Ashley,'' ``Jody,'' ``Mickey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they replied.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Carlon, a 16-year-old sophomore, was standing in front of
the elementary school. As he started to talk about what he had seen
at the high school, a girl named Jane ran up and said, ``Call your
mom. Is your sister OK.?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not know.
</P>
<P>
   One mother and daughter saw each other and embraced, crying and
trembling as their anxiety turned to relief. The mother, Isabel
Naslund, said that she had scrambled over fences and past
roadblocks to reach the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Julie, a 15-year-old freshman, described an attack
that had surprised and, at first, confused students and teachers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was a joke, a senior prank,'' she said.
Students had been expecting an onslaught of balloons filled with
shaving cream a few days ago, she said, but that did not happen. So
when the popping started, she said, many students figured it was
just the seniors acting up.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said that he had been in the auditorium when the gunmen
opened fire. ``I looked out into the hall and to my left, there was
a guy right there, shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the auditorium were three teachers and about 40 students, he
said. They locked the doors, sealing themselves in and, they hoped,
the attackers out. ``About every minute we would hear a big bang, a
bunch of big bangs,'' he said, ``with gunshots in between.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a custodian came in and told everyone to lie down,
then explained a route that would lead out out of the building
safely. They escaped in about half an hour.

 &HT;    Colorado resident Weiss kept abreast of shooting developments
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The family of Braves shortstop Walt Weiss lives in
the Denver suburb of Aurora, and two of his three children _
12-year-old Blake and 4-year-old Brody _ go to a private school
only a few miles from Columbine High School where Tuesday's tragedy
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said his children's school was locked down and they were
sent home Tuesday. He spoke to his wife and children by telephone
several times during the day and watched news reports from the
Braves' clubhouse at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about literally close to home,'' said Weiss, who was just
home with his family when the Braves played the Colorado Rockies
this past weekend. ``All the streets they're naming, I've been on
those roads they're talking about. It's a perfect snapshot of
suburbia. Talk about a shocker. It's disturbing. It enrages me. It
makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he always worries about his children, and this
incident intensifies that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sick world we live in,'' Weiss said. ``Obviously these
kids have problems. I don't think it's hard to see that. I don't
know the whole story, but these are kids with no value for life.''

   WASHINGTON _ He says he's at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   What does Bill Bradley have that I don't have? He's stiff. He's
wooden. He's plodding. He takes himself too seriously. He bores
people to death. He has zero personality.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. I can do that.
</P>
<P>
   He's much more of a snooze than I am. He's obsessed with taxes.
And CBS dumped him because they couldn't bear his windy
commentaries on values and the Cold War anymore. I, on the other
hand, can balance bats and spoons on my nose, and do the booty-call
line dance.
</P>
<P>
   He has a spot, too. You just can't see it, because he's such a
beanpole. Tipper doesn't find him a bit attractive.
</P>
<P>
   I am so ticked off. My polls are dropping faster than a pig out
of an F-117, as we used to say down on the farm. All of Clinton's
sex scandals are dragging down my numbers. He has the sweet tooth
and I get the cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Monica is no sooner over than we get buffeted by Juanita,
charges that the Chinese filched nuclear bomb technology, and that
inconvenient creep in Belgrade. Clinton is just a magnet for
trouble. Worse, I'm a magnet for Clinton's trouble. Even Tipper is
mad at him.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire and Iowa are exhausting enough. But now I have to
deal with the Kosovo primary. John McCain is winning that one.
While I'm schlepping to fund-raisers, McCain has suspended his
campaign during the Yugoslavia crisis and is getting more tube time
than I am. The only good news is that W. is losing the Kosovo
primary, too.
</P>
<P>
   But just when I can relax a little about W. because he's
bumbling around without any intelligent opinions about life outside
of Austin, I have to start worrying about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   I was never supposed to go one-on-one with this guy. I thought I
had scared or charmed other Democrats out of the race. Bradley was
the only one I didn't target. So I miscalculated a little. But now
things are getting totally out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, people are falling in love with that goody-goody when
they're supposed to be falling in love with this goody-goody.
</P>
<P>
   I've been trying to schmooze the press lately, but all they do
is fawn over him. I've raised $8.9 mil and all the press can talk
about is Bradley's ``impressive'' $4.3 mil. I wanted to hurl at the
description of him in USA Today: ``A 6-foot-7 gentle giant slipping
in and out of roles as coach, author, interviewer, college prof and
Sunday school teacher ... this is what it would be like if Mr.
Rogers ran for president.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not Mr. Rogers! I'm Mr. Rogers!
</P>
<P>
   I'm sick of him poaching my stars and my turf. I get Dreamworks.
Then he gets Michael Eisner, JFK Jr. and Michael Jordan. I spend
years sweet-talking all those executives in Silicon Valley and they
give me a paltry $400,000. Then Bradley drops into San Francisco
and raises $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that whole basketball hero thing getting pretty tired?
They didn't even have the three-point shot in his day. And he had
to wear those silly- looking short shorts. If I see another quote
from that old John McPhee New Yorker piece about what an amazing
athlete and role model he was, I'll set fire to the barn. Everybody
forgets that McPhee also wrote that ``He can't seem to resist
throwing a certain number of passes that are based on nothing but
theory and hope,'' and that he psyched himself for Princeton games
by listening to ``Climb Every Mountain.'' How corny can you get?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I can shoot hoops, too. My St. Alban's yearbook called
me a ``basketball standout'' and said ``Al is frighteningly good at
many things.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bradley was just another tired, burned-out
Beltway hack. Now everyone is oohing and aahing at his refreshing
new face.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's made ``trust'' his campaign code word. Subtle. OK,
maybe I exaggerated at the Rose Garden impeachment rally when I
blurted out that Clinton would ``be regarded in the history books
as one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's running on Big Serious Things, while I'm running on
Little Puny Things. He's talking about racial unity while I'm
talking about lost luggage. He's talking about child poverty while
I'm talking hot lines for local traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   He's wrong. I do have one really big idea: Bill Bradley should
get lost.

PHONE GIANTS SAY MERGER HINGES ON ROLE OF GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom tentatively agreed on
a merger pact Tuesday night to form the world's largest
telecommunications provider, but they said a final deal required
assurances that the German government abdicate its voting rights in
the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia's board, which met for a second consecutive day
to discuss the merger, said it ``approved in principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The approval came after Deutsche Telekom promised it would
support a Telecom Italia demand that the German government,
Deutsche Telekom's biggest shareholder, not interfere in the new
company's structure or management.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Italian and German companies pushed the
merger one step forward toward formal approval. It put the ball
clearly in the court of the German government, which would retain
about a 45 percent stake in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   A Telecom Italia board member said a decision from the German
side could come as early as Wednesday, after which the merger would
be formally announced. The Telecom Italia board would then call a
shareholder meeting to approve the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A merger of Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia would create a
mammoth phone company, with a market capitalization of almost $180
billion, making it even larger than the planned merger of SBC
Communications and Ameritech, at $173 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Tuesday night how the government of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder would respond. German newspapers
reported Tuesday that Bonn was favorable to reducing its voting
rights in the planned company to match those of the Italian
government, which holds a 3.4 percent stake in Telecom Italia, and
to setting a schedule for divesting itself of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   A German Finance Ministry spokesman was quoted Tuesday night by
the Italian news agency ANSA as saying only that the government was
preparing a decision, which would require a vote of Deutsche
Telekom shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government appears to support the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Massimo D'Alema, the Italian prime minister, discussed the
merger with Schroder in a phone call on Friday. Italian and German
finance ministers took time off from a meeting of European finance
ministers in Dresden, Germany, at the weekend to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not without German critics. Uwe Jens, the economic
spokesman for Schroder's Social Democratic Party, was quoted
Tuesday as saying German antitrust officials should step in to
``stop this nonsensical movement.'' Executives of Mannesmann AG,
Deutsche Telekom's main domestic rival, have also criticized the
government for appearing to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Deutsche Telekom said they had no way of knowing
how soon Bonn would respond. A Deutsche Telekom spokesman, Hans
Ehnert, said, ``We want the alliance, the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the merger discussions have said the merger
amounts to a Deutsche Telekom takeover of Telecom Italia that
values the Italian company at about 12 euros a share, which would
make the value of the deal about $95 billion. That would be the
biggest corporate takeover ever.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, in a statement released after the board meeting,
said the plan was to create a combined holding company that would
swap its shares for common stock in Deutsche Telekom and for
Telecom Italia's ordinary and savings shares.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether the swap would include the shares in
Telecom Italia's mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, but if
that were so, the deal would be worth roughly $106 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The board member who requested anonymity said that Deutsche
Telekom was expected to offer three of its shares for every one
Telecom Italia share, leaving Deutsche Telekom shareholders in
control of roughly 56 percent of the combined company. Shares in
the company would be quoted on the exchanges in Frankfurt, Milan
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Italia board, in its statement, said it was
``essential that the terms be made clear under which the German
government will limit the exercise of its voting rights in the new
holding company,'' pending full divestiture of its shares. The
board also asked Telecom Italia's chief executive, Franco Bernabe,
to present an industrial plan for the proposed combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe has sought the merger with Deutsche Telekom to thwart a
hostile $65 billion takeover bid by the Italian company's chief
domestic rival, Olivetti SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the Italian government has been sensitive to the
idea that the merged company would be under German control, and
Italian officials have insisted the merger must be a partnership of
equals.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had originally scheduled a news conference for
Tuesday in London to announce the merger plan, but the board member
said no announcement would be forthcoming until the Italian board's
condition was met.
</P>
<P>
   The board member said the key issue in the discussions Monday
and Tuesday was the question of German government voting rights.
``In a sense, it's an artificial problem in a public company,'' he
said. Yet with the German government in control of 45 percent of
the company, ``the Italian government would have opposed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is a minority shareholder in Telecom Italia, the
Italian government has a ``golden share'' that gives it veto rights
over any merger.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not specify what form a German assurance would
take, but the board member said it could be given as a written
guarantee or a withdrawal of Bonn representatives from the merged
company's supervisory board.

MAN IS INDICTED IN 10 CHURCH FIRES IN INDIANA AND GEORGIA, ONE IN
WHICH A FIREFIGHTER DIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Ga., Minn., Ohio)   (af)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Indiana drifter with a history of dabbling in Satanic rituals
was charged in dual federal indictments Tuesday with setting 10
church fires in Indiana and Georgia, including one last year in
which a firefighter died.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials from the National Church Arson Task Force,
which was established three years ago to investigate hundreds of
church blazes across the South and Midwest, said it was the largest
number of church burnings linked to one suspect since the task
force was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, who said some of the church fires the task force
was looking into had been motivated by racism, said all the burned
churches in Indiana and Georgia linked to the man charged, Jay
Scott Ballinger, 36, were in predominantly white rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger, who is white, confessed to federal agents in February
that he had set up to 50 church fires from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer in Indianapolis, Steven J. Riggs, said he was
defending Ballinger against the charges for setting seven fires in
Indiana and could not comment on other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs said his client had suffered severe burns over 35 percent
to 40 percent of his body in a fire set in February. Ballinger has
undergone four skin grafts and is being held at the United States
medical center for federal prisoners in Rochester, Minn., the
lawyer said. The lawyer said that legal proceedings were on hold
until Ballinger was well enough to return to Indiana, which could
take up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have not decided where Ballinger, of Yorktown,
Ind., will be tried.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Berarducci, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, which is part of the task force, said
additional fires possibly set by Ballinger were under investigation
in more than 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   Richard H. Deane Jr., the United States attorney for the
northern district of Georgia, said no decision had been made on
whether to seek the death penalty for Ballinger in connection with
the death of a firefighter in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighter, Kennon Loy Williams, 27, a volunteer, was
killed on New Year's Eve in 1998 when the burning roof of the New
Salem United Methodist Church in Commerce, Ga., collapsed on him.
Three other firefighters were injured in that blaze, which
Ballinger has been accused of setting.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum penalty Ballinger faces for his 7-count indictment
in Georgia is 50 years in prison, while the 12-count indictment in
Indiana carries a minimum of 90 years in prison. In addition, he
faces possible fines up to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger was apprehended after he failed to seek medical
treatment for two days for severe burns he received while trying to
set fire to a church in Brookville, Ohio, on Feb. 7, 1998.

   A detective from the Ball State University police department
recognized Ballinger's name on the scanner when ambulances were
sent to his parents' home in Indiana. Ballinger was hospitalized
with severe burns on his face, chest, legs and hands, and said that
he had been injured in a bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   The officer knew that Ballinger was an arson suspect. The
officer went to the hospital and called federal investigators after
he discovered from Ballinger's father that his son had refused to
go to the hospital until Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Scott D. McCart, an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent, said in
an affidavit released Tuesday that a search of Ballinger's father's
house uncovered a new two-gallon plastic gasoline container with
some fuel in it that had been stored in a paper bag; Satanic
materials that included books, notes and writings, and credit card
slips that put Ballinger in the vicinity of church fires in various
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballinger admitted to setting a total of approximately 30 to
50 church fires in Indiana and various other states,'' the
affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   A motive for the fires remained unclear. Investigators said
Ballinger's girlfriend and another man have admitted taking part in
burning at least one Indiana church where they painted an
upside-down cross on the steps as a Satanic ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger's girlfriend, Angela Wood, 24, of Macon, Ga., and a
friend, Donald A. Puckett, 37, of Lebanon, Ind., have been arrested
but were not charged in the federal indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal task force, which combines law-enforcement agencies
from the Departments of Justice and Treasury, has opened
investigations into 752 fires at churches since Jan. 1, 1995.
Law-enforcement agencies have arrested 331 people in connection
with 249 of those attacks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A September report by the task force said federal, state and
local prosecutors have obtained convictions of 235 people connected
to 173 of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the attacks have been motivated by racism, the
report said, the reasons behind the arson attacks ranged from
random vandalism to pyromania and even included neighborhood
disputes over parking. Most of the defendants were not members of
hate groups, the report said.

 &HT;    Colorado resident Weiss kept abreast of shooting developments
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The family of Braves shortstop Walt Weiss lives in
the Denver suburb of Aurora, and two of his three children _
12-year-old Blake and 4-year-old Brody _ go to a private school
only a few miles from Columbine High School where Tuesday's tragedy
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said his children's school was locked down and they were
sent home Tuesday. He spoke to his wife and children by telephone
several times during the day and watched news reports from the
Braves' clubhouse at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about literally close to home,'' said Weiss, who was just
home with his family when the Braves played the Colorado Rockies
this past weekend. ``All the streets they're naming, I've been on
those roads they're talking about. It's a perfect snapshot of
suburbia. Talk about a shocker. It's disturbing. It enrages me. It
makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he always worries about his children, and this
incident intensifies that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sick world we live in,'' Weiss said. ``Obviously these
kids have problems. I don't think it's hard to see that. I don't
know the whole story, but these are kids with no value for life.''

 &HT;    Shades give students cool time on playground
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Students now look hip when they hop, skip and
jump during gym class at Boca Raton Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   During the 40-minute period when they're out on the playground,
they get to wear neon-colored shades, the gift of a local bank
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fun having sunglasses,'' third-grader Charlene
Toussaint, 9, said Tuesday. ``My eyes don't turn red.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, things weren't so cheery on the school's
playground. The kids were quite lethargic playing in the hot sun,
physical education teacher Juanita Tiona said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing steamier days were on the way, she came up with an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Tiona asked the school's business partner, Philip Friedly, vice
president of the local Washington Mutual bank branch, about
providing sunglasses for her students.
</P>
<P>
   Friedly came through with 30 pairs of shades with lenses that
block ultraviolet rays. Tiona keeps the sunglasses in a cardboard
box and passes them out at the start of each class.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're happier and willing to do more,'' said Tiona, who has
taught at Boca Raton Elementary for five years. ``They're not
giving me that `I don't like P.E.' look.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 40-minute class Tuesday, students did push-ups, ran
laps and practiced tennis strokes. No one's sunglasses fell off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're good,'' fifth-grader Chris Laporta, 11, said.
``You get to see better instead of squinting all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach County school district spokesman said he didn't
know of any other school where students have a ready stash of
sunglasses for PE class.
</P>
<P>
   Friedly said he didn't blink twice when Tiona called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you never think about,'' he said.
``The kids needed sunglasses and I had no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the kids say it's cool to look fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them because they come in red and that's my favorite
color,'' third-grader Jackie Pastor, 9, said.

Kosovo families, the djep is a symbol of the future, wherever one
might be. ``If we left the djep, the Serbians would end up burning
it, just like they have destroyed everything else,'' said Behrami.

DRAWINGS OF CHILDREN FOUND IN CREEK BED RELEASED

<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ Desperate to identify the bodies of two
small children found dumped in a rural creek bed, authorities
released composite drawings Tuesday of a girl and boy who appear to
be related.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the good Lord will help us make identification of
those babies and hopefully today, tonight or tomorrow,'' said
Williamson County Sheriff Ed Richards. ``It's almost impossible to
establish motive without knowing who the victims are.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards said law enforcement officials believe the children
were murdered and are looking for any clues to solve the mystery.
He described external trauma to the children's bodies as ``minor''
but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are awaiting autopsies by the Tarrant County
Medical Examiner to determine the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Richards added they are following up several leads and have been
swamped with calls from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 74 missing children in Texas the same ages as the
victims showed up in the Texas Department of Public Safety's
Missing Persons Clearinghouse and are being checked by two Texas
Rangers, according to DPS spokesman Mike Cox.
</P>
<P>
   In the drawings, the children bear a striking resemblance to
each other as if they were brother and sister. Both wore pull-up
Mickey Mouse diapers, the boy's blue and the girl's pink. They were
dressed in toddler-size clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators estimate the boy was between 1 and 3 years old,
while the girl is thought to have been between 2 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl, known simply as ``Victim 2,'' was clad in denim
overalls embroidered with hearts and flowers. A green four-leaf
clover dangled from a chain attached to one of the pockets. The
little boy wore a striped T-shirt, jeans and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received a lot of calls from law enforcement agencies,
people that have children missing thinking maybe these are their
children,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Law officers from several counties and towns have joined the
investigation as well as the Texas Department of Public Safety, the
Texas Rangers and support help from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities had strung yellow crime scene tape across
the deep incline leading to the shore line of Brushy Creek near
Hutto, population 740.
</P>
<P>
   There, they said, an unidentified couple out for a stroll made
the discovery around 4:30 p.m. Monday and informed local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they believe the bodies had been in 6 inches of
water near a debris-strewn ravine only a matter of hours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I've heard it's a pretty popular place to fish,'' said Mike
Gleason, a patrol supervisor for the Sheriff's Department, as he
worked on a crew looking for clues Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun fades everything our here real fast, so you can pretty
much determine what's old and what's not,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, the officers discovered an object a news
photographer said looked like a blood-stained piece of paper. They
carefully lifted it into a paper sack wearing protective gloves but
would not confirm what the object was.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said they are doubtful that the dead female child is
that of Cristy Ryno, a 3-year-old from Irving reported missing on
Saturday.

VAUGHN MIGHT DH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Angels are trying to take the cautious approach
with first baseman Mo Vaughn, but it seems it would take an army to
keep him out of the lineup today, when he's eligible to return from
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who sprained his left ankle on opening night, is likely
to serve as the designated hitter in the final game of the series
against the Blue Jays, who play on artificial turf in SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I don't like to DH, I can't say I'm going to play
first base if I'm not capable of playing.'' he said. ``We'll see
what happens in the next couple of days. But the faster I get back
to first base, the stronger our lineup can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn did some running Tuesday for the first time since the
injury. He also took batting practice and fielded ground balls at
first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still limping, but I'm not known for my speed,'' he said.
``I'm going to have to play with some pain, that's just the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Expected exit: The loss of Jim Edmonds to shoulder surgery
took no one by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``(General manager) Bill (Bavasi) and I had running
conversations with Jimmy on a daily basis,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``We knew where he was coming from. It hurts, but
we'll do OK. Obviously we hoped to get him through the season. . .
. He's a great player, but someone else with pick up the slack,
because good teams do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Edmonds out, Garret Anderson becomes the permanent center
fielder, although Collins said he has thought about putting Darin
Erstad in center and moving Anderson back to left.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookie's a hit: Troy Glaus has gotten off to such a fast
start (.435, 3 HRs, 11 RBI through Monday) that other teams have
responded by pitching him inside. He was hit by a pitch against the
A's and then the Mariners hit him twice over the weekend. In the
span of four games, he was hit three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to throw me inside and I get hit, that's fine,''
Glaus said. ``It's not going to intimidate me or get me off the
plate. I got thrown at in high school, I got thrown at in college
and I got thrown at in the minor leagues. It's not something I've
never had to deal with. . . . It always surprises me, but it's not
going to change my approach, change what I do at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Brawl benching? Collins said he expects Todd Greene to be
suspended for charging the mound in Sunday's game against the
Mariners. But Greene, who fought with Mariners pitcher Brett
Hinchliffe after Hinchliffe hit him with a pitch, said he isn't so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should,'' he said. ``I was defending
myself.''

CLINTON, `SHOCKED AND SADDENED,' HOPES FOR PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING; skedded earlier as CLINTON) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A somber President Clinton said Tuesday night that
he was ``profoundly shocked and saddened'' by the school shooting
in Colorado, and he expressed the hope that the country would,
somehow, find ways to prevent future bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy,''
Clinton said. ``Perhaps we may never fully understand it. St. Paul
reminds us that we all see things in this life through a glass
darkly, that we only partly understand what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, his face flushed and eyes downcast as he spoke in
the White House briefing room, said he had asked Attorney General
Janet Reno; her top deputy, Eric Holder, and Education Secretary
Richard Riley to assist the stricken Colorado school system any way
they could.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, his brief appearance amounted to a shared
outpouring of grief and a call for prayer, rather than a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say more tonight, but I don't think I can,''
Clinton said in response to questions.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time enough for analysis, he said, adding that
Tuesday night was a time for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is an open wound right now,'' the president said
of Littleton, Colo., the Denver suburb where the bloodshed
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been in Littleton _ ``It's a wonderful place'' _
and that if such a thing could happen there, it could happen
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Clinton expressed the hope that ``perhaps now
America would wake up to the dimensions of this challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   And minutes later, he remarked that ``there are a lot of kids
out there who have access to guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And apparently more than guns,'' the president added,
referring to early reports that the Colorado gunmen may have had
explosives as well as firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our children
and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons,'' Clinton went on. ``And we do
know we have to do more to recognize the early warning signs that
are sent before children act violently.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had consoled officials in Colorado and had
spoken with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was one of
several people shot to death by a gunman on a Long Island Rail Road
train in 1993. He did not discuss the substance of their telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who in the past year has made school safety a priority
and who organized a White House conference on the subject last
fall, seemed to express the anguish and frustration of his
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people
are with you,'' he said to the citizens of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he did not want to use the word ``epidemic''
in describing Tuesday's killings and similar spates of violence in
schools and on the streets. But in promising that the federal
government would help any way it could, he said, ``We do have, from
bitter and sad experience, a great cadre of grief counselors.''

BRADLEY, IN FIRST OF ISSUES TALKS, TURNS TO DIALLO SHOOTING AND
RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Invoking the Amadou Diallo shooting as evidence of
persistent racial discord in America, former Sen. Bill Bradley said
Tuesday that he would make the ``quest for racial unity'' a central
pillar of his White House if he was elected president. Bradley
called racism the ``defining moral issue of our time'' and pledged
to raise the subject regularly as he seeks the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ronald Reagan was president, everyone knew that if you
wanted to please the boss, you talked about cutting taxes,
increasing military spending and fighting communism,'' said
Bradley. ``If I'm president, I want one thing to be known: If you
want to please the boss, one of the things you'd better show is how
your department or agency has furthered tolerance and racial
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is competing for the nomination against Vice
President Al Gore, chose Manhattan to give what his organization
described as the first in a series of major addresses on what he
believes will be issues crucial to the campaign. Race is an issue
with which Bradley has regularly identified himself during his
career, and he returned to it Tuesday by invoking February's fatal
shooting of Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, by four
white New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley described the shooting as ``an extreme example of the
targeting that most African-Americans have experienced with the
police at some time in their lives.'' He deplored the response of
public officials, describing it as the loss of an opportunity to
confront the relations between the police and minorities, and to
help whites understand what he described as ``the white-skin
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is a Diallo-like event a potential catalyst, not just toward
police reform but toward deeper understanding?'' Bradley said,
speaking before students and television cameras at Cooper Union.
``Why can't this stark tragedy come across in a compelling enough
way to open the eyes of all of us today, just like the church
explosion in Birmingham did 36 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't some public official ask our schoolchildren to
observe the tragedy with a moment of silence in memory of another
life lost to senseless violence and tell all of us that if we want
to, we can change our lives, our relationship, our communities, for
the better?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech opened a phase of his campaign in which, his
aides said, he will try to present himself, with a series of policy
addresses, as more substantial than Gore, who has so far run a
relatively unadventurous campaign. Democrats across the nation have
awaited these speeches to see whether Bradley, who has a reputation
for being stronger at articulating problems than at offering
solutions, will begin to flesh out his own White House agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But during his 44-minute speech Tuesday, Bradley offered no
programs to promote racial unity. He also largely avoided
discussion of affirmative action, and strongly suggested that most
of the remedies that could be applied by law or the courts had
already been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   He signaled instead that much of his response to dealing with
racism would be exhortation, an approach he displayed for his young
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you care about race?'' he asked the students, peering up
over his glasses. ``If you do, then do something about it. Start
with your life and the life of a friend. Go from there to your
parents, your dorm, your club, your team and more friends. Make
racial unity a part of your being.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley urged his listeners to ``take this issue and find a way
of making it yours _ of blowing away the acrid odor of racism as
well as the stultifying pessimism that nothing will change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the eve of the 21st century,'' he said. ``Let us
affirm that when we get to its third decade, or maybe even the
second decade, the racial divisions of America will be mended.
Pledge that it will be your generation that will put those stupid
attitudes behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley noted changing demographics that will make the nation
increasingly diverse. In 2010, he said, fewer than 60 percent of
people entering the work force will be native-born white Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for racial healing should be a common-sense
impulse,'' he said. ``But if morality doesn't bring you to the
table with enthusiasm, how about self-interest?''

CLINTON CHALLENGES NATION TO HELP PREVENT SCHOOL VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, confronted with another gruesome
school shooting, called Tuesday for ``a candid assessment'' of
steps the nation can take to prevent classroom violence.
</P>
<P>
   In nationally broadcast remarks from the White House, Clinton
said the ``hows or whys'' of the tragedy in Littleton, Colo., may
never be known, but added:
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our children
and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons. And we do know we have to do
more to recognize the early warning signs that are sent before
children act violently.''
</P>
<P>
   After his comments, the White House announced Clinton had called
off his Wednesday trip to Texas, where he was to speak at the
opening of the new Austin airport and attend Democratic
fund-raising events in the state capital and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the tragic circumstances in Colorado, the president
thought it was best to cancel,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said in a statement Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a number of school shootings, including one in
March 1988 at Jonesboro in his native Arkansas, Clinton convened a
White House conference on classroom safety last October.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the administration announced it would award
more than $300 million to 50 communities to improve school safety,
including programs to combat violence, drugs and destructive
students.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation in Littleton began, Clinton said there are
additional proposals he had in mind to fight school violence, but
he did not detail them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I think the American people ought to be thinking
about those folks in Littleton,'' he said, calling the community
south of Denver ``an open wound right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow and in the days ahead, we'll have a little more time
to kind of gather ourselves and our determination and go back at
this again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that as the families in Littleton grieve and the
facts of the incident are gathered, ``the rest of us have a
responsibility to do everything we can to make sure this doesn't
make 1999 a year like last year, that we don't have another rash of
this, that we really can be more effective in preventing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned aside a reporter's suggestion that there may be
an ``epidemic'' of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like to know is whether we can learn enough from
this, which in its dimensions apparently is much greater than even
the others were, and see what else we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing a report prepared for the White House conference,
Education Secretary Richard Riley said that ``the vast majority of
America's schools are still among the safest places for youngsters
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday that ``statistically, for all the whole 53
million kids in our schools, it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, from the facts we're hearing about what
happened at this school, and the possibility that explosives were
out there, that hand grenades were available, that other things
were there, it obviously wasn't true there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was obviously the most dangerous place in Colorado
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference resulted in an ``early-warning guide'' to help
educators and parents spot potentially violent students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you know that there are a lot of kids out there who
have access to weapons, and apparently more than guns'' in the
Littleton incident, Clinton said. Some young people, he said,
``build up these grievances in their own mind and ... are not being
reached. And it's not just Littleton. We know that now. We've had
lots and lots and lots of places.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had asked Attorney General Janet Reno and
Education Secretary Riley ``to stand ready to assist local law
enforcement, the schools, the families, the entire community during
this time of crisis and sorrow.''

 &HT;    Everglades fire sparks greater anti-arson battle
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore and Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTON, Fla. _ As weary foresters finally contained a four-day
fire that streaked across the Everglades, devouring 155,000 acres
and turning skies a dirty brown with acrid smoke and ash, the state
hatched a tough new strategy to hunt down and punish the arsonists
causing much of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush doubled the reward for arson tips to $10,000 after
learning many of the fires were deliberately set by teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people responsible for starting these fires need to be
held accountable,'' Bush said. ``In some cases, parents may be
ordered to pay for damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that the fire season is barely under way, and Florida's
battle may have just begun, Bush dumped an extra $5.6 million in
emergency money into the fire fight _ more than a half million for
arson investigation alone.
</P>
<P>
   From Apalachicola National Forest to the Everglades, in parched
forests and brittle scrub, more than two dozen fresh fires erupted
over the last two days. But while conditions remain dire, the
monster Everglades fire _ this year's largest _ was successfully
trapped by roads, levees and backfires, the Division of Forestry
said. Once back-burning is complete, foresters estimate 175,000
acres of saw grass will have burned, down from the 45,000 they
predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was good news for motorists, too. The Florida Highway
Patrol reopened Interstate 75, the state's main coast-to-coast
highway, after closing it Saturday when fires dropped a curtain of
smoke and made driving dangerous. For three days, truckers and
other motorists have had to take a circuitous detour, snaking
around southern Broward County via U.S. 27 to the Tamiami Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, more than 2,500 fires have burned more than 230,000
acres this year. Forestry officials expect erratic winds and dry
weather to remain for several more days, making new fires quick to
start and difficult to fight. In Port St. Lucie, where ferocious
blazes whipped by 30 mph gusts of wind destroyed 42 homes Thursday,
officials worry they could be hit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as simple as someone tossing a cigarette butt out of the
window and we could have another incident like last Thursday,''
said St. Lucie County Fire District spokesman Ron Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, foresters warned that this year could bring fires
even worse than last summer, when blazes devoured 500,000 acres and
damaged or destroyed 370 buildings. A single firestorm forced the
evacuation of Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the La Nia weather phenomenon rising out of the
Pacific, the state has endured desert-like conditions since
February. Temperatures have also run higher than normal, further
baking and drying forests and underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fires cranked up, Bush slashed $30 million out of
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford's budget. Crawford's
department includes the Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Bush was in a fighting mood. He said he has
``started the conversation'' with advisers about a fireworks ban
and wants to throw another $555,000 into the fight against wildfire
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect up to 35 percent of the state's fires have
been the work of arsonists; 12 of 13 arson arrests in the past
three weeks have been of juveniles. More than 100 other cases are
under investigation, Florida Department of Law Enforcement
Commissioner Tim Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's agency is assisting 36 arson investigators from the
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hard enough time dealing with Mother Nature,''
Crawford said. ``It's frustrating that some of the fires are being
caused intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   FDLE added a $5,000 reward to a similar one offered by the
Florida Forestry Arson Alert Association, bringing the total to
$10,000. State officials urged anyone with information to call the
arson hotline at (800) 342-5869.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a prank or a joke,'' Moore said. ``It's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who willfully starts a fire that damages a building with
someone inside would be guilty of a first-degree felony, punishable
by up to 30 years in prison. Juveniles as young as 14 can be
punished as adults for arson, and state courts can order parents to
make restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the state will spend $1.2 million to lease a mammoth
Sikorsky helicopter for 20 days. The helicopter carries a
2,200-gallon water tank for aerial dousing. The state is also
paying for another 10 days' use of a Fire Hawk helicopter with an
800-gallon bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and rangers will also get improved communication
equipment and 1,000 lightweight protective suits better suited for
fighting fires in Florida's brutal heat.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Bush announced his arson crackdown, foresters
said someone sparked a new blaze near the northeast corner of the
Everglades fire. Worse, the fire was set across a levee rangers had
been using as a fire barrier. Witnesses told rangers they saw a
black Ford Explorer leave the area just before they saw the fire
spring up. However, with winds considerably calmer and the humidity
slightly up, rangers were able to contain it, said Division of
Forestry forester Erin Albury.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, another section of the Everglades fire burned
within a few miles of the Seminole Tribe's Big Cypress reservation,
where 300 Seminoles live. Tribal firefighters set their own
backfires to protect against the advancing flames. Late Tuesday,
the fire did not appear to pose a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the area remains particularly volatile, especially with
I-75, also called Alligator Alley, open and carrying thousands of
motorists who could carelessly ignite a blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here certainly shouldn't let their guard down,'' Albury
said. ``The fire situation is extremely dangerous. A cigarette,
match, spark from a catalytic converter, you name it, any kind of
ignition device.''

DERBY-WINNING TRAINER DEAD AT 86
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ To those who knew him, Charlie Whittingham
epitomized dignity, graciousness and good sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham, who died Tuesday at the age of 86 from leukemia,
left behind a legacy that includes two Kentucky Derby wins, three
Eclipse Awards and a place in the horse racing Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll ever have another one like him,'' said
former jockey Bill Shoemaker, who rode the Whittingham-trained
Ferdinand to a Kentucky Derby win in 1986. ``I don't think there'll
ever be another Charlie Whittingham again.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmuth von Bluecher, Whittingham's son-in-law, said the trainer
would have wanted a simple epitath to be remembered by: ``He was
the best damned horseman there ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys, trainers and others at Santa Anita observed a moment of
silence for Whittingham on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham, who lived in nearby Sierra Madre, became ill last
October. In recent months, his son Michael took over training
duties in Santa Anita's Barn No. 4, Whittingham's home away from
home.
</P>
<P>
   He is Santa Anita's, Oak Tree's and Hollywood Park's all-time
leading trainer. At Santa Anita alone, Whittingham had 868
victories, including 204 in stakes events. He was twice the oldest
trainer to win the Kentucky Derby, at age 73 with Ferdinand and at
76 with Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best,'' Shoemaker recalled. ``He was great to ride
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gave you a lot of instructions other than, `Get a
position and do the best you can.' And he never complained much
about it when you messed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say something like, `I goofed on this one,' and he'd
say, `Don't worry about it. Next time you'll get 'em.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Born April 13, 1913, in San Diego, Whittingham grew up on a farm
near Otay Mesa. As a child, he would go to the Tijuana racetrack
with his brother Joe, who was a jockey. At 19 he took out his
trainer's license and was in attendance at Santa Anita when the
race track opened on Dec. 25, 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham got his big break three years later when Bing
Crosby, who had just opened Del Mar, introduced him to legendary
trainer Horatio Luro. Luro immediately hired Whittingham as an
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1953 and 1989, Whittingham trained 11 national
champions. He won seven national earnings titles and trained more
than 20 horses with career earnings of more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said it was Whittingham's patience and ability to read
horses that made him great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could look inside a horse's brain and know exactly what
(the horse) was going to do and what (the horse) was thinking,''
Shoemaker said. ``He always brought the best out of the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to do anything else,'' Whittingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham was taken to St. Luke Medical Center here at 6 a.m.
Tuesday morning and was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m., officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements are pending. Whittingham is survived my his
wife Peggy, son Michael, daughter Charlene, 11 grandchildren and
five great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Richard Mandella, who as a youth idolized Whittingham,
noted the eerie coincidence of the trainer's death Tuesday morning
and the demolition of Santa Anita's 64-year-old grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the racing community knows how lucky we all were to
have had a leader in our industry like him,'' Mandella said. ``So
many young people grew up to follow in his footsteps or just hoping
to be a little bit like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think of racing without him.''

about the relationship between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In the deadliest school massacre &UR;  &LR; in the
nation's history, two teen-age boys stormed into a suburban high
school here at lunch time with guns and explosives, killing as many
as 23 people and wound at least 20, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunshots continued to ring out for four hours, and a bomb
exploded in the school parking lot as hundreds of police officers
evacuated the building and searched for the suspected gunman _ both
juniors at Columbine High School _ who were found dead in the
library of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, with what appeared to be
bombs around their bodies, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Sowing mayhem, the suspected gunmen wore ski masks as they threw
what appeared to be homemade explosives and shot semiautomatic
weapons at students and teachers as they walked through the school
beginning at 11:30 a.m., authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In a shooting last year at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark.,
previously the nation's worst, four girls and a teacher were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's , at least 20 people were wounded _ one student was
hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel. Among the 25 the police
estimated are dead are the suspected gunmen; their identities were
not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue.
By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime
scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives. No
precise death toll was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw two kids in trench coats with guns,'' said Chris
Weischer, referring to a group of students that some students
called ``the trench coat mafia,'' who wear swastikas on their dark
clothes and combat boots. Weischer was in one of several groups of
students freed by SWAT teams about four hours after the shooting
started.
</P>
<P>
   Students said the gunmen appeared to target minority students
and athletes at the 1,800-student school, as well as peers who had
poked fun at them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes
not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said in
an interview broadcast on CNN Tuesday night. ``And he just put the
gun in my face and started bleeding everywhere and stared laughing
and saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding
in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept
thinking to herself: ``This can't be happening to our school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman,
who also was not identified. ``This should be a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was the first at an American school during this
academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that
struck six different communities last year and set off national
alarms about teen-age violence.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton immediately dispatched a crisis-response team
to aid the school community and the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy;
perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the president said in
a nationally televised news conference. ``St. Paul reminds us that
we all see things in life darkly, that we only partly understand
what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our
children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this
suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried
injured, dead and dying students past the icons of serene
high-school life _ tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a packed
student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents swarmed at a nearby elementary school after the
police secured the high school; one woman was crying into her cell
phone: ``Her name is not on any list. They don't know where she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   After police officers used a fire truck and an armored car to
get close to the building, dozens of students raced out of the
two-story building, some slipping in the mud, others holding up
their hands in the air or behind their heads. The police said they
feared that the gunmen would try to escape by mingling with the
trapped students.
</P>
<P>
   One bloodied student broke out a second-floor window, and
climbed down into the hands of the police.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers established a wide perimeter around the
school, stunned students and school workers gathered on nearby
tree-lined streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms, and
a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood was going all over,'' a shaken girl said, as she was
comforted by her father outside the school.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who had barricaded herself in a woman's
bathroom, said, ``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Ladd, a student, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several trapped students used their cellular telephones to call
television stations when they could not get through on 911 lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver
television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added,
``There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said ``I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live on television all afternoon and into
the evening without commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said
before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly
affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a
suburban Denver high school, he said, ``We have to ask ourselves
what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, police officers detained three young white men
wearing camouflage pants and black jackets after spotting them in a
park next to the high school. Later, they said they knew the gunmen
inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket
were the words, ``Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign
printed over a cross.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Trench Coat Mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors
and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little
feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the
school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and
the Gothic look popularized by the rock star Marilyn Manson,
neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark
eyeliner, according to one student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret,
a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition that only his
first name be used.
</P>
<P>
   The group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris
McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from the
school, said that residents have known about the group for about
five years, and that no one considered it a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to
do with,'' McCaffrey said. ``They weren't particularly feared. They
were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls
appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described
the group as ``nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret suggested the gunmen might have targeted athletes out of
resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school.
</P>
<P>
   The students ``weren't really accepted as younger kids and as
they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said.
``They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand
that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those here were reminded of other school shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the seventh time it has happened,'' Bob Sapin, a
shaken student told a television station minutes after watching two
young men shoot students. ``I just can't believe it is happening at
my school.''

<P>
   When he heard the noise in the hall, Adam Foss leaned out of the
choir room, the room where the confident singers of Columbine High
School outside Littleton, Colo., rehearse the kinds of songs that
student choruses have sung for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he remembered seeing the barrel of a shotgun. He
remembered seeing a flash of fire. He remembered seeing a teacher
go down.
</P>
<P>
   Foss, 18, said had scrambled back into the choir room, he said.
and herded the other students into a closet, an 8-foot-by-8-foot
room where their sheet music is stored. Not knowing whether the
gunman had pushed into the choir room and was poised to blast the
closet or had gone away, Foss and his friends barricaded the door
with a filing cabinet and waited.
</P>
<P>
   The boys peeled off their shirts _ the closet was hot and
stuffy, and they dared not open the door. They lifted one or two
classmates with asthma who had trouble breathing toward the
ceiling, where the ventilation seemed to be better. Together, they
waited as the minutes ticked by on the tensest afternoon of their
lives, until the police swept through the school and shouted that
it was safe to come out.
</P>
<P>
   But in that moment early in the afternoon, the everyday routine
of high school had given way to uncertainty, and then to panic. Two
young men had invaded a suburban high school southwest of Denver at
lunch time, killing as many as 23 people and wounding at least
another 20, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students froze where they were _ by their lockers, in the
cafeteria, at their desks. Others tried to make a quick getaway,
hoping not to catch the attention of the gunmen. ``Me and my
friends got to my car and drove off,'' said a student whom The
Associated Press identified only as Janine.
</P>
<P>
   Still others tried unsuccessfully to sneak out of the school
under siege. Foss' twin brother, Nick, had been in a bathroom when
the shooting started and was grazed on the head by a bullet. He
tried to pull himself to freedom through a crawl space in the
ceiling, but as his mother explained it later, the ceiling gave way
under his weight and he tumbled to the floor in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls, shots ricocheted off lockers as the gunmen in
trench coats and combat boots opened fire with what students said
were semi-automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them
shooting,'' another student, Jake Apoeaca, told the AP. ``He saw us
and then he started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt
threw two hand grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we
started running.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students with cellular telephones called relatives to say
that they had not been hit. Kendra Curry called her grandmother and
said that she was huddled with Adam Foss and the others in the
choir room. Curry's mother, Lorie, said that the grandmother then
let the rest of the family know that Kendra was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Columbine, hundreds of police officers from the Denver
area were preparing to retake the school, room by room. Frantic
parents were sent to an elementary school less than a mile away,
where they waited for word of their children. From times to time,
teachers at the elementary school would tell parents milling about
on the sidewalk to come in, that children had been brought there
and were inside on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   There were parents at the elementary school who could not find
their children. One woman was talking on a cell phone, crying and
saying: ``Her name is not on any list. They don't know where she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, students were running to freedom, their
hands over their heads. Some dashed out a back door and past a
yellow fire truck, while others followed police officers who were
running backward as they crossed the nearest street. The students
boarded buses in groups of 40 or so _ school buses and city buses
that had been waiting to carry them to the nearby elementary
school. First one bus, then 5 to 10 minutes later, another one.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses lumbered into the driveway at the elementary
school, red, tear-stained faces could be seen looking out the
windows, looking for parents and friends _ who were, of course,
straining to see who was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses came to a stop, the parents cried out their
childrens' names: ``Ashley,'' ``Jody,'' ``Mickey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they replied.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Carlon, a 16-year-old sophomore, was standing in front of
the elementary school. As he started to talk about what he had seen
at the high school, a girl named Jane ran up and said, ``Call your
mom. Is your sister OK.?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not know.
</P>
<P>
   One mother and daughter saw each other and embraced, crying and
trembling as their anxiety turned to relief. The mother, Isabel
Naslund, said that she had scrambled over fences and past
roadblocks to reach the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Julie, a 15-year-old freshman, described an attack
that had surprised and, at first, confused students and teachers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was a joke, a senior prank,'' she said.
Students had been expecting an onslaught of balloons filled with
shaving cream a few days ago, she said, but that did not happen. So
when the popping started, she said, many students figured it was
just the seniors acting up.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said that he had been in the auditorium when the gunmen
opened fire. ``I looked out into the hall and to my left, there was
a guy right there, shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the auditorium were three teachers and about 40 students, he
said. They locked the doors, sealing themselves in and, they hoped,
the attackers out. ``About every minute we would hear a big bang, a
bunch of big bangs,'' he said, ``with gunshots in between.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a custodian came in and told everyone to lie down,
then explained a route that would lead out out of the building
safely. They escaped in about half an hour.

TWO STUDENTS KILL 25, WOUND 20 IN COLORADO HIGH SCHOOL ATTACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
and KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Two students, throwing explosives and firing
automatic weapons &UR; , &LR;  stormed a high school here Tuesday, killing as
many as 25 and wounding 20 as they hunted students hiding under
furniture and in classrooms. The gunmen killed themselves as SWAT
teams moved in.
</P>
<P>
   A third suspect was led from the suburban Denver school,
Columbine High School, in handcuffs. Police said he was an
``associate,'' and was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just shooting,'' said one student who escaped.
``They didn't care who they shot. They were just shooting. We
didn't think it was real and then we saw blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack, which began at 11:30 a.m. CST, dragged out for more
than four hours, moving from the school parking lot to the
hallways, into the cafeteria and finally to the library, where the
dead gunmen, one identified as a junior, were found.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers, dressed in black trench coats, sprayed lockers
and hallways with gunfire and threw bombs as students broke for the
exits. As the ordeal continued into the afternoon, one wounded
student was pushed through a smashed second floor window to waiting
SWAT officers. Many of the school's 1,870 students were trapped in
classrooms and the cafeteria. Ten to 15 bodies were found in the
library with the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them
shooting,'' sophomore Jake Apoeaca said. ``He saw us and then he
started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two
hand grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we started
running.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 police surrounded the large school and went
classroom by classroom to rescue students, some of whom used their
cellular telephones to call family and officials from their hiding
places.
</P>
<P>
   Police said bombs were found inside and outside the school and
also at the house of one of the dead gunmen. A police spokesman
said a detonator was found on the body of one of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell, FBI agents and police were still moving through
the school, searching for victims and explosives, and the bodies
had not been removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to take us some time because of how many rooms
we have bodies in,'' Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman Steve
Davis said late Tuesday. ``We still have a SWAT team in the
building going into the attic, the crawl spaces, everywhere.'' He
said the pair had a large amount of ammunition and police were
searching for live bombs before moving the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said 25 people may have been
killed, but it was not immediately known whether they were all
students or teachers and what the motive might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students blamed the shooting on eight to 10 students in the
school who wear black trench coats every day and are known as the
``Trench Coat Mafia.'' But it was not clear whether they were
involved in the shooting. Other students said athletes and
minorities had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Student Bob Sapin said the gunmen were all in black, in trench
coats and masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting
people,'' said another student who gave her name as Janine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff,''
she said. ``Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. We saw
three people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something blew
up.''
</P>
<P>
   During the SWAT search, three youths wearing black were stopped
by police in a field near the school. The Colorado Bureau of
Investigation said the three were friends of the gunmen who were
being taken in for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the most recent and the worst in a series of
school shootings in the United States. Since 1997, children and
teachers have been killed in Pearl, Miss., three at West Paducah,
Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A somber President Clinton, in two statements after the
shooting, asked the nation to pray for the victims and called for a
``candid assessment'' of steps the nation can take to prevent such
violence. He also canceled his Texas trip, which was to bring him
to Houston today for a fund raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The scene outside the school Tuesday, broadcast on national
television in fitful tragic snatches, swung from tragedy to relief
to tragedy. At nearby Clement Park, students were shaking and
crying as parents wandered about, looking for their children.
Police helicopters whirled overhead and hundreds of officers
patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people were taken to hospitals, including a girl who
suffered nine shrapnel wounds to the chest and the student passed
from the second story window to rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Mackecher, spokesman for HealthOne, which runs Swedish
Medical Center, said five students were taken there, all in serious
condition but conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Five other hospitals reported getting 15 people, at least one of
them in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton, population 35,000, is southwest of Denver.
Single-family homes line winding roads through the school
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, parents, students and community members
gathered at a nearby Catholic church to talk about the tragedy.
Hundreds showed up with drivers parking wherever they could. People
milled about, not really knowing what to say or do. Many families
sought out grief counselors who attended from local organizations.

WASHINGTON STATE SUES THREE SWEEPSTAKES COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire
announced lawsuits Tuesday against the nation's three largest
sweepstakes companies, saying their promotions have become
blatantly deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, especially the elderly, are being duped into buying
products they don't need or want on the false promise that they
have a good chance of winning a large prize, Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   The suits were filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle
against Publishers Clearinghouse Inc., American Family Enterprises
Inc., also known as American Family Publishers, and Time Inc., also
known as Guaranteed and Bonded. Company officials could not be
reached for comment on the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Also sued were celebrities Ed McMahon and Dick Clark, who
promote the American Family Publishers sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire said many people have a hard time taking the
sweepstakes seriously as a scam because they throw them away
without reading them. But for many others, especially the elderly,
they are effective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, at least 10 Washington state consumers spent more than
$10,000 each ordering merchandise _ including magazines, watches
and coins _ to increase their chances of winning a large
sweepstakes prize, Gregoire said. And 450 Washington residents
spent more than $2,500 each in one year on sweepstakes merchandise,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dreadful deceptions by these companies are tragically
effective,'' Gregoire said. ``Many seniors are absolutely convinced
they will win millions.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, their chances of winning the Publisher's Clearinghouse
prize are 1 in 200 million, Gregoire said. Their chances of winning
the Guaranteed and Bonded sweepstakes are 1 in 120 million, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-year-old Bellingham, Wash. woman spent half her monthly
Social Security check on sweepstakes, Gregoire said. A Spokane
woman was so convinced that she had won that she baked a cake and
put a banner sent by the sweepstakes company in her front yard. The
banner said: ``Prize Patrol Stop Here.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Publishers Clearinghouse accused the company of
specifically targeting the elderly, the first time the state has
ever filed a specific charge of that kind, Gregoire said. The
company has said that 30 percent of the people who buy its products
are older than 65. That's double the percentage of that group in
the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The sweepstakes promotions from American Family Publishers and
Publishers Clearinghouse use personalized messages to imply a
personal relationship or interest, the suits say. All three
companies use official-looking documents designed to convince
consumers that the companies are endorsed or approved by the
government, the suits say.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuits, the companies misrepresent that
consumers have won a prize and also falsely imply that consumers
have an improved chance of winning by making a purchase, which is
illegal. The process for entering the Publishers Clearinghouse and
the Guaranteed and Bonded sweepstakes without making a purchase is
improperly cumbersome, the suits alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The mailers of all three companies also create a false sense of
urgency to respond, Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional testimony indicates that one company sent as many
as 144 separate mailers in one year to some consumers who responded
to the first mailer, Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing more than predatory conduct by these
companies,'' Gregoire said. Besides the elderly, they also prey on
the lonely and people without much money who dream of winning the
large prize.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits ask the court to stop the companies from continuing
their deceitful conduct, ask for $2,000 in fines for each
violation, and ask that the companies be made to pay restitution to
consumers harmed by the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties could be in the millions of dollars,'' Gregoire
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suits were brought under the state's Promotional Advertising
of Prizes Act and the state's Consumer Protection Act. Three other
states _ Connecticut, Wisconsin and Indiana _ sued the companies
under their laws earlier this year, Gregoire said. And attorney
generals of 40 states are engaged in conference calls about the
companies, presaging more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and 30 other states entered into an ``assurance of
discontinuance'' agreement with American Family Enterprises last
year, but despite agreeing to alter its conduct, the company has
made few changes in its mailings, Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants the companies to prominently display the odds of
winning, quit telling people they've won prizes when they haven't,
quit mimicking government documents, stop implying an urgent need
to act, and to stop implying that consumers would improve their
chances of winning by buying a product.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire showed one Guaranteed and Bonded sweepstakes promotion
that she herself received that told her she had won $833,337 in
cash. Gregoire said she read the promotion carefully and then
showed it to her husband. They both concluded that the mailing was
definitely telling her she had won the money.
</P>
<P>
   Omak, Wash., attorney Richard Price is one of more than two
dozen attorneys nationwide who have filed suit against American
Family Enterprises, essentially alleging the sweepstakes mailer
told their clients they had won $11 million and the company must
now pay the money.
</P>
<P>
   Price said yesterday his 91-year-old client, a well-respected
Omak orchardist, responded to seven or eight mailers in a row. The
mailers strongly implied that he had won. One of the final ones
told him he had definitely won $11 million, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to stop these guys is to make them start paying
out on these outlandish statements,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in Okanogan Superior Court, but American
Family Enterprises had it moved to federal court in Spokane. It was
then consolidated with a number of other similar lawsuits filed
around the country and moved to federal court in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Brighton, a North Seattle resident, said his wife Helen
was spending $500 a month buying products from the sweepstakes
companies. He started noticing when their basement began to fill
with junk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple finally called Publisher's Clearinghouse to try to
get the company to stop sending the mailers, but it was difficult
to get them stopped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was waiting for the armored truck to pull up in front
of the house to give us all this money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sweepstakes have been operating for many years. Asked why
the states are only now filing suit, state Assistant Attorney
General Regina Cullen said, ``It's been a gradual buildup over
time. The language has just gotten more and more egregious. The
come-ons are more blatant, and the disclosures are smaller and
smaller. They're pushing the envelope.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ After more than 100 years of arm's-length
interaction between the his-and-hers institutions at the pinnacle
of academic prestige, Radcliffe College has agreed to be fully
absorbed into Harvard University, officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe, which lost much of its initial mission as a women's
annex when Harvard turned fully coeducational in the 1970s, is to
be renamed the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and expand
its study of women and gender, among other subjects, bolstered by
an infusion of $150 million from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But the change in Radcliffe's status means it will give up its
vestigial claims on undergraduate women at Harvard _ it had still,
technically, accepted their applications and put its seal on their
diplomas, even though they studied at Harvard _ and act as a center
for scholarship much like a similar institute at Princeton
University, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move also carried heavy symbolic weight. An institution long
known as one of the world's foremost educators of women is to merge
into the formerly all-male bastion with which it has had a close
but often-fractious partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of the negotiations on the merger, said
Nancy-Beth Gordon Sheerr, chairman of the soon-to-be-dissolved
Radcliffe College Board of Trustees, was ``weighing the tremendous
opportunities of moving in this direction against the meaningful
nature of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by a sprinkling of initial reactions, current Harvard
women and Radcliffe alumnae greeted the news of the merger with
tentative approval tinged by an undertone of concern that programs
for women might suffer. Officials of the Radcliffe College Alumnae
Association said that though they had not met formally yet to vet
the decision, it has their ``qualified support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's tremendous potential here and I'm excited
about the possibilities,'' said Susan Eaton, secretary of the
association. ``It's probably time for the study of women to be
fully integrated into Harvard's mission, and that's what I hope the
Radcliffe Institute will be able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' Ms. Eaton said, ``I can't help feeling a
sense of loss. It's been a very important institution in the lives
of generations of women, not just those who had the good fortune to
attend here but those who benefited from the presence of others
here.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard Tuesday, Alyssa Glass, a senior in computer science,
said she had had little contact with Radcliffe and had always found
it ``kind of insulting to know that I'm not considered the same
type of Harvard student as my male counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Glass said, she supported the merger only ``as long
as the sorts of programs that are out there from Radcliffe, such as
the mentorship program, are maintained by Harvard in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate for those to be lost because Harvard doesn't see that
as much of a priority anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is not talking about cutting Radcliffe programs, but
rather about increasing its scholarly wattage with some of the cash
that a university with an endowment of about $12 billion can afford
to transfer into its newest division.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe's new incarnation will have the resources to become a
center for advanced scholarship the likes of which there are only
two or three in the world, Dr. Neil L. Rudenstine, president of
Harvard, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating something rare,'' Rudenstine said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Radcliffe, Dr. Linda S. Wilson, who announced
Tuesday that she would be resigning after 10 years in the post,
said, ``We do not see this as giving up anything for the students
or anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen to Radcliffe's identity, now that it was
merging with Harvard, Wilson responded that it was ``clearly a
legacy we bring with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement in principle, which is not expected to be
formalized for months, Radcliffe will have a dean rather than a
president, who will be appointed by the president of Harvard in
consultation with a Harvard-Radcliffe committee. The dean will
participate in major Harvard decisions just like the deans of the
medical school, the law school and other Harvard faculties; in
essence, Rudenstine said, Radcliffe's position will be comparable
to those other schools within Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, Radcliffe becomes part of Harvard, and its assets,
including an endowment of about $200 million and some choice
Cambridge real estate, become Harvard's. But Harvard contributes
$150 million to Radcliffe, and previous contributions made
specifically to Radcliffe remain within Radcliffe's purview.
Rudenstine said he doubted that the move would lead to great
savings in administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ended months of rumors that Harvard was
planning to somehow swallow Radcliffe, talk that played upon the
nerves of many Radcliffe alumnae with deep emotional ties to their
alma mater and still-vivid memories of how women were openly
dismissed, excluded and disrespected here in the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   Many have kept up the pressure on Harvard to keep improving its
treatment of women, including a group of Radcliffe alumnae who put
their contributions to Harvard's capital campaign in escrow until
the university improved its record of hiring and awarding tenure to
women. About 12 percent of Harvard's tenured professors are women.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what effect the merger will have on
fund-raising. Rudenstine said Harvard would seek aggressively to
raise more money for the new Radcliffe institute, since such
centers for advanced study get no tuition revenue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For him, Rudenstine said, the hardest part of the merger
negotiations was finding a way to both honor Radcliffe and make a
``clean break'' with its independent past, because ``anything less
than a clean break would have left so much ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity has characterized much about Radcliffe's relations
with Harvard ever since the college signed an agreement with
Harvard in 1977 that effectively handed over all responsibility for
educating college women to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Radcliffe has offered mentorships, internships,
social action and arts programs and the like, all particularly
geared toward women, and guaranteed women ``a yard of their own.''
It has also developed highly respected scholarship and seminar
programs, from the Schlesinger Library, considered by many to be
the foremost American library on the history of women, to the
Bunting Institute, a center for women fellows from various
disciplines, to the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not, by most definitions, been exactly a college. So
to some extent, Tuesday's announcement merely formalized changes
that happened long ago. And the absorption by Harvard, too, seemed
logical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cherished a child that we're now sending out into the
large world, I think,'' Mrs. Gordon Sheerr said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, concerns lingered over how the loss of
independence for Radcliffe, an institution founded and run by and
for women, would affect Harvard women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an environment that's overwhelmingly male and doesn't have
a high percentage of tenured women,'' said Joanna B. Strauss, an
alumna and clinical social worker, ``will there be enough force
left to pay more than lip service to the particular needs of women
in education?''

 &HT;    Investivators wait for autopsy results in child killings
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTTO, Texas _ A small boy and girl believed murdered and dumped
while still wearing their diapers in a shallow Williamson County
creek remained unidentified Tuesday as investigators fielded calls
from law enforcement agencies and worried parents from around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Results of autopsies being performed by the Tarrant County
medical examiner in Fort Worth were not available late Tuesday,
leaving investigators wondering how the children, who may be
siblings, wound up in Brushy Creek south of Hutto Monday afternoon.
The boy and girl had been in the creek for a matter of hours before
a Round Rock couple having a picnic found their bodies near County
Road 137, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was one of the saddest days of my career,'' said
Hutto Police Chief Richard Miller, who was one of the first
officers at the scene Monday. ``It makes me wonder why I'm doing
this job. And it makes me think about my own children. I just can't
imagine that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Texas Rangers are helping about 15 sheriff's
investigators assigned to the case, said Chief Deputy Richard
Elliott of the Williamson County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sketches of the children were released Tuesday and posted on the
Texas Department of Public Safety's Internet web site. A bulletin
describing the children was distributed to law enforcement agencies
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were some of the most beautiful children I've ever
seen...and I know there is family and people out there just like
myself that this has got to touch their heart,'' said Ed Richards,
Williamson County sheriff. ``I make a heart-felt plea to anyone
that can come forward with information to help us find out what
happened to these children and help us identify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following a lot of leads. The whole world is a suspect
until we can find out who did it. The real dilemma we have is
making identification first.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever left the children in the creek is probably acquainted
with the area, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when there are bodies in a remote area, we find they
are familiar with the area,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean they
live in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The DPS Missing Persons Clearinghouse has listed 74 cases of
missing children fitting the children's general descriptions, said
Mix Cox, a DPS spokesman. A pair of Texas Rangers are
systematically going through the list in search of matches, Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of ``minor trauma'' was apparent on the children's
bodies, Richards said. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have virtually ruled out the possibility the dead
girl may be one of two girls reporting missing from the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's department officials assigned additional deputies to
field phone calls about the case, but so far none of the calls has
developed into a solid lead, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a large number of telephone calls that have come in
since last night...because of the volume, we're having to get some
help from other police agencies,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators returned to the creek bed surrounded by corn
fields and the Hutto Cemetery to question nearby residents and
search for evidence Tuesday, and plan to be back in the area today,
Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   They worked slowly through shin-high weeds, raking grass and
wildflowers alongside FM 1660 with collapsible metal batons,
slicing the brush for clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Gleason was asked what the officers were trying to
find in the debris amid the roadside fields. ``Anything. We don't
know what we're looking for, but we'll know it when we find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The midday sun and a steady wind trailed the six officers from
the sheriff's department, as did a police van stocked with water
and Kool-Aid. The probe turned up bottles and a red plastic tray,
junked lottery tickets, stray business cards and a $10 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Potential clues began turning up more than an hour after the
officers started walking when one man found what appeared to be a
white piece of paper. More officers were called in, the area was
photographed and the item was placed in a brown container and then
carted back to Hutto Police Department. The scene repeated several
times that afternoon and K-9 units joined the search party _ hints
of progress in an investigation that, so far, has been slow to
yield clues.
</P>
<P>
   The grim search was a reminder that times are changing in the
Hutto area, where residents gathered Tuesday to ask for news or
wonder why two small children would be killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Snuffy's restaurant on U.S. 79, a lunch-time spot where the
menu is printed on marker on brown paper bags, many said they
couldn't imagine that the children are local, because if kids were
missing ``we'd know about it,'' said waitress Kim Morgan, 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the whole town is pretty shocked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Audra Flegal, 20, a receptionist who lives near the creek, said
the news rattled her small-town sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hits you harder when you live in a small town and something
like this happens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hutto, farming and old-timers are slowly being eclipsed by
the growth that has consumed Williamson County. Since 1990, Hutto's
population has more than doubled to about 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here it was more of a farming community,'' Miller
said. ``Now it's getting more like Round Rock. And the old-timers
don't outnumber the newcomers anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Hickman, a 21-year-old welder and machinist, said that as
a kid he used to play in the creek, where he said the fishing isn't
very good but the scenery is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run around there all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In City Hall, the discovery created such a stir that ``even my
staff's relatives are calling in asking if we know anything,''
Yantis said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are asking anyone with information on the case to
contact the Williamson County Sheriff's Department at 943-1313.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had 30 children age 4 and under murdered in 1997,
according to DPS statistics. The number of children the same ages
murdered nationwide the year before was 622. In Williamson County,
the apparent murders near Hutto are the latest in a recent string
of child homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had numerous over the years and they're extremely
traumatic for everyone involved in them,'' Elliott said. ``The idea
of finding two deceased children murdered in Brushy Creek is
unthinkable. I can't even express in words what we feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three months, we had a young child shot and
murdered, we had a 15-year-old murdered and now we have these two
children. The cases aren't connected. I wish I knew the reason
behind murders of innocent children, but there is no reason.''

 &HT;    President cancels Texas trip
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ President Bill Clinton called off his trip to
Austin on Tuesday night, saying today's scheduled celebration of
the city's new airport and a fund-raising lunch would be
inappropriate so soon after the school shooting in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``As tomorrow was supposed to be a trip to celebrate the opening
of an airport and to fund-raise, given the tragic circumstances in
Colorado, the president thought it was best not to go,'' said
Elizabeth Newman, assistant press secretary for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said she did not know if the trip would be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kirk Watson, who is in Washington and was scheduled to
return to Austin on Air Force One this morning, said U.S.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater was prepared to come in
Clinton's place, but the city decided to cancel the whole event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of us celebrating we're going to pause and say our
prayers for the people in Jefferson County, Colo.,'' Watson said.
He said he called Patricia Holloway, the chair of the Jefferson
County commission, to offer his condolences for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disappointment for a lot of people,'' he said of
Clinton's cancellation, ``but in comparison _ there is no
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The president had no plans to visit Colorado on Wednesday,
Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation upset weeks of planning, forcing city officials
to call off a ceremony at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport
and the Democratic National Committee to nix a fund-raiser at Roy
Spence's home that was expected to raise $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone attending will agree the president needs to
take care of the country's business first before we have a party,''
Mauro said.

 &HT;    Littleton saga became America's
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just 19 days left until the end of the school year at
Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   When some students at the sprawling Littleton, Colo., school
first heard the noise, they thought it was the seniors playing a
prank _ perhaps firecrackers in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they said there was shooting, and we all got down in
corners,'' said Seth, a student interviewed on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just, like, prayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything stopped for a few hours Tuesday as the nation was
transfixed by the horrific images being broadcast from the suburban
Denver high school.
</P>
<P>
   Parents returning from work in Atlanta and around the country,
high school students shouldering their bookbags into the house, if
they turned on any of the major television networks, saw and heard
the news unfold.
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours at least, there was no war in Yugoslavia, no
soap operas, no local news _ only the Columbine school saga.
Parents everywhere watched as Littleton parents waited,
desperately, to see their children as they were evacuated from the
school. Teenagers watched their Columbine peers, looking so
teenage: untucked polo shirts, backward baseball caps, sprinklings
of acne, a girl with a double-pierced eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it was out of a movie,'' said one girl
interviewed on Denver TV. In the chaos of the live coverage, many
of the witnesses were identified by their first name or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver television reporter literally ran down a barefoot girl
in a leather jacket who was tearing down a sidewalk, recently freed
from the school by one of the police SWAT teams.
</P>
<P>
   She lost her shoes, she said, huffing and puffing. Her friend, a
curly redhead, spoke frantically about seeing a friend, Anne-Marie,
lying on the floor of the school, covered in blood. She was still
talking when the cameraman swung around and captured a middle-aged
dad in a Nike warmup jacket running up to his daughter on the
sidewalk. The two hugged so hard it looked as if they'd never part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, I'm glad you're here,'' sobbed the girl. ``Let's go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the drama became too overwhelming for the
professionals covering it. A reporter for Denver's CBS affiliate,
describing the emotional reunions of surviving students and their
parents, broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for a parent,'' she said, turning away from the
camera to wipe her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else mattered. President Clinton came on for an
unscheduled live statement in the late afternoon. The situation at
Columbine was still fluid. No one knew if the gunmen were still
alive, and the word ``fatalities'' had scarcely been spoken yet,
though it was surely already thought by anyone watching the story
unfold. Clinton urged the nation to pray for the students, their
teachers, the parents, then started to say something about an
economics meeting. In a blink, all television _ CNN and the rest _
cut the president off in midsentence.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Columbine High School, back to raw video of students
jogging from danger, hands clasped behind their heads like
prisoners of war. Apparently the SWAT teams had told them to hold
that position after they were out of the school, so they wouldn't
be mistaken for the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Back to pictures like the one capturing a woman hugging her son,
her face as tightly scrunched as a wadded washcloth. Images like
the kids who had fled to a nearby house, then made their way across
a rock-strewn drainage ditch to safety once it became apparent that
the assailants were dead inside the school. As the teenagers picked
their way across the large rocks, many held hands to support one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The national news media were depending on the four Denver TV
stations, which were in turn depending, at times, on the police.
Some students inside the school were watching their own captivity,
and many were equipped with cell phones. The TV news anchors told
the students to call a special number to get through to police. A
short while later, the students were told not to call, to remain
silent. Apparently no one knew at that point whether the killers
were still shooting up the school.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Littleton residents were being asked by Air Touch
Cellular not to use their cell phones in case of emergency. They'd
been put to good use throughout the day, though, by students who
had them. Early in the afternoon, one student called a Denver
station that was being carried nationally by CNN. He was hiding in
some bushes near the school, he said, his voice trembling.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the injury toll kept rising, starting at eight,
then 13, 14, 18, 21. There was little early speculation about
fatalities, but the kids pouring out of Columbine told tales of
trench-coated invaders carrying pipe bombs, shotguns and automatic
weapons, spraying bullets through the cafeteria and the library.
``Bullets were ricocheting off lockers,'' said student Jonathan
Ladd.
</P>
<P>
   At a little after 6 p.m. in Atlanta, a solemn-faced John Stone,
the Jefferson County sheriff, held a press conference outside the
school and made official what had been feared: He estimated about
25 people were dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time as Stone's grisly announcement, there
were scenes of jubilation from nearby Leawood Elementary School,
where the parents had been told to wait for news of whether their
children were dead or alive. As students were evacuated, they were
loaded into yellow buses and driven to Leawood.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome boy with a goofy grin leaned out a school bus window.
</P>
<P>
   Two girls, tears streaming down their faces, awaited word of
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people keep showing up, so we have more and more
reason to be happy,'' said a girl in overalls who looked like Joey
on ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sheriff spoke to reporters, news helicopters circled
overhead. He was immersed in a sea of reporters, their microphones
all lined up in concentric circles, pointing inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of media attention of these kinds of
situations,'' the sheriff said, ``and you don't know how much that
gives other people the idea to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he have any idea of a specific motive, asked a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craziness,'' he replied.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The moment he crossed into Albania and
registered with police at the shabby border station about 10 miles
east of here, Ymer Behrami was given four blankets, a large green
tarp, and what he believed was a chance for him and his family to
leave behind the madness in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But he had no idea that by passing into Albania he was now
engaged in a new struggle _ to provide for the seven children on
his wagon. As it turned out, the apartment he expected to be
waiting for him in Albania never appeared. Obtaining food, even a
piece of bread, forced him to fight and claw like an animal. The
intimidation and humiliation he thought he had left behind with the
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo found him again, only this time from his
own side.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, he heard Albanian soldiers bark orders at him and
saw Albanian children taunt him with the three-fingered Serbian
salute. He watched his children shiver with cold and cry from
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   And after surviving the threats and beatings of Serbian police,
he was among those rounded up by armed members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian rebels, who questioned him and
frightened him so much that after he was released he took his
family and fled yet again.
</P>
<P>
   For every one of the more than 600,000 Kosovo Albanians expelled
by Yugoslavs over the last three weeks, the escape from Kosovo was
but a single point in a long exodus of terror and pain, preceded by
months of anxiety and followed by long days of disappointment and
vulnerability. Their journey did not start at the border, nor end
there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was natural for Behrami, a stern and stoic 58-year-old
of Albanian descent whose family had been in Kosovo for many
generations, to feel the bright, warm sun of midafternoon and think
he was lucky still to be alive. The last nine months had been a
relentless round of intimidation and fear, starting with the rifle
shots and mortar rounds he heard approaching his village, Kotore, a
rebel stronghold southwest of Mitrovica, last July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was fighting and they started to bomb,'' he recalled.
After two days of listening to the Yugoslav shells come nearer,
Behrami felt he had to flee. He packed his wagon and hitched it to
his 1978 C-355 Ursus tractor, with a lucky horseshoe hanging over
the radiator grill. He took one, last, heart-searing look at his
home, the product of 40 years of working hard in an ore- processing
plant and on his beloved farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good water, beautiful mountains, big trees,
everything,'' he said. He had built three houses for his large
family, solid houses of stone and cement. He had eight cows and
boasted that they gave so much milk the pails overflowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said, ``paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that his Serbian neighbors were suspicious and
jealous, even after he had lived near them for so many years. As he
left for the last time, they came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbors were wearing the uniforms of the Serbian army,''
he said. ``They beat us, and put a knife under my chin and told me,
``Go to NATO. Go to the USA and let them help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Creeping undetected along a mountain path, he drove 10 hours to
his older sister's house in Bujore, within the resource-rich
northern part of Kosovo that the Yugoslav government is intent on
keeping. But it was already crowded with refugees. He went on to
his daughter's house in the city of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   During the nine months he stayed there, the days rang with rifle
fire, and the nights were lit by mortars and flames. Last week
Serbian police, some in black ski masks, returned to Mitrovica,
systematically crisscrossing the city in search of ethnic Albanians
in hiding. Finally, at about 10 a.m. on April 15, they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up the street walking,'' he said, describing an
almost tranquil scene that contrasted greatly with the events
unfolding, ``and when they saw me they shouted, `What are you doing
here? You must leave the house and leave Kosovo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they would eventually arrive, he had loaded his wagon
weeks before. Forced to decide what cherished parts of his life in
Kosovo to take with him, and what to leave behind, Behrami had
chosen carefully.
</P>
<P>
   He took what he thought would be useful things, like an ax, a
small stove and a sack of flour to make bread. He took blankets and
cushions for the 21 people in his extended family who would ride on
the rattling wooden wagon.
</P>
<P>
   And Behrami brought along a small wooden cradle, called a
``djep'' (pronounced dyep). Not because he expected to need it _
the youngest of his 10 children is 9 years old. But because for
him, as for many Kosovo families, the djep is a symbol of the
future, wherever one might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we left the djep, the Serbians would end up burning it,
just like they have destroyed everything else,'' he said. ``Now
they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police watched and waited until they left. It took about
10 minutes. They started heading toward the city of Pec, but were
stopped by police and forced to wait with other refugees overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that they found Aslan Hasani, 48, who is married to
Behrami's younger sister. Hasani's family had taken refuge in the
city after having been forced from his own village, Rezane, near
Mitrovica, by Yugoslav forces on September 15.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-school biology teacher with brown, tightly curled hair,
Hasani looked as if he were already half dead. He had spent a
horrible night tortured by doubts about his wife and son, whom he
had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   For six days before the Serbs showed up, Hasani's son Bajram,
16, had suffered severe stomach pains. Hasani was reluctant to
bring him to the hospital in Mitrovica and run the risk of
encountering police.
</P>
<P>
   Finally his wife, Naile, took the boy to the hospital and stayed
with him until he received the necessary appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   She was still there when police banged on the door of their
house. ``I asked them if I could go to the hospital to tell my
wife,'' Hasani said, his eyes reddening. ``The policemen said no,
`You can only go to Albania.'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Two days and two nights later, having been robbed and beaten by
police twice on the way, and having eaten nothing but hard bread
and salt, Hasani cared for his other four children and worried
about the part of his family that had been taken from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are dead,'' he said from atop the wagon hitch on
which he rode Saturday afternoon on the approach to Kukes, in
northern Albania. ``I'm afraid that since she doesn't have money to
pay the hospital, they will do something to her and to our son.''
As the tractor neared Kukes, the family got its first glimpse of
what life would be like for them in Albania. At a bend in the road,
the Italian government had built a refugee camp, surrounded by
barbed wire. Tractors and wagons were scattered everywhere. There
was no clear way to get in _ or out _ and no official to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Behrami, who had driven all the way from Mitrovica, finally got
off the tractor. ``What can I do now?'' he asked his
brother-in-law. He spoke through the barbed wire to someone in the
camp, asking first for information about relatives, then about
conditions in the camp. With optimism draining from his angular
face, he looked around and sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Three rifle shots sounded just then, and not far away he could
see an Albanian guard chasing after local children who had stolen
something from the camp. He adjusted the dirty black beret he never
removed and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to Kukes,'' he quietly told one of his sons. ``We
will have to pay for a room, and it will be very expensive, but we
cannot stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimly, he moved the tractor forward again. He fell silent a few
minutes later when he saw the chaos of the unorganized tractor
encampments that have sprung up around Kukes. Unlike the official
camps, which are at least organized, if inadequate, these
unofficial camps are nothing more than open fields. The refugees
organize themselves, if ``organize'' can be used to describe the
utter disorder of tens of thousands of lost families struggling to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Behrami is the unquestioned patriarch of his family, a strong
figure with a steely gaze who makes all decisions. Now he was lost,
and the uncharacteristic indecision seemed to sap his strength. ``I
don't know where to stop,'' he told his sons on the tractor.
``Where do we go?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a painful scene for the family, lasting until one son,
Lavdim, whose arm had been fractured by a blow from a Serbian
policeman, gestured for his father to pull into a vacant spot
alongside the road.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children did not get down from the wagon. Behrami
immediately ventured into the muddy field to find food. A bread
truck came and tried to distribute some hard loaves, but the
distributors haughtily told the mob that no bread would be given
out until they formed a single line. Behrami pushed his way to the
front, and his hand was upraised and pleading when the truck driver
pulled away to teach the disorderly refugees a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Behrami lined up again, and this time he came back with a
few unwrapped loaves. He broke off a piece and ate it, not with
pleasure but to fortify himself for the next fight.
</P>
<P>
   After insuring that everyone in the family had bread, he
wandered into town, stopping to ask peddlers and old men sitting on
stoops about finding shelter. With less than an hour left before
nightfall, he resigned himself to sleeping in the muddy field.
</P>
<P>
   While Behrami searched the field for a site that blocked the
fierce wind, Lavdim drove the tractor. But the boy was
inexperienced and nearly tipped the wagon over. Dark was
approaching, and a crescent moon was already cut out sharply in
front of the towering mountains. The women asked when they would
leave the field. Behrami had to tell them they would not leave that
night.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew that after being squeezed into the wagon for two
days, they had to have room to stretch out. He and his
brother-in-law, Hasani, wearily began to unload the tractor when a
stranger offered to let them use a nearby empty wagon. Behrami
gladly accepted and sent the women and children over. He spent his
first night in safety sleeping in his wagon under the green tarp
given to him at the border.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next day was a continuation of the last: fruitless searching
for a room, continuous worrying about his family. ``I am a family
man,'' he told a peddler who promised to bring him information
about an available rural house. ``If we must live here without food
and without shelter we will die.'' He had not spoken to a single
official or relief worker.
</P>
<P>
   Walking to another encampment in a city park, he found a friend,
who took Behrami to his married daughter, Fidaije, from whom he had
been separated in the refugee column. She had come with her husband
in their own tractor, bouncing along on one tire because a Serbian
policeman had shot out the other after she said she did not have
money to give him.
</P>
<P>
   For a second night the extended family slept in the wagons _
Behrami's brother-in-law, Hasani, and that side of the family in
the borrowed wagon at the muddy field; Behrami's wife and children
in a garbage-filled lot in the center of Kukes. There he was
offered the use of another empty wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, after the rains stopped, Behrami trudged
once more through the dilapidated city searching for a room, hoping
to get his family under a roof somewhere. Still he had not spoken
to any relief worker.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged, he returned to the tractor at midday to find a
thuggish-looking man accusing him of having taken his wagon the
night before without permission. A contingent of Kosovo rebel
soldiers, heavily armed and wearing new uniforms and identification
tags, came up to Behrami and order him to go with them. In Kukes,
local authority has been almost completely usurped by the rebels,
whose presence in the city is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nightmarish repeat of what he had been through before
in Kosovo. Without a chance to tell his wife anything, Behrami was
taken away. With his hands in the pockets of his coat, his beret
firmly on his head, he walked with them, hunched over, not looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers took him around the corner to a local outpost where
the man who made the complaint against him gestured threateningly
with a large wrench. The rebels chased away observers. Then, moving
quickly, they hustled Behrami into a small red Lada sedan,
squeezing him into the back seat with three rebels, their automatic
rifles planted between their legs. As the car sped off, the rebels
looked menacingly at passers-by, while Behrami stared blankly
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said that Behrami returned a few hours later and
parked the tractor in a lot somewhere. Then, along with the members
of his side of the family, he took a bus to the capital, Tirana.
This is something he had said repeatedly he would not do; the
rebels had obviously changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The djep was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   As they had begun several days before, the family was ending
this part of its sad odyssey split apart. Behrami left for Tirana
without a word to his brother-in-law, who was still in the first
borrowed wagon on the edge of the muddy field. Paralyzed by worry
over the fate of his wife and son in the hospital in Mitrovica, he
had done nothing to secure a home. He worried that his family would
be put out of the wagon that night.
</P>
<P>
   But then the owner of the wagon he had been using, who had
already found shelter in a rural village, came along. He and Hasani
met for the first time. They shook hands, and smoked a cigarette.
``We have very little,'' said the owner, Hatim Merdiu, who came
from the Kosovo village of Brodosane, near the Albanian border.
``But we must take care of each other.'' He told Hasani to stay in
the wagon as long as he needed.
</P>
<P>
   People who arrived in the camps after him told Hasani they heard
that his son was dead. Some said they had seen two bodies in his
house. He tried not to believe them. His responsibility now was to
care for his four other children, little ones who cry at night for
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Advam, 4, has the same curly hair as his father. He
is a dirty-faced imp with eyes that have already seen things a boy
should never see. Hasani said he regretted that he had not brought
any toys for the children to play with, but there had been so
little time, and so little space, for anything that was not
essential.
</P>
<P>
   The sun came out, and the air turned warm. Advam took from his
pocket his own treasure, a set of marbles. He knelt down and shot
one expertly, knocking another into a puddle. And there, at that
moment, in the mud and waste, it appeared he had made a home from
the fury of war.

COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES CITES WEAKENING VOLUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporting sales that were weaker than expected, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, Coca-Cola Co.'s largest soft-drink bottler, said
Tuesday that first-quarter volume rose just 1 percent, one of the
smallest increases in years.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain volume _ the soft drinks sold in restaurants, movie
theaters, sports arenas and other public places _ grew just 2
percent in the quarter. Despite the unimpressive volume growth,
Coca-Cola Enterprises said cash flow rose 11 percent, to $417
million in the quarter, after the company raised prices in several
distribution channels, including many supermarkets. Net losses,
however, widened to $61 million; in the comparable quarter of 1998,
the company lost $51 million. Revenues per case increased 3 percent
in the quarter, reflecting the higher prices as well as product,
packaging and distribution changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to be making good progress on raising prices in
the take-home channel,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst for
Goldman, Sachs. However, he said, Coca-Cola soft drinks are facing
increased competition from Pepsico's Pepsi-Cola. In March, he said,
citing data released Monday by Information Resources Inc., which
tracks sales in supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchandisers,
Coca-Cola's market share declined 1.7 percent, while Pepsi's market
share grew nine-tenths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have been locked in a price war for more than two
years, and Coca-Cola Enterprises moved in January to raise prices.
In March, the bottler raised prices 3.4 percent, compared with a
2.3 percent rise made by Pepsi bottlers, according to Information
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer products analyst for Merrill
Lynch, predicted that the bottler's volumes would increase in the
next three months, once consumers accept the price increases. ``For
the bottlers, this will be the era of good feelings,'' Goldman
said. ``With low inflation, you don't need a lot of price to derive
substantial benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises rose $1.4375 Tuesday, to $31.

HOGAN MEMENTOS GO TO USGA museum 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After spending four decades on display at
Colonial Country Club, the primary mementos from Ben Hogan's
record-setting PGA Tour career will be unveiled June 9 at the U.S.
Golf Association's Museum and Library in Far Hills, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day for the Ben Hogan Room, a 1,000-square-foot area
that will include more than 300 personal items donated by the Hogan
family, was announced yesterday by USGA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Hogan, widow of the legendary golfer from Fort Worth who
died in 1997, agreed last July to move the majority of Hogan's
artifacts out of Colonial so the items could be displayed in a
museum environment that offered greater public access and
heightened security measures. The USGA museum, also known as Golf
House, is open daily and is free to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he would be so pleased that the public can come to see
his things,'' Valerie Hogan said. ``This is what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the medals from Hogan's nine major championships have
been moved to Golf House, fans who attend the MasterCard Colonial
(May 20-23) will not be denied a sense of Hogan's contributions to
his hometown tournament. Colonial officials will continue to fill
the shelves of its Ben Hogan Room in the main clubhouse with
vintage photographs, instructional books, a Colonial champion's
jacket and trophies that USGA officials deemed more pertinent to a
regional audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Hogan is giving us some things, and some members are
helping us add to our inventory,'' said Dr. Wally Schmuck, a member
of the Hogan Room Committee formed to reconfigure Colonial's
permanent shrine to its only five-time champion. ``Everything in
the room will be Hogan-related. We still have a lot of items. We're
just spreading them out a little more than we used to.''

SHIP'S CARGO CONTAINER USED TO SMUGGLE IN 19 CHINESE NATIONALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nineteen people, including as many as three juveniles,
endured two weeks stuffed into a cargo container on the rolling
decks of a freighter as it crossed the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It was an attempt to reach America, the land of freedom and
opportunity. But they had precious little freedom and no
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Police and security guards apprehended the 19 Chinese males just
after they climbed out of a cargo container on the Sea-Land
Navigator early Sunday morning in the Port of Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently are the customers of Chinese smugglers who are
increasingly using the giant container ships that ply the Pacific
and visit West Coast ports for their human cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a troubling trend,'' said Bob Coleman, deputy
district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Seattle. ``This fits an existing pattern of soft-top container
smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS has had other cases in which Chinese citizens were
smuggled in in containers with tops made out of vinyl or other
fabric, Coleman said. That allows air to get in so those being
smuggled can breathe.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the INS and the U.S. Coast Guard discovered 11
Chinese nationals hidden in a cargo container on a Korean ship that
had just pulled into Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, INS agents discovered an empty cargo container in
Tacoma, Wash., and evidence that people had been living in it
during the voyage across the Pacific. None of the stowaways was
found.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea-Land Navigator, which can carry as many as 1,000 40-foot
containers, made port calls in Hong Kong and Kao-hsiung in Taiwan
in early April, said Clint Eisenhauer, a spokesman for Sea-Land
Service Inc. at its Charlotte, N.C., headquarters. The Korean ship
carrying the 11 Chinese apprehended in California also made stops
at Hong Kong and Kao-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very rare,'' Eisenhauer said. ``They are the first
stowaways from Asia ever (for Sea-Land).''
</P>
<P>
   The 19 males on the Sea-Land Navigator had food and water, but
little else in the way of comforts. ``It's a horrible trip,''
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the stowaways agreed to pay as much as $40,000 to
smugglers to reach the United States. ``It's better than cocaine
smuggling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In past cases, Chinese citizens have made a down payment on the
trip, then promise to pay the rest after finding a job in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials were questioning the 19 people Tuesday, trying to
determine at which port they got into the cargo container and how
they managed to elude detection until they were caught.
</P>
<P>
   The INS will decide what will become of the stowaways; most will
likely be deported.
</P>
<P>
   At least one and as many of three are juveniles, an INS
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator crossed the Pacific and arrived in Tacoma on
Saturday, Eisenhauer said. Early Sunday morning, Tacoma police
asked for help from port security to catch the stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards found and stopped the 19 near the cargo
container.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the agency is ``working strong investigative
leads'' to determine if any of the 19 were smugglers or whether the
smugglers had local connections.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese smugglers have become adept at bringing in illegal
aliens by air, sea and land. In the past year, law enforcement
agents have discovered that:
</P>
<P>
   - Smugglers were using a fishing boat to bring Chinese from
South America, then transferring them to the United States by small
power boats based in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   - Chinese citizens were arriving in Vancouver, British Columbia,
by air, then taken across Canada in a van. They were smuggled into
the United States through a Mohawk Indian Reservation along
Canada's border with New York state. Soon, they were on their way
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   - Moss Landing and Half Moon Bay in Northern California were
used to smuggle in Chinese, whom smugglers turned into virtual
slaves in the United States.

COMMENTARY: FOR SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's potential Senate candidacy reached a new plane
this week when she and the citizens of the Empire State moved into
the same pronoun. ``We have everything in New York that we have in
America,'' she said. In some kind of agrarian flashback to her
Arkansas days, she added that the New York press corps might be
surprised to know the kind of crops that are grown in their state.
If this candidacy blossoms, flash cards and spelling tests are sure
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that New York is uniquely reflective of the nation as a
whole is sure to appall the nation as a whole, but a contest
featuring Mrs. Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani, New York City's mayor,
would certainly be America's race. The nationalization of the New
York Senate seat is already happening. Giuliani announced at a
speaking engagement in Florida that he had filed papers
establishing his potential candidacy. Mrs. Clinton, expanding the
race's scope further, broke her self-imposed embargo in discussing
her political plans while she was in Cairo. (This week, as Adam
Nagourney noted in The Times, she entertained a public discussion
of the Senate race for the first time ``on American soil.'')
</P>
<P>
   On a substantive level, Clinton vs. Giuliani would be an
interesting clash between the politics of moderate Republicanism
and of Clintonian Democrats, in which we would finally get to
figure out how the two differ. (This week's hint: school vouchers.)
On a personal level, this is the gender gap come to life. But right
now, the greatest fascination lies in the sight of these two
outsize personalities trying to fit themselves into their new
roles.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Clinton finally allowed reporters to ask questions
this week, the infamous bulldog New York press corps failed to
bite, offering only one hesitant query about whether it was fair
for the American taxpayers to be underwriting these first-lady
forays into New York. If Mrs. Clinton had been studying Giuliani's
technique, she would have announced that the subsidized
transportation and staff were all necessary for her security, and
perhaps implied that the media was sympathetic to international
terrorism. Instead, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary compared the
questioning reporter to a ``pinhead,'' raising the possibility that
the information policy that has done so much for President
Clinton's reputation can be exported to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Giuliani, whose inability to get along with his
peers is notorious, wants to join the clubbiest legislative body in
human history is almost as otherworldly as the idea of a first lady
running for election in a state where she has never lived even as
her husband still occupies the White House. The mayor has never
told Gov. George Pataki that he is interested in the Senate race,
although he has traveled to Texas to discuss the matter with George
W. Bush. When the mayor was asked about Pataki at an event in
Staten Island, he invited his Greek chorus, Borough President Guy
Molinari, to deliver a reply. While Giuliani stood dutifully at his
side, Molinari laced into the governor for trying to ``scuttle''
the Giuliani candidacy. It is a pretty good definition of surreal
politics when a candidate for senator from New York chooses to
discuss his ambitions with the governor of Texas while attacking
the governor of New York through the borough president of Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's associates say she will announce her intentions
this summer, and that the longer she waits the more likely it is
she will run. The first lady has apparently already decided that
she would like to make the race, but has not quite come to grips
with whether she could stand to lose. Giuliani, whose inner life
seems far less complicated, says he is closing in on a decision,
but that he is worried the city might sink back into anarchy and
chaos if he is not at the helm. One side fears yet another personal
nightmare, the other envisions barbarians at the gates. The
presidential race would pale by comparison.

   ALL MAJOR INDEXES REBOUND A DAY AFTER A BIG SELLOFF
</P>
<P>
   Shares of technology companies rebounded in heavy trading after
Monday's selloff, and investors were seen moving out of
economically sensitive cyclical stocks, like industrial and oil
companies, which have been rallying.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index recovered 64.03 points of Monday's
138-point loss and closed at 2,409.64, up 2.7 percent. The Dow
Jones industrial average edged up 8.02 points, or 0.1 percent, to
10,448.55, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.69
points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,306.17.

<P>
   BROWSER RIVALS JOIN FORCES
</P>
<P>
   Hadi Partovi, the former lead product manager for Microsoft's
Internet Explorer, is joining a Silicon Valley software start-up
founded by two former enemies from Netscape, Michael McCue and
Angus Davis, and backed by Jim Clark, the co-founder of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD NEWS FOR DRUG STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   A steep selloff in drug stocks halted after three large drug
makers reported first-quarter earnings gains and and a fourth
received a recommendation from a government panel that a new drug
be approved. What surprised analysts was Johnson &AMP; Johnson's 12.3
percent gain. The earnings news lifted the shares of many drug
companies, with Johnson &AMP; Johnson rising $6, to $96.25.
</P>
<P>
   CAR MAKERS DELAY FACTORIES
</P>
<P>
   An opposition governor in southern Brazil has disrupted plans by
General Motors and Ford Motor to build two car factories regarded
as prototypes for the future.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT RISES AT SEVERAL BANKS
</P>
<P>
   Several of the nation's big banks reported big gains in
earnings. Chase Manhattan said first-quarter net jumped 61 percent,
Bank One said profits were up 23 percent, and Wells Fargo reported
a 29 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure from shrinking demand for cigarettes and the
cost of tobacco-related lawsuit settlements, Philip Morris posted a
1.4 percent increase in first-quarter profit.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the nation's largest phone companies _ Sprint,
BellSouth, Ameritech and SBC Communications _ reported strong gains
in first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   AUDITING BOARD CONSIDERS CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets the
nation's accounting rules, is expected to vote Wednesday for strict
limits or even a ban on the use of the pooling of interest
accounting method, which played a prominent part in many of the
largest corporate mergers and acquisitions in recent years.

   INQUIRY HURT BRAZILIAN MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness over a legislative inquiry into reported
irregularities during a Brazilian government bailout of two
investment banks earlier this year unsettled financial markets
there. The Bovespa stock index gave up 4 percent before
recuperating to close at 10,989.42, down 207.18 points, or 1.85
percent. The bailout was organized by Francisco Lopes, who has
since been replaced as head of the central bank and is now a
consultant in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   INFLATION IS EXPECTED TO RISE
</P>
<P>
   The rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,
is likely to jump this year to more than 2 percent from the 1.6
percent of last year. It could increase even more if oil prices
continue to rise, upsetting the stock and bond markets. Market
Place.

   PROTECTING INTERNET PRIVACY
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has proposed new rules to protect
the privacy interests of children on the Internet. They would
require commercial Web sites to get parental consent before seeking
information from children younger than 13 and would require the
sites to post notifications about what they do with any information
obtained from children.

TV CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WITH CONFUSION AND FEW FACTS, NONSTOP
COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING) 
 (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network news came on in time to report that the local police
chief estimated that 25 people had been killed in a high school in
Littleton, Colo., probably by two people in long coats and masks,
perhaps members of a group known as the trench coat Mafia, who had
then killed themselves. The chief referred to them as
``gentlemen,'' then apologized for his undue politeness.
</P>
<P>
   For seven or so hours before, the cable channels had had the
assignment once again of covering a big story that lacked known
facts. And with the exception of a striking picture or two, it did
not make for much of a television story. Trapped by their reason
for being and by the competition, they had to deliver nonstop
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the televised images from Columbine High School in
Littleton, a suburb of Denver, were of police officers running here
and there, doing it was hard to say what. They were identified as
SWAT teams. But then came a batch of students, fleeing the school,
hands behind their necks for some reason. In the most dramatic
moment, a wounded student was helped from a second-story window by
two officers.
</P>
<P>
   These few images were repeated and repeated and repeated. Time
was also used up on all channels with lists of other schools that
had known shootings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The national networks, broadcast and cable, turned for help to
affiliate stations in Denver, whose anchors and reporters were hard
put to find words, not because of the enormity of the event but
because of the scarcity of information. A man in Denver resorted to
praise for the camaraderie he witnessed: ``We ought to be very
proud of that as Coloradans.'' A local official concurred. He said
his town was full of caring people.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken, weeping girls told of their moments of panic. Official
spokesmen appeared after a while, bestowing credits on every
law-enforcement agency on the premises. We were reminded on MSNBC
that in past school shootings in Oregon, Arkansas and Alaska, the
perpetrators were all young men with behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   It was also reported that the Colorado Rockies and the Denver
Nuggets had canceled their ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter pressed a student to speculate on whether the episode
might have been connected with a feud of some sort or a racial
confrontation. The student resisted. He attributed the shooting to
``sick people.'' That was as persuasive an analysis as anything
else we had been hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another student called the killers ``social outcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8 p.m., President Clinton appeared and said a few
words about ``trying to prevent these things from happening.'' He
also said he needed more facts to say much more. The reporters
asked a few empty questions and must have envied the luxury of
getting off camera as easily as the president.

ACCOUNTING RULES MAY CHANGE FOR MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board that sets the nation's accounting rules is expected to
vote Wednesday for strict limits or even a ban on the use of an
accounting method that played a prominent part in many of the
largest corporate mergers and acquisitions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Jenkins, the chairman of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, said Tuesday that his staff had recommended that
the board eliminate the accounting method known as pooling of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-member board is also considering whether to
continue to allow pooling in the small number of cases where two
companies of equal size decide to merge, Jenkins said. The board
will discuss whether the rules can be written in a way that would
prevent companies of unequal sizes from finding ways to squeeze
through loopholes so that they can still use pooling accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The board will not force companies that have already merged to
change their accounting, Jenkins said, although it may make the
changes effective for mergers and acquisitions that take place
before the final rules are issued, probably in late 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the board expects to issue a draft of the
proposed rules. Companies will then have three months to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many corporate executives and Wall Street
dealmakers have come to count on pooling accounting because it
allows merging companies to avoid expensive charges relating to the
intangible asset known as good will, which reduce future earnings.
Pooling accounting is being used in deals like those between Exxon
and Mobil and Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the pooling method, including federal securities
regulators, say that it allows corporate executives to use
shareholders' money to make expensive acquisitions but never record
the price of those decisions in the accounting ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pooling does not leave an adequate trail of management's
acquisition activities,'' Jack Ciesielski wrote recently in his
newsletter, the Analyst's Accounting Observer, which is published
in Baltimore. ``A mediocre acquisition can still look decent and
accretive to earnings if pooling is used.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pooling, the accounting ledgers of two companies are
simply added together, and any premium that one company may be
paying for the other disappears.
</P>
<P>
   But under the other merger accounting method, known as purchase
accounting, the acquiring company must record the full value of the
cash and stock that was paid for the other company. If the company
is paying a large premium, most of the excess is generally recorded
as good will, which must be gradually written off.
</P>
<P>
   The standards board, based in Norwalk, Conn., has also
tentatively agreed on new rules for accounting for good will.
Instead of continuing to allow companies to write it off over as
many as 40 years, the board has decided to shorten the maximum
period to 20 years. Under the shortened schedule, many companies
would have larger reductions in earnings each year, until the good
will was written off, than they would have had if they had been
able to stretch the process out over a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins said the board was reconsidering some of its
decisions on good will after reading letters sent by companies in
response to a paper proposing that pooling accounting be
eliminated. The paper was written by a group of authors including
two members of the standards board; members of similar rule-making
boards in Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand, and
representatives of the International Accounting Standards
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies said that if pooling were to be eliminated, the
standards board should work harder to clarify the purchase
accounting rules, especially those that pertain to good will.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the letters, Jenkins said, the board is
considering other options for the accounting for good will,
including allowing companies to leave it on their books
indefinitely if they can prove that its value has not diminished or
allowing them to write it off immediately if it appears to have no
future value.

AMGEN BEATS ANALYSTS' FORECASTS, BUT STOCK DROPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Biotechnology drug maker Amgen Inc., based in
Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles, soundly beat analysts' first
quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, but then saw its share price
pounded in trading after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen was expected to earn 44 cents per share by a consensus of
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. The company bested that
figure by 4.5 percent, or 2 cents per share, on what the company
said was strong growth in sales of the drug Epogen. Revenues from
the drug increased 30 percent to $395 million for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the report, which came out after U.S. markets
closed, investors sent Amgen shares up by $8.0625, or 13.23
percent, to $69. Trading in the stock was heavy, with 9.3 million
shares changing hands, or roughly twice the 30-day average volume
for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move that surprised some analysts, the stock dropped $3
in Nasdaq trading after the close of markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was some misguided concern about their pipeline,''
said analyst Douglas Christopher of Los Angeles-based Crowell,
Weedon &AMP; Co. He noted that Amgen, in its earnings report, announced
that it was discontinuing development of two drugs _ a form of the
anti-obesity compound leptin, as well as GDNF for the treatment of
Parkinson's disease _ but said the moves should have no material
impact on the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Amgen executives reiterated
that they expect the company to earn $1.80 to $1.85 per share for
the year. Since the company announced in March that it will spend
up to $100 million to develop a prostate cancer drug it acquired,
that means sales are growing faster than expected for drugs Amgen
already has developed.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the anti-anemia drug Epogen have grown rapidly in the
last year since a Clinton administration decision to ease Medicare
restrictions on the drug. Almost all of Epogen's revenue comes
through Medicare, the federal health plan for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Along with most publicly traded U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech
firms, Amgen's shares were pounded Monday in a sell-off that
hammered the company's stock down by $5.875, or 8.7 percent, to
close at $60.9375. Christopher said that a cycling-out of
technology and drug stock may have contributed to the after-hours
drop in Amgen stock Tuesday.

DEMOCRATS SEEK MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats in Congress on Tuesday kicked off a major
effort to secure Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, one of
the biggest expenses for millions of elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for such benefits promises to continue into next
year's elections, as candidates from both parties search for ways
to plug a conspicuous hole in Medicare coverage and try to solve
the program's long-term financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most employers who provide health benefits to employees help pay
for prescription drugs. But Medicare generally does not pay for
drugs used by patients outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In offering the Democratic proposal, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said Medicare's failure to cover prescription drugs was
``the greatest single gap'' in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Many elderly people receive drug benefits through health
maintenance organizations or through private insurance that
supplements Medicare. But Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said there was
a growing clamor for Medicare to cover drug costs because HMOs were
cutting back drug benefits, and private Medigap insurers have
sharply increased premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, a Medicare beneficiary would have to pay a
deductible of $200 a year in drug expenses, but Medicare would then
pay 80 percent of the cost of each prescription. The government
would pay $1,200 of the first $1,700 in annual drug expenses. It
would provide additional coverage for people with very high drug
costs, so beneficiaries would have to spend more than $3,000 of
their own money each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they did not yet have an estimate of the cost
of their proposal. Beneficiaries would pay some through higher
premiums. Other possible sources of money include higher tobacco
taxes and the anticipated federal budget surplus. In addition,
Democrats said, proper use of drugs could save some money by
reducing the need for more costly treatments, hospitalization and
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they had modeled their proposal after the
arrangements already used by many employers to manage the cost of
prescription drugs provided to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The government would award contracts to private organizations to
manage drug benefits for Medicare patients. These private entities
could include groups of retail pharmacists, insurers and
specialized companies like PCS and Medco. PCS, now a subsidiary of
Rite Aid Corp., and Medco, a unit of Merck &AMP; Co., manage
prescription drug care for employers, labor unions and health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans agreed that many elderly people needed help with
drug bills, but said the Democratic plan was likely to prove very
expensive. Drug companies welcomed the Democrats' effort to use
private ``pharmacy benefit managers,'' but said there would be far
too big a role for the government.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drug companies' big concerns is that Medicare would
be a huge purchaser and could command discounts similar to those
available to other big buyers, like HMOs and large employers.
Indeed, the Democrats' bill says Medicare beneficiaries shall
receive drug discounts comparable to those provided to ``large
private sector purchasers.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dichter, executive vice president of PCS Health
Systems in Scottsdale, Ariz., said the government's ability to
achieve such savings would depend on how much latitude it gave to
the managers of Medicare drug benefits. The Democrats would allow
companies to establish lists of preferred drugs and to recommend
low-cost generic versions of brand-name medications.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have long been nervous about Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs because they fear it could lead to federal
regulation of drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a trade group, praised the Democrats on Tuesday for
``backing away from the type of price control legislation they
proposed in 1993-94,'' as part of President Clinton's plan to
redesign the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldbaum said the Democrats' bill gave the secretary of
health and human services ``quite extensive authority to set rules
for Medicare drug benefits, without much guidance from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, expressed cautious interest in the Democrats' ideas. ``I
look forward to working in a bipartisan way to provide some form of
prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries,'' Archer
said.

BONILLA ENDS HIS DROUGHT WITH TIE-BREAKING BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Strikeout followed popout. Popout followed
strikeout. The runners he left on base were piling up.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Bobby Bonilla in a rut. While he stumbled through
the first two weeks of the season, the self-analysis he kept
offering sounded more like an excuse than anything profound.
</P>
<P>
   One road trip. One homestand. The middle of the month. That is
all Bonilla said he needed to regain his batting stroke. He had
missed most of spring training with a partly torn ligament in his
right knee, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Getting away from the boos he has grown so accustomed to at Shea
Stadium could not have hurt much, either. But whether it was a new
road trip, a less hostile environment or just the right time of the
month mattered little to the Mets in the aftermath of their 3-2
victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That was because Bonilla slugged a one-out, seventh-inning home
run off Pete Harnisch that broke a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Bonilla's first of the season and first with the
Mets in nearly four years. It seemed almost as long since his last
extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was 6 for 37 _ all singles _ before his homer. And while
it came a little late for Orel Hershiser, Bonilla's timing in the
cleanup slot was perfect for a team that will be without Mike
Piazza for five more days.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco, who came on in the ninth with a two-run lead,
yielded one run but got the last two batters out with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser took a 1-0 lead into the sixth inning, thanks to a
two-out, second-inning triple from Mike Kinkade followed by Todd
Pratt's run-scoring single. But the player Hershiser really had to
thank for the lead was shortstop Rey Ordonez, who robbed the Reds
of a run in the fourth with a terrific relay throw.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin had opened the inning by drawing a four-pitch walk.
Sean Casey followed with a double into the left-field corner.
Kinkade, a converted catcher-third baseman who was making just his
second start in the majors, did his job by fielding the ball
cleanly and hitting his cut-off man, Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' two-time Gold Glove winner took Kinkade's throw in
medium left field and in one blur of a motion pivoted and fired a
one-hop strike to Pratt at the plate. Pratt's tag beat Larkin's
head-first dive. And after Casey made a base running mistake on a
grounder hit to Ordonez for the second out, Hershiser was able to
escape the inning with his lead intact.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser could not escape the sixth. Mike Cameron pushed a
bunt between the mound and first base and under Hershiser's reach
for a single. Cameron stole second on a pitch to the backstop, then
took third on Larkin's grounder to second. Casey followed with a
run-scoring double to left center. After walking Greg Vaughn,
Hershiser, the 40-year-old right-hander, was done for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook retired the next two Reds on flies to keep the score
1-1. And so Hershiser's line read five and a third innings, five
hits, one run, three walks and three strikeouts, lowering his
earned run average to 3.60 after three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch _ the former Met _ had been given new life. But then
Harnisch left a pitch up to Bonilla leading off the seventh. And
Bonilla responded.

WITH HULL, STARS ALIGNED IN QUEST FOR STANLEY CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If you believe in fate, if you believe that
coincidences don't really exist and that events are a byproduct of
karma and the juxtaposition of Stars in the universe, then you know
perfectly well why Brett Hull is here.
</P>
<P>
   You know there's a reason he skates for the Dallas Stars tonight
at this point in space and time. You knew it last summer, when
owner Tom Hicks opened his treasury to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   It was July 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars celebrated Independence Day 24 hours early.
</P>
<P>
   The moment we've been waiting for since that hot July afternoon
has arrived. The NHL's second season, the one that matters, is
here.
</P>
<P>
   This time the difference-maker is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge playoff for Brett Hull,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said yesterday after the final practice at Stars Center
before the first-round playoff matchup with Edmonton tonight at
Reunion Arena. ``Huge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's huge because the 34-year-old winger has never had a better
chance at a Stanley Cup. In 11 previous full seasons in the NHL, he
has been past the second round of the playoffs only once _ two
games of the 1986 Stanley Cup as a newly called up rookie with
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team game, and there's not a lot you can do if the
people above you don't give you the team to carry on with,'' Hull
said. ``There's obviously pressure on me. I'm the guy they brought
in that they felt would put them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's just my internal pressure. All I can do is play
within the group and play hard and do the best I can. I'm not one
to sit there and be afraid, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull afraid? When pigs fly and the Rangers beat the Yankees in
the playoffs, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   This opportunity is why he came here. It's why he has tamed his
game, given up much of his free-wheeling offense to fit within a
system that emphasizes defense and hard work first. Everything
else, including egos, is somewhere down the line.
</P>
<P>
   That Hull has willingly accepted Hitchcock's philosophy tells
you how much he wants to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a style that's changed my game from the kind of guy who
hides and jumps into hole,'' Hull said. ``There's no hiding on this
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this situation and on this team, you go right from the
get-go. There's no more waiting around and picking your spots. That
was a big change for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has adapted well, scoring 32 goals, including an NHL-best
11 game-winners, and teaming with Mike Modano (34 goals) to give
the Stars as strong an offensive line as there is in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a little bit of your creativity, because now you're
right in the middle of things and people have their eye on you all
the time,'' Hull said of the Stars' style of play. ``That's not the
way I've played before. It took 30-35 games before it became
instinctual and I didn't have to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you are \Ra great star\S on this team you're not
because of the way they play. I don't know, in this style, if
they'll ever have a 50-goal scorer. But every night there's a new
guy who steps up and does something to help you win. You don't come
up with 110 points by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hull has given the Stars something they lacked, a
scorer with a big shot, an offensive threat who can score from
anywhere inside the blue line. Fifteen of his 32 goals have come on
the power play. When teams get too frisky and take penalties, Hull
is the man who makes them pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hull's given us confidence that we've got people on our team
who can score from a distance,'' Hitchcock said. ``In the playoffs,
with the tenacity that people defend with, you have to have people
who can do those things. He's scored a number of goals from the
same locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost, at times, surprising for us because we're not
used to that type of player being on our team. At the start, it was
hard trying to find that player. We're always looking for that
player going to the net, not finding that empty space in the slot
or in the higher areas. It took us half a season to get used to him
playing in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the playoffs last season? With Joe Nieuwendyk out
courtesy of the San Jose snake, Bryan Marchment, the Stars just
hoped they could slop in a goal or two and hang on with defense.
Hull and Modano on the ice together puts double pressure on
defenses, each opening up space for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're on the bench, you can feel the scoring chance
coming,'' Hitchcock said. ``When he's out on the ice, you can feel
it coming from somewhere, especially when there's a longer
possession in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Hull who scores, or whether he's opening it up for
Modano or another of the Stars, the bottom line is winning. First
this series, then the next, and the next, right on to the Stanley
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   He could have stayed in St. Louis and scored goals. He came here
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking it up, and Hully hasn't played on a team
that's had a lot of playoff success,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's a big
challenge for him. Brett had the opportunity to go to a number of
teams, but he wanted to have team success.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the Stars were shrugging about winning another
Presidents' Trophy, Hull was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Presidents' Trophy wasn't delivered on time, for
whatever reason, he's the one who led the big uproar,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Everybody wanted to downplay the darn thing because you
think it's the kiss of death when it comes out there, but he was
really, really upset and he came out and said, `You know what,
that's the first team trophy I've ever won.' He wanted that thing
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it started to hit home that individually he's had
a great career, but now he's looking at other things. He wants to
be a part of team success and he's pretty focused in that area
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why he's here. Brett Hull and the Stars have come
together at this point in space and time for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   They're here for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Day, Stars style, has arrived.

HIGH COURT WEIGHS FEDERALISM IN STATES' IMMUNITY FROM LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fault lines within the Supreme Court over basic
questions of federalism were on full display Tuesday as the
justices heard arguments in two cases on whether states can be
forced into federal court to defend their business practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of 1992 laws, Congress made states liable to private
damage suits in federal court for unfair trade practices, like
false advertising, and for patent infringement. The question for
the court Tuesday was whether, in either of these areas, Congress
had the authority to nullify the states' constitutional immunity
from suits in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear from the justices' questions and comments
throughout the two hours of arguments that much more was at stake
than the fate of the two laws, the Patent Remedy Act and the
Trademark Remedy Clarification Act.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Congress passed these laws, the ground shifted on
federalism as a series of Supreme Court decisions began to sweep
away long-held assumptions about the authority of Congress to make
federal laws binding on state governments. The real question before
the court Tuesday was how much of that authority is left.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases began as lawsuits by a bank that markets certificates
of deposit for financing future college expenses, against a Florida
agency that the state set up to offer a similar investment program
for Florida residents. The College Savings Bank, based in
Princeton, N.J., charged that Florida had both infringed its patent
on its financing methods and had also engaged in false advertising
of the state program, in violation of a federal law, the Lanham
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed in 1994, were still pending in U.S. District
Court in Newark, N.J., when an unrelated Supreme Court decision
limited federal jurisdiction over a large category of suits against
states. In that decision, Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, the court
ruled that in the ordinary exercise of its power to regulate
interstate commerce, Congress lacked authority to abrogate the
immunity that states enjoy under the 11th Amendment from suits in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the district court dismissed College Savings Bank's
false advertising case against Florida. But it refused Florida's
request to dismiss the patent infringement case. The court reasoned
that because the legal system regards a patent as a type of
property, the 1992 law that made states liable to suit for patent
infringement was not ordinary commercial legislation. Rather, the
district court found, it was an exercise of Congress' power under
the 14th Amendment to protect against the deprivation of property
without due process of law, a power that the Supreme Court had not
directly attacked in the Seminole Tribe case.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Philadelphia, agreed
with the dismissal of the false advertising suit, while the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized appeals
court in Washington that has nationwide jurisdiction over patent
cases, agreed that the College Savings Bank could still pursue its
patent infringement suit. Each side appealed the case that it lost
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments Tuesday ranged over a number of issues. Could the
right to be free of unfair competition, like false advertising, not
also be considered a type of property right? Could a state that
enters the commercial marketplace, either by selling an investment
contract or opening a coffee bar _ an image the Justices seemed to
find particularly engaging _ be seen as waiving whatever special
immunity from suit it might otherwise possess?
</P>
<P>
   But the most important issue appeared to be the current
definition of Congress' power to protect constitutional rights
under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment. The amendment, adopted after
the Civil War, prohibits the states from violating the guarantees
of due process and equal protection; Section 5 authorizes Congress
to ``enforce, by appropriate legislation'' the amendment's
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, defending the patent infringement
law and arguing on the side of the College Savings Bank, told the
court that Congress was aware in 1992 that states were becoming
major players in the fields of technology and intellectual property
and that private patent holders felt threatened. ``Congress heard
there was a problem,'' Waxman said. ``It was emerging. It was
getting worse. It was unique. State remedies were inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, he continued, was whether the method Congress
chose, to permit patent holders to sue states, was ``appropriate''
legislation under Section 5. Congress' conclusion was entitled to
the Court's deference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Glogau told the
court that the patent infringement law was unconstitutional because
Congress' authority under Section 5 was limited to remedying
constitutional violations. The proper question, he said, was not
whether Congress found that the states were likely to infringe
patents, but whether in doing so they would deny patent holders due
process. There was no due process violation as long as states
offered some redress in their own courts, as Florida did, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter objected that there was a need for
uniformity in the application of federal patent law, rather than a
patchwork of 50 state remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Using the format of posing questions to the Florida lawyer,
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony M.
Kennedy then began to debate Souter, who is as strong an advocate
of federal authority as the other three justices are of states'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't the fact that patent cases can be appealed to the Supreme
Court provide sufficient guarantee of uniformity, O'Connor asked?
</P>
<P>
   Scalia wanted to know why, when the Constitution did not even
require the creation of the lower federal courts, the Supreme Court
should deduce a requirement for federal jurisdiction over patent
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The patent case is Florida Prepaid Board vs. College Savings
Bank, No. 98-531. The false advertising case is College Savings
Bank vs. Florida Prepaid Board, No. 98-149.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a two-hour service filled with preaching, prayer
and psalms about healing and reconciliation, the most profound
statement came from a simple, silent gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist
Church, who less than a year ago denounced Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
as a racist, stepped off the podium at St. Patrick's Cathedral on
Tuesday and walked over to the first pew to shake the mayor's hand.
The two men ended up in a cordial embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing unites us like the humble, simple act of prayer,''
Butts told the crowd of about 1,500, including a wide array of New
York's religious and political leaders, who had gathered at the
invitation of Cardinal John O'Connor to help repair a city scarred
by the Feb. 4 police shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was not listed on the program but was invited to
say a few words after the extraordinary handshake-turned-hug,
responded with perhaps his most conciliatory comments since the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our similarities are much greater than our differences,''
Giuliani said humbly. ``We're children of the same God. The mayor
needs to recognize that. The police do. And the citizens of the
city do.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 weeks after Diallo, a 22-year-old West African
immigrant, died in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment in a
barrage of 41 police bullets, the service aimed to shift civic
discourse over the incident from the fiery civil disobedience in
front of police headquarters to a more spiritual, forward-looking
sense of unity. Clergy from all faiths sat side by side, in robes
of black, magenta and white, vestments of gold, green and burgundy,
each offering similar messages about the common origin of all
people, regardless of race or belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a time for protest and a time for prayer,'' said
O'Connor. ``Today is a time for prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the Talmud and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter
from a Birmingham Jail, reading from the Q'uran and Corinthians II,
ministers and rabbis, imams and elected officials, police officers
and a high school valedictorian took turns at the microphone. Among
those in the audience were Police Commissioner Howard Safir; Bronx
District Attorney Robert Johnson; and Mark Green, the city's public
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   In the ecumenical semicircle of clergy, the haberdashery
revealed the diversity of the service, from the crimson skullcap of
the Episcopal bishop, E. Ron Taylor, to the gold cone atop the head
of Shaykh Abd' Allah Latif Ali, from Sister Loretta Richards' navy
headscarf to Rabbi Robert N. Levine's knit yarmulke and the large
black hood of the Rev. Sooren Chinchinian ofthe Armenian church.
</P>
<P>
   They offered prayers for Diallo's family, and for the four
police officers indicted on second-degree murder charges in his
death. They appealed for peace and justice, dignity and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the service were Diallo's parents, who
met with the cardinal last month, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has
led dozens of demonstrations against police brutality since the
shooting. Sharpton said in an interview afterward that he boycotted
the event because the program did not include families of victims
of brutality or ministers who had been among the nearly 1,200
people arrested protesting the shooting last month. Representatives
of his National Action Network had been asked to give the
invocation but canceled at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like me saying I'm going to have a reconciliation service
on Yugoslavia and not invite the Albanians,'' Sharpton said. ``I
always like to see people act civil to each other, but I definitely
don't think it should be billed as reconciliation around Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   The embrace between Giuliani and Butts, he added, ``has as much
to do with the police brutality movement as Yogi Berra making up
with George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts stunned city officials and black leaders alike last spring
when he called Giuliani a racist who was on the verge of turning
New York into a fascist state. Butts, whose political alliances
have included Gov. George Pataki but excluded Sharpton, has
previously spoken out about the Diallo case but has not been a
leader in the protest movement.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Tuesday afternoon that Butts' gesture ``was part
of the spirit'' of O'Connor's interfaith service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reciprocated in trying to dmonstrate whatever differences
we have we should put aside,'' he said. ``We both worship the same
God.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was the theme of nearly every speech at the cathedral, as
ministers and lay people pointed out that the diversity of New York
City _ and, indeed, the world _ had grown from a common seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go through justice to get to peace,'' the Rev.
James Goode, a Franciscan friar, said in a sermon that earned
several standing ovations. ``Are we willing to be a little
uncomfortable, so we can all be a little more comfortable?
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we willing to give up for the cause of justice? What
are we willing to give up to raise up one another?'' he demanded of
the audience. ``Let us never be so busy fighting each other that we
don't realize it is far more important to fight for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Henry, 59, a cosmetologist who lives in East Harlem, said
attending Tuesday's prayer service was a natural extension of her
marching over the Brooklyn Bridge behind Sharpton last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe God is sending out a message with Amadou Diallo,''
she said. ``We need a total circle to correct the injustice of New
York. People need to understand, enough is enough. We need to make
sure people hear all of the messages of today.''

INSULIN PUMP, NEW BLOOD GLUCOSE SENSOR KEEP MINIMED OUTLOOK HOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two days after splitting its stock 2-for-1,
MiniMed Inc. is expected to post a 41 percent gain in first quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of microinfusion pumps, based in the Sylmar community
of Los Angeles, is expected to post earnings of 12 cents per share,
according to a consensus of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks
Investment Research. The company earned 8.5 cents per share in the
first quarter of 1998. MiniMed is expected to have first-quarter
revenues between $34 million and $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed's pumps are worn by diabetics to release insulin as
needed into their bodies. The company is using the same technology
to develop treatments for other chronic conditions that require
regular drug injections.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by strong sales of the pump and anticipation of U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approval of a new blood glucose sensor,
MiniMed's share price has climbed steadily from a low of $40.3750
in July 1998 to a high of more than $110 earlier this month. Such
growth prompted the company's board of directors to authorize
Monday's split. MiniMed shares closed Tuesday at $53.50, up $2.375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say they expect few surprises in the earnings report.
``Their business is very strong, and I expect a continuation of
that,'' said Marc Davis at investment bank B.C. Ziegler and Co.
``I'm not looking for anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he rates MiniMed shares a ``buy,'' B.C. Ziegler's
highest rating for a stock.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price got a boost last quarter when an
advisory panel for the FDA said it would recommend approval of a
new MiniMed blood sugar sensor that can be worn by diabetics for up
to three days at a time. Diabetics must now prick their fingers
several times a day to draw blood for testing, a process MiniMed
hopes to make redundant with its sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kotler, an analyst at ING Barings, said the sensor has the
potential for major revenue growth for MiniMed if it is approved by
the full FDA. But even the pump market has not been fully tapped,
Kotler believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. markets are underpenetrated,'' he said. ``Only 7 percent
of Type 1 diabetics now use a pump, and there are 900,000
(potential customers) out there.''
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed is expected to report earnings after the close of U.S.
markets.

U.S. URGES NEW RULES TO GUARD PRIVACY OF CHILDREN ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government proposed new rules Tuesday
to protect the privacy interests of children on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, prepared by the Federal Trade Commission, would
require commercial Web sites to obtain parental consent before
seeking information from children under 13. They would also require
the sites to post notifications about what they do with any
information they obtain from children.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes after a new law expanding the agency's
authority on privacy issues. That legislation moved through
Congress quickly last fall after studies by the government and
experts showed that the vast majority of Web sites collect personal
information from consumers and children, and that very few
companies provide notice about what they do with such information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are a particularly vulnerable audience,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC. ``You mix the invasions of privacy
with kids and you have a particularly combustible mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites that ask children to provide personal information
about themselves and their families have proliferated in recent
years. Sometimes the sites offer prizes in exchange for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Children who want to win a Nintendo Game Boy from the Blue Bunny
ice cream trucks can register at Bombpop.com by supplying their
name, address, age, e-mail address and favorite kind of ice cream.
The Web site does not say what it does with the information.
</P>
<P>
   At another site, run by the Liberty Fund, a large asset manager
in Boston, children are asked questions about their family's
finances, including whether their parents use mutual funds or
brokers, whether the children have received bonds or stocks as
gifts, and what the family does with its money. The site,
www.younginvestor.com, says that the surveys are ``completely
anonymous'' but that the Web site also uses cookies _ information
that Web sites record on a computer's hard drive to track the
user's comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the FTC last June concluded that 89 percent of
children's sites surveyed collected personal information from
children and that few of the sites tried to provide for meaningful
parental involvement in the process. The study found that only 23
percent of the sites even tell children to seek parental permission
before providing personal information, 7 percent say they will
notify parents of their information practices, and less than 10
percent provide for parental control over either the collection or
use of the information gleaned from their children.
</P>
<P>
   After that study, Congress passed a law last October proposed by
the FTC that gave the agency wide authority to adopt new rules that
would protect the privacy interests of children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the proposed rules are approved this year by
the commission's four members, compliance would provide a ``safe
harbor'' from government lawsuits for improper trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal applies to any commercial Web sites directed to, or
that knowingly collect information from, children under 13 years of
age. It would require companies to obtain ``verifiable parental
consent'' through various means. Web sites can provide a consent
form that would be signed by the parents and returned by postal
mail or facsimile, take credit card numbers from parents, offer a
toll-free number that parents could call, or accept e-mail
accompanied by a unique ``digital signature'' that demonstrates
that the e-mail was not sent by the child.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts have warned that standard e-mail is not
sufficient because children can easily send what appears to be
their parents' consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the proposal looks pretty good,'' said Katharina
Kopp, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Media Education, a
Washington research and advocacy group that has pushed for the
rules. ``But the FTC could have given stricter guidance that
e-mail, by itself, does not work to provide verifiable parental
consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists, however, have argued in favor of a wide
latitude in developing mechanisms to get parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there should be broad flexibility,'' said Jerry
Cerasale, a leading lobbyist for the Direct Marketing Association,
which represents 4,600 companies that use the Internet, telephones
and mail to sell their products.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy experts said the rules would be hollow without a
vigorous enforcement program in which the FTC would audit a sample
of companies to assure that they are getting adequate consent and
following their own privacy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important piece of this policy will be whether the
FTC verifies what the companies are actually doing,'' said Jason
Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., which promotes consumer
protection on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky suggested that the agency would be vigorous in
enforcing any rules that are ultimately adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's a monitoring mechanism to see what people do
when they say they are abiding by the rules, the rules are an empty
gesture,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: PAYING FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, April 21: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo ought not to be the occasion for budget
gamesmanship in Congress. Unhappily, some Republicans are trying to
manipulate an emergency spending bill for the war to inflate the
Pentagon budget and to lay the groundwork for cuts in domestic
programs. Both schemes should be soundly rejected by the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress for $6 billion to help pay
for the war and the cost of caring for the hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians driven from their homeland by marauding Serbian
troops. It is a reasonable request and should be promptly approved.
Several Republican lawmakers, however, want to load up the measure
with unrelated military items, like increases in military pay and
retirement benefits, to circumvent the budget ceilings that apply
to defense spending. These sneaky tactics demean the budget process
and trivialize the Balkan emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts in Congress are right to scrutinize the
administration's request and raise appropriate questions about
plans for prosecuting the war. But the emergency funding must not
be turned into a vehicle for extraneous spending that should be
debated as part of the overall defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say the emergency request cannot be separated
from what they view as an overall decline in military readiness
under President Clinton. That is not so. What the Pentagon needs
now is money to pay for the aircraft, missiles, munitions and fuel
required to sustain the air war over Serbia. Broader questions
about the state of the armed forces can be considered later in the
year. As Sen. John McCain and others have pointed out, some of
spending pushed by members in both parties is being driven more by
pork-barrel projects than by a desire to upgrade the military.
</P>
<P>
   Money for Kosovo need not force cuts in other programs, another
idea being floated by some Republicans. The Congressional Budget
Office is projecting a surplus of $111 billion this year alone. But
the Republicans have created a budget trap for themselves by
enacting a budget blueprint for the next fiscal year that calls for
a tax cut of nearly $800 billion over the next 10 years, and a
spike in military spending. Because of previously established
ceilings, these steps cannot be taken without deep cuts in
appropriations for health, education and the environment. Not even
the Republicans think such cuts will be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans may think it is clever to get around this trap
by pushing as much of the spending as they can into ``emergency''
bills that, by law, do not have to comply with the ceilings. That
is a backdoor route to fiscal irresponsibility. Instead, both
parties and the White House should admit the obvious and revise the
budget ceilings. At a time of extraordinary prosperity and budget
surpluses of hundreds of billions of dollars in the future, there
is enough money to meet the spending needs of the country and also
pay for legitimate emergencies like the Kosovo crisis.

EDITORIAL: THE MET'S GREEK GALLERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, April 21: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important traditions in Western culture is the
act of restating the centrality of ancient Greek civilization. The
images and artistic forms of ancient Greece exude an air of
familiarity, which reaffirms our sense of cultural ancestry. But
that familiarity is deceptive. What we know about the people
depicted in red-figure and black-figure paintings on ancient Greek
kraters and amphorae obscures what we do not know about those
vessels and the people who used them. The same is true of the
funerary sculpture, the marble grave steles that do so much to
reinforce our sense of the primacy of the human figure.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the Greek Galleries at New York City's
Metropolitan Museum of Art has the effect, quite literally, of
letting new daylight in upon the Met's collection of Greek
antiquities. The artifacts themselves have been cleaned and
beautifully reordered, and if the light that pours in through the
skylights, for the first time in more than 50 years, isn't actually
Mediterranean, it is revealing enough to let us see the
Mediterranean light that seems latent in the esthetic clarity of
these objects.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this restoration exceptional is that it represents a
rediscovery of the Metropolitan Museum's original purpose, in
architecture and in content. The Met's Greek Galleries join Grand
Central Terminal and the Reading Room of the New York Public
Library as masterpieces in the archeology of a living city,
reinventions of a humanistic, democratic design for urban
existence.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of Grand Central and the Library's Reading Room
reawakens us to what might be called the capacious hopefulness of
the city that first built them. The same is true of the Greek
Galleries. The space these galleries define is exalted. In a new
light, the viewer turns to the artifacts on display and sees not
only their familiarity, restated here once again, but also their
profound and welcome strangeness. &QL;

RUSSIANS CLING TO DEADLINE TO ACCEPT THEIR BOND TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ignoring the protests of several international banks,
Russia held foreign investors to a Tuesday deadline for agreeing to
a plan that restructures $40 billion in defaulted government debt
at a fraction of its face value.
</P>
<P>
   Represented by 19 major lenders such as Credit Suisse First
Boston, Deutsche Bank and Chase Manhattan, foreign investors hold
about $17 billion of that debt, which is in ruble-denominated
Russian treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's default last August and a sharp devaluation of the
ruble has made the debt practically worthless on bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government's restructuring plan, foreigners would get
a package of new Russian securities and anywhere from 3 cents to 8
cents on the dollar, brokerage analysts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A first deputy finance minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, who has been
meeting with international bankers in London, said about 40 percent
of foreign holders of the debt had agreed to the terms. But over
the last few weeks, a group of investors led by Credit Suisse First
Boston and Nomura Capital Management has demanded that the
government revise the agreement, which it criticized for a lack of
clarity and limited investment options.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry said Tuesday that Russia would not do so.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston and its clients account for about 40
percent of the $17 billion held by foreigners, making that
institution particularly wary of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan is nominally voluntary, it was unclear what
would happen to the holdings of investors who rejected the terms.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute further tarnishes Russia's image among foreign
investors, as the government struggles to repay billions in debt it
accrued over the last several years to keep its economy
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question this agreement brings up is about Russia's
continued access to international capital markets,'' said Eric
Kraus, head of fixed-income trading at the Moscow office of
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ``The Russians haven't come anywhere
close to keeping their word.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the debt problems were worsening, Kasyanov
also said Tuesday that Russia would default on $1.6 billion worth
of Finance Ministry bonds that mature next month. The repayment of
these bonds, issued after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,
has been in doubt since the financial crisis erupted last August.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's mounting debt troubles come just as it is negotiating
with the International Monetary Fund to refinance $4.8 billion in
other loans due this year.
</P>
<P>
   The final list of investors accepting the restructuring
agreement on defaulted treasury debt is expected to be established
by late Thursday. Banks seeking continued good relations with the
government saw no realistic alternative to agreement, although
Credit Suisse said it was still trying to discuss the restructuring
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between accepting the agreement and
endorsing it,'' said Andrew Ipkendanz, a managing director of the
bank in London. ``Clients are going to the agreement because they
have no choice.''

 &HT;    Partial birth abortion foes will introduce legislation banning
procedure
 &HT;    By Joann Rouse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ During a news conference in Cincinnati on
Tuesday, the Ohio, Dayton and Warren County Right to Life
organizations announced that U.S. Senator Mike DeWine
(R-Cincinnati) plans to reintroduce national legislation banning
so-called partial birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has overturned similar legislation twice in
the past three years. On Sept. 18, 1998, the U.S. Senate fell three
votes short of overriding the veto, but senate majority leader
Trent Lott pledged to keep fighting for it.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the presentation, medical technician Shelly Lowe
recounted the story of ``Baby Hope'' born prematurely April 7 at
the Bethesda North Hospital in Cincinnati at 22 weeks. The day
before she was born, a doctor at the Women's Med Center in Dayton
had begun a three-step abortion procedure that would have
terminated the pregnancy April 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say its just a bunch of cells,'' said a teary-eyed Lowe
as she held up a tiny doll. ``But this is a baby, a small baby, but
she would have lived. My life will never be the same after what I
went through in that medical room.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending physicians judged the infant's lung development
insufficient to permit sustained respiration. The baby was healthy
otherwise, said Dayton Right to Life Society spokeswoman Peggy
Lehner.
</P>
<P>
   The death was ruled natural and no autopsy was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The partial birth abortion - or dilation and extraction
procedure - is used after the 20th week of pregnancy and involves
two days of dilating the woman's cervix and on the third day,
delivering the baby feet-first until only the head remains inside
the mother, said Dr. William Stalter, president-elect of the
Montgomery County Medical Society and past Chief of Staff at Miami
Valley Hospital in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor then inserts a suction tube in the back of the baby's
neck that removes the brain, causing the head to collapse, Stalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Dr. William Haskell of the Women's Med Center in
Dayton credited himself with developing the procedure used on
``Baby Hope.'' The classic dilation and extraction procedure used
previously involved dismembering the fetus inside the uterus with
instruments and removing the pieces through an adequately dilated
cervix, Haskell wrote in a presentation dated Sept. 13-14, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell did not return phone calls Tuesday, but Women's Med
Center vice-president Valerie Haskell, who is Martin Haskell's
wife, issued a news release condemning the right-to-life press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of women miscarry during the second trimester in the
United States each week,'' the release stated. ``It is unfortunate
that Right to Life has chosen to exploit an individual patient's
most personal circumstance for the sake of a publicity stunt to
promote their latest round of anti-choice legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The release further described the news conference as the Right
to Life group's attempt to manipulate the public.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Woodward-Ginther, executive director of National Abortion
and Reproduction Rights and Legislation also denounced the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad attempt to further their own political
agendas,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: NEW ZONING IN NYC LEAVES ROOM FOR SKYLINE OF FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Rose wants to make this city safe for
architecture once again.
</P>
<P>
   That is one clear point that emerged in a wide-ranging speech on
the reform of zoning policy that Rose, the Giuliani
administration's Planning Commission chairman, delivered Tuesday at
City Hall. Speaking to an audience that included planners, urban
designers and community activists, Rose declared, ``We are not
Colonial Williamsburg, and the world's greatest and most dynamic
city should be a hospitable environment for bold new structures.''
</P>
<P>
   But how is this estimable goal to be attained? Not everyone will
be pleased with the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Rose hopes to discourage remakes of past mistakes by
restricting the height of buildings outside of the midtown and
downtown business districts. At the same time, he wants to
encourage excellence by exempting some buildings from those same
limits on height.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public process should be able to grant waivers from some
regulations on the basis of exceptional design,'' he stated. ``To
that end, I am convening an advisory body to help us figure out how
we can prudently introduce such values into our zoning.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city as economically dependent on real estate development
as New York, Rose's call for height restrictions may be the
splashiest of his proposals. In a sense, it may also be the easiest
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   For the city's architectural community, however, his most
significant goal was that city government recognize that it has a
legitimat role to play in raising the standards of architectural
quality in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the stringent laws on landmark preservation now in
place, Rose said, ``If we can bend over backward on behalf of great
old buildings, I am confident we can figure out how to do so for
great new ones, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the really hard part. Rose's plan is a welcome
opportunity. But given the slim chance of a sudden civic rage for
innovative design, can New York seize it?
</P>
<P>
   For it is not a simple matter for any government agency to
venture into the murky and subjective realm of esthetic evaluation.
Rose can anticipate challenges to this initiative from the City
Council, whose approval is required, and, most likely, from the
legal system, in which the debate over landmarks legislation was
fought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. He surely will arouse
the ire of community boards that have enjoyed considerable power
over the design of new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, Rose can expect opposition from residents who will
undoubtedly question his willingness to override the new zoning
regulations on the basis of outstanding design. Who will make the
determination that a design is outstanding? What values will be
represented by the advisory panel Rose proposes to create? How can
this group gain the trust and respect of communities affected by
its decisions?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to proposing an advisory panel on architectural
design, Rose declared his intention to abolish the urban planning
model that has governed high-rise development since the adoption in
1961 of the Zoning Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1961 zoning imposed an esthetic regime of a tower in the
park, which has proven to be a fundamentally flawed, anti-urban,
and anti-New York concept,'' he said. ``We are going to drive a
stake through the heart of tower-in-the-park zoning and its trail
of exceptions, caveats, and interpretive gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the revised zoning would limit the transfer of air
rights and permission to build ``bonus'' floors in exchange for the
creation of public plazas. Instead, the Department of City Planning
will propose a unified set of bulk regulations for middle- to
high-density development.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is not proposing a new architectural esthetic. Rather, he
seeks to liquidate two old ones that have persisted past their
prime.
</P>
<P>
   The first, the tower-in-the-park concept, originated in the
1920s with French architect Le Corbusier. At the time, it was a
visionary idea for introducing light and open space into congested
urban areas, and for preparing the city to cope with the age of the
automobile. The concept was taken up after World War II by
idealistic American architects, with results that often fell far
short of the ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The taste for historical pastiche began in the 1960s in a
similarly idealistic spirit. It represented a reaction against the
sterility of streets like Avenue of the Americas after they became
lined with relatively uniform glass towers in the modernist mode.
It was not until the 1980s that this esthetic began to harden into
a retrograde and profoundly suburban approach to architecture and
urban design. Then, we began to see these tragic remakes of cast
iron lampposts, these ersatz 1920s facades pasted over contemporary
residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The post-modern movement has become an esthetic tyranny: a fear
of change. As a result, New York has been deprived of projects like
the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, the new Jewish Museum in
Berlin, and the Congrexpo conventional hall in Lille, France. These
buildings have helped their cities face the future with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   From an architecture critic's perspective, the big picture is
this: Rose is chief planner of a city where architecture in recent
years has become a world-class joke. He spoke for many when he
urged, ``Instead of cloaking ourselves only in the architectural
garb of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we must be able to add
to our built environment the best of the early 21st century as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if this sentiment is widespread, it has not yet attained
the political and social clout that the preservation movement
eventually acquired. Many people feel comfortable with buildings
that recall the past, not only because of their reassuring
familiarity, but because they give communities a sense of control
over their surroundings. Others recoil from the new as if it were a
form of esthetic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   New York's civic groups and cultural institutions have done
little to whet the public's appetite for architectural innovation.
For example, the Municipal Art Society, a group that should have
been keeping the city on its architectural toes, has instead
contributed to the city's creative torpor. While the city's
architecture schools, like those at Columbia University and Cooper
Union, have fostered creativity among their students, the schools
have shown little initiative in transmitting this spirit outside
the classroom, even when it comes to the design of new buildings on
their own campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups, and others, may be alarmed by Rose's linkage
between quality and quantity. They are right to be on guard. No one
wants to see design used as a rationale for overdevelopment,
particularly in a town that has lost its architectural bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Donald Trump's design for a 900-foot skyscraper just
north of the United Nations demonstrates, loopholes in the existing
regulations already allow developers to pile on bulk. Quantity with
quality is a better deal than quantity without.
</P>
<P>
   Rose has yet to spell out the steps he will take to implement
the concept of a design advisory board, or the other proposals
outlined in his speech. It's going to be a bumpy ride, but this
idea deserves a chance to succeed, and even to fail. It will not be
easy to convince people that, even in the subjective realm of
taste, it is possible to sort out good ideas from bad ones, or to
persuade them that, even when a public agency makes an esthetic
fumble, the effort to discriminate is itself worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   As Alfred North Whitehead put it, ``It is the business of the
future to be dangerous.'' Buildings that reflect cultural change
can be shocking, but providing such shocks, and provoking public
debate over their value, are tasks a vital city should perform.

HILLARY CLINTON CHECKS OUT SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton made a campaign-style trip
Tuesday into the heart of the Long Island suburbs that would be
crucial to winning a race for U.S. Senate, then came back into
Manhattan for two more events to finish off a 13-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   But in a total of six appearances before such Democratic
constituencies as teachers, lawyers, women, Jews, members of
minority groups and patrons of the arts, Mrs. Clinton made no
teasing references to her potential Senate race, as she has in the
past, and stayed within the bounds of First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this first lady's business is sometimes hard to
distinguish from a candidate's stump speech. In an address at
Hofstra University in Hempstead, Mrs. Clinton first mentioned her
failure on pushing Congress to enact sweeping national health care
reform _ ``Clearly that approach did not work, and we're not going
to try that again, rest assured'' _ then described herself as a new
incrementalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from the school of smaller steps now,'' she said,
adding that 3.1 million New Yorkers have no health insurance and
that 1,500 children in New York may lose their insurance as they
get older.
</P>
<P>
   One notable moment of the day came at a lunch for the Long
Island Women's Agenda at the Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury,
where Mrs. Clinton sat on the dais next to Libby Pataki, the wife
of Gov. George Pataki. The Republican governor has a quarrelsome
relationship with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, a
potential opponent of Mrs. Clinton in a Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The two women chatted cheerfully and praised each other in their
speeches; Mrs. Pataki called herself ``the warm-up act'' for Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton started her day at the Village Elementary School in
Syosset, where she spoke about the need for more teachers and
after-school programs. ``She did not seem to be playing to a
broader audience,'' said Jeffrey Rozran, the president of the
Syosset Teachers' Association. ``She was playing to this audience,
and I'm grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon at the New York University School of Law, Mrs.
Clinton presented awards to Archishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa
and Dr. Alexander Boraine, a professor in the school's global law
program. In one of the only public references Tuesday to her
possible campaign, Boraine told the first lady to cheers from the
law students that ``who knows, we may see more of you in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Mrs. Clinton attended fund-raisers for the
United Jewish Appeal and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

GOP FEARS GIULIANI-PATAKI FEUD COULD COST U.S. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tensions between New York Gov. George Pataki
and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are causing growing
concern among Republican officials on Capitol Hill, many of whom
want Giuliani to run for the U.S. Senate next year and are worried
that the feud will hurt the party's chances of winning the seat,
particularly if Hillary Rodham Clinton is the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's main rival for the Republican nomination is Rep. Rick
Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican who has been aggressively
courting Pataki. Neither man has formally announced his candidacy,
but many New York Republicans say Pataki's allies have been quietly
helping Lazio build support. Aides to Pataki deny those assertions.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, a large number of Republican officials and
fund-raisers view Giuliani as the party's strongest candidate.
Those Republicans have been puzzled that Pataki, the state's most
powerful Republican, has not joined Giuliani's bandwagon, and they
are angered by reports that Pataki's supporters have been trying to
undermine the mayor, particularly upstate, where Pataki's support
is strongest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans in Washington figure that Rudy would be by far the
strongest candidate,'' said a New York Republican congressman York
who is close to Pataki. ``They want to coalesce around him early.
So there is frustration. They think the state is not helping.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Republican lobbyist in Washington who has spoken to
both the mayor and governor in recent days said: ``The whole thing
is baffling. Everybody agrees Giuliani is a sure thing. It's good
for the party. Every national figure agrees it is the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest show of Washington support for Giuliani, the mayor
is scheduled to appear at a news conference Wednesday on Capitol
Hill with several Republican senators. After that, he will speak
before a group of major contributors to the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, which raises money for Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Though the senatorial committee is not allowed to take sides in
a Republican primary, the speech is widely viewed among Republicans
as giving an important lift to Giuliani's candidacy by giving him
the chance to meet major Republican donors from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the senatorial
committee, has not endorsed Giuliani, he has made very clear that
he considers the mayor the best possible Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's supporters have expressed dismay that McConnell has been
so supportive of the mayor. But they assert that while Giuliani may
have stronger support in Washington, Lazio is gaining momentum
among Republican leaders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I checked, they don't have votes in New York,''
said a Republican official close to Lazio, referring to Washington
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican official added that allies of Pataki have been
helpful in directing Lazio to upstate Republican leaders who remain
angry with Giuliani for endorsing Gov. Mario Cuomo in his 1994
campaign against Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get in the door because they hate Rudy,'' the official
said. ``But we stay in the room because they like Rick Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio himself has not been shy about promoting himself in
Washington as a close ally of Pataki. Last week, Lazio glowingly
introduced Pataki when the governor testified on tax cuts before
the House Committee on government Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who are close to Pataki say the governor has
encouraged Lazio to work at building support upstate so that the
party will have a viable candidate if Giuliani decides not to run.
Pataki spoke with Giuliani on Tuesday, but aides to both men
declined to say what they discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans say Pataki's allies have gone further than
that, asking local leaders to withhold support from Giuliani. And
Republican fund-raisers say that some Republican contributors in
New York are unwilling to give money to Giuliani as long as he is
fighting with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in New York is hanging in limbo waiting,'' said a
Washington Republican with strong ties to the New York Republican
Party. ``At some point, there has to be a brokered peace.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A steep weeklong selloff in pharmaceutical stocks
halted Tuesday, after three large drug makers reported
first-quarter earnings gains and Merck &AMP; Co. received a
recommendation from a government panel that its new drug for
arthritis and acute pain be approved.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter net income at the Schering-Plough Corp. rose 20
percent, to $539 million, or 36 cents a diluted share, meeting
analysts' expectations. SmithKline Beecham PLC's first-quarter
profit increased 14 percent, to $540 million, or 48.9 cents an
American depository receipt, which surpassed expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But what surprised analysts was Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
first-quarter gain of $1.13 billion, or 82 cents a diluted share, 2
cents above consensus estimates and a 12.3 percent gain from the
comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, which also reported Tuesday, said its
earnings rose less than 1 percent, to $654.9 million, or 49 cents a
diluted share, in line with analysts' projections.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings news lifted all four stocks as well as the shares
of many of their competitors. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose $6 a share, to
$96.25. SmithKline Beecham's ADR's increased $3.9375, to $66.6875.
American Home Products increased $2.5625 a share, to $62.3125. And
after plunging 20.4 percent in the last week, Schering-Plough's
shares closed up 3.9 percent, or $1.875, at $50.375.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Lilly and Pfizer unexpectedly missed the mark last week
with their earnings announcements, investors were reassured that
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and the others all made their expectations,''
said Viren Mehta, a partner with Mehta Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every major United States drug maker participated in
Tuesday's rally. Shares of Merck, lifted by the recommendation from
an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration that
Vioxx, its arthritis drug, be approved, rose 2.8 percent, or
$2.125, to $75.25.
</P>
<P>
   But what was especially noteworthy was Pfizer's volatile
performance. After being the industry darling for most of last
year, Pfizer was dumped by investors last week when the company
announced that its second-quarter earnings gains might be less than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's shares had fallen 21.4 percent since then and appeared
to be rebounding strongly Tuesday, up as much as $4.1875 in
afternoon trading, when investors sold again. The stock closed at
$118.75 a share, up a mere 81.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company should have earnings gains of 25 percent during
the second half of this year,'' said David Saks, a managing
director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``Investors also don't realize that
Pfizer recorded strong sales from Viagra last year in the second
quarter. If you hit that many home runs in one inning, of course
you're aren't going to beat it by a huge percentage.''

   LOS ANGELES: called it home.
</P>
<P>
   But he pointed to the family atmosphere that existed when the
Rams played in the facility as well as the current major tenant,
the University of Southern California football team.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he feels personally committed to seeing a
successful franchise placed in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view and the National Football League point
of view, we have an obligation to rekindle the interest in
professional football for our fans here,'' Richardson said. ``But
we have to recognize what has happened here. Facts are facts. We've
had two teams play here and leave. We cannot allow that to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue addressed another concern that whoever seeks to become
the owner of a team would be involved in a bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee did not make a final recommendation, he
said he would urge the owners to set a specific price for the cost
of a franchise, considering there will be a $300 million cost in
building a stadium and a slightly smaller amount needed to start up
a team.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the franchise fee in the $500 million to $600
million range.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also dismissed potential problems over Roski's
exclusive agreement with the Coliseum to bring a professional
football team to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he believes it would be resolved on its own by
the time a team is awarded to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL long has wanted to return to Los Angeles because of its
size as well as being the second-largest media market in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it has resented the city's attitude over
refusing to provide additional tax money and backing of the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league is looking at its ``public-private
partnership'' in different ways and looks at the Coliseum proposal
as including the infrastructure around it.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has said he would not support the use of any existing
taxes to finance the effort but would consider new taxes _ such as
a ticket surcharge _ to go toward the proposal.

NFL CHOOSES COLISEUM FOR EXPANSION TEAM'S HOME; NOW WHO WILL PAY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five years after vowing never to return to the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the National Football League announced
Tuesday that the historic stadium is the preferred site for a 32nd
team.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the league left open who will be the new
owners among two competing local groups and the final price tag,
although it was estimated at $1 billion, including the costs of
remodeling the stadium. Key elements include developing 20,000
on-site parking spaces and creating a public-private financing
partnership acceptable to the league.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, standing in front of the
landmark peristyle end of the stadium and under the 1984 Olympic
torch, made the announcement following a morning of meetings with
the 11-member NFL owners committee and two prospective ownership
groups along with city and county officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culmination of five years of discussions,''
Tagliabue said. ``The (expansion) committee was given a mandate to
select a site for a 32nd team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, the committee selected the Los Angeles Coliseum
as the site that offers the best opportunity for the National
Football League ... to create a state-of-the-art stadium that will
benefit the fans, the league and the city for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL voted 29-2 last month to award the expansion team to the
Los Angeles area, the nation's second-biggest TV market, over
Houston and allowed six months to reach an agreement that could
bring football back in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It was a distinct victory for the team that has been pushing for
the Coliseum _ headed by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, in whose
district the facility is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the Coliseum and a great day for Los
Angeles,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Ed Roski Jr., who spent more than $3 million in
developing his proposal, said it was a day he was not sure he would
ever see.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a big challenge,'' Roski said. ``It's hard to
believe after three years that we're finally here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Ridley-Thomas who generated the political support, from
Mayor Richard Riordan on down, as well as convincing Roski, owner
of the Los Angeles Kings, to get involved more than three years
ago. Billionaire Eli Broad joined his effort as a partner earlier
this year to provide the financial muscle to back the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's announcement said he was giving the Roski-Broad team
and another headed by Hollywood super agent Mike Ovitz and food
magnate Ron Burkle time to develop a business and site development
plan for the Exposition Park area. Those plans are due in May for
the owners' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Until this month, Ovitz had been pushing the NFL to select the
city of Carson for a new football stadium that would be combined
with a mall. Ovitz dropped that when it became apparent the
Coliseum would be the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier about this,'' Ovitz said. ``It means
football can return to Los Angeles, and that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said he will proceed with his own plans, adding he has no
interest at this time in joining with the Roski-Broad team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I'm at a disadvantage,'' Ovitz said as a result
of his efforts for a Spanish-style stadium dubbed the Hacienda.
``Four and a half years ago I developed some plans for the Coliseum
to have a new stadium and a new sports arena. I was told then there
was no way they would return to the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear in remarks made by NFL officials that they
would like to see Ovitz join the Roski-Broad team and come up with
a unified approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many owners who want Michael Ovitz involved,'' said
Jerry Richardson, owner of the Carolina Panthers and chairman of
the expansion committee that met over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be hard enough to get 24 votes (from owners to
approve an expansion team for Los Angeles). We would like to see
these people work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also offered high praise for Ovitz, calling him a
``visionary,'' adding that Los Angeles and the Coliseum _ a
facility abandoned by both the Rams and Raiders _ would not have
been in the running if it wasn't for the efforts of Ovitz, Roski,
Broad and Ridley-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Broad and Roski said they welcomed the idea of Ovitz joining
their effort, but would be proceeding with their own plans.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he understood the past reluctance of owners about
the Coliseum because of their experiences with crime and rowdy fans
when the Raiders called it home.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Nine games. That's all that's left in the Rockets' 1999 NBA
regular-season schedule. Nine games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's all the time the Rockets have to tweak the offense,
fine-tune the defense and get everyone on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   These final nine games will serve as a lab experiment of sorts,
in which the Rockets attempt to capture their playoff chemistry in
a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   That process starts tonight against the Dallas Mavericks. The
Mavs drag a 14-27 record into Compaq Center, but Hakeem Olajuwon
isn't about to overlook the team that picked up two of those wins
last week by knocking off San Antonio and Minnesota and beat
Phoenix on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot take anything for granted,'' Olajuwon said. ``Every
game is so big by now.''
</P>
<P>
   A win tonight would clinch a playoff berth for the Rockets, but
that was almost a foregone conclusion for a team that features
Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have their sights set higher, and overtaking the San
Antonio Spurs for the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference playoff
field would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   But with nine games before the playoffs, the Rockets have things
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Olajuwon said. ``The key is to stay focused and
just keep playing. We have nine games left now, and each one of
these games is important _ critical _ in the standings. We are
taking it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is another steppingstone in the maturity of this
team. We see Scottie getting so much more aggressive and feeling
much more comfortable out there, and then there's Charles, who is
so quick on his feet, making such nice moves to the basket and
getting key rebounds. The team is coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, ever the pragmatist, knows what he wants to accomplish
in these final nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win them,'' he said. ``I just want to win, man.
That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen is focusing on getting the team to lose the one bad habit
it has acquired this season _ blowing leads. The most recent
examples of that came in their past two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets coughed up a 23-point lead in Sunday's 86-83 loss at
San Antonio, then watched a 16-point lead shrink to four with less
than three minutes to play Monday against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   They pulled out the game, but Pippen is troubled by the Rockets'
overly generous ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see us close out games better,'' Pippen said.
``That's been the biggest disappointment for this team as a whole,
that we haven't been able to complete any games like we would like
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that we have a very dominant team. Dream can score
on anyone, (as can) Charles. When we're all rolling like that, it's
tough to defend us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not holding on to what we work hard for. We're
allowing teams to get back into games too fast and too easy,
especially (Sunday's) game. We worked for a quarter to build such a
great lead on that team, but they got back into the game within six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that we've let a lot of games slip away from us,
and these last nine games, we have to really stay focused and
realize that it's important that we try to carry this momentum into
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game is the first step in starting that momentum, even
though Barkley contends the Rockets are competing with just one
team in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing against ourselves,'' Barkley said. ``We have to
play up to our capabilities. I think we've played really well this
past week, and we have to keep building on that. I can't worry
about who we're playing against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is obviously a team that has been struggling, but we're
not playing against Dallas (tonight). We're competing against
ourselves, and I'm very happy. We've played really well this past
week.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich hopes that stays true over
these final nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every game some new problem comes up (because of) the other
team _ what they do, their strengths and how we set our defense to
that _ or if they do something on their defense,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``We worked on some things that Dallas hurt us with (on March
24) with their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at it on tape, and we worked on it. Once you get
into the season, the schedule and the opponent sort of takes care
of your work, and as you take care of that, you grow as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just moving right along. We have nine games left, six at
home and three on the road. We have to go out, take care of
business, approach each game with a businesslike focus and come out
and play with intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything is going to work out all right for us.'' &QL;

BROWSER FOES DROP ENMITY TO RUN START-UP TOGETHER

   For the last few years, Hadi Partovi has been a front-line
warrior in the ``browser war'' _ the blood feud between Microsoft
and Netscape in the market for Internet browsing software, the
focus of the government's sweeping antitrust case against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   As the lead product manager for Microsoft Corp.'s Internet
Explorer, Partovi, in a flourish of competitive zeal, once led a
group that loaded a giant script ``E'' _ for Explorer _ on a truck
and drove to Mountain View, Calif., where they plopped it on the
front lawn of Netscape Communications Corp.'s campus. When a
videotape demonstration that Microsoft presented two months ago at
its antitrust trial proved embarrassing, he was summoned overnight
to set things right. Partovi, a 26-year-old Harvard graduate,
speaks movingly of his emotional bond to Microsoft and its people.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, having just left Microsoft, he is joining a
Silicon Valley software start-up founded by a pair of his former
enemies from Netscape, Michael McCue and Angus Davis, and backed by
Jim Clark, the co-founder of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The move, uniting onetime adversaries, seems a sure sign that
the browser war is over. Microsoft and Netscape still compete in
the browser market, of course. But it is no longer seen as the
arena of excitement, corporate life-and-death rivalry and
cutting-edge innovation that lures the young, entrepreneurial
talent that keeps the frontiers of the software business moving
ahead at a dizzying pace.
</P>
<P>
   To the youthful entrepreneurs at Tellme Networks Inc., the
browser business is suddenly a backwater. They speak of it as
``mature'' _ no compliment in Silicon Valley, whose business
culture is dedicated to pursuing the technologically new and hot,
the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Browsers are an evolutionary business now,'' said Davis, a
former browser product manager at Netscape. ``What you want to do
is walk into a space and make a revolutionary change.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis speaks with the wisdom of 21 years. He joined Netscape at
18, becoming its youngest employee. For McCue, 31, Tellme Networks
is the second start-up. He joined Netscape in early 1996, when it
bought his small company, Paper Software Inc., for an estimated $20
million. At Netscape, he was vice president for technology.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a growing number of former employees who have
left Netscape, mostly to form startups. In Silicon Valley, they are
known as Netscapees, and their numbers are likely to increase now
that the purchase of Netscape by America Online Inc. is complete.
Among others, Tellme has signed up John Giannandrea, a senior
programmer at Netscape, who led efforts to put Java, an Internet
programming language of Sun Microsystems, into the Netscape
browser.
</P>
<P>
   McCue, who left Netscape in December, said that the purchase by
America Online was not really the reason he departed, but a further
prod to take the entrepreneurial path again. Just what slice of the
Internet software business Tellme is aiming at is a closely held
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that we're not going after some niche
market,'' McCue said. ``We want to use Internet technology to
revolutionize an industry again.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists and industry executives believe that Tellme
intends to use some combination of natural-language and
speech-recognition technology to give users a simpler way to find
information on the World Wide Web or retrieve it from a computer,
probably with a telephone. The industry experts base their
speculation on the name of the company, the backgrounds of its
founders and recent technology trends.
</P>
<P>
   The industry experts say the goal is to allow people to speak a
simple question or command _ such as ``What is the weather forecast
for San Francisco today?'' or ``Send me my e-mail'' _ and receive
replies by either voice or E-mail. ``Natural language technology is
at the very forefront of commercialization now,'' said Richard
Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners. ``But a lot of
companies are working on it, so if that's where Tellme is going, it
will find a lot of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the business plan, it proved alluring to Partovi. By
leaving Microsoft, he walked away from unexercised stock options
worth ``millions,'' he says. To try to keep him, Partovi says,
Steven Ballmer, the Microsoft president, offered him a corporate
staff position working directly for him _ a chance that would be
regarded as a career-boosting prize at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to Steve Ballmer was the hardest thing about
leaving,'' Partovi observed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Partovi, too, had decided to leave the big-company
environment and join a start-up. He looked at a dozen companies, he
said, but found Tellme the most promising.
</P>
<P>
   McCue knew Partovi well from the browser wars and, he said,
wanted him on his side in the new venture. Is there any residual
hard feeling from the days of bare-knuckle competition _ including
some Microsoft tactics that the Government has called illegal _
when the browser war was at its height?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly, says McCue, who looks back at the Microsoft-Netscape
confrontation as a pragmatic capitalist, not as a lawyer. ``It was
mainly a lot of heavy-duty, good clean competition,'' he said. ``We
viewed that experience as an asset in recruiting Hadi.''
</P>
<P>
   Partovi offered his own retrospective olive branch. ``There was
nothing really personal about the browser wars,'' he said.

CHARLIE WHITTINGHAM, 86, HALL OF FAME HORSE TRAINER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Whittingham, the Hall of Fame horse trainer and the dean
of racing on the West Coast for most of the last half-century, died
Tuesday in Pasadena, Calif. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham had had leukemia. An ambulance took him to the
hospital Tuesday from his home in Sierra Madre, his wife, Peggy,
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was tall and lanky and as bald as a bridle, and he strode
through the barns and winner's circles of thoroughbred racing with
other giants like Horatio Luro and Woody Stephens for parts of
seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career walking horses and cleaning stalls in
Tijuana, Mexico, when he was a teen-ager during the depths of the
Depression, and ended his career training champions 60 years later.
In between he had numerous achievements, including winning three
Eclipse Awards as the best trainer in North America and winning the
Kentucky Derby when he was 73 and again at 76, the oldest trainer
ever to do so. He trained eight national champions, won more than
2,400 other races and 650 other stakes, led all trainers in prize
money seven times, and was elected into the Racing Hall of Fame in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   He did all this with an obsession that brought him to the stable
before dawn every day and that kept him there until dark. ``I get
five hours' sleep a night,'' he once said, ``but I haven't had a
headache in 73 years.''
</P>
<P>
   His obsession did not encompass the Kentucky Derby. He refused
to join the stampede on the road to Louisville, maintaining that
too many good young horses were sacrificed to the rigors of
preparing for the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1986, he abruptly changed course and went to the Derby
for the first time in 26 years with a large, muscular, durable colt
named Ferdinand. The horse reflected all of the Whittingham
doctrine of training: Take a sound, strong colt and work him hard
and long. He put Ferdinand in the hands of the veteran champion
jockey, Bill Shoemaker, who had already ridden more than 200
Whittingham horses to stakes victories.
</P>
<P>
   After running 16th and last for a quarter of a mile, Ferdinand
began to overtake horses, passed all 15 and won by more than two
lengths. Whittingham rushed to the winner's circle to greet
Ferdinand, Shoemaker and the horse's owner, Elizabeth Keck. ``It
took me 26 years to get here because I said I wouldn't come till we
got a good horse,'' he said to her. ``We got one now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also got one three years later when he returned with Arthur
Hancock's Sunday Silence. And he made the winner's circle again
when Sunday Silence outran the Eastern star Easy Goer in the Derby,
the first of three memorable duels they staged in the Triple Crown
series. Two weeks later, in one of the classic races of modern
times, Sunday Silence clipped Easy Goer by a nose to win the
Preakness. But when they finished the series three weeks later in
the Belmont Stakes, it was Easy Goer by eight lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to feel bad,'' Whittingham said, irrepressible as
always. ``But they handed me this check for $1 million, the horse
is fine and I plan on waking up tomorrow. Anyway, we beat the other
horse two out of three. We just couldn't handle him on his home
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   For Whittingham, there was more to come both times. Ferdinand
came back to win the Breeders' Cup Classic and the title Horse of
the Year in 1987, and Sunday Silence did the same in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whittingham was born on April 13, 1913, in the town of
Chula Vista, Calif., near San Diego. When he was a child, his
father died, and he was raised by an aunt and uncle. He soon
followed his older brother Joe to the local race track as a hot
walker and stablehand.
</P>
<P>
   He took out his trainer's license in 1934, but didn't blossom
until 1940, when he met Luro, the elegant, urbane horseman from
Argentina who saddled his share of champions. The two future Hall
of Famers pooled their energies, toured the country with a few
horses and launched their successful careers. Luro died in 1991 at
the age of 90.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he had learned from Luro, Whittingham replied:
``Patience. You've got to let the horse tell you when he's ready.
Listen to anyone else, and you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He met and married Peggy Boone while in the Marines in 1944, and
she followed him around the racing circuit when he returned to
training horses after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham spent most of his career on the West Coast, where
his horses won San Juan Capistrano Stakes 14 times, the San
Bernardino 11 times, the Californian 11 times, the Sunset Handicap
11 times, the Santa Anita Handicap nine times, the Beverly Hills
nine times, the San Luis Rey nine times, the Hollywood Gold Cup
eight times and the Santa Barbara Stakes seven times.
</P>
<P>
   His national champions included Porterhouse in 1953; Ack Ack,
the 1971 Horse of the Year; Cougar II in 1972; Estrapade in 1986;
Ferdinand in 1987, and Sunday Silence in 1989. He became the career
leader in victories and purses at Santa Anita. Twenty of his horses
earned more than a million dollars apiece. He won the Eclipse Award
in 1971, 1982 and 1989. And he was elected to the Racing Hall of
Fame in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Michael, also a trainer, had taken over most of the
work of the Whittingham barn at Santa Anita in recent months.
Another son, Taylor Whittingham, died in 1974. In addition to his
wife and son, Whittingham is survived by a daughter, Charlene von
Bleucher, of Arcadia; a sister, Alice Rodich of Pomona, Calif.; 11
grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

IMF WARNS GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD SLOW THIS YEAR AND NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By PAUL LEWIS c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday that
global economic growth could slow in 1999 and perhaps into 2000,
hurt by weakness in Russia, Asia, Brazil and some regions of
Europe, notably those ravaged by the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The group's latest world economic outlook said that ``several
hurdles could prevent global growth from returning to potential
within two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The lending agency's assessment was issued at the beginning of a
weeklong meeting in Washington by officials of the IMF and the
World Bank. Its cautious tone followed the IMF's conspicuous
failure to foresee the 1997 economic crash in Southeast Asia and
its havoc on financial markets around the world, the subsequent
financial crisis in Russia and parts of Eastern Europe or the more
recent economic tremors in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten, who runs the Institute for International
Economics in Washington, said the IMF caution also reflected its
desire to fight complacency that could come in weakened economies
if they show signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund is afraid that if recovery starts, the countries of
Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe will back off from the deep
structural economic reforms the recent crises showed they must
make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF predicted a 2.3 percent global economic growth rate this
year, down from 2.5 percent in 1998 and 4.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It predicted a 3.4 percent growth rate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That projection assumed a steady improvement in the
emerging-market economies, a gradual slowing of the U.S. economy to
a more sustainable pace, resilience in Europe and an end to the
Japanese recession. But the IMF said the weakness this year in
Brazil, China and Russia, as well as the possibility that Japan's
recession could worsen, could lead to ``a distinct possibility of a
less favorable scenario developing.''
</P>
<P>
   It also said economic activity in the former communist countries
of southeastern Europe would be affected by the Kosovo crisis. &QL;

AGING N.Y. POWER PLANTS DIRTIER IN 1998, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Air pollution from 21 aging power plants across New York state
rose significantly last year, according to a report released
Tuesday by several private environmental, health, and consumer
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York state environmental officials did not dispute
the findings on these plants, they said that the state had reduced
overall power-plant pollution by half from the level in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At the plants, which use decades-old technology and burn mainly
oil or coal, there was a 21 percent rise last year in emissions of
sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain and respiratory problems,
and a 12 percent rise in releases of nitrogen oxides, which cause
acid rain and smog, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that the persistent problems at these plants, the
state's most polluting, could cause health problems for communities
downwind in New York and New England, which receives some of New
York's pollution along with that of more highly polluting plants in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The plants cited in the report are scattered across the state,
from Port Jefferson on Long Island and Astoria, Queens, to the
Hudson Valley and Niagara County. They were highlighted because
they all produce at least 100 tons more nitrogen oxides annually
than the federal standard allowed for new plants burning coal, said
Cori Traub, an author of the report and director of air and energy
projects for Environmental Advocates, a private lobbying group in
Albany. The other organizations publishing the study were the New
York Public Interest Research Group and the New York chapter of the
American Lung Association. The data were provided by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   New York state environmental officials said the state was a
national leader at cutting power-plant pollution, by focusing
efforts on newer plants, where major improvements can be made at a
low cost. Samuel Thernstrom, a spokesman for the state Department
of Environmental Conservation, said the drop in the state's total
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 1990 was due
mainly to a shift to cleaner fuels, like natural gas, and improved
pollution-capturing gear for smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   He added that by far the biggest air problem for New York still
lay to the west. In fact, he said, some individual coal-fired power
plants in the Ohio Valley produce more sulfur and nitrogen
pollution than all New York's plants and industries combined. This
pollution drifts east, damaging forests and lakes and causing
problems like asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 plants are responsible for half the total emission of the
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide by all industries in the state,
the report says.
