<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bread Price Hike Triggers Unrest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan accused
here today "misled and misleading elements that belong to outside
parties and powers" of being behind the riots that broke out
Friday in some southern towns in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In a television address this morning, the king warned that the
authorities "would strike with an iron fist" against those who
would foment unrest.
</P>
<P>
The unrest, which began with southern town of Karak, erupted
late Friday when some 2,000 demonstrators protesting against the
increase in the price of bread clashed with security forces and
burned down government buildings and private banks.
</P>
<P>
Karak residents were quoted by today's English-language daily
Jordan Times as saying that the violence began when police tried
to stop a group of 200-300 people who staged a march and shouted
slogans demanding the downfall of the government of Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti for its decision to double the
price of bread and animal fodder.
</P>
<P>
They said police used tear-gas and rubber bullets and fired
live bullets in the air to disperse the protesters, who in turn
pelted policemen with stones and set fire to several buildings and
government and private cars, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the riots spread to the cities of Ma'an,
Tafileh, Al Qaser, Al Mazar and Al Rabbeh late in the
evening after calm returned to Karak.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that a child died from asphyxiation and
13 people were wounded in the riots, but the king said in
his address that there were no casualties among the protesters
and the only minor injuries were suffered by members of the
security forces.
</P>
<P>
A number of Karak residents who took part in the clashes said
violence began after police tried to stop the demonstrators by
using tear-gas.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations escalated after that and the demonstrators
burned at least four banks and other government facilities, said
the daily.
</P>
<P>
The official Radio Jordan reported today that several arrests
have been made in the city of Karak.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Celebrates 51st Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and other senior officials and high-ranking officers along with 30
thousand people gathered at the Presidential Palace today to mark
the 51st anniversary of Indonesia's independence.
</P>
<P>
The grand ceremony opened with the firing of 17-gun salute at
10 a.m. the time in 1945 that Sukarno, Indonesia's first
president, proclaimed independence after nearly four centuries of
Dutch colonial rule and more than three years of Japanese
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Sukarno declared then: "Thanks to the blessing of god almighty
and impelled by the noble desire to lead their own free national
life, the Indonesian people hereby declare their independence."
</P>
<P>
The text of the proclamation was re-read by wahono, parliament
speaker at the front of the Presidential Palace surrounded by
military soldiers and students.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's red-and-white flag was raised by a squad of youths
to the singing of the national anthem -- Indonesia Raya (great
Indonesia).
</P>
<P>
In nearby Monas square, dominated by a 137-meter high national
monument, a towering obelisk commissioned by former president
Sukarno as a symbol of the soaring spirit of Indonesian
nationalism, several thousand people gathered to watch the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Today, Jakarta and the whole country are in a holiday mood. All
buildings and households are decorated with colorful flags,
lanterns and flowers. Various activities, such as art
performances, photo exhibitions, sports meets, have been conducted
in big cities, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Indonesians lost their lives between 1945
and 1949 in their fight to oust the Dutch, whose rule was
virtually ended by Japan's 1942-45 occupation in World War II.
</P>
<P>
"The independence celebration is aimed at reminding the people,
especially the young, to bear in mind the country's history and
the sufferings the elder generations had experienced," said Eddy
Seeding, a 66-year-old veteran.
</P>
<P>
"Thank god. We have recorded great achievements in the past 51
years, especially in the economic fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
With a per-capita income of 70 US dollars in 1969, Indonesia
was classified as one of the poorest countries in the world. 27
years later, the per-capita income has surpassed 1,000 US dollars,
an increase of 14 times. Today, Indonesia is regarded as a middle
income country.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate peaked around 650 percent in 1966. At
present, the inflation rate is maintained at an average of under 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Indonesia achieved self-sufficiency in rice, thus
ending the history of being the biggest rice importer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, 60 out of every 100 Indonesians were poor. In 1995,
this number dropped to 14.
</P>
<P>
The achievements were attributed to a series of reforms it
adopted since the late 1960s. It opened the door wider to attract
more foreign investments and readjusted the economic structure to
make it more reasonable. As a result, the contribution of the
manufacturing industry sector to the country's general domestic
product was now bigger than the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Today, Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, is
an emerging economic powerhouse and is playing an active role in
international organizations, such as the U.N., the non-aligned
movement, the APEC and the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The independence day celebrations were held smoothly in the
country with no violence reported.
</P>
<P>
In his address before the parliament Friday, President Soeharto
said "after we pause for a moment to look back at the past
journey, let us continue the long journey towards the creation of
an advanced society imbued with a just prosperity and prosperous
justice."

<P>
Clashes stopped at about 8 p.m. (17:00 GMT) Friday when police
withdrew from the streets which were blocked by rocks and burning
tyres.
</P>
<P>
The situation is calm in Karak now and the security forces are
reportedly on high alert in other southern towns of Ma'an,
Tafileh, Al Qaser, Al Mazar and Al Rabbeh.
</P>
<P>
However, city residents were quoted as saying the situation is
"very tense" in Karak, adding that it will explode again if
detainees are not released and if the police return to the city.
</P>
<P>
Residents said the riots were spontaneous, but noted that
leaflets inciting people to protest the hiking of bread prices
were distributed Thursday in Karak, whose population is well known
to be politically active and where various leftists, centrists and
Islamic parties have strong followings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the king absolved the Islamic Action Front (IAF)
from any responsibility for the riots. The IAF is the largest
opposition party in the kingdom and the vocal opponent of the
government's decision to lift subsidies on bread and animal feed,
which was announced and took effect last week.
</P>
<P>
"For clarity's sake, these elements do not belong in any
form to the Islamic Action Front in this country," said
the king.
</P>
<P>
"In fact these misled and misleading elements are the remains
of some who belong to parties operating outside Jordan in
terms of ideology and belief," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the king did not name the outside parties which he
believed should take the responsibility for the unrest.
</P>
<P>
In his address today, the king reiterated Jordan's support for
the Palestinians in their just cause.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan is the wall supporting Palestine and its people in
their pursuit to regain their rights on their national soil," the
king told the country through his televised speech.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the king indicated some Palestinian
extremist group based in neighboring Arab countries is behind the
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Upper House of Parliament Ahmad Lawzi condemned
"irresponsible acts in parts of the country" and urged for
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament Saad Hayel Srour
expressed regret over the riots in Karak and echoed Lawzi in
stressing dialogue as the best means of dealing with issues of
contention.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here told Xinhua that the unrest would
repeat and spread in the kingdom if the government did not take
immediate and effective measures.
</P>
<P>
Large scales of riots broke out in the country in 1989
when the government raised the price of fuel.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Peacekeepers to Stay in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will not recall its
troops in war-torn Liberia where it has spent four billion U.S.
Dollars leading a sub-regional effort to restore peace, the
Defence Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi stated that Nigeria
will no longer increase its troops in Liberia beyond the
present strength.
</P>
<P>
There are some 12,000 soldiers from five west African
countries in Liberia on peacekeeping mission, and the number of
Nigerian troops is about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian defence spokesman Fred Chijuka said the mission
in Liberia is justifiable because full-scale war among Liberian
factional warlords has been avoided.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria announced its stand on the peace mission in Liberia at
the time when the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG was
requiring 18,000 troops for reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia are
scheduled to hold a summit today to probe ways to restore
peace in Liberia.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad held talks here today with his visiting Turkish
counterpart Necmettin Erbakan on bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions centered on efforts to further enhance
bilateral cooperation especially in the economic field, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Mahathir and Erbakan agreed to set 1.5 billion US
dollars as the target for the trade volume between the two
countries, which was about 80 million US dollars during the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders identified fields in which to further upgrade
cooperation between the two countries, such as construction,
defense, electronics and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister, who arrived here Friday for a
three-day visit, is seeking Malaysia's support for his country's
application to attend the Asia-Europe Summit (ASEM), Abdullah
said.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM was held in Bangkok in March this year. ASEM
brings together the leaders of 15 countries of the European Union
and Asian countries including the seven members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Mahathir agreed that Malaysia will convey
Turkey's wish to the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Erbakan also agreed that ASEAN should establish
ties with the Economic Cooperation comprising the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia requested Turkish's assistance to enable it to play an
active role in the development of the Balkan states and the CIS
countries and hoped that the private sector could establish joint
ventures in those areas especially in the construction sector,
Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the existing political
cooperation between the two countries including their
participation in the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) and
in Bosnia Herzegovina.

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish pro-Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
said that his coalition government was planning to raise 40
billion U.S. dollars from privatizations over the next five years,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said Friday when visiting Singapore that "the
privatization law of 1994 is one of the most important tools for
foreign capital investments to arrive in Turkey. Forty billion
dollars are targeted from privatizations in the next five years."
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The German-Arab Chamber of Commerce will organize in
September a conference in the German city of Berlin to draw 200
German companies wishing to take part in the Cairo Economic Summit
Conference in November.
</P>
<P>
Peter Geofrisch, managing Director of the Chamber, said that
the conference aimed to clarify the atmosphere and opportunities
for investment in Egypt to German companies prior to the holding
of the Cairo summit, the Arabic-language newspaper Al Ahram
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference would discuss German and Egyptian

oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars
worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine for the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Suez Office for Investors Service in Egypt agreed
Friday on the allocation of necessary plots of lands for 24

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Rand Drops to New Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
Rand hit an all-time low of 4.5700 against the US Dollar in the
monetary market on early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The previous all-time record low was set on April 26, when
Rand was rated at 4.5650 against the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Rand, however, recovered three cents in later trade,
following what dealers described as aggressive intervention by
the Reserve Bank, the central bank of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African currency has lost a quarter of its value
since mid-February when one Dollar cost just 3.65 Rand.
</P>
<P>
Most dealers believe that the Rand will probably hit a fresh
record of 4.58 against the Dollar, a major technical level, in
the coming week.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the rand will fluctuate around current levels for
the next month or two, but we don't see it much lower than 4.60,"
said Johan Louw, chief economist at life insurance group Sanlam
in Cape Town.

HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Many children in Hong Kong are
suffering from astigmatism, according to experts of the Hong Kong
Chinese University.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the university reveals that about 25 percent

<HEADLINE> Increased Economic Co-operation in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, Augest 17 (Xinhua) -- Five provinces and autonomous
regions in southwest China, which are home to various minorities,
are looking for more co-operation in economic development.
</P>
<P>
The state's policy of developing the middle and western regions
of the country is seen as a historical opportunity and has
provided good conditions fro using other's advantages for a common
purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 530 projects with a total investment
of 1.39 billion yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) were arranged last
year between provinces and autonomous regions in this region.
</P>
<P>
A series of special markets have also been established, such as
for tobacco in Yunnan, for coke in Guizhou, sugar in Guangxi, and
liquor and technology in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is also an important field for the five provinces and
regions to co-operate in. According to the source, 82 new tourism
routes were jointly explored last year and all proved beneficial.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Trade Fair is one of the most important events in
the region. To open the fair to the outside world, the five
provinces and regions have given each other a hand, and at the
last fair, more than 2,500 businessmen from 16 countries did a
total of 1.52 billion U.S. dollars' worth of business.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border transport and communications construction is also
increasing. A railway linking Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi
region with Yunnan is expected to be finished next year, and a
highway linking Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, with Beihai, an
important coastal city in Guangxi is also being built.

<HEADLINE> Israel Keen To Import Indian Manpower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel has shown keen interest
in importing manpower from India for its construction industry
which is in a consistent boom phase now.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI) here Friday, visiting Director
General of the Association of Contractors and Builders in Israel
Amos Bar Am said that Israel was also keen to offer its
sophisticated technology to India.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israelis were also looking forward to Indian
businessmen coming for joint ventures in construction.
</P>
<P>
Every year 10-15 million units of hotels, houses are being
added for the last 6-7 years which had led to an unprecedented
boom in Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of labor shortage, the Israeli government would relax
very shortly its policies regarding import of labor, he said, this
would provide countries like India innumerable opportunities not
only for exporting skilled manpower but also in setting up joint
ventures in Israel which was predominately focusing on use of the
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Israel is importing labor from East European
countries and South East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
India's trade volume with Israel is estimated at 250 million US
dollars and the opening up of the Indian economy has provided
tremendous opportunities for Israeli investors in India.

LANZHOU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- People visiting Gangu County in
northwest China's Gansu Province could be quite astonished at the
sight that confronts them - Chinese rose everywhere.
</P>
<P>
When one mentions the Chinese rose, people usually think of
places that are famous for this flower, such as Laizhou in
Shandong Province, Cixi in Zhejiang, and Nanyang in Henan.
</P>
<P>
But in such a dry place as Gangu, where there is much more
yellow than green, how could it become known as the "home of the
Chinese rose"?
</P>
<P>
The county has a Chinese rose garden covering a 13 mu (about 1
hectare) area that is said to have more than 600 different types
of Chinese rose. Its flowers now sell throughout China.
</P>
<P>
The total area planted in Chinese rose in this county is now
more than 100 mu, or about 6.5 hectare.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia-U.S. Armies Hold Joint Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The nine-day joint army
exercise by Malaysia and the United States ended today, after
revealing several weaknesses of the participating teams,
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
The participating teams were unable to develop information on
land conditions, enemy organization and equipment, Malaysia's
second division commander Major General Abbas Mohd Yunos was
quoted as saying in Ipoh, over 200 kilometers north of Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, held at Syed Putera camp in Ipoh, also showed
that they did not make use of the existing intelligence network
and lacked imagination, Yunos said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the weaknesses, he said the teams could not carry out
their operations effectively and the exercise failed to achieve
the desired objectives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 693 men and officers under Malaysia's second
division command and 31 men and officers from the US army's 100
battalion took part in the exercise.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Frequent Disruptions in Hong Kong Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Frequent disruptions in the
subway have become a common concern of the passengers and the Hong
Kong Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC).
</P>
<P>
Signal failures are one of the major factors in the
disruptions of the MTRC which operates the subway in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, 68 of the 99 equipment
failures since last April are the result of faulty signal
equipment, either on the track or on the train.
</P>
<P>
Alan Cooksey, a British rail specialist invited by MTRC to
investigate the subway disruptions, said that 18 of the 68
signals failures were caused by the installation of a new signal
system.
</P>
<P>
Cooksey said the number of hold-ups lasting five minutes or
more at the subway has dropped since 1990 although there were more
 stoppages in the past seven months and more than in the same
1995 period.
</P>
<P>
But the number of passengers affected by delays of five minutes
or more has risen since 1990, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Cooksey said signal failures are more common in the summer
because the equipment are likely to be affected by the moisture
carried into the tunnel by either trains or the ventilation
system.
</P>
<P>
The MTRC is expected to develop an intercom system as an
alternative alarm system that would cause less disruption.
</P>
<P>
MTRC Experts noted that passengers are to be partly responsible
for some of the disruptions.
</P>
<P>
They said 17 disruptions in the past four months were caused by
the actions of passengers with 11 resulting in delays of 10
minutes or more and four of them affecting some 10,000 passengers
each.
</P>
<P>
Several delays were triggered by people pressing the passenger
alarm plungers. Some passengers pressed the alarm for no valid
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The 43.2-km-long Mass Transit Railway system, as part of daily
life for many people in the territory, services 38 stations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 759 rail cars make up the system, which operates 19
hours a day and carries about 2.3 million passengers every weekday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the MTRC's profits were almost 1.2 billion HK
dollars (about 154.84 million US dollars) and its total assets
were almost 43 billion HK dollars (about 5.55 billion US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Unique Development Zone in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- In the late 80s, a plan to invite
foreign developers to build the Yangpu Development Zone, in
Hainan, triggered a heated war of words nationwide, with
conservatives condemning it as a sell-out of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The central government, backed by the chief reformer, Deng
Xiaoping, shrugged this off and went boldly ahead.
</P>
<P>
After three years of intensive infrastructure construction, a
multinational group of contractors have turned the zone into an
attractive investment opportunity with unique conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Yangpu Development Zone covers 31 sq.km. and is said to be
the world's only place where a special economic zone, development
zone, bonded warehouse, residential quarter, and commercial area
are all being built from wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Overseas contractors plan to invest 18 billion HK dollars in 15
years to turn it into an export-oriented industrial, port city
with a population of 400,000, and industrial output value of 60
billion yuan. Thus far, some five billion yuan, including 3.6
billion HK dollars from the developers, has been set aside for
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The zone now has a 315,500-kw power plant, with an oil port and
power transmission network. It also has a 43 km-highway network,
pipeline, a telecommunications network with 2,200 telephone lines,
240 microwave cables, 150 mobile phone lines, and a paging station.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu now has its own schools, telecommunication and post
facilities, hospitals, commercial centers, hotels,
office-buildings, and recreation spots.
</P>
<P>
The central government has granted it municipal rights in
administration and legislation, and the country's banks and
banking institutions have opened branches in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu's sound investment environment has attracted many
domestic and overseas investors and a number of projects related
to glass-making, automobile manufacturing, and chemical and
petroleum production are being negotiated. A 500,000-ton/year
steel rolling project jointly backed by Capital Iron and Steel and
Yangpu West Iron and Steel is now under contruction.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang Shangzhou, director of the Yangpu
Development Zone Administration, 1996 is a year for
investment. The administration hopes more outside investors,
especially international giants, will open businesses in the
zone.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace Talk Or Empty Talk? (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- More and more Palestinians
have come to believe that, although Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has kept talking glibly about peace since rise
to power, in effect he means otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have followed up closely Netanyahu's words and
deeds. They observed that the Likud prime minister speaks in two
voices, and acts along two tracks. He tries to convince the
international community that the new rightwing government's quest
for peace is sincere. On the other hand, however, it works very
hard to blot out the Palestinians from its agenda. All the urgent
issues have been put on hold.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has succeeded to some extent in communicating his
views on the future of the Middle East in various capitals --
Washington, Cairo, Amman -- without upsetting his interlocutors
or causing a crisis. He succeeded simply because he had told each
of his interlocutors what the other party wished to hear --
continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
When the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council
demanded recently that the Palestinian Authority link progress in
the peace talks with Israeli implementation, they were far from
acting from a whim.
</P>
<P>
The PLC members were expressing deep concern over the present
state of Palestinian-Israeli relations. The new Israeli government
had refused to carry out the commitments made during the Labor
coalition government of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, the
signatories of the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Many of the commitments made by Israel should have been
fulfilled months ago. They were put on hold during the course of
the Israeli elections. Redeployment in Hebron, removal of the
closure, release of the Palestinian prisoners and resumption of
the final status talks -- none of these issues can wait.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of the Palestinians, regardless of
those living in the occupied territories or those in diaspora,
expressed their support for the peace agreement signed in
Washington on September 13, 1993. They cherished a profound hope
for a new era of peace unfolding in the relations between Israel
and Palestine, hailing the Oslo Accords as a turning point, one
intended to usher in a better and brighter future for the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, no one in the Palestinian street expected the
newly-found relations to go smoothly in the wake of the historic
peace agreement, but one demand needed to be unequivocally
respected, the condition -- promised by the Labor government --
that Israeli activities in the Palestinian territories would cease
during the implementation of the first part of the accords, also
known as the interim period.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Computer Still Far From Chinese Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A national survey in China has
revealed that only 1.6 percent of Chinese families own computers,
and 85.7 percent have never used one.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that younger and better-educated people
who are in a higher-income bracket are more likely to use
computers at work and for their own entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted among some 4,000 urban and rural
residents, aged 18-70, by the Yangshi Survey and Consulting
Service Center, a national survey network.
</P>
<P>
"The results showed that the popularization rate of computers
in China is still too low, even though we have entered into an
information era and computers have become a hot topic among
Chinese people," survey organizers said in their report, which was
carried in "China Youth Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The huge margin represented by non-owners indicates China is a
vast potential market for computer suppliers, the report pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"People whose monthly wage is higher than 700 yuan (about 83 US
dollars) will be potential buyers of your products," the report
said, referring to computer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
But it also warned them that the high-priced PCs in China have
prevented many people from making such a big purchase.
</P>
<P>
Only 4.1 percent of families are planning to buy computers,
while 22.8 percent of people polled said they wanted to buy one,
but could not afford it, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of the respondents bought computers as
educational tools for their children. The rest use the machines
mainly for work and entertainment, the survey found.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace Talk Or Empty Talk? (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to their expectations, Netanyahu declared, at a press
conference held exclusively Monday with Arab journalists in
Jerusalem, that there was no clause in any of the
Palestinian-Israeli accords -- those of Oslo, Taba, or of Paris --
to prevent the expansion of the Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
As if to echo Netanyahu's statement, Likud Knesset faction
head Michael Eitan said that new settlements would be created in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and many Jews would come and live
there.
</P>
<P>
It appears that Netanyahu believes that the Jewish settlements
are an essential means to delineate the borders between the
Palestinians and the Israelis. In other words, he has taken upon
himself unilaterally to decide where he wishes those borders to
be, even before the talks on the final status will have begun, and
by telling the Palestinians what the limits of their entity are to
be, he has drained the talks on the final status of their contents
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
With the Netanyahu government denying the preeminence of the
land-for-peace formula as a principle fundamental to the future
of the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, the new settlement activity
policy amounts to the potential nightmarish situation that could
destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Legislative Council insisted that urgent
actions should be taken lest the peace process, begun at the
Madrid Peace Conference in 1991, sink without trace.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat warned, in an interview with Israel
Television earlier this week, that he would turn to the two
sponsors of the peace process and the international community for
arbitration on Israel's reneging Oslo Accords. So he did.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat sent a three-page letter to U.S. President
Bill Clinton calling on the U.S. to put pressure on Israel to
honor its commitments to the peace agreement. The Palestinian
leader pointed to Israeli plans for settlement expansion and
failure to redeploy in Hebron saying, "We look to you to make
Israel comply with the peace process and its obligations ... to
achieve a lasting and just peace between the Israeli and
Palestinian peoples."
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns declared the same day
that the U.S. continues to believe that settlements are an
obstacle to the Middle East peace process. "Obviously our
position remains unchanged. We think settlements are complicating
and unhelpful to the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns made it clear that the issue should be discussed in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has shown no signs to budge in his position
regarding his favorite peace-with-security formula. The government
has also announced to resume negotiations with the Palestinians
at the joint committee level, which will deal with civil affairs,
but not land and withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Kids Encouraged to Help out Poor Kids of Red Army Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen teenagers whose
grandparents fought in south China's Jiangxi Province 70 years ago
under the late chairman Mao Zedong, paid respects today to Mao's
remains at his memorial in Tiananmen Square here today.
</P>
<P>
The grandchildren of the Red Army veterans are among 300
schoolchildren in Jiangxi who are receiving financial assistance
for their educations from students at the privately-owned Beijing
Limai School.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangxi students, who were close to dropping out because
they could not afford their schooling, came to Beijing at the
invitation of the school and the Chinese Communist Youth League
Commission of Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dingdong, vice principal of the expensive Beijing school,
said that her 300 primary school students will join hands with the
300 Jiangxi youngsters to become partners in life and schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to create conditions that will allow children
from the old revolutionary base to have the same opportunities as
the city kids, and to provide an environment that will help them
to develop," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 Beijing teenagers who escorted the Jiangxi students
today promised to provide books, stationery and clothing to their
partners. In turn, they hope to learn thrifty habits from their
Jiangxi partners.
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Hong Chunji said, "I have bought a copy of 'How
Steel Is Tempered' by Nicholas Ostrovski for my partner. I will
often write to her and send her some pens and pencils."
</P>
<P>
An educational expert said that as many Chinese families have
only one child, that child can easily become spoiled and behave
like a "little emperor."
</P>
<P>
He praised the private school's farsightedness in arranging the
partnership with children from poor areas.
</P>
<P>
An official from the China Youth Development Foundation (CYDF)
said that more than one million children have been forced to leave
school because of poverty every year in recent years. The Hope
Project, which CYDF launched in 1989, has been successful in its
efforts to aid poor children.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, donations from all walks of life
enabled 1.25 million children to continue their schooling and led
to the construction of 2,074 primary schools in poor areas.

<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Saleh Morsi, an Egyptian writer
famous for his novels and screenplays on espionage, died of a
heart attack early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Morsi passed away at his home in the Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria at the age of 67.
</P>
<P>
He had worked as a journalist for several magazines including
weeklies Sabah al-Khier and al-Mussawar since 1956 after serving
as an assistant engineer in the Egyptian Naval Forces for eight
years, according the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
But he won his fame through his novels and screenplays,
especially those based on the lives of Egyptian spies.
</P>
<P>
He wrote "Raafat el-Haggan," one of the well-known series
screened by the Egyptian television, narrating the life of an
Egyptian agent whose spying on Israel helped Egyptian forces cross
the Suez Canal in the 1973 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Morsi is survived by his wife Wagiha Fadel, a television
director, and a son and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold First Competition for Jeans Designers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China will hold its first
national jeans design competition on Sunday, with 569 styles
presented by 59 of the country's top jeans designers.
</P>
<P>
The "Boshideng Cup," jointly sponsored by the China Garment
Association, the China National Garment Corporation and Kangbo
Group of Jiangsu Province, signals China's first step toward
establishing domestic brand-name products in the booming jeans
market.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Caiqing, vice-president of the China National Garment
Corporation, said that foreign garment brands maintained a
100-percent-odd increase in sales over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The senior-class jeans market is dominated by foreign products,
such as Apple, Puma, Jeanswest and Marlboro, and has left no room
for domestic brands, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China still has no record of jean exports, though its
garment exports make up the lion's share in global markets, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The country has more than 1,000 jeans manufacturers, centered
in Shandong, Jiangsu and other coastal provinces, but the market
share sharply declined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Lu Yihua, a member of the competition's jury, said that
only the reform of design and technology can save the flagging
industry -- not the cutthroat price war that many local
enterprises adopted as a panacea for commercial competition.
</P>
<P>
In addition to increased advertising, domestic jeans brands
should be established through "a brave innovation in design, color
mix and coating materials," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said this reform trend will be displayed in the design
entered in the competition, which represent the highest level of
processing technology and design originality in the country.
</P>
<P>
The best 59 entries in the competition will be paraded by
China's top models.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Cities Urged to Strengthen Anti-Pollution Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China has urged its heavy
industrial cities to leave no means untried in the effort to fight
pollution.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese cities, particularly industrial centers, must pay
close attention to the issue of pollution, a top environmental
protection official today told participants at a meeting to
discuss the pollution control achievements in Benxi, a steel city
in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's key energy and raw materials producers,
Benxi has more than 400 enterprises that discharge of millions of
tons of wastewater and waste gases.
</P>
<P>
Located in Liaoning Province, Benxi was once nicknamed "the
city that cannot be seen by satellite."
</P>
<P>
After a seven-year intensive effort to curb industrial
pollution, Benxi has cleaner air and water. In 27 to 28 days out
of every month, air visibility stretches for 10 kilometers, and
the quality of air and groundwater have met the standards set by
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, state councillor and chairman of the Environmental
Protection Committee of the State Council, urged all of the heavy
industrial cities to follow Benxi's lead and speed up their
efforts to curb environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection is a large-scale and complicated
undertaking, he said. As a result, every positive factor should be
brought into play to deal with environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Investment in environmental protection should be increased, and
full use of the fund should be made to secure the smooth progress
of the construction of environmental protection projects, Song
noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, Benxi has built 44 large projects
for environmental protection, with a total investment of 480
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Troops Locate Place of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian military troops have
located and surrounded the place where 13 hostages were being held
by a bunch of kidnappers, who were suspected of being Irian Jaya
insurgents, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We have them surrounded, and it is only a matter of time to
free the hostages," the agency quoted armed forces chief spokesman
brigadier general Amir Syarifudin as saying today.
</P>
<P>
He said some 50 armed men Wednesday kidnapped the employees of
Pt. Kamundan Raya, a giant timber company, as they were having a
rest at the base camp, some 80 kilometers northwest of Timika, the
operational center of a US mining company in the country's
easternmost province of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Amir said the troops have not made any move, while awaiting
developments of what the kidnappers would do with their hostages.
</P>
<P>
This is the second kidnapping incidnet occurred in Irian Jaya.
A group of 26 Indonesian and foreign scientists were kidnapped on
January 8 this year by a local security disturbance gang in
Maphnduma, a small village in central Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were released by a rescue mission of the
Indonesian armed forces in May after a military operation.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Technologies Willing to Be Telecom Partner of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Lucent Technologies, formerly a
network and system business of AT&AMP;T, will speed up its development
in China to maintain its status as a leader in the country's
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
"The company will greatly benefit from such a leapfrogging
industrial growth," which turned the country into an emerging
telecom power over the past decade, said John S. K. Ng, vice
president of Lucent Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In support of China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) status, he
said, the company sent a high-profile lobbyist delegation to
Capitol Hill in the United States capital this spring when the MFN
issue was discussed.
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has set up seven joint ventures and six
branches across the country, according to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a series of cooperation projects have been
launched between the company and the Chinese government over the
past ten years. Included are the 500-million-dollar exports of
telecom equipment to Guangdong Province, the first optical cable
between China and Japan, an advanced switching machine plant in
Qingdao, and the SDH system of the Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou
optical trunk.
</P>
<P>
Ng said that Lucent Technologies, as the successor of AT&AMP;T's
telecom equipment businesses here, will continue the work outlined
in a 1993 agreement between AT&AMP;T and the State Planning Committee
of China, which proposed ten technical fields for bilateral
coordination.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the company plays an important role in China's drive
to train telecom technicians. To date, 60 Chinese engineers have
participated the company's technical training course, according to
Ng.
</P>
<P>
Personnel localization will be also accelerated in the Lucent
joint ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Though our contracts have a time limit of 30 years, we would
like to see these plants run by Chinese people in the near
future," the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
Although the market competition is becoming more and more
bitter due to a number of multinational companies entering the
country, Lucent will survive the challenges and realize a quicker
growth, Ng said, because its technical advantage is reinforced by
Bell Laboratories, one of the largest research and development
leaders of global telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee its leading position in the technical market, the
company plans to open more advanced telecom technologies in China,
ranging from the latest network equipment to a wireless telecom
system, according to Ng.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Prime Minister Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi arrived here today on an official visit, the first in six
years, amid stepped up U.S. sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Greeted by Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi at the
airport, Zouebi said that Syria would like to boost its political,
economic, technical and cultural relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Described the present relations between the two countries as
excellent, he said he flew to Tehran to "consult with the Iranian
leadership on regional and international issues."
</P>
<P>
Zouebi is accompanied by six cabinet members including the
ministers of industries, economy, transport and education.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani Monday.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that Turkey's proposal on a
quadrilateral meeting of foreign ministers of Iraq, Turkey, Syria
and Iran to discuss the situation in northern Iraq would be among
the topics to be discussed in the course of Zouebi's visit.
</P>
<P>
Talks were held on the issue between Iranian and Turkish
leaders when Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan visited Tehran
early this week.
</P>
<P>
Now the Iranian and Syrian leaders would focus on measures to
end the internal belligerence in Iraqi Kurdestan, to prevent the
disintegration of Iraq and confront the presence of foreign powers
in the region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear if the two sides will also assess the
U.S. sanctions against Iran. Reporters were given little time to
ask the Syrian prime minister for comment at the airport.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato bill into a law
to punish Iran and Libya on August 5 for alleged sponsoring
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Iran's ally in its eight-year-old war against Iraq, is
believed to be carefully seeking better ties with Washington in
anticipation of securing an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
However, visits by senior foreign officials at this sensitive
moment were seen here as of great political importance since they
might help offset the U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
During this visit by the Syrian prime minister, Iran and Syria
will sign an economic cooperation agreement in a bid to remove
double taxation and establish joint trading firms.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also cover Iran's technical assistance to
Syria in the fields of silos, railway network and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
"We have comprehensive program and list of issues to
discuss. We hope to reach agreement during Syrian delegation's
stay in Tehran," First Vice President Habibi said.

<HEADLINE> First French Woman Astronaut Sent into Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- France sent its first woman
astronaut into space today on the Russian "Soyuz-TM-24" space
shuttle which lifted off from the Russian space center Baikunur in
Kazakhstan at 1318 GMT today.
</P>
<P>
Claudie Andre-Deshays, a 39-year-old neuroscientist, will spend
two weeks on the Russian space station "Mir" carrying out a series
of biological, medical and physical experiments on the human body
in micro-gravity.
</P>
<P>
Andre-Deshays and two Russian astronauts, Valeri Korzoun and
Alexander Kaleri, are expected to dock with Mir, which is
orbiting the earth at an altitude of 350-400 kilometers, at 1448
GMT on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deshays is the 31st woman to go into space. Soviet Valentina
Terechkova became the first woman astronaut in 1963, two years
after Yuri Gagarin made mankind's maiden space mission.

<HEADLINE> Pak Records 20 Bird-Hitting-Plane Cases in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMAABAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 20
bird-hitting-aircraft cases have been reported in three major
airports in Pakistan during the past three months.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, a large number of these incidents
took place at the airport of Lahore, metropolis of Punjab province
in eastern Pakistan while the airports in the capital of Islamabad
and the southern port city of Karachi also face the same problem.
</P>
<P>
Birds become especially hazardous during the current mansoon
season with insects and worms coming out from the humid and soggy
grounds. Once on the runway, the insects and worms are easy prey
for birds, which in turn crowd the runways, posing an immediate
threat to aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan International Airline's Boeing-737 air planes have
been major victims of bird-hitting incidents in the country.
</P>
<P>
A survey of the damage pattern caused by birds shows that a
great number of accidents took place while the aircraft is on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the same thing has been reported with the plane
either takeoff or landing. If both the engines of a twin-engine
plane are affected during takeoff or landing, it could lead to a
major disaster, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Blames Interior Minister for Chechnya Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed today lashed out at Russian Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov for mishandling the conflict in Chechnya and demanded
his head.
</P>
<P>
"I publicly call on President (Boris) Yeltsin to choose between
Lebed and Kulikov," Lebed told reporters here after a
peace-making trip to Chechnya. "Resolute steps must be taken. It
is either Lebed or Kulikov who remains," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov, the interior minister, was assigned by Yeltsin to take
charge of disarming the Chechen separatists in December last year
and was re-appointed to the post in Yeltsin's new government
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Lebed accused Kulikov of "refusing to fulfil his
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
Kulikov later denied the charges, saying Lebed was throwing mud
at him out of an "insane" drive for power and insufficient
knowledge of Chechnya's problems, according to Interfax news
agency reports.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov threatened to resign if the accusations were not
officially withdrawn. "I will tender my resignation to the
president -- I may even write it today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebed was appointed Yeltsin's personal envoy to the breakaway
republic of Chechnya last week after rebels attacked Russian
troops in the capital Grozny and took control of much of the city.
</P>
<P>
He has just returned from Chechnya where he held talks with
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in a bid to build on a
fragile cease-fire which went into effect Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, whose political future hinges greatly upon his success
to end the 20-month war in Chechnya, labeled Kulikov as "one of
the main figures responsible for the tragedy in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with Yandarbiyev Thursday, Lebed said
the peace talks had been "hopeful and constructive".
</P>
<P>
His optimism was echoed by Yandarbiyev, who told Interfax
reporters today that they were ready to meet Russia on the road to
peace.
</P>
<P>
However, sporadic fighting continued in Grozny today despite
the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people have died since Russia sent troops to
subdue Chechnya's independence attempt in December, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Chia Tai Group to Increase Investment in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thailand-based Chia Tai
Group of Companies will increase its investment in the southwest
China province of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the companies' vice president Chen
Liqiang, during a meeting today with Guizhou Province's acting
governor Wu Yixia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Guizhou is full of energy and mineral resources,
and his company now wants to build a cement plant and an aluminium
processing factory there.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the Chia Tai has invested more than 10 billion
Yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars) in China, and nearly 90
enterprises have been established, ranging from livestock raising
to motorcycle production.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises under the group companies have been established in
more than ten provinces or autonomous regions in the inland area.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the group and Guizhou Province began in
October, 1995, when they invested 148 million yuan (about 18
million US dollars) in a large feed-processing plant there.
</P>
<P>
The project will be finished in 1997, the vice president said.

<HEADLINE> Flight Data Recorders to Be Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Southwest Airlines of the
United States has launched a 20 million U.S. dollar upgrade of
flight-data recorders in its Boeing 737 fleet, the Wall Street
Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the country's efforts to install advanced
"black boxes" in the wake of a series of unexplained crashes and
inflight problems. Southwest Airlines expects to have new devices
in two-thirds of its planes by the end of the year, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The new data recorders measure 18 to 22 different aspects of a
flight's performance, depending on the model of 737, providing
additional information over the older black boxes that measure
only 11. In addition to measuring speed, altitude and orientation,
the new recorders track the position of key components, such as
rudders and ailerons, a part of the wing that controls rolling
movements.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board requested the
upgrades, the paper said. The Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), however, balked at ordering the modification under pressure
from airlines concerned about the cost, according to the report.
The FAA proposed a timetable for modification which stretches into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
USAir and United Airlines said they will be in compliance when
the FAA issues a final order. The upgrades are currently estimated
to cost United about 37 million U.S. dollars. Other major
operators of the Boeing 737, including Delta Airlines and
Continental Airlines, said they couldn't immediately say when they
would begin the modifications.

</P>
<P>

promoting the services in the capital and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government has created 120,000 new jobs
since it came to power nearly four years ago, the Beirut Diyar
daily quoted Fuad Sinyoura, Minister of State for Financial
Affairs, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a recent seminar organized in Beirut by the Harvard
Business Administration Club, Sinyoura said 180,000 new
subscribers in the National Fund for Social Security have been
registered over the same period.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Egypt's food gap in the year 2000 would not exceed

<HEADLINE> Further Reduction Expected in US Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal budget
deficit is expected to be down further to 116 billion dollars in
this fiscal year, the smallest since 1981, The Washington Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a revised forecast by the U.S. Congressional
Budget Office (CBO), the U.S. budget deficit will be cut further
by 28 billion dollars from the CBO's earlier estimate of 144
billion dollars issued three months ago.
</P>
<P>
It said the combination of an improving economy and declining
unemployment produced an unanticipated revenue surge of about 22
billion dollars. At the same time, projected government spending
for the year is down by about 7 billion dollars from previous CBO
estimates.
</P>
<P>
The CBO's new forecast is virtually the same as the one
released late last month by the White House Office of Management
and Budget.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. budget deficit ballooned in the 1980s and early 1990s
and began declining gradually after Bill Clinton became the U.S.
president in 1993. The deficit in fiscal 1995 was down to 164
billion dollars from 255 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Economists generally agree that the deficit-to-GDP (gross
domestic product) ratio is the most important measurement of the
relative size of the deficit. With the projected deficit of 116
billion dollars in fiscal 1996, it would be at its lowest level as
a percentage of GDP since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been boosting repeatedly in the
election year that the reduction of budget deficit showed that its
anti-deficit and economic policies are working well.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Russia, Chechens to Reach Negotiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland, the
European Union (EU) presidency state, has urged the Russian
government and the Chechen separatists to reach a negotiated
settlement that would eventually bring peace to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on behalf of the EU, the Irish government
said the worsening situation in Chechnya could not be solved by
military means and a settlement could only be achieved by peaceful
talks, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the EU continued to be seriously
concerned about the situation in Chechnya and that it was
especially worried about the civilian population there.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that both sides should make efforts to ensure
that necessary measures were taken to help humanitarian
organizations to carry out their work in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tens of thousands of people had died over
the past two years and a Russian military source estimated that
265 Russian soldiers had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded
in the last 10 days since Chechen separatists pushed back into
Grozny.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Develop Major Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply
Authority (ZESA) has confirmed the need to develop a major power
station based at Sengwa, in northern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement on Friday a major power
station may be built in the region by the year 2004 based on its
billion-tonne coal resource.
</P>
<P>
The Sengwa coal fields, 450 km northwest of Harare, last year
were identified as having a total coal deposit of 924 million
tonnes, enough to support a power station with installed capacity
of 600 to 1,200 megawatts of power for over 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Power experts believe Zimbabwe has to continue reducing its
dependence on hydro-electric power, mainly because of the erratic
rainfall pattern experienced during the past decades.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Lesotho
today discussed the practical measures on how to deal with the
tensions caused by the cross-border stock theft.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town after his meeting with
Lesotho Foreign Minister Kelebone Maope, Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo said he had discussed with Maope the suggestion of a summit
meeting of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
South African and Lesotho officials believed a high-profile
meeting between President Nelson Mandela and Lesotho Prime
Minister Ntsu Mokhehle could be used as a psychological weapon in
the fight against cross-border stock theft.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that a summit meeting between the two
countries would have "psychological impact" and would add to
other measures already employed to combat the cross-border
cattle-rustling.
</P>
<P>
Nzo also noted that the ongoing high-level discussions would
continue and the proposed meeting between Mandela and Ntsu would
hopefully take place in a near future.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Russian Cabinet, Few New Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The new cabinet announced by
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin Thursday shows that
President Boris Yeltsin is intent on continuing his free market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
But the appointment of Viktor Ilyushin, Yeltsin's former chief
aide, to head up a new social division of the labor ministry shows
the government will pay more attention to social policy.
</P>
<P>
Ilyushin was one of only a few new faces in the cabinet, along
with Vladimir Potanin and Alexander Livshits who becomes finance
minister. All three men are resolute free market reformers and
Ilyushin and Livshits were both close Kremlin aides to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the politically inexperienced Vladimir
Potanin, the 35-year-old head of the giant private bank Oneximbank
as first deputy prime minister in charge of macroeconomic policy
attracted most attention. He will be responsible for leading
Russia further into the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The former Labor Ministry, Social Insurance Ministry and
Federal Employment Service have been merged into the Ministry of
Labor and Social Development, headed by Gennady Melikyan and
expected to play a powerful role in social reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, several ministerial posts, mainly in technocrat fields
such as science and energy, are still vacant. Chernomyrdin said
they could be filled by "representatives of the opposition who are
worthy of it."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who had to form a new government after his re-election
in July, took the opportunity to streamline the administration.
</P>
<P>
The number of government departments has shrunk from 89 to 66,
while the number of ministries has fallen from 25 to 24 and have
been split into nine divisions led by nine deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Shadowed by Yeltsin's poor health, the new cabinet could well
be set for some stormy times as many observers speculate over a
power struggle between chief of Presidential Staff Anatoly
Chubais, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Security Council
Secretary Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet will also be under pressure over the coming
months to boost the economy and tax collection which has been
disastrously low this year.
</P>
<P>
Other problems faced by the new government will be solving the
20-month old war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and cutting
the budget deficit which accounts for 5.5 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Create Rabin Memorial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Likud-led government
today approved the creation of a center to commemorate the slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose death was partly blamed on
Likud's hatred campaign.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill at today's cabinet meeting was a
technical step, for it was first introduced by the former Labor
government, which failed to advance it to the last Knesset
because of the earlier elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the symbolic meaning was not lost in the move: the
Likud government led by Benjamin Netanyahu approved the bill to
set up the memorial center.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, then leader of the rightist opposition Likud party,
was criticized for launching a hatred campaign which allegedly led
to the assassination of Rabin by a radical Jew on last November 4
at a peace rally in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, chief architect of Israeli-Arab peace process based on
"land-for-peace" principle, was usually depicted as a traitor by
the rightist activists in rallies where Netanyahu often made
speeches.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu won the May 29 elections despite the criticism that
dramatically eroded his support among Israeli public after the
Rabin's murder.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu scored a successive comeback after a spate of
Islamic terrorist suicide bombings killed 58 people from February
to March, and eliminated the original comfortable lead by
Netanyahu's rival and then Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Netanyahu paid tribute to Rabin for his
achievements, hailing him as an "important figure in the history
of State of Israel".
</P>
<P>
He said the "awful and hideous murder created a unique
situation that necessitates preserving Rabin's memory in a
unique way."
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the center will be to commemorate the
achievements of the slain prime minister and to serve as a
reminder of the tragic circumstances of his death," said
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. television network CNN a day
earlier, Netanyahu also mourned Rabin's assassination as a "great
tragedy".
</P>
<P>
"The Rabin tragedy is a great tragedy. It is now something
that the overwhelming majority, the great overwhelming majority of
Israelis feel anything but deep sorrow, and hope it will never
repeat again," Netanyahu said.

<HEADLINE> Japan PM Sues Okinawa Governor over U.S. Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto filed a lawsuit against Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota
today demanding he comply with an order to renew land leases for
U.S. military facilities on the southern island prefecture,
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between the
government and Okinawa's governor over land leases to U.S. bases
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the Okinawans and the U.S. military have been
high since three U.S. servicemen raped a teenage girl on the
island last September.
</P>
<P>
This is the third suit brought by the central government against
Ota over the U.S. bases issue in an attempt to get the governor to
carry out what it claims are his gubernatorial duties.
</P>
<P>
Ota has rejected Hashimoto's order that he take the legal
procedures required to renew land leases for Kadena air base and
10 other U.S. military facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court is expected to give a
ruling at year-end or next year.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto had asked Ota to act as proxy for the mayors of nine
cities, towns and villages, where the 11 bases are located after
the municipal governments refused to display public papers
required for expropriating the land plots.
</P>
<P>
Ota defied the prime minister's order, saying an agreement
between the Japanese and U.S. governments to reduce the amount of
land occupied by the U.S. military by one-fifth does not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all Japanese land for U.S. military use is
concentrated in Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of
Japan's total area and is located about 1,600 kilometers southwest
of Tokyo. Some 30,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are
stationed in the prefecture.

<HEADLINE> OECD Report Hails China's Reform and Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's economic reforms and
achievements over the past 15 years have been "remarkable" and set
the country on a path of rapid growth, a report by the
Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said today.
</P>
<P>
"In only a decade and a half, China has transformed itself from
a dormant, introspective giant into a dynamic powerhouse of major
potential significance to the world economy," said the report by
the body, which represents the world's 28 richest nations.
</P>
<P>
The report, "China Enters the 21st Century" published in the
August-September edition of "the OECD Observer", says that output
has expanded at an average annual rate of nearly 10 percent and
total exports at 17 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated one-fifth of world's population, China now
accounts for almost four percent of world merchandise trade and a
substantial share of global production.
</P>
<P>
"This is a remarkable accomplishment by any standard. It is the
fruit of a strategy, initiated in 1978, to embark on far-reaching
economic liberalization and to integrate China into the world
economy," it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that following the success of experiments with market
reforms, most notably in the agricultural sector, and with the
increased exposure of the economy to foreign investors and freer
trade in special economic zones, China's door has swung further
open.
</P>
<P>
"A sustained series of reforms has continued the process,
including most recently the declared intention of the Chinese
government to allow convertibility of the currency well ahead of
schedule, step up reforms of the state-owned enterprises, and press
ahead vigorously with tariff reductions," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that standards of literacy among China's workforce were
high, reserves of coal huge and the agricultural base strong.
</P>
<P>
The reforms led quickly to rising farm incomes which permitted
higher rates of saving among the rural population in the first
years of reform.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, it was high saving rates by households which helped to
sustain the high investment rates (around 40 percent of GDP in the
early 1990s) on which rapid growth has fed," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which
amounted to 34 billion U.S. dollars by 1994, have been an
important source of foreign technology and improved management
techniques, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also mentioned several obstacles that may
block China's future development. They are primarily
infrastructural deficiencies, which cost nearly one percent of
gross domestic product; the deficiency of more sophisticated
high-quality goods across a wide range of advanced technologies
and industries; and serious environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
It said that widening regional differentials in development, the
prospect of large-scale joblessness, the potential volatility of the
macro-economy, and the implications of an ageing population will also
have a bearing on China's growth path.
</P>
<P>
The OECD aims to coordinate economic and social policies among
its 28 member states, mainly western countries.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Officials Worship Military War Dead at Yasukuni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Six Japanese cabinet members
visited Yasukuni Shrine today to mourn Japan's military war dead,
including war criminals, enshrined there, on the 51st anniversary
of Japan's defeat in World War II.
</P>
<P>
They are all from Prime Minister Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic
Party which, together with the Social Democratic Party and the
Pioneer Party Sakigake, comprises Japan's tripartite ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
International Trade and Industry Minister Shumpei Tsukahara and
Transport Minister Yoshiyuki Kamei signed their names only in the
visitors' book.
</P>
<P>
While the rest of them, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Minister Ichizo Ohara, Home Affairs Minister Hiroyuki Kurata,
Defense Agency chief Hideo Usui and Science and Technology Agency
chief Hidenao Nakagawa, wrote their cabinet titles in the book,
indicating that they were visiting the shrine in their official
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Yasukuni, next to the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo,
enshrines some 2.4 million Japanese military personnel and
officials who died in Japan's wars of expansion and aggression in
the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead honored there were 14 class-A war criminals of
World War II, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and
others executed by the Far East Military Tribunal in Tokyo at the
end of the war.
</P>
<P>
The Shrine, which was a bastion of the
militarist-government-sponsored Shintoism during the war, is and
has always been a political institution more than a religious one.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members' visits to the shrine have been criticized by
Asian neighboring countries and have been controversial at home
since Japan's postwar constitution stipulates separation of
religion and the state.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Hashimoto became the first incumbent Japanese Prime
Minister to visit the shrine since Yasuhiro Nakasone did so in
1985, triggering protests from such neighboring nations as China,
the Democratic People Republic of Korea and South Korea, which
suffered bitterly under the militarist heels of the Japanese
empire.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Ritsuko Nagao and Hokkaido-Okinawa Development
Agency chief Saburo Okabe went to the shrine on August 7 and
Monday, respectively.

<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold and silver
medalists Cuba and China will clash again on the 1.5 million
U.S. dollar Women's Volleyball Grand Prix tour starting later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the post-Olympics retirement of star spiker Mireya Luis
and center block Magaly Carvajal, Cuba is still favored in the
event held in nine cities across the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
China, coached by former national star Lang Ping, have
announced the same squad that fell to Cuba 3-1 in the final at the
Atlanta Olympic Games earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, Olympic champions in 1984, will still rely much
upon star players Sun Yue and Lai Yawen as they meet Cuba in the
Japanese city of Sendai on August 30 and in Beijing on September 8
before a probable clash in the finals in Shanghai in September.
</P>
<P>
"With almost all of the world's best squads competing, the
grand prix tour is a top-standard event after the Olympics," coach
Lang told a press conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Although my team is physically exhausted at the Atlanta
Olympics, I hope they could still present the best form in an
event beloved by spectators home and abroad."
</P>
<P>
The other teams in the event to be staged in five consecutive
weeks are Olympic bronze medalist Brazil, South Korea, last year's
overall Grand Prix winners the United States, Russia, Japan and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In each of the first four weeks there will be two tournaments
held simultaneously in two cities, each featuring round-robin
competition participated by four teams.
</P>
<P>
The tournament in Sendai will coincide with another in Jakarta
in the opening week, Beijing with Osaka in the second week, Macau
with Honolulu in the third and Hong Kong with Taipei in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The top three out of the preliminaries and host China will
enter the September 27-29 finals in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> U.S. D'amato Bill Not Acceptable, Germany FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel has described a new U.S. law imposing sanctions on foreign
companies investing in Iran and Libya as unacceptable and said it
could upset German-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Bild-Zeitung newspaper today quoted Kinkel as saying
Germany cannot accept legislation by another country dictating
what country it can trade with. Kinkel stressed that if
Washington insists on implementing the bill, also known as the
D'Amato Bill, European countries will have to consider retaliatory
measures.
</P>
<P>
The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act was signed into law by
U.S. President Bill Clinton last week. The law threatens sanctions
against foreign companies who invest more than 40 million
U.S. dollars a year in the oil and gas industries in Iran and
Libya. The U.S. wants to penalize the two countries, which it
believes sponsor international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said the bill has brought "slight disharmony" to
German-U.S. relations. He also expressed the hope that American
sanctions would not develop into a trade war between Europe and
the U.S..

<HEADLINE> UK, France to Create Largest Missile Firm in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- British Aerospace (BAe) and the
French defense and communications company Matra Defense have
signed an agreement to create the largest missile company in
Europe by pooling their missile businesses.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the signing ceremony, they
said that the deal would create Europe's largest guided weapons
business, Matra BAe Dynamics, with annual turnover of around 1
billion pounds (1.55 billion U.S. dollars) and a 2.6 billion pound
(4.03 billion dollar) order book.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, which is expected to employ 6,000 people, is
still subject to approval by the British and French governments
and both companies said it might be some months before it went
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Under the final details of the agreement, BAe is to make an
initial cash payment to Lagardere Group, Matra's parent company,
of 80 million pounds (124 million dollars) to reflect the current
value for Lagardere's Matra in excess of that of BAe Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
The two companies made it clear that the signing marks a major
step forward in consolidation of the European defense industry to
enable it to compete against U.S. giants such as Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of the joint venture recognizes the changing
nature of defense procurement in Europe and need for the European
defense industry to consolidate in order to be fully competitive
in international markets," they said in the joint statement.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parties Regret WWII Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's main political parties
today issued separate statements expressing remorse for the
nation's aggression in World War II and vowing to contribute to
world peace.
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of 51st anniversary of the Japanese surrender,
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said his Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) will always remember the historical fact that the war
of aggression launched by Japanese militarists caused immeasurable
pain to the people of Asia and will do it utmost to work for
global peace while doing soul-searching over Japan's wartime
actions.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is the main partner in the three-party ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Its partner, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) said it will
develop the spirit of remarks made by its chairman, former Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama, one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Murayama expressed remorse and made a clear-cut apology to
neighboring nations over Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
New Party Sakigake, the smallest partner in the tripartite
coalition, said it will never forget the fact that Japan inflicted
tremendous pain on Asian nations and the world and will sincerely
apologize for the past in order to help build relations of trust
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party said Japan should clearly express
remorse for its war crimes. It also called for Japan to end its
military alliance with the United States and become a neutral
nation. That is the only way for Japan to draw lessons from
history, the party said.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party),
and Japan's second largest party, only said it would work hard for
the global abolition of nuclear weapons and for the elimination of
famine, poverty and discrimination in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement is regarded as a step backwards from the one
issued a year ago, in which the party expressed deep repentance
for Japan's aggression and colonialism.

<P>
SEOUL, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The E. coli O-157 bacteria, which
caused nine deaths and thousands of food poisoning victims in
Japan, was found in a cow liver here on Thursday, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the Health and Welfare Ministry as saying
that it has found the deadly bacteria in one of the 10 cow liver
samples collected at the slaughterhouse in Majang-dong, eastern
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The beef liver products are among a list of 270 food items
collected last month for sanitary checks.
</P>
<P>
On the discovery of the strain in the cow's liver, the ministry
has ordered health offices across the country to beef up their
preventive maneuvers and advised people not to eat uncooked meat
offals such as beef liver, stomach and tripe, which some South
Koreans prefer to eat raw or not well cooked.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's instructions came one day before health experts
and government officials are to hold a meeting to discuss ways of
coping effectively with the bacteria and preventive measures
against a massive food poisoning outbreak to be caused by them.
</P>
<P>
However, ministry officials have denied press reports that the
government may be considering declaring the O-157 bacteria an
epidemic, as the Japanese government did on August 6.

ATLANTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The 1996 Atlanta Paralympic

Golden Knights.
</P>

Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh killed 49 people and seriously
wounded another 199 in the first half of this year, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial News said a total of 308 traffic accidents were
registered in the capital in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Police officials said the accidents were mainly attributed to
people's poor awareness of the importance of observing traffic
rules.
</P>
<P>
Traffic rules request drivers to drive along the right side of
the road but most of them ignored the rules in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The absence of traffic lights at crossings has also added to
traffic chaos, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Condemns Japanese Ministers' Visit to War Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean political parties
today attacked the visit by several Japanese cabinet ministers and
parliamentarians Thursday to the Yasukuni Shrine to mourn Japan's
military war dead.
</P>
<P>
The visit, on the 51st anniversary of the country's surrender
in World War II, was described as a sign of the revival of
militarism in Japan by a commentary by the ruling New Korea Party.
</P>
<P>
The politicians insulted the feelings of the peoples of Asian
countries invaded by Japan during World War Two, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, the National Congress for New
Politics, also issued a statement saying the Japanese ministers'
visit to the war shrine indicated Japan has not shown remorse for
its war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Japan should make sincere apologies to all war victims, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Another statement jointly issued by some 20 lawmakers from both
the ruling and the opposition parties called on the South Korean
government to lodge a protest with the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency released a
commentary attacking the Japanese ministers' visit as an attempt
to glorify Japan's war of aggression in Asia in the 1930s and
1940s.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Signs Agreement With International Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A formal agreement was
signed today in Cape Town by South African Correctional Services
Minister Sipo Mzimela and the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), according to ministerial liaison officer bert
slabbert.
</P>
<P>
Slabbert said the agreement would bring South Africa in line
with similar international agreements between the ICRC and other
democratic states in the world.
</P>
<P>
One of the most notable principles of the agreement was that
the ICRC would be allowed "unhindered access" to persons held in
all South African prisons, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Correctional Services believes that positive
effects of the agreement are that it would strengthen the drive
towards transparency in the department and it would further
commit the department towards the humane treatment of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was an amendment of an existing agreement which was
signed on July 8, 1992.

<HEADLINE> Two Moslem Extremists Arrested in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian security forces have
arrested two wanted Moslem Extremists who are members of the
outlawed al-Jihad group, an official security source at the
Interior Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The two were identified as Gamal Ahmad al-Sayyed Mustafa, a
leader of the Moslem extremist group, and Muawad Abdallah Ismail
al-Issawi, the source was quoted as saying by the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The group, which was held responsible for the killing of late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981, has been in a low profile
due to the government's fierce crackdown on it following the
assassination. Some members of the group recently have been
accused of trying to revive the group's activities.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made as part of efforts by the government
security forces to crack down on Moslem extremists whose terrorist
activities have posed a threat to the government and the stability
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came only one day after Egypt's Supreme Military
Court convicted eight members of the Moslem Brotherhood for
attempting to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Seven of them were sentenced to three years in prison, while
the other one was given a one-year suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, many members of the group were arrested
after being accused of having links with Moslem extremists who
have resorted to violence since 1992 in an attempt to install
strict Islamic rule in Egypt.

OTTAWA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
expressed deep concern over the violent clashes that took place in
Cyprus on August 11 and 14 in the United Nations-controlled buffer
zone between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is particularly troubled by these latest events, which
resulted in the death of two Greek Cypriots and injured many
others in the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, as well as UN
peacekeepers," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the two parties to take all necessary measures to
prevent further violence and to resume talks aimed at finding a
permanent resolution to this conflict," Axworthy stated.
</P>
<P>
Canada participated in UN peacekeeping operations in Cyprus for
29 years, and continues to support UN efforts toward establishing
peace and security on the island, said a news release from the
Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
Canada supports all measures, consistent with relevant Security
Council resolutions, leading to the demilitarization of Cyprus as
a possible avenue for the peaceful resolution of the Cypriot
conflict, it said.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour today proposed formation of a joint Africa censor body to
counter negative reports disseminated by the foreign media
institutions on Africa.
</P>
<P>
President Amour sounded the proposal this afternoon at his
home village, Mkwajuni, to the north of Zanzibar Town when he met
five members of the Tanzania Broadcasting Commission who paid a
courtesy call on him.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign media had been disseminating bad news on
Africa apparently to discourage the people to struggle towards
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the bad reports against the continent would affect the
development and ultimately discourage the people to step up
efforts toward self dependence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commision Chairman Mark Bomani advised the Isles
government to make Televison Zanzibar (TVZ) as a national
insitution and give fair coverage of all national reports

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
deplores the recent violence in Cyprus and the use of force by the
security forces in the north of the country in a declaration made
here today.

unauthorized entry into the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, it accuses the killings of two victims,
Tassos Isaac and Solomos Solomou, as "brutal" and expresses its
deep concern about the injuries sustained by many others,
including United Nations peacekeeping personnel.
</P>
<P>
The EU calls for restraint and calm in the wake of these tragic
events and it urges both sides to avoid further confrontation and
to make efforts to defuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
The European organization sees an urgent need to intensify
efforts to promote a comprehensive political settlement in Cyprus,
under the aegis of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the EU also reiterates its full support for
the work of the UN secretary-general and his special
representatives in this regard.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- About 18,000 troops would be
required for the west African peacekeeping force known as Ecomog
to obtain the ''overwhelming'' capacity necessary to deter a
further breach of the peace in war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, said Ecomog Field Commander Major-General Victor
Malu, 4,500 would be in need for Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
In a report to a two-day ministerial meeting of the Committee
of Nine on Liberia of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), which began in the Nigerian capital of Abuja on
Thursday, Malu said the troops must be provided with adequate
logistic support before the peace program for Liberia could work.
</P>
<P>
The support will include the cooperation of neighboring
countries in enforcing the U.N. arms embargo against Liberia,
logistic and troop support for Ecomog as well as the cooperation
of factional leaders in the process of restoring the safe haven
status of Monrovia, which was turned into battlefield when
renewed factional fighting broke out on April 6.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Warns of Rapid Expulsion of Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre today warned the immigrants going on hunger
strike in a Paris church of immediate expulsion, and he again
ruled out the possibility of granting them residential papers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on local television, Debre said, "There will be
no regularization" of the status of the illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 African illegal immigrants have been occupying the
Saint-Bernard Church of Paris for six weeks and 10 of them have
been fasting to protest the immigration policy of the French
government which has been in force since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of former president Francois
Mitterrand, today paid a visit to the hunger strikers in the
church.
</P>
<P>
"I have told them the government cannot regularize your status.
We apply the law. We are ready -- since you should go back to your
country -- to see... how to let you go home in the best ways,"
said Debre.
</P>
<P>
Asked by a television anchorman if the government is planning a
rapid expulsion of the illegal immigrants, the minister said, "I
respect the law."
</P>
<P>
"The illegal immigrants said that we are in an illegal
situation. But their laws are not important, we will not buy
them," he said. "A small group of people cannot jeopardize the
laws voted by the deputies and senators who are the expression of
the national will."
</P>
<P>
He said that he is receiving hundreds of letters of legal
foreign residents in France who encourage him to be firm on the
issue of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
"I do not play fun with the policy of firmness. If I prove the
firmness (in my policy), it is because this is in the interest of
France and foreigners (legally living in France)," said the
minister.

PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it remains
attached to the transmission of the draft text of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to the U.N. General Assembly
despite the partial failure of the negotiations on the treaty in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution of the U.N. General Assembly of December 15,
1995, binds all the states to adopt the treaty at the beginning of
the next general assembly of the organization at the end of
September. This expiry date calls for the commitment of the whole
international community. France for its part understands respecting
it," Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the plenary session of the Conference of
Disarmament scheduled for August 20 will allow the come-up of a
consensus on the transmission of the text of the treaty to the U.N.
General Assembly," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that France regrets that the U.N. ad hoc committee on
the CTBT could not unanimously approve the draft text.
</P>
<P>
India has rejected the CTBT treaty by describing it as
"discriminatory" and "undermining the national security of
India."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts down to Four-Month Low in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in U.S. fell
by 1.3 percent in July to the lowest level in four months, U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.46 million units at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, down from a revised 1.47 million in June. The June's
figure was originally estimated at 1.48 million.
</P>
<P>
The housing starts in July was the smallest since last March,
when builders laid foundations at a 1.44 million rate. It also was
the third straight decline, the first time that has happened since
January-March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said that single-family starts, about 80 percent of
new home construction, plunged 5.7 percent in July to a 1.13
million rate, erasing a 5 percent gain a month earlier. It was the
biggest decline since a 12 percent fall in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartments and condominiums, which is not as
sensitive to changes in interest rates, shot up 17.9 percent to a
322,000 rate, almost wiping out a 18.3 percent drop in June.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, starts fell 12.2 percent in the West and 4.1
percent in the South. But they jumped 17.1 percent in the Midwest
and managed a 2.4 percent gain in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Despite generally rising mortgage rates and the recent slowing,
starts during the first seven months of 1996 still were 12.4
percent above those of a corresponding period a year earlier.
Starts for all of 1995 totaled 1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, applications for building permits, often a gauge of
future activity, rose 2.6 percent to a 1.45 million rate in July.
It was the first advance in three months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the decline in the U.S. housing market, the
most interest-sensitive sector of the economy, was bound
eventually to respond to higher rates.
</P>
<P>
In July, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages in U.S. averaged 8.25
percent, down from 8.32 percent a month earlier but well above the
7.03 percent average last January, according to the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend in the U.S. housing market was consistent
with the recent performance of most other sectors of the economy.

<HEADLINE> UN Plans to Further Cut Budget in 1998-1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
cut its budget by 6.9 percent in the 1998-1999 period,
Under Secretary-General Joseph Connor said here today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1998-1999 budget outline at a press conference,
Connor said that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali estimated
that for 1998-1999 the organization will require resources of
2,429 million dollars, a decrease of 178.9 million dollars over
the current biennium (1996-1997) before allowing for inflation and
foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The first reason for the budget decrease is attributed to
reduction of staff members. Connor noted that a staffing level of
10,021 posts was approved by the General Assembly as at January 1,
1996. At the end of the 1998-1999 period 15 percent of the posts
will be vacated and kept unoccupied. So far, the organization has
already vacated 900 posts compared to that at the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will also cut resources for conference
services, international justice and law, human rights,
development, administration and building management, ranging from
4.4 to 13 percent. The only sector with increased resources is the
political affairs, mainly providing for possible mandates relating
to special missions, Connor said.

<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Aid agencies working in Liberia
have appealed to the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) to discuss humanitarian issues during a summit aimed at
bringing peace to the war-ravaged country, relief officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
''We would like to appeal to the Special ECOWAS Committee on
Liberia to seriously include humanitarian concerns on the peace
process agenda so as to strengthen the chances for a durable and
sustainable peace so much demanded by the Liberian people,'' the
agencies said in a letter to ECOWAS Chairman and Nigeria's head
of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
According to a report obtained here today, heads of state from
Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire,
Nigeria, Senegal and Togo are expected to participate in the
meeting of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia, which is
scheduled to open Saturday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Since factional conflict was ignited by warlord Charles Taylor
more than six years ago, Liberia has been torn apart and at least
150,000 people have died in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen peace agreements have been signed by the
warring factions but none of them has been respected.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the agencies appealed in their letter for
''international pressure to be applied on faction leaders to
abide by the peace process,'' said the report.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
continues to be seriously concerned about the situation in
Chechnya, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU remains especially concerned about the conditions of the
civilian population in Chechnya, according to a declaration issued
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has recently approved a package of
humanitarian aid worth 4.18 million ECUs (some 5.27 million U.S.
dollars) for civilians affected by the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU noted that more needs to be done in this regard.
It is therefore planning to urge both sides to ensure that
necessary measures are taken to facilitate the work of
humanitarian organizations on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also planning to encourage the parties to move now to
build on the positive developments in Chechnya and to continue
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ceasefire now appears to be broadly in place,
the EU expressed its belief in the declaration that the situation
in Chechnya cannot be solved by military means and that a
settlement can only be achieved by negotiations.

</P>
<P>
Eizenstat, 52, was appointed under-secretary of commerce for
international trade in January. He once was chief domestic policy
adviser to President Carter in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced his decision to name a special envoy on Cuba
policy last month when he suspended for six months the filing of
lawsuits under the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law, which Clinton signed in March, includes a
provision that permits U.S. citizens to sue in American courts
foreign companies that now "traffic" in such properties.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in the statement that he suspended the right to
file such suits for six months to give time "to forge a common
approach with our allies and trading partners to accelerate
democratic transition in Cuba".
</P>
<P>
The Canadian embassy said Canada will adopt a wait-and-see
attitude about the new envoy, but would be willing to work with
him.
</P>
<P>
"On our part, I don't think we need to be pushed or pulled with
the Cubans because we're engaging them at all levels... We deal
with everybody," said a Canadian embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Cuba believes Eizenstat's mission would be a tough one.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Havana, a Cuban Foreign Ministry
spokesman said: "Without a doubt, he has a really tough mission.
The international rejection (of Helms-Burton) has grown and it's
clear that this U.S. policy is condemned to failure."

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Economic Growth Slow but Steady in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economy has maintained
a slow but steady growth since the beginning of this year, coupled
with a low inflation rate, strong consumer spending and more
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures released by influential economic
research institutions, the British economy has kept growing for
the fifth consecutive year since 1992 when it recovered from the
recession earlier than that of other European Union (EU)
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury forecasts that the UK economy will grow by 2.5
percent in 1996, and by 3.25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the strong consumer spending will be
the backbone of the economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Britain's inflation rate stood at
2.1 percent in June, the lowest level since 1993. Mortgage costs
were cheaper than at any time in almost 30 years. Tax cuts, lower
unemployment rate and rising personal income have contributed to
the strengthening of consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, new car sales in Britain surpassed one
million, 5.1 percent up over the same period last year,
representing the best half-year sales since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In addition, housing, furniture, carpets, food and drink all
saw a strong increase in demand.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Conservative government has tried its
best to regulate economic growth and inflation by encouraging free
competition, reducing administrative measures and promoting market
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the UK economy broke away from the state of
stagnation which had perplexed it for several decades. Many
enterprises in steel, electricity, gas, communication and aviation
industries have improved efficiency and made high profits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has kept money supply under control
and constantly adjusted the base interest rates to ensure a smooth
operation of the whole economy. Since last December, the Bank of
England, the UK central bank, has cut its interest rates four
times.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the number of people out of work is also a main
factor in heightening the consumer confidence, thus benefiting the
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Central Statistics showed
that the jobless total fell to 2.12 million in July, accounting for
7.6 percent of the workforce, the lowest level among other main EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
The healthy growth of the economy and a good investment
environment in the UK have attracted more foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Britain has become the top target of
Japanese entrepreneurs. The number of Japanese companies in the UK
amounted to more than 200, exceeding the total sum of firms Japan
has set up in France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has increased from 44.3 billion pounds (68
billion US dollars) in 1985 to 150 billion pounds (230 billion US
dollars) at present, equivalent to one-third of the total foreign
investment in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the British economy has its own weakness.
Manufacturing, as a key sector of the national economy, has long
been plagued by less investment and low efficiency. Foreign trade
deficit keeps widening in the country though its economy relies
heavily on exports. Losses inflicted upon the economy by trade
union strikes and +mad cow+ crisis are hard to estimate at
present.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that with the approaching of the general
election to be held in 1997, the Conservative government will
certainly spare no effort to keep the momentum of the economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Mad Dogs Bites Dead 48 Sheep before Being Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Two domestic dogs cut the throat
of 48 sheep and fatally wounded 100 others in Buhy, Val d'Oise
north of Paris this evening in an orgy of bloodbathing on a green
field before being killed by police, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The heads and bodies of sheep were lying everywhere on an
enclosed meadow several hundred meters wide, and some corpse of
the lambs slaughtered by the two mastiff dogs were drifting down a
river nearby, Agence France Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
The dogs belonged to Catherine d'Herbes, a regional councillor
of the extreme rightwing Front National in Picardie and municipal
councillor of Beauvais. They broke away from a castle where
Catherine inhabits.
</P>
<P>
One hundred other sheep -- many of them pregnant -- fatally
bitten by the dogs were to be slaughtered because they were
bitterly suffering from their wounds. Loss was estimated at
400,000 francs (80,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shepherd Sylvain Crevecoeur has launched a legal complaint
of "digression of domestic animals" against d'Herbes, who
claimed that the animals "had never shown any aggressiveness
before."
</P>
<P>
The two dogs were undergoing autopsy to show the cause of their
madness.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Wildfires have burned 1.6
million hectares in western U.S. states since the beginning of the
year, more than tripling the total of the last whole year,
according to the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 fire-fighters are battling against fires in nine
Western states where nearly 136,000 hectares have been burned
since August 8. Half of the fire-fighters were assigned to Oregon
to slow the growth of a 38,600-hectare fire. The fire has already
destroyed 11 houses.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, vacationing with his family in
Wyoming, ordered Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to send any
needed reinforcements to the state which has declared a state of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
State police evacuated 92 people, mostly campers, from an
area in north-central Oregon late Thursday when the glow of a
fire was approaching.
</P>
<P>
The National Interagency Fire Center said about 700 new fires
were reported in Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming -- mostly small fires sparked by lightning.
Fires also erupted in Nevada and Colorado.

<P>
SARAJEVO, August 16 (Xinhua) - A high-level Yugoslav trade
delegation will visit Sarajevo as early as next week, local press
quoted a senior Bosnian official as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According Ejup Ganic, who is a member of the Bosnian presidency,
The visit was agreed to during talks between presidents Alija
Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Geneva
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ganic, who led the first Bosnian delegation to visit Belgrade last
month since 1992, said the arrival of a Yugoslav delegation will be
"the next step in the normalization in relations" between the two
Balkan neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resumption of the trade with Serbia will be in the
interests of Bosnia since their economies were closely linked as
republics of the former Yugoslavia.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.N. Administrator for Eastern Slavonia Jacques
Klein said today the normalization of Yugoslav-Croat relations had
a positive impact on the resolution of problems relating to the
Eastern Slavonia region.
</P>
<P>
The two assessed that the normalization of relations between
the two countries was also an important factor of the
consolidation of peace and stability on the territory of the
former Yugoslavia, Tanjug news agency quoted an official statement
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman signed an
agreement in Athens, Greece, on August 7, under which Yugoslavia
and Croatia will formally establish diplomatic relations later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Klein informed Milosevic about the most important aspects of
the implementation of the agreement concerning Eastern Slavonia,
especially the invested efforts for the solution of key issues of
interest to the local population's life and work in normal
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Serb-dominated Eastern Slavonia region, located in
northeastern Croatia bordering Yugoslavia, has been placed under
U.N. Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) for
a year, in accordance with an agreement reached between Croatian
government and the local Serb leaders late last year.

<HEADLINE> Five U.S. Congressmen Attack Turkey for Cypriot Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- In what appears to be an
escalation of criticism on Turkey, five members of U.S. House of
Representatives on Friday attacked Turkish Cypriot security forces
for killing two Greek Cypriot demonstrators in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The attack follows Thursday's State Department accusation that
said the Turkish Cypriot security forces took "disproportionate"
step to the threat posed by the demonstrators who entered the
divided island's buffer zone without permission on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Representative Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of
the five Representatives told a news conference: "Turkey must be
condemned for the actions of its troops in brutally killing, on
two separate occasions, unarmed, defenseless civilians."
</P>
<P>
"I want to call on President Bill Clinton... to invoke
sanctions against Turkey for their $23 billion gas deal with
Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, brushing aside the
the threat imposed by Clinton's new Iran/Libya sanctions, reached
the $23 billion deal on Monday with Iran that will sell 140
billion cubic feet of natural gas a year to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iran/Libya sanctions, signed into law by Clinton
early this month, any foreign firms would be punished for
investing $40 million or more in the energy sectors of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon Turkey's signing of the deal, the State Department said in
its first reaction that the Turkey-Iran deal sent a "wrong
message".
</P>
<P>
Most of the congressmen also called for sanctions to be
imposed on Turkey for its ignoring the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street advanced
broadly today, boosted by a strong bond market and a surprising
rebound in shares of Hewlett-Packard Co., which suffered a slump
in profit.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 23.67 points to close at
5,689.45. In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced losers
by a 15-to-8 margin on light New York Stock Exchange volume of
about 319 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip measure is about 10 points shy of 5,700 and 15
shy of its starting point for the week.
</P>
<P>
Bonds had strong gains, sending long-term interest rates lower,
after the Commerce Department reported that construction of new
homes and apartments fell 1.3 percent in July to the lowest level
in four months.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend was consistent with the recent performance
of most other sectors of the economy, enhancing expectations the
Federal Reserve will not feel compelled to raise short-term
interest rates next week to check inflation.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares were mostly firm today despite
Hewlett-Packard's 26 percent drop in third-quarter profit,
reported after trading on Thursday, and a warning that some
profitability problems could continue.
</P>
<P>
But a stream of healthy profit reports from other technology
names such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Compaq Computer, and, just a
few days ago, Dell Computer, has helped sooth worries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (xinhua) -- Share prices in London hit a new
record today, closing high after the public sector borrowing
requirement figures gave a boost to hopes of tax cuts. But trading
on other European bourses was thin because of the summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
News that UK government borrowing had moved out of the red for
the first time this year spurred the London market onwards.
Buoyant gains on Wall Street added coal to the fire together with
good corporate results and signs that inflation was under control.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed at a record high at 3,872.9 points,
surpassing the previous closing record of 3,857.1 set on April 19.
</P>
<P>
The bullish trading on the London market was in sharp contrast
to the sleepy mood on most other European bourses.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed a touch firmer supported by
a strong bond market, which was underpinned by the hopes for a
slowdown in the growth of M3 money supply for July, due next week.
But trading was thin.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended 35.5 points higher at 3,872.9.
Frankfurt's DAX-30 share index closed floor trade up 2.03 at
2,548.36. The computerized IBIS index finished up 25.21 at
2,567.96. The Paris bourse was closed for holiday.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Cuban Plane Crashes off Florida: Coast Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Four people on a small plane
were rescued this afternoon after crash-landing in the Gulf of
Mexico off Southwest Florida, the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
The plane circled a Russian-flagged freighter, then crashed
into the waters close to it, Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr.
Marcus Woodring was quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
The freighter's crew rescued the four people aboard.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard said the plane was from Cuba and it was
being hijacked by three Cubans who forced the pilot to fly to the
west coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
The three hijackers immediately asked for political asylum,
while the pilot said he wanted to return home, Russian crew
members interviewed by U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs agents said they were pursuing and videotaping the
unidentified small plane as a possible drug smuggler at the time
when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear why the plane ditched in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Russian freighter, Irbenskiy Proliv, was about 80.5
kilometers west of Naples, Florida, when it saw the plane crash.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Turkish Minister's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
criticized Turkey's foreign minister for his comments about
violence occurred this week on Cyprus, causing a toll of two
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The violence took place on Wednesday when Greek Cypriots
entered the island's buffer zone to protest against the Turkish
troops who were reported to beat a Greek Cypriot to death the
previous Sunday, and a young man, called Solomous Solomou, 26,
climbed a pole trying to tear down the Turkish flag when Turkish
Cypriot security forces opened fire and killed him.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller told a rally
in Turkey: "We break the hands that reach out in disrespect of the
flag. We won't allow any violation of border lines. We won't allow
any attacks on the flag."
</P>
<P>
In an unusually strong condemnation, State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns called the flag "a piece of cloth" and human life
is more important than that "piece of cloth".
</P>
<P>
"Protection of a flag cannot excuse the horrible events of
August 14. Human life and the sanctity of human life are
ultimately more important than protecting a piece of cloth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. relations with Turkey, a NATO ally, was greatly
affected by a $23 billion gas deal Turkey's prime minister signed
with Iran on Monday, which is in confrontation with U.S. new
sanctions against foreign companies investing $40 million or more
in Iranian energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Burns called the killing "unwarranted and unjustified", adding:
"We are calling here for full accountability, first and foremost.
Secondly we're calling for restraint, restraint by both sides, so
that this kind of violence will not continue."

BELGRADE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic said today all state institutions were engaged in
securing the necessary atmosphere for democratic elections and
that all measures would be taken to prevent possible incidents.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic made the statement to reporters after discussing the
September 14 elections in Bosnia with U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Envoy Igbal Riza, Tanjug news agency reported from Serb
capital Pale.
</P>
<P>
Riza said it had been agreed at the meeting that it was
necessary to create conditions for the elections to pass in the
best possible atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
He said a U.N. mission would closely cooperate with NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) and Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in monitoring the elections. OSCE
has been charged with organizing the first post-war elections in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also noted that an agreement had been reached
between the Interior Ministries of Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation Thursday on ways of protecting voters who
will be casting their ballots in the other entity.
</P>
<P>
Riza said the freedom of movement was the key issue, since all
indications were that there will be large numbers of those who
will be voting in the other entity.
</P>
<P>
He specified that citizens of the Muslim-Croat federation will
be mostly crossing into Republika Srpska to vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lanzhou, August, 17 (Xinhua)-- Families in northwest China's
Gansu province have won more breathing space - thanks to a reform
of the province's housing system.
</P>
<P>
Each person has 8.49 square meters of living space in urban and
rural areas in the province, an increase of 1.19 square meters
since the reforms were introduced.
</P>
<P>
Over 8,700 units, more than half of the units in Gansu, have
established housing accumulation fund systems. They cover one
million people and have so far built up a total fund of 320
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
So far, 86 counties have started housing reforms, collecting
155 million yuan housing accumulation funds, and 920 million yuan
in savings surplus.
</P>
<P>
The progress has been due to the housing reform policies
initiated by the provincial government. Rent levels of
publicly-owned housing is based on the state's house-sale policy,
executed jointly by departments of housing-reform, statistics and
construction.
</P>
<P>
Now, Gansu has realized its target of eight square meters
average per capita living space in advance, which was set for the
end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Red-Crowned Cranes Fly Over Himalayas Twice A year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Extinction-threatened red-crowned
cranes have given themselves the ultimate bird's eye view of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Twice a year they fly high above the Himalaya Mountains on
their way from northern China to India, as part of their annual
migration trek.
</P>
<P>
The flight, over the world's highest mountain range, has been
tracked by Chinese monitoring technology through an orbiting
meteorological satellite.
</P>
<P>
"Experts fixed the satellite transmitting sets on the
red-crowned cranes, to watch their migration route, which included
their resting places, on the way to the sites where they pass the
winter, " said Ma Ming, an ornithologist of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The birds fly over the Himalaya Mountain from the warm and
humid Indian peninsula in spring, then, some of them settle and
breed in the Bayanbulak grasslands, and some continue their
journey to the Mongolian Plateau. They fly back along the same
route in Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Experts have found that the wet land ecological system in the
Bayanbulak grasslands and the Mongolian Plateau are the main
habitats and breeding places for the crane.
</P>
<P>
April to May is the cranes' reproduction period and after the
baby crane grows up, it leaves its parents to loiter around the
swamp, preparing for its own migration in the Autumn.
</P>
<P>
With the degradation of their living environment, the cranes
which used to only live in wet land ecological system, have
evolved to be able to sometimes live in grasslands forests. But
they never perch on the trees or live in places without lakes or
rivers.
</P>
<P>
When they migrate to the south in autumn, they try their best
to avoid passing across the Taklimakan Desert. They rest for a
short period in places between the Taklimakan river valleys and
the Bayanbulak grasslands, to prepare for the long-distance flight
ahead.
</P>
<P>
If they have a favorable wind, they will fly over the Himalaya
Mountains to arrive in the northern parts of the Indian peninsula to
pass the winter. The cranes migrate on this route year after year.
</P>
<P>
The red-crowned crane is a first category state-protected wild
animal. Seven of the 15 sub-species of the red-crowned crane in
the world are facing the danger of extinction, and the wet lands
in the Xinjiang is one of the most important habitats of the
bird.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Personnel Agent System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's personnel system will try
to meet the demand for talented people, especially those for state
enterprises and institutions, by promoting the agent system, in
the next year or two, according to sources at a seminar in the
capital of Shaanxi Province for officials in charge of personnel
service centers.
</P>
<P>
In the personnel agent system, organizations approved by the
government handle personnel for enterprises, institutions, and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
For enterprises, the organizations handle employment, personal
evaluations and records, positions, evaluations of those going
abroad, and training, arbitration, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
In the new system, which is better suited to the market
economy, individuals use the agent centers to look for employment
or re-employment.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, personnel service agencies registered
with government departments have been successful in helping
foreign-funded ventures, township and village enterprises,
collectively-run enterprises, and private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the method helps enterprises choose suitable
employees, and those with talents will enjoy better opportunities
to display their professional skills.

Beijing, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bai Fangli has sacrificed
thoughts of a comfortable retirement to help children from poor
families receive an education.
</P>
<P>
Despite his age - a sprightly 84 - Bai has used pedal power to
raise more than 150,000 yuan to meet the school fees of dozens of
children.
</P>
<P>
Tricycle rider Bai, living in Tianjin of North China, has been
using his income from his tricycle for 12 years in his quest to
help the young.
</P>
<P>
Bai started his drive when he found it was very difficult for
children from poor families to afford schooling.
</P>
<P>
The tricycle driver has, since then, given up his dream to lead
a comfortable retired life and continued his career, just to raise
money to finance poor students.
</P>
<P>
Bai has so far donated 150,000 yuan of his hard-earned income
to students.
</P>
<P>
In China, the average per-capita annual income stands at
around 4,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Now a national model for supporting education, the old man has
urged people to save money for educating the younger generation.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of General Zhang's Opium Burning 60 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, Augest 17 (Xinhua) -- A story of opium-burning that
took place in Shenyang, the capital city of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, more than sixty years ago, has been told again
by some newly discovered photographs.
</P>
<P>
In 1839, Lin Zexu, regarded as a national hero in China, burned
a shipment of opium of English merchants in Humen of Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Deliang, a professor of history and the
discoverer of the photographs, a similar event 66 years ago in
Shenyang is just as significant as that in Humen.
</P>
<P>
At that time, 240 packages with a total weight of 960 kilograms
were burned, the photographs show.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, the order to destroy them was given
by General Zhang Xueliang who once admonished Chiang Kai-shek with
a show of force and who is now living in the U.S. after having
spent half a century under house arrest in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The burning was done on June 16, 1930. The opium was described
as mostly having been shipped by the Japanese.

<HEADLINE> State Farms Fare Better on Household-Run Basis In Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Wang Jin used to work at a
State-owned farm, eating from the same "iron rice bowl" and never
dreaming of earning more money than his colleagues, but things
began to take a turn for the better in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In that year, Wang contracted to farm 2,000 mu of land, and he
went from making 1,000 yuan a year to today's 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of 200,000 farm workers who have built their own
farms with land rented from state-owned farms of the state Farm
Administration of Heilongjiang province in Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 104 state farms under the administration have
adopted the family-farm system of management.
</P>
<P>
The reform is meant to separate land-ownership from management,
and to help sluggish state farms that were set up in the 50s and
60s on the model of collective farms in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the state was responsible for production,
management, sales, and profit and loss, and workers got their
wages in accordance with technical standing, and they had little
enthusiasm for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, some of the state farms tried to open household-based
farms by lending out land and selling machines to the new
family-farm managers. This, in turn, encouraged farm workers and
increased grain production in the state-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
The practice has reinvigorated the old farms and has triggered
large-scale mechanization of farming, with family farms having
purchased over 30,000 large or medium-sized machines as well and
100,000 pieces of equipment and tools.
</P>
<P>
The reform also forced administrators of state farms to change,
and more than 50 percent of former administrative staff members
have been moved to technological service departments to help
family-farms.
</P>
<P>
Private farm owners now run 93 percent of the bureau's farmland
and have become the main grain producers. The administration's
grain production capacity has increased from three billion kg to
the present five billion kg.

<HEADLINE> PC Competition Turns Hot in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite fierce competition in
the Chinese personal computer market, domestic and foreign PC
suppliers are speeding up production in anticipation of new sales
records in China this year, the "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhengqing of the Ministry of Electronics Industry(MEI)
said that during the first six months of the year, Chinese
industry manufactured more than 512,000 PCs, an increase of 123.4
percent from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate for Chinese PC manufacturers stood at
approximately 90 percent during the same period, Chen, director of
MEI's information Center, said.
</P>
<P>
Chen acknowledged US-based Compaq aggressively competed for PC
market share in China this year.
</P>
<P>
"Last year Compaq was the top foreign PC supplier in China, and
this year it hopes to maintain its position." he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based Legend Group, a State-owned Chinese PC company,
is currently the largest supplier of Chinese-made PCs in the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Legend officials said during the first six months of the year,
their company sold 80,600 PCs, a 126 percent jump compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said legend's achievements are notable. It has already
entered the ranks of the top six PC suppliers, including both
domestic and foreign companies, in China.
</P>
<P>
Tsu Chiang Hsi, managing director of Compaq's Beijing office,
said he is confident Compaq will maintain its position as the top
foreign PC supplier in China this year, although he declined to
detail the US company's sales in China during the first six months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
But other sources say sales of Compaq PCs in china market still
account for a small percentage of its total global sales, valued
at four billion US dollars during the second quarter of this year,
up 14 percent from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"The year-one-year growth of the US computer company's sales
during the January-June period in China slowed down compared with
the same period last year, but during the latter half of the year,
the growth may regain its vitality," Hsi noted.
</P>
<P>
To compete with the downward trend of PC retail prices, Compaq
has followed a strategy adopted by many Chinese computer
companies-it cut its PC prices by 10 to 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Also, Compaq introduced a new model-Presario-to the Chinese
market. It expects the Presario, equipped with a Pentium chip and
Microsoft's and its own multi-media soft-ware, to boost sales this
year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the US company has introduced four kinds of PCs to the
Chinese market. They include a computer server, a portable
electronic notebook, and computers designed for family and
commercial purposes.

(GDP) and industrial output dropped 8.7 percent and 3.1 percent

cooperation in assisting Vietnam with its ASEAN activities.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported that Jayakumar arrived
here Friday on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He told his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Manh Cam, that
Singapore would assist Vietnam in organizing the sixth ASEAN
(Association of South-East Asian Nations) summit scheduled for
1998 in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam became an ASEAN member in July last year.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Nguyen, Jayakumar affirmed Singapore's
consistent policy of attaching great importance to the development
of cooperative relations with Vietnam, VNA said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed satisfaction over the rapid and smooth
development of friendly bilateral cooperation, especially in trade

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Confirms 8 East Timorese Entered French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Foreign Ministry
has confirmed reports that eight east Timorese entered the French
embassy compound here on Friday afternoon to seek asylum in
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Antara news agency today, Ghaffar
Fadyl, the ministry's director for overseas information, said
seven of the eight East Timorese were residents of East Timor's
capital of Dili and one was from the province's Baucau district.
</P>
<P>
Fadyl said the Indonesian government's stance on the case was
the same as on previous ones -- it would not lay anything in the
way of East Timorese wishing to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
But he refuted the East Timorese youths' claim that they were
being persecuted by Indonesian authorities. "That's only a
pretext, an excuse to get a free ticket to go overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese had timed their action to coincide with the
eve of celebrations of Indonesia's Independence day, August 17, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Friday's action marked the fourth time this year that East
Timorese youths entered the French embassy in Jakarta to seek
asylum. Up to Friday, 11 East Timorese had made the Australian,
New Zealand, Polish and French embassies their stepping stones for
a free trip to Portugal this year.
</P>
<P>
Since September 1995, a total of 75 East Timorese have sought
refuge in foreign missions before being flown to Portugal, Antara
said.

<HEADLINE> Good Buys In Housing In Shanghai, Experts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- It's a good time to buy a house
in Shanghai, as local real estate prices are the lowest they've
been in the past two years and the market is expected to rebound
in near future.
</P>
<P>
Prices in Shanghai's real estate market are stable in general,
moving downward slightly though, experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, of 15 major cities in the country,
Shanghai experienced the biggest price-plunge in the real estate
market, with office buildings and apartments built for overseas
buyers suffering the most, followed by villas.
</P>
<P>
Low-priced apartments built for local residents look stable and
have come down only slightly due to continued enthusiasm of local
buyers.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish sales of apartments intended for foreigners have
pushed the prices of these houses down, bringing them close to
prices of apartments intended for domestic clients.

<HEADLINE> Fernandez Assumes Presidency, Promises Clean-Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Leonel Fernandez Reyna, who was
sworn in today as the Dominican Republic's new president, promised
to lead a state reform committee with the central goal of fighting
corruption in public administration.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Santo Domingo, said Fernandez
announced his intentions in his inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to create more jobs, reform the tax system and
fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
Half the population, nearly 3.5 million people, live under the
poverty line in this Caribbean island country.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, 42, a lawyer, was the presidential candidate
nominated by the Dominican Liberation Party, the country's third
political force.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the alliance with the then governing Social-Christian
Reformist Party, Fernandez won the June 30 runoff, with a
difference of 2.5 percent over the presidential candidate of the
Dominican Revolutionary Party, Jose Pena Gomez, who had won more
votes in the first round of elections.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez succeeds 89-year-old Joaquin Balaguer.

<P>
TOKYO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan launched an Earth-observing
satellite today with its self-developed H-2 rocket, according to a
Kyodo news report.
</P>
<P>
The 50-meter, two-stage rocket blasted off this morning from
the Tanegashima Space Center on the Tanegashima Island, some 1,000
kilometers southwest of Tokyo, Kyodo quoted the National Space
Development Agency of Japan as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth blastoff of the H-2 rockets. Three H-2
rockets have been test-launched successfully since a maiden launch
in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
An advanced Earth-observing satellite, the largest satellite of
the country, was released 15 minutes after the blastoff.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is designed to monitor the global environment via
its eight sensors, five of which were developed by Japan, two by
the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and one by
the French National Space Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Data from the satellite will be processed in cooperation with
American researchers before being distributed for use to
scientists around the world.

<P>
The H-2 is Japan's first rocket made purely from domestic
technology.

<HEADLINE> Play Is Vital: International Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Playing is a vital pastime for
children growing, an international meeting on children stresses.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting which ended today in Espoo discussed
problems facing children in playing and recreation, and their
solutions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting drew experts from 20 countries and regions, and was
presided over jointly by the International Association for the
Child's Right to Play and the Finnish Association of Children
Protection.
</P>
<P>
Participants pointed out that playing, like nutrition and
education, was essential for children to keep healthy, both
physically and psychologically, in the process of growing up.
</P>
<P>
Playing could help children develop fully in morality,
intelligence and sporting ability.
</P>
<P>
However, opportunities for children's free enjoyment of playing
had been decreasing. It had now become a global problem and would
bring serious consequences for the next generation, the experts
warned.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that children's lives were more and more being
affected by the enlargement of cities, floating populations,
increasing traffic and changes to the environment. War and social
conflicts in some countries had resulted in negative effects on
them.
</P>
<P>
The experts also noted that television had diminished
children's abilities in taking part in various social activities.
This passive recreation prevented them from mingling with others
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Widely-enjoyed video games could effectively prompt
development of intelligence. But their drawback was their
simplicity which hold children back from their full potential for
development.
</P>
<P>
The conferees said children should play more outdoors and
within nature. This built strength and was better for them than
playing in confined playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
The participants stressed that playing was the children's
right, their every day "work".
</P>
<P>
They said make-believe and discovery play promote the
children's ability for cooperation with others, and was a natural
means of study and understanding.
</P>
<P>
If children did not have enough opportunities for play, they
were unlikely to become creative adults, able to fully fit into
the community.
</P>
<P>
The experts appealed to the governments of all countries to
take measures to improve children's playing conditions.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Threatens Air Ban on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
decided today that unless Sudan complies with an extradition
demand for three suspects in connection with an assassination
attempt on Egyptian president, it will impose an air ban on the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution which was adopted by 13 votes for and two
abstentions, the council also decided that it will, after 90 days,
decide on the date when the ban will come into force.
</P>
<P>
China and Russian were the abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Under the new resolution, countries will deny all Sudanese
aircraft permission to take off from, land in or overfly their
territories, once the council decides the air ban date.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council made the demand under resolutions
1044 and 1045 that Sudan should extradite to Ethiopia for
prosecution three suspects in connection with the assassination
attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on June 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded that Sudan should desist from engaging in
activities assisting, supporting and facilitating terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed diplomatic sanctions on Sudan on
April 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied all the charges against it. On several
occasions it indicated explicitly that it was against terrorism
and that the three suspects wanted by the Security Council were
not in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In an explanation speech before voting, the Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Qin Huasun, said
that China's position regarding sanctions was consistent.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions are not a panacea, because a sanction or
strengthening sanctions, instead of solving problems, can only
make things more complicated," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Kawasaki Steel Corp.'s

expected to be 2 billion yen (about 15 million U.S. dollars) lower
than initially projected, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported today.
</P>

The profit fall is partly due to the lower production of sheet
steel, the business daily said.

<P>
Pretax profit for the first half of the current business year
is likely to gain 30 percent from a year earlier to 8 billion yen
(about 60 million dollars) while sales are forecast to increase 2
percent to 450 billion yen (3.38 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Operating profit is projected to gain 12 percent to 19 billion
yen (142.59 million dollars), about 1 billion yen (7.5 million
dollars) lower than initially projected, it added.
</P>
<P>
For the full year ending next March, the pretax profit is
expected to reach 23 billion yen (172.6 million dollars) with
sales at an estimated 920 billion yen (133.25 billion dollars),

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Becomes Largest Importer of Taiwan Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province was China's
largest absorber of Taiwan investment in the first seven months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Taiwan made up 20 percent of the total overseas
investment used by the South China province, next only to Hong
Kong investment, said Chen Guoxing, an official from the
Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the number of Taiwan-invested enterprises
had risen to 7,800, which attracted 5 billion US dollars in
investment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Taiwan-invested enterprises are located in the
economically-developed Pearl River Delta, including Shenzhen,
Dongguan, Huizhou, Foshan cities. More than 90 percent of the
firms are profitable.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises have shifted from experimental practice to
permanent operations, with many prolonging the terms of
contracts. Their business scope has expanded from agriculture, new
technology to service trades, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 firms have each attracted 10 million US dollar-worth
of Taiwan investment.
</P>
<P>
Many cities in Guangdong have worked out preferential policies
for Taiwan-funded enterprises and enhanced crack-downs on
infringements of Taiwan investment.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,700 enterprises in the province have joined the
association for Taiwan-invested firms, making up half of the
membership in China.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Intend to Rely on Spouses after Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Instead of depending on their
children to help them in retirement as in the past, an increasing
number of Shanghai adults say they intend to live out their lives
in retirement with the help of their spouses, a recent survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
In answer to the question, "When you can no longer take care of
yourself, what way you will choose to live out your life in
retirement?" 43 percent of those surveyed, all middle-aged at
present, said that they want to rely on their spouses, and 19.67
percent said they will go to homes for the elderly. Those who want
to rely on their children account for 15.29 percent, and 15.17
percent want to get help from housekeepers with the aid of spouses
and children.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is a city facing the problem of an aging
population. The number of people above the age of 60 has reached
2.3 million, or 17.4 percent of its total population.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2030, the number will be 4.83 million, or there is
one old person among every three.
</P>
<P>
Out of the adults surveyed, 90.83 percent have savings accounts
and live a better life than their parents did.
</P>
<P>
While most of them want to live out their lives with their
spouses, 74.5 percent of them also agree with the idea of old-age
insurance. Those who disagree with the plan take up only 2.83
percent.

<HEADLINE> ROK Professor Promotes Cultural Exchange with Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Professor Shin Keun-ho from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) has realized his dream -- setting up a
research institute on Tibetan culture and art.
</P>
<P>
The institute was sponsored by the Tibet University and the
Chinese Tibetan Culture Research Institution in Taegu City of
ROK.
</P>
<P>
The institute will develop the collection, protection and
research on traditional Tibetan arts. It will also conduct
research on the differences and similarities between Tibetan and
Korean culture in the fields of ancient cultural activities,
recreational hobbies, folk customs, language, and education.
</P>
<P>
Shin, 53, said that he was excited to have been invited by the
Tibet University as a foreign professor to work in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"Many foreign scholars and experts dream to have such a
precious chance. I'm the lucky bird," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shin works for the Yeungnam Junior College as a professor,
teaching applied arts and researching fine arts and sculpture. He
is interested in the art of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
"A visit to Tibet has long been my wish since I was a child,"
said Shin, adding that his wish became a strong desire when he
started art research.
</P>
<P>
"I had been to Nepal four times, but I couldn't go into Tibet
because China and ROC hadn't established diplomatic relations at
the time," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"With tears in my eyes, I sighted at the Himalaya Mountains in
front of me. How nice it would be if I could pass over it to
Tibet, the paradise in my dream." Shin said.
</P>
<P>
My dream did not come true until China and ROK established
diplomatic relations in 1992, he said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
I'm glad to see that exchange and co-operation between the
governments and peoples of ROK and China have experienced a
prosperous era in recent years, Shin told Xinhua.

<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of towns in China
stands close to 17,000 now, 780 more than this time last year,
according to an official from the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The number of extra-large cities, with an urban population of
over one million, remains about the same. However, two large- and
fifteen medium-sized cities have emerged, with urban populations
of over 500,000 and 200,000, respectively for the two categories.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the population growth rate was 4.19 percent for the
towns, compared with 2.32 percent for the extra-large cities, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
The average urbanization rate in China was 22.74 percent last
year, with Liaoning Province, in Northeast China, leading the
nation at 43.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
Now, the average urbanization rate of inland areas including
Anhui, Henan, Hebei and Jiangxi, and western regions covering
Ningxia, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, is higher than that of the
country as a whole, said the official.
</P>
<P>
This indicates a faster pace of development in the middle and
western regions of China, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I came to Lhasa at the beginning of last year. Seeing the
peaceful and happy life that Tibetan people today enjoy, all my
discomfort caused by high-altitude disappeared," Shin said.
</P>
<P>
Shin has forged a friendly relationship with the Tibet
University, and begun to learn more about the social and economic
development in Tibet through his research of Buddhism paintings in
the university.
</P>
<P>
"People in ROK don't have enough information about Tibet. Some
even believe the rumors from a few Western countries. As an honest
person, I want to tell my folks at home the true happenings and
facts in Tibet today," Shin said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ROK-China Tibetan Culture Institute was set up
in 1995, thanks to the efforts by Shin and those interested in the
development of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To support cultural and educational development in Tibet, the
institute has donated 30 computers to the Tibet University.
</P>
<P>
Also, the institute will carry out a series of exchange and
co-operation projects, including mountain-climbing, art
exhibition, dancing performances and language training.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ROK and Tibet will send groups of students and
scholars on goodwill visits to both sides, with arrangement of the
institute.
</P>
<P>
Professor Shin plans to spend his four-month vacation in the
university every year. He will also work to help Lhasa and
Kyongju, a well-known cultural city in ROK, become "sister cities"
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be a bridge for the exchange and co-operation with
Tibet -- for the rest of my life," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- All commercial banks in Zambia
now have enough stocks of foreign exchange and are failing to
sell it to the public, which forces the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) to
intervene and buy some of it.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Director of Economics at the BOZ Felix
Kani on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kani said that this situation of foreign exchange has further
strengthened the country's reserve to finance most of its imports
and services despite the reduced amount of donors funds.
</P>
<P>
The central bank official took Barclays bank of Zambia as an
example which, among other banks, has submitted a report to BOZ
indicating that there are more sellers of foreign exchange on the
market than there are buyers.
</P>
<P>
The liberalized economy has helped the country become less
susceptible to fluctuations in donor funds, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If it were not for the liberalized economy we would have
experienced a lot of problems in the foreign exchange market,"
Kani said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Premier Leaves for Egypt on Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 17 (Xinhua)-- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah left for Egypt
today on a Middle East tour which will also take him to Syria and
Lebanon to cement Kuwait's ties with Arab allies.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was accompanied by a high-ranking
delegation of ministers and officials.
</P>
<P>
During the tour starting with a two-day visit in Egypt, the
premier will hold talks with President Hosni Mubarak on a number
of issues ranging from the Middle East peace process to the
already-strong bilateral relations and will also hold talks with
the Syrian and Lebanon leaders on similar issues, Kuwaiti
information Ministry said before he left.
</P>
<P>
His tour is aimed at underlining Kuwait's commitment to the
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The tour comes in light of the latest developments in the
Middle East and within the framework of continuous visits and
consultations among Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Sheikh Saad will underline Kuwait's keenness
to promote its Arab relations, especially with countries that
sided with Kuwait and supported its sovereignty and independence
during the the Gulf crisis (from August 1990 to February 1991).
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit by the Prime Minister to Egypt since
the Arab summit held in Cairo in June. He will convey a message
from Kuwait Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah to President
Mubarak dealing with the latest developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Egypt, the prime minister is expected to
sign agreements on economic, cultural and scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the Gulf War in 1991, Sheikh Saad paid a number of
official visits to Arab countries. In 1992 he paid two visits to
Saudi Arabia where he met King Fahd. In 1993, he visited Bahrain
and in 1994, he paid a short visit to Syria and during the same
year he toured Saudi Arabia again.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, he visited Morocco and Tunisia, where he
discussed with their senior officials a number of issues related
to strengthening bilateral relations in all domains.
</P>
<P>
After he participated in the Arab summit in June this year, he
visited Saudi Arabia for the fourth time in less than six years
for more consultations and coordinations.

KATHMANDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's improved capability in
international negotiations and India's vast demands for hydropower
have resulted in an equal bilateral treaty on the development of a
border river, Nepali Water Resources Minister Pashupati Rana said.
</P>
<P>
"After years of unequal treaties (with India), we (Nepal) have
finally signed a truly equal treaty," Rana said here Friday at a
workshop on Nepal's water resources development strategy.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali Treaty, signed earlier this year by the prime
ministers of the two countries in New Delhi, provides framework
arrangements of cost and benefit sharing on future water projects
on the Mahakali river along the Nepal's western border on an
equitable basis, Nepali officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Rana, the treaty has established principles of
equal water sharing between Nepal and India which Nepal had
struggled for over three decades.
</P>
<P>
India's northern region will face a power deficit of at least
21,000 megawatts by the year 2010, providing a viable power market
for Nepal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali minister said the abundant water resource, with a
potential of 83,000 megawatts, is Nepal's only strategic resource
through which the country could double its per capita income,
which stands at less than 180 US dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
There has been strong opposition to the Nepal-India treaty
these days in Nepal, as different social groups including
political parties held meetings and rallies denouncing the treaty
as unequal.
</P>
<P>
The government has submitted the treaty to parliament for
ratification during the on-going session.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML)
said it is now studying details of the treaty and will make its
decision over the treaty as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari has said his party will
not allow the treaty to be ratified during the current session.
</P>
<P>
Without support from the main opposition, which now holds 88
seats in the 205-member lower house of parliament, the Mahakali
treaty is unlikely to be passed as it needs a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said if the treaty could not be
ratified by parliament, the coalition government led by Sher
Bahadur Deuba might have to resign on moral grounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange market were traded mixed this week with
investors continuing to concentrate on the second board and small
capitalized stocks on speculative play.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index (CI) stayed above the 1,100-level for most
of the week to form a solid support for a rally which some
analysts expected to start in September.
</P>
<P>
Many interim results announced so far pointed to an encouraging
trend on the back of the country's economic strength, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of active participation from fund managers dragged the CI
3.11 points lower this week to 1,102.09.
</P>
<P>
The all main board share Emas Index increased 0.51 of a point
to 317.40, the Industrial Index perked 1.70 points to 2,095.68 and
the second board index surged 14.21 points to 488.12.

U.S. dollars) from 475.399 million shares valued at 3.316 billion
ringgit (about 1.326 billion U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
However, the second board turnover increased to 274.010 million
shares worth 2.762 billion ringgit (about 1.105 billion U.S.
dollars) from last week's 244.365 million shares valued at 2.387
billion ringgit (about 954.8 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's tin, crude palm
oil (CPO) and rubber markets ended the week mixed with tin and
rubber prices lower and CPO price higher.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin market (KLTM) drifted further to close
easier this week in brisk trading following the bearish London
Metal Exchange (LME) throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
Tin finished the week lower at 15.00 ringgit (about six U.S.
dollars) per kg against 15.06 ringgit (about 6.024 U.S. dollars)
last week.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover broadened to 510 tons from 444 tons last
week, with European, Japanese and local buyers accounting for the
bulk of the transactions the whole week.
</P>
<P>
The price differential of the KLTM and the LME broadened at a
premium of 45 U.S. dollars per ton against 25 U.S. dollars
previously.
</P>
<P>
But, CPO physicals closed higher this week on news that India
is cutting palm oil import duty and would increase imports.
</P>
<P>
India state trading corporation tendered for 6,000 tons of
refined, bleached deodorized (RBD) palm olein for September 5-20
shipment, 6,000 tons of RBD palm olein for September 1-20 shipment
and another 6,000 tons for the first half of September shipment.
But until Friday, India only bought 6,000 tons of RBD palm olein
for the September 5-20 and September 1-20 shipment respectively.
</P>
<P>
Besides that, Pakistan also bought 9,000 tons of RBD palm olein
for September shipment.
</P>
<P>
The palm oil registration and licensing authority said palm oil
stocks shed 2.49 percent to 754.634 tons from 773.920 tons in
June, while production perked by 0.05 percent to 721.893 tons

dollars) per tons from 1,110 ringgit (about 444 U.S. dollars) per
tons last week.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, it continued a bearish week and
closed lower on lack of fresh leads coupled with a lack of
direction in the market.
</P>
<P>
September RSS One dropped three sen to 321.5 sen (about 128.6
U.S. cents) per kg compared with 324.5 sen (about 129.8 U.S.

(about 121 U.S. cents) per kg against 303.5 sen (about 121.4 U.S.
cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather in major plantation areas, however, did not help to
boost the market as players were said to have adequate stocks.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Balance of Payments Posts Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments from January to July this year posted a surplus of 3
billion U.S. dollars, compared with 975 million dollars registered
during the same period of 1995, a central bank official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Amando Tetangco, the managing director for research of the
Philippine central bank, told reporter that the increase in the
balance of payments surplus is due to the higher inflow of foreign
investment and overseas workers' remittances.
</P>
<P>
The trend of high foreign capital inflows during the first half
of this year continued through July, he said.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments, the sum of the current account balance
and the financial account balance, is an important economic
indicator since it allows the government to determine whether or
not the country is living within its income from trading and
investment.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, Tetangco said, the country's
merchandise trade deficit stood at 5.98 billion dollars, up by
30.3 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
But remittances of overseas workers in the first seven months
amounted to 3.5 billion dollars, a 57.3 percent increase compared
with the level for the corresponding period of 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that net foreign investment in the country expanded by
180.2 percent to 1.6 billion dollars during the seven months.
</P>
<P>
For the full year of 1996, the country's balance of payments
surplus is targeted at 2.397 billion dollars, as compared with the
645 million dollars achieved at the end of 1995.

markets in the Indian Ocean and the African region.

<HEADLINE> Ieng Sary Appeals for Cambodia's National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Ieng Sary, a Khmer Rouge split
faction leader, called for national unity and urged Cambodian
political groups to forget the past in a statement released Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his first public statement since reports last week of a
split in the Khmer Rouge leadership, Ieng Sary urged King Norodom
Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge, the government and other political
forces to work toward national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The statement was read by Sok Pheap, a military chief of the
Khmer Rouge split faction, to reporters at the faction's Phnom
Malai base, northwest Cambodia, near the Cambodian-Thai border.
</P>
<P>
The statement, dated August 15, was released after Cambodia's
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen promised to protect the Ieng Sary
faction.
</P>
<P>
Sok Pheap told reporters in the mountainous district of Phnom
Malai that his faction was ready to join the government but wanted
to retain control of the areas they held including Phnom Malai and
Pailin.
</P>
<P>
"We will set up a political party to contest the national
election in 1998, and afterwards we will fully and officially open
our areas," Sok Pheap said, adding that representatives of the
faction were still negotiating with the Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
Sok Pheap said Ieng Sary was still in "a liberated zone" in
Pailin.

NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 of the 3,356
children suffering malnutrition in Amravati district of
Maharashtra state in southwestern India may have died in the past
two months because of malnutrition, The Hindustan Times said
today.
</P>
<P>
The official toll has been put at 212. But the newspaper,
quoting opposition Congress of the state assembly leader Madhukar
Pichad, said the toll was much higher and could be above 500.
</P>
<P>
The areas include 157 remote and usually inaccessible villages
in the state and the worst-affected areas are Chikaldhara and
Dharni. The villagers are so poor that they are unable to earn
enough money to buy foodstuffs for themselves, the paper said.
