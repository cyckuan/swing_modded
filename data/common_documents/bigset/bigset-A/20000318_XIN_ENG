<HEADLINE> Chretien's Campaigning Speech Cheered by Youth Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien were applauded Thursday when he declared his campaigning
intention to 400 youth delegates attending the Liberal Party's
weekend convention.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of work to do and I intend to do it for
the next four years," said the 66-year-old prime minister, who was
greeted with an enthusiastic chant of "four more years".
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the Liberals are able to repair the
damages done to the Canadian economy by the previous Conservative
government including spending cuts and belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
"For the first two mandates I had, it was not that exciting to
get out of the mess," he said, adding that "now the sunshine has
come back in Canada" to ensure "the most exciting campaign we have
seen in years."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to make efforts to make Canada a country which cares
for its poor people and fits for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said he would stay in office till the next election
scheduled for May 2001. Dissident members of parliament have
called for Chretien's step-down and Finance Minister Paul Martin's
leading of the party into the next election.
</P>
<P>
Chretien made the speech on the eve of the party's policy
convention to be attended by 2,000 delegates, who will hear a
keynote address by Chretien Friday night.

toward Iran.
</P>

purchase and import carpets and food products such as dried fruits,
nuts and caviar from Iran," Albright said in the prepared text of

<HEADLINE> SOCOG to Release Super Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympics organizers
announced on Friday that 200,000 "super tickets" would go on sale
towards the end of the staged ticket release.
</P>
<P>
The super tickets is a part of the 3.1 million Games tickets
set to go on general sale next month, according to SOCOG deputy
chief executive Michael Eyers.
</P>
<P>
He denied the category A super tickets were a revamped version
of the premium packages but said the increased revenue would help
SOCOG produce a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
Eyers said the tickets pricing are yet to be decided but he
predicted the cost for super tickets would be at least 10 percent
higher than the listed price.
</P>
<P>
Those events include athletics and basketball, but swimming,
diving, rhythmic gymnastics or track cycling were excluded from
the offer.
</P>
<P>
After a final audit of seats available in all venues, SOCOG
will release 2.4 million tickets, including almost 700,000 Olympic
opportunity tickets, for events in New South Wales state. A
further 700,000 tickets are available for interstate soccer venues.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG received heavy criticism late last year when details of
secret premium ticket sales were revealed to the general public,
who could only acquire seats by entering an Olympic ticket ballot
at that stage.
</P>
<P>
Eyers promised all tickets would be sold on a "first-come first-
served basis," initially through a telephone call center, via the
internet or by mail order. The remaining tickets will be sold
through the box office starting July.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams U.S. Overture as Intervention Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday slammed the latest
U.S. overture for reopening the long-frozen relations as an attempt
by Washington to intervene in Iran's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Hassan
Rowhani told the state television the speech made by the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was "another step by the U.S.
to interfere in Iran's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Rowhani acknowledged the speech contained "some
positive points," but said they are not so important as to pull
down the "wall of distrust" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the "wall of distrust" has been solidified by
the recent U.S. moves, such as the extension of sanctions on Iran,
the U.S. Congress' bill to threaten companies cooperating with
Iran, said Rowhani, also vice speaker of the outgoing Majlis
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said Albright's repeating of the U.S. accusations against
Iran, particularly the charge against the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps and Intelligence Ministry was "a clear interference in
Iranian affairs."
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the American-Iranian Council, Albright
announced the lift of a ban on U.S. imports of Iranian luxury goods
and invited Tehran to enter a "new relationship" with Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ease of sanctions came after Iranian reformists, who
support better ties with the U.S., took over the country's powerful
parliament from the conservatives in last month's elections.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Friday
welcomed the U.S. move as "positive," saying Iran would respond by
allowing imports of grains and medicine from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright in her speech renewed Washington's concern on
Iran's stance on key issues of weapons of mass destruction,
terrorism and the Middle Ease peace process. The political
developments in Iran have not caused the IRGC or the Intelligence
Ministry to get out of the terrorism business, she claimed.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks angered the powerful IRGC, an elite legion
that has its own ground, air and naval forces, parallel to those of
the Iranian army.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC issued a statement blasting the U.S. overture and
calling on Iranian people and political parties to strengthen
solidarity to confront the U.S. conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Albright's calculated remarks about Iran and its revolutionary
bodies indicated an intensified conspiracy of the White House to
stir up waves of crises in Iran, the statement was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The IRGC reserves its right to give appropriate reply to the
conspiracy on time," it added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Albright's admittance of U.S. involvement in the
1953 coup in Iran and other plots, the IRGC stressed the U.S.
should compensate for its deeds that "exposed Iranian people to the
tyranny."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Visit Mosque in Greek Cypriot Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot pilgrims from
north of island Saturday visited the Hala Sultan Mosque in Larnaca,
at the southern coast of government-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The 1,450 pilgrims came to the mosque to pray for the Muslim
holiday, the Feast of Sacrifice, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims crossed Ledra Palace's check-point in the buffer
zone, central Nicosia, in the morning and transferred by 28 buses
to Larnaca, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's visit by Turkish Cypriots is one of several such
events that are being organized in the past year or so.
</P>
<P>
On the Greek Orthodox Easter, in early May, Greek Cypriots are
scheduled to visit the monastery of Saint Andreas in the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled northern area, on the most eastern tip of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when troops
from Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island
in reaction to a failed coup engineered by the junta then ruling
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Revolutionary Guards Slam U.S. Overture As Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's powerful Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Saturday slammed the latest U.
S. overture for reopening the long-frozen relations as an attempt
by Washington to intervene in Iranian domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC said in a statement that the speech made by the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday was flagrant
interference in Iran's internal affairs, especially that part in
which she maliciously voiced protest to the IRGC.
</P>
<P>
At the American-Iranian Council, Albright announced the lifting
of sanctions on non-oil products, such as carpets, pistachios and
caviar and invited Tehran to enter a "new relationship" with
Washington. But the ban on all oil products remain intact.
</P>
<P>
Imports of those products to the United States were banned in
1987, seven years after diplomatic relations between the two
countries were severed when the U.S. embassy was seized and some U.
S. diplomats taken hostage in the Islamic revolution in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ease of sanctions on Iran came after Iranian
reformists, who support better ties with the U.S., took over the
country's powerful parliament from the conservatives in last
month's elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright also renewed Washington's concern on Iran's
stance on key issues of the weapons of mass destruction, terrorism
and the Middle East peace process. The political developments in
Iran have not caused the IRGC or the Intelligence Ministry to get
out of the terrorism business, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks angered the powerful IRGC that has its
independent ground, air and naval forces to safeguard Iran's
Islamic revolution, which toppled the former pro-U.S. shah regime.
</P>
<P>
The calculated remarks made by Albright about the Islamic
Republic of Iran and the revolutionary bodies indicated an
intensified conspiracy of the White House to stir up waves of
crises in Iran, the IRGC statement was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
It added "the IRGC reserves its right to give appropriate reply
to the conspiracy on time."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. official accuses the revolutionary bodies in Iran of
terrorism at a time when the U.S. military force are busy
interfering in the Persian Gulf and the other regional countries
and creating crises," it said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Albright's admittance of the U.S. involvement in
the Iranian coup in 1953 and other events, the IRGC stressed that
the U.S. should compensate the Iranian people for the tyranny they
have been exposed to in the past.
</P>
<P>
It also called on Iranian people and political parties to
exercise solidarity to confront the U.S. conspiracy against the
revolutionary organizations in Iran.

<HEADLINE> 2 Arrested for Shot Threat Against Iranian Reformist: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali
Yunesi said on Saturday that two of those who had threatened to
shoot Iranian reformist Saeed Hajjarian have been identified and
arrested by his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi said that Hajjarian had been on the hit-list of the
military opposition Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) since March
1999 and threatened by certain domestic extremists too.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention the identities of the two arrested
for threatening Hajjarian and whether they are linked with the MKO
or domestic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Yunesi said that
with lapse of time, security and intelligence officials get closer
to the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of Tehran Municipal Council and a
close ally to moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was shot and
seriously wounded by two gunmen on a motorbike in downtown Tehran
on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The prominent reformist and former deputy intelligence minister
is still in a coma and doctors are trying to save his life.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that 20 special intelligence operations have
been launched on the basis of reports of the public and some
invaluable clues have been found.
</P>
<P>
He said that the possibility of internal origins of the MKO
threats and foreigners' intervention are studied concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council had offered measures to protect
Hajjarian, which was rejected by the council member, he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Greek Students to Conduct Cultural Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Greek students will
meet in Ankara on April 22 within the framework of cultural
exchange, a step designed to consolidate the detente in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The students, 22 from Turkey and the same number from Greece,
are to attend the "From Common Culture to Culture of Peace" event,
organized in response to a U.N. declaration that regards 2000 as
the "Year of Culture of Peace."
</P>
<P>
The students will discuss common music, lyrics, games,
architecture, cultural dimension of language and EU-Turkey-Greece
relations.
</P>
<P>
They will then go to Athens on May 15 to seek ways of turning
the common culture into "culture of peace."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over the Cyprus problem
and the Aegean Sea. Relations improved after Greece rushed to aid
Turkey when the neighbor was hit by a killer earthquake in August
last year. Turkey reciprocated Greece's aid weeks later when a
tremor shook Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cem Tuzuner, the Turkish Public Relations Official in charge of
this project, said that their aim was to contribute to efforts to
change the existing common cultural values of Turkey and Greece
into common culture of peace.
</P>
<P>
"People of other countries have the prejudice that there was a
failure in solution of problems between Turkey and Greece. This
activity will try to remove this prejudice," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that "achieving our goal necessitates a new
structure based on mutual respect and understanding instead of
nationalist propaganda."
</P>
<P>
As the youth who see a different and promising future, the
students want to focus on common values of the Turkish and Greek
peoples, discuss and change the settled nationalist culture which
always underlines the problems between the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Academicians, journalists, and non-governmental organizations of
Turkey and Greece would attend the activity as observers.

<HEADLINE> Polisario Front Urges France to Help Solve W. Sahara Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Polisario Front of West Sahara
Saturday urged France to help solve the conflict in that desert
region of northwest Africa between it and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The Polisario Front made the appeal from Algiers, where its
headquarters are based, on the eve of a state visit to France by
Moroccan King Mohammed VI.
</P>
<P>
``We launch an appeal to France so that it works for peace in
West Sahara on the basis of application, in the shortest time, of
the peace plan of the United Nations and the Organization for
African Unity(OAU) aimed at organizing a referendum of self-
determination,'' Agence France-Presse quoted Polisario's ``foreign
minister,'' Mohamed Salem Ould Salek, as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said that France, as a friendly country of Morocco's, has
the moral and historical responsibility to help the young king of
Morocco to go out of the impasse in West Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Morocco and Polisario have been disputing since 1975 over the
sovereignty of West Sahara, a former Spanish colony of 260,000
square kilometers, most of them desert.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying to organize a self-
determination referendum in the region since 1992, but has failed
so far because of differences with Morocco over the number of
voters.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has recognized 86,381 people as eligible voters in a
referendum, while Morocco says 140,000 more people living in that
area should be entitled to vote.

DAR ES SALAAM -- The government of Rwanda will soon carry out a
census to establish the actual number of people murdered in the
1994 genocide, Tanzanian media reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government is set to conduct a countrywide census which
will give the public the actual figure of genocide victims,
Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania Zephyr Mutanguha told the Guardian
newspaper in Dar es Salaam on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he did not disclose the time to conduct the census.
</P>
<P>
The much publicized figure of people killed was solely based on
reports by the western media and the relief agencies present in
Rwanda at that time, so it is easy for one to double the death
toll at certain spots, he said. (Rwanda-Genocide-Census

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia will pull surplus federal
units out of the breakaway republic of Chechnya after the large-
scale military operation ends there, said acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Chechen extremists have been defeated. However, "a
lot of animals under the name of commander Salman Raduyev are
running around. They can gather into packs and attack," Putin told
the Mayak radio station.
</P>
<P>
"We will cut off the mountainous part of Chechnya where rebels
still feel comfortable," he said. "Military and special operations
will be conducted there to finish them off," he added.
</P>
<P>
"All spheres of life will be brought back to normal and legal
authorities will be restored in the liberated territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our choice is to finish off the rebels or to leave," he said,
calling the 1996 withdrawal from Chechnya "a large-scale mistake."
</P>
<P>
A pullout of Russian forces "will not happen again," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must take care of people's interests. If we leave again,
militants will consolidate again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's territorial integrity and constitutional principles
should be strengthened not only in Chechnya, "but also in the
entire territory," he said.

"The (Clinton's) visit is not simply (about) what the U.S. can

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Students Demonstrate Against Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 Kenyan students
demonstrated in the Kenyan capital Nairobi Saturday to demand a
total ban from the international community on ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
They chanted the slogans like "say no to ivory trade" and
"ivory kills", handing out leaflets to passers-by in the two-hour
parade from Kenya's National Museum to Kenyan International
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, member nations of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) relaxed the ban on ivory trade
imposed in 1989 to allow "one-off" sales by Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"The partially lifting of the ban has triggered off the roaring
of poaching in Kenya, where 45 elephants were killed in 1998 and
67 in 1999," said Paula Kahumb, scientific advisor to the Kenya
Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana have been lobbying
for permission to sell off part of their ivory stockpiles and
playing down a resurgence in poaching.
</P>
<P>
A CITES conference is scheduled to take place here in April, at
which the member countries will vote on whether to grant the four
southern African nations permission to sell more ivory.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Parliamentary Leader on Sino-Mongolian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Mongolian
Great Hural Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj said Saturday the friendly
good-neighborly relations and cooperation between Mongolia and
China will enjoy comprehensive development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese journalists on the eve of his
upcoming Chinese visit, Gonchigdorj stressed one of Mongolia's
principal diplomatic policies is to steadily develop the long-term
friendly relations and mutual-beneficial cooperation with its
great southern neighbor China in accordance with generally-
accepted international guidelines and principles.
</P>
<P>
After the two countries established diplomatic ties 50 years
ago, especially during the past 10 years, the overall relations
between Mongolia and China have become more opening, broader and
freer, said the parliamentary leader.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile expressed his confidence over the prospect of the
Sino-Mongolian ties, saying the two countries will vigorously
expand cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, trade,
culture, education, public health as well as science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
As to the Taiwan issue, Gonchigdorj reaffirmed Mongolia's stand
that the People's Republic of China is the legitimate government
of China and Taiwan is part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia supports China's policies of "one country, two systems
" and "peaceful reunification", while opposing the independence of
Taiwan, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Statement on Taiwan Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The election of a new leader in
Taiwan can not change the fact that Taiwan is part of Chinese
territory, according to a Chinese government statement issued here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of
Chinese territory, says the statement released by the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The "One China" principle is the prerequisite for peaceful
reunification. "Taiwan independence" in whatever form will never
be allowed, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
"We should listen to what the new leader in Taiwan says and
watch what he does. We will observe where he will lead cross-
Straits relations."
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to exchange views on cross-Straits relations
and peaceful reunification with all parties, organizations, and
personages in Taiwan who favor the "One China" principle. We
appeal to Taiwan compatriots to combine their efforts with ours to
safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
motherland, protect the fundamental interests of the Chinese
nation, and realize the complete reunification of the motherland,"
concludes the statement.

CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- World-renowned architect Ahmet Vefik Alp has designed
a 60-kilometer causeway to link Anamur, on the Turkey's southern
coast, with Girne (Kyrnea) in northern Cyprus, according to report
of Hurriyet (Freedom) earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the travel time between the two points will be
reduced to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Under the project two 15-kilometer pontoon bridges would be
built, one at the Anamur end and the other at the Girne end of the
causeway. A steel "tube", which is set to join the these two
pontoon bridges, will lie in the water 30 meters below the surface.
</P>
<P>
Alp, a Prime Ministry adviser, said suggested that the project
be implemented jointly by Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The first step is being taken for Professor Ahmet
Vefik Alp's "Trans-Marmara Floating Viaduct" project to link
Istanbul's Avcilar District with Tuzla, according to a report of
Milliyet (National) earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The 33-kilometer causeway bridge between Istanbul's Asian and
European sides will ease the congested traffic of the Turkey's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to secure financing, Alp left for the United States
on March 15 to have talks with seven companies interested in the
project, six of them American and the seventh Japanese.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government has decided to raise by 20
percent the prices of fuel sold to foreign commercial airlines and
vessels to offset the costs to the state budget by soaring oil
prices, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new price hike is expected to earn an extra 3 million
Jordanian dinars (4.2 million U.S. dollars) for the state treasury,
but barely covers 5 percent of an estimated overall increase of 60
million dinars (84 million dollars) incurred on the kingdom by
skyrocketing rising oil prices in the international market, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new decision, jet fuel went up from 120 fils (0.168
dollars) to 150 fils (0.210 dollars) per liter, and diesel prices
for ships up from 135 fils (0.189 dollars) to 170 fils (0.238
dollars) per liter.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government has closed down 20 non-
licensed head hunting agencies across the kingdom as part of part
of its efforts to streamline the labor markets, the semiofficial
Jordan TimeS reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The measure was taken after the government received complaints
from thousands of Jordanian professionals that they had been conned
by labor offices both in and outside the kingdom, that granted them
phoney contracts in the Gulf States in return for a commission up
to hundreds of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Alpha Bank here achieved a pre-tax profit of 4.58
million Cyprus pounds (about 7.78 million U.S. dollars) in 1999, 77
percent up on 1998, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which belongs to the Greek-based Alpha Credit Bank
Group, began operation in Cyprus in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since then, customer deposits have increased by 237 million
pounds (403 million dollars), or 82 percent, reaching 525 million
pounds (893 million dollars). Customer loans rose 96 million pounds
(163 million dollars), or 43 percent, to 318 million pounds (540
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Alpha chairman Michalis Kolokasides Wednesday said that the
bank's strategy for 2000 would focus on taking advantage of
upcoming opportunities in the development of the stock market, the
liberalization of the Cyprus economy and the continuing role of
Cyprus as a major services center.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hoopster Likely to Join NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Hu Weidong may become the first
Chinese basketball player to join NBA after Orlando Magic formally
invited the forward to boost their chances into the play-off.
</P>
<P>
The Magic general manager John Gabriel has sent a formal
invitation to the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), making an
offer of 17,757 U.S. dollars for his ten-day service, CBA
president Xin Lancheng was quoted as saying by Chinese newspaper
Sports Daily on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Magic hoped that Hu could join them from March 21-31, Xin said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not object to it as long as his NBA journey does not
affect the intensive pre-Olympics training," Xin added.
</P>
<P>
Hu has been included in a 14-man list of the men's national
side for the training camp, which will open on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The Magic side promised to make an arrangement which are
acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We know he is the backbone of the national side, so we will
allow him back home in April," Gabriel wrote in the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Hu is not the only Chinese hoopster who is on the verge of
becoming an NBA player.
</P>
<P>
Last June Chinese center Wang Zhizhi was picked 36th in the
second round of the NBA draft by Dallas Mavericks, becoming the
first Asian player in history ever to be drafted by an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
But Wang's transfer was finally aborted after his club Bayi
Rockets refused to release their only top center.
</P>
<P>
Hu, standing 1.98 meters tall, is known for his sharp shooting
and ball-controlling ability.
</P>
<P>
The Magic, currently placed eighth in the Eastern Conference,
are fighting for a play-off spot.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Muslim rebels killed 19
people in recent attacks in rural areas, local newspapers reported
on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the killing of one pro-government
militiaman and 18 civilians including six children were carried out
by Armed
Islamic Group (GIA) rebels, blamed by the government for most of
the massacres of thousands of civilians in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The GIA and another radical group, the Da'wa wal Djihad
(Appeal and Struggle), rejected a government amnesty and
continued their rebellion when two moderate groups, the Islamic
Salvation Army and the Islamic League for Appeal and Struggle,
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
The six-month amnesty which expired on January 13 was the
key plank of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's peace plan, aimed
at ending eight years of violence in which about 100,000
people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been racked by violence since early 1992, when
the authorities cancelled a general election.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 Somali intellectuals
met in Djibouti on Saturday to prepare for the forthcoming
reconciliation conference for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The intellectuals, who were summoned from both inside and
outside Somalia, are preparing a preliminary program of discussion
for the conference, according to sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The program will cover the agenda of the reconciliation
conference, the best possible government for Somalia and how the
power sharing system for Somalia would be like and then all these
will be forwarded before the conference to be opened on April 20,
this year, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the ten-day meeting, the intellectuals will also prepare
the participation criteria of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The intellectuals, who were earlier received in the Djibouti
hotel, moved into Sheraton hotel on Thursday where they were
offered computers with Internet access, e-mails and all other
possible means of communication for the facilitation of their
research and endeavors for the forthcoming meeting for Somalia.
</P>

The international community including the United Nations,
Organization of African Unity and the European Union are all
having representatives in Djibouti to oversee what is going on.
Members from the Arab League also joined the effort on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision-making will always remain for the
Somalis. Despite some opposition from Somalia's power monger
faction leaders, the Somalis are still very hopeful of obtaining a
government at last through the Djibouti peace plan within this
year.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Enhanced Efforts to Turn HK Into Asia's Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- To turn Hong Kong into Asia's
Silicon Valley, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government and the community should exert joint efforts to quicken
the step of development of high-tech projects, according to a
senior information technology official.
</P>
<P>
The government has a vital role to play in facilitating the
development of advanced technology and in strengthening the
private sector's capability to develop innovative ideas for
commercial use, Director of Information Technology Services Lau
Kam-hung told a forum Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lau pointed out at the forum on venture capital and technology
financing at the Hong Kong Information Infrastructure Exhibition
and Conference 2000 that the active participation and support of
venture capital and technology financing from the private sector
is equally essential in enabling the new technologies to flourish
here.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is already in possession of the critical success
factors that will make it the Silicon Valley of Asia, Lau said.
These include a free market, an entrepreneurial spirit, a sound
legal system, excellent infrastructure and a well-developed
capital market, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some new high-tech projects in Hong Kong such as the
Cyberport and the Science Park attracted considerable investment
interest, reflecting in the good response from the multinational
companies which have already signed up as anchor tenants at the
Cyberport, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lau, another initiative which will boost support
for Hong Kong's industries in developing high value-added products
is the establishment of the Applied Science and Technology
Research Institute. Targeted for completion in 2004, the institute
's role will be to carry out high-quality mid-stream research and
development projects for transfer to the industry sector.
</P>
<P>
The five billion Hong Kong dollar Innovation and Technology
Fund provides essential financial support to projects which will
contribute to innovation and the technological upgrading of Hong
Kong's manufacturing and service industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, venture financing is also provided through the
Applied Research Fund to the private sector to assist companies
undertaking technologically innovative projects with real
commercial potential, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the Growth Enterprise Market is
already providing an alternative mechanism enabling emerging
companies to raise funds for business development and helping
attract greater amounts of venture capital to Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A powerful windstorm hit Turkey's
central Kayseri province on Saturday, leaving nearly 100 people
being poisoned by charcoal fumes, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Gusts at the speed of about 100 kilometers per hour tore roofs
of many houses, destroying the charcoal-fueled heating system and
thus causing the leak of the poisoning fumes.
</P>
<P>
The poisoned people have been taken to hospitals and there is no
immediate report of any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strong wind also damaged energy lines in several
regions in the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala,
president of the ruling Nepali Congress, was elected prime
minister Saturday by NC lawmakers. This is the third time the 76-
year-old NC leader becomes the chief executive of the Himalayan
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1925 into a family which has produced three prime
ministers of Nepal (his brothers M.P. Koirala and B.P. Koirala
were prime ministers in 1950s and 1960s), G.P. Koirala began his
political career in his early 20's when working at a jute mill in
Biratnagar of eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
As Koirala led the labor movement in Biratnagar after the
dissolution of multi-party system in Nepal in 1960, he was
arrested the same year and was imprisoned for seven years. After
another three-year imprisonment, Koirala exiled himself to India
until 1979.
</P>
<P>
Koirala held the post of NC's youth leader for many years
before he was elected the party's general secretary in 1976 at a
party conference held in India.
</P>
<P>
The armed struggle against the partyless Panchayat system in
place from 1960 culminated in the people's movement in February
1990, which forced King Birendra to abolish the Panchayat system
and introduce a multi-party democratic system in the country.
</P>
<P>
When NC won the first ever free elections in Nepal in May of
1991, Koirala, as the party leader who was elected member of the
House of Representatives, became the Kingdom's first popularly
elected prime minister since 1960, a post he held till March 1994.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1998, Koirala was once again appointed as prime
minister to head a minority government by NC until the new
election in May,1999.
</P>
<P>
Koirala remains single after his wife died many years ago. He
has one daughter.

<HEADLINE> Clashes in Southern Nigeria to Come to A Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the feuding Ife and
Modakeke communities of Nigeria's southern Osun State Friday
agreed to reach a cease- fire to show respect for President
Olusegun Obasanjo, who is expected to visit them next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They gave the pledge at separate meetings with the state's
governor, Adebisi Akande in Osogbo, the state capital, after the
clash had taken lives of about 125 people, according to the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions were about peace and how to maintain it in our
area and sustain it, also, to prepare ourselves for the coming of
the president so that we will not mess ourselves up when he comes.
And we've given him (Akande) our words that nothing would happen,"
said Wale Fadare, leader of the Modakeke group after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"When we realize the communication gap that broke down between
us and we both see the cost, both materially and humanly, then we
will be more reasonable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The violence, which first erupted on March 3 over a land
ownership dispute between two Yoruba communities, rekindled
Tuesday after a latent break, causing great casualty and property
damage.
</P>
<P>
The two towns of Ife and Modakeke were heartland of Yoruba, one
of the three dominate nationalities in the Africa's most populous
country. President Obasanjo himself is a Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
The communities living in the two towns have a long-standing
rivalry over land ownership and political supremacy in the area
that has sporadically erupted into violence since 1997.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Supports Equal Opportunities in Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department fully
supports the promotion of equal opportunities, particularly in the
area of employment, Commissioner for Labor Matthew Cheung Kin-
chung said at a conference organized by the Equal Opportunities
Commission today.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with the government's commitment to fostering
gender equality through legislation and administrative policies.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said equality of men and women was a "cardinal principle
" enshrined in many international human rights conventions
applicable to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
While the Bill of Rights Ordinance provided that men and women
should enjoy the same basic human rights and equal protection
under the law, the Sex Discrimination Ordinance rendered unlawful
discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy
in specified areas of activities including employment, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"Our labor legislation provides equal protection in all
employment-related areas to all employees, irrespective of sex,
and these areas mainly cover rights and benefits as well as safety
and health," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, our Employment Ordinance provides female workers
with maternity benefits and also protection against discrimination
on ground of pregnancy," Cheung added.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's Local Employment Service (LES) and
Selective Placement Service provided free employment assistance to
job-seekers on a gender-neutral basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 45 percent of the 189,000 job-seekers registered with
the LES were female and 54 percent of the 33,500 placements
directly made by the department were successfully made for female,
Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"To eliminate discriminatory practices or recruitment of
employees, the LES carefully vets vacancies from employers to
ensure that they carry no restrictive requirements based on sex
and age," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
Cheung noted that during the past decade, women's participation
and standing in the Hong Kong economy had been steadily improving.
</P>
<P>
With enhanced education and increased training and retraining
opportunities, there was a growing number of women taking up
employment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At present, women represented almost 40 percent of the labor
force and the unemployment rate was generally lower than that for
males. In 1999, the employment rate for females and males was 4.9
percent and 7.1 percent respectively, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rabies Kill 200 People Annually in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- About 200 people were killed by
rabies each year in Nepal due to overwhelming number of stray dogs
in the country and the shortage of effective anti-rabies vaccines,
according to a seminar on the control of rabies.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture Mukti Shrestha said Friday
at the seminar that controlling the multiplying numbers of stray
dogs in urban areas could be a solution as the post exposure
vaccines available in the country is not very safe.
</P>
<P>
"The rabies vaccine in Nepal is not safe, because of which the
coordination between government and municipalities is important in
the process of controlling the disease," said Shrestha.
</P>
<P>
Shrestha also proposed killing or taking population control as
solutions, which were objected by animal rights activists. This
dispute has left the problem of controlling the proliferation of
stray dogs unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar on the strategy to control rabies in
animals and human beings was jointly organized by National
Zoonosis and Food Hygiene Research Center of Nepal and UK-based
World Society For Protection of Animals.
</P>
<P>
There are so many stray dogs in urban areas of the country that
no one can tell the exact number of them.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Supports Genocide Trial Chamber in Kigali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government
supports plans by the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTR) for
the country's 1994 genocide suspects to set up trial chambers in
its capital Kigali, the Guardian newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government supports plans to have some trials held
in Kigali as proposed by ICTR's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte,
Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania Zephyr Mutanguha told the paper on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the envoy emphasized that Arusha, a northern town of
Tanzania, should remain the headquarters of the tribunal where
most hearings should be done.
</P>
<P>
Having some of the genocide trials held in Rwanda would speed
up the proceedings, he said, expressing his support for Del
Ponte's observation that such a move would also give an
opportunity to the people of Rwanda to witness justice being done
against the culprits of the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government would ensure maximum security to the

</P>
<P>
Post Express:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Conduct Census on Genocide Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The government of Rwanda
will soon carry out a census to establish the actual number of
people murdered in the 1994 genocide, Tanzanian media reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government is set to conduct a countrywide census which
will give the public the actual figure of genocide victims,
Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania Zephyr Mutanguha told the Guardian
newspaper in Dar es Salaam on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he did not disclose the time to conduct the census.
</P>
<P>
The much publicized figure of people killed was solely based on
reports by the western media and the relief agencies present in
Rwanda at that time,

so it is easy for one to double the death toll at certain spots,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mutanguha blamed western media for complicating the Rwandan
issues in their reporting.
</P>
<P>
These people have been at the forefront but they gave negative
reports through deliberate distortion of facts about Rwanda, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to western media, extremist ethnic Hutus slaughtered
an estimated 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the
genocide which ended only when a Tutsi-led rebel army seized power
in July, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian State Company Loses 17.5 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's state-owned
National Insurance Corporation (NIC) last year lost over 14
billion Tanzanian shillings (about 17.5 million U.S. dollars) to
private insurance companies, the Guardian newspaper reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 35.5 billion shillings (about 44.4 million U.S.
dollars) total premium income earned by insurance companies last
year, some 21.4 billion shillings (about 26.7 million U.S.
dollars) was generated by the state insurance corporation, said
NIC Managing Director Margaret Ikongo in a press statement on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite losing nearly two-fifths of its total premium incomes
to private insurance companies, the corporation is still the
market leader, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NIC is facing stiff competition from about 10 private
insurance companies which entered the market after the
liberalization of the industry.
</P>
<P>
These private insurers are on an aggressive move to end a
30-year state monopoly over the industry by the NIC.

<P>
Maj. Johnny Macenas, spokesman of the army's Fourth Infantry
Division, was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that
marines took hold of the Kauswagan town hall at dawn Saturday and
immediately raised anew the Philippine flag.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte Province in Mindanao,

</P>
<P>
MILF members, who took control of the town Wednesday night,
fled toward the coastal area when marine soldiers started crawling
toward the town Friday night, it said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and MILF rebels have been engaged in a fierce
fighting in Lanao del Norte in the past three days. At least 41
MILF members and five government soldiers were killed in the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have accused each other of starting the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF, a major rebel group in the Philippines,

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Ogonis Problem Resolved: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The issue of Ogoni people, over
which Nigeria's membership in the Commonwealth was suspended in
1995, was no longer a problem, a Nigerian official said on Friday
while on his trip in London.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Peter Odili, Governor of
Nigeria's Rivers State, where Ogoni people live, as saying that
Ogoni people have already been serving as national and state level
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, their rights are now no longer a problem, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria fell foul of the Commonwealth when its then military
government in 1995 executed nine Ogoni minority rights activists
including Ken Saro- Wiwa for alleged murder and many Ogonis fled
into exile.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth.
Meanwhile, western nations stopped all aid to the most populous
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria resumed its membership last May when Olusegun Obasanjo
was elected as president and took over from the military regime.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of Nigeria's trouble-making Delta region,
Odili said the National Assembly, the country's top legislature,
is to pass a bill creating a development commission for the nine
oil-producing states.
</P>
<P>
Money would be channelled by federal and state government as
well as oil firms to develop the areas and create jobs for the
youths, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A man who is busy has no time for trouble and we are already
getting out of this situation," the governor added.

<HEADLINE> JMC Demands Congo Pow Lists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Council (JMC)
has asked all warring parties in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) to submit lists of prisoners of war as part of the
implementation process in the DRC, JMC Deputy Chairman Timothy
Kazembe said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kazembe was quoted by Saturday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper as
saying that submission of lists of prisoners of war was the first
step in the implementation of the first calendar which came into
effect on March 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The response so far from concerned parties was encouraging, he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
According to Kazembe, who had recently visited the DRC,
violations of the cease-fire were not as widespread as portrayed
earlier. The JMC is also finalizing deployment of neutral
observers in some parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
All parties involved in the conflict in the DRC have reaffirmed
their commitment to the Lusaka cease-fire agreement signed in July
and August last year.
</P>
<P>
A one-day summit held in Lusaka last month endorsed March 1 as
the new D-day for commencement of some of the activities of the
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The summit also urged the United Nations Security Council to
speedily deploy an appropriate and effective U.N. peacekeeping
force in the war-torn central African country.

<HEADLINE> Costa Ricans Demonstrate Against Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican farmers, rural
workers, longshoremen, public servants and students staged
protests, work stoppages and demonstrations Friday against the
economic policies of the government.
</P>
<P>
Since early Thursday, farmers and rural workers have
barricaded the 20-kilometer highway from San Jose to Cartago in
Alto de Ochomogo, stalling hundreds of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Public servants and students took to the streets to protest the
government's policy of opening up to foreign investment the
industries of telecommunications and energy production, now in the
hands of the Costa Rican Electrical Institute (ICE).
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to "modernize" the ICE, a state
monopoly for more than 50 years, by opening it up to the outside
world, but trade unionists regard the move as "privatizing" the
institution, which they consider emblematic for the development of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations occurred in the capital between the authorities
and demonstrators, who refuse to stop the protests and start talks
with the government, which has said repeatedly that it does not
intend to sell or privatize the ICE, but that the project,
popularly known as the "electric combo," under discussion in the
Legislative Assembly, aims at modernizing the institution.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture producers and rural workers, who accuse the
government of causing their ruination because of its opening
policies, urged raising custom tariffs for several products, such
as potatoes, onions, and carrots, refinance their debts through
the banking system, and stop auctioning off their homes and land
plots which have been foreclosed by banks.
</P>
<P>
The protest demonstrations added to the growing dissatisfaction
and continuous confrontations that different rural sectors have
maintained during the two first years of Costa Rican President
Miguel Angel Rodriguez's mandate.

SANTIAGO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile decided not to file a

Chile maintains the law principle that the courts of each
country have the right to try crimes committed in their own
territory, said Alvear.
</P>
<P>
Chile made the decision after Augusto Pinochet returned to his
country on March 3 following 16 months of detention in London,
where the British government tried to extradite him to Spain to
stand trial on human rights abuse charges.

MEXICO CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is confident oil-
producing countries will strike satisfactory deals by late March
when OPEC states meet in Vienna, Austria, to increase petroleum
output, the energy ministry's Vice-Minister Mauricio Toussaint
Ribot said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He took the success of implementing various accords to reduce
oil production as proof of reaching concrete and satisfactory
agreements to raise the supply among oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
"We have been acting in consensus with other producing countries,
" and the Mexican government will continue acting in this
direction, Ribot said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mexico will closely watch the degree of
compliance with the agreement to reduce production, he said,
noting that the Mexican government favors the increase of oil
output, but "we must do it in a responsible and measured way to
prevent any disarray in the market."
</P>
<P>
He said that "nobody foresees an oil crisis in the future,
because there are mechanisms for agreement, and we are advancing
in this direction."

meeting will be held on March 27 in Vienna.

<P>
ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada dominated the final freestyle
skiing World Cup aerials competition of the season as Nicolas
Fontaine and Veronica Brenner won the gold in men's and women's
category respectively in Livigno, Italy on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fontaine snatched the World Cup aerials title for the fourth
consecutive year after finishing with a two-run combined score of
250.57.
</P>
<P>
Joe Pack of the United States settled for the second place with
244.82 and Belarus's Alexei Grichin came in third at 219.97.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I really screw by rushing and going too soon," said
Fontaine, going over the 250 point barrier for just the second
time in his career. "But this time I just told myself that I was
going to wait if it was windy."
</P>
<P>
Brenner collected her second win of the season with a mark of
195.32 when world champion Jacqui Cooper of Australia, the leader
after the first round jumps, touched down on her landing on her
second effort and dropped to fourth.
</P>
<P>
Alla Tsuper of Belarus finished second with 186.74 and
Australian Alisa Camplin took the third on 175.79.
</P>
<P>
Jacqui Cooper's fourth place finish was enough to allow her to
defend her overall aerials title finishing atop the rankings with
488 points, just 12 in front of Brenner, who made a late bid for
the crown winning two of the last three races and finishing second
in the other.

WELLINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Six people instead of five as
earlier reported were killed in a road crash in Southland on New
Zealand's South Island Friday, New Zealand Press Association
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The six people, including two children and a baby, were from
one family and were travelling from Wanganui to Invercargill for
another family member's wedding. They died when their van collided
head on with an articulated meat truck just after 7:00 Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in foggy conditions on State Highway One
between Clinton and Waipahi in southern part of the South Island.
The truck driver, who was on his way from Invercargill to Dunedin
with a load of meat cartons, was not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Local police had problems determining how many people were in
the van and had to wait for a specialist identification team from
Dunedin before they could start removing the bodies. Debris was
scattered over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
The refrigerated truck skidded across the road, through a fence
and crashed about 200 meters down a hill before coming to rest
with its nose embedded in the bank of a stream.

The Chatham Islands is 800 kilometers from New Zealand's east
coast. According to NZPA, more than 100 tons of diesel, hydraulic
and lubricating oils on the Seafresh One, which began sinking
Friday night,are threatening to cause one of the biggest spills in
New Zealand waters in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Local fisherman Paddy Lanauze was quoted as saying the slick
has already spread across a three-kilometer by one-kilometer area
in Hanson Bay, on the island's east coast.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's really worried at the moment because it's not far
from the entrance to the lagoon," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the slick reaches there, he added, some of the fishery
stocks on which the island depends will be ruined.
</P>
<P>
The 41-meter trawler, owned by Wellington-based fishing company
Seafresh NZ, was towed to the Chatham Islands a week ago after a
fire in its engine room.
</P>
<P>
It was waiting to be towed back to Wellington when it began
sinking Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a floating oil barrier has been stretched
across the Hikurangi Channel to protect the ecologically sensitive
Te Whanga lagoon.

WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Basketball
Association compromised again on Friday by recalling 100,000 U.S.
dollars fines for the Seattle SuperSonics and Toronto Raptors
after their coaches refused to wear microphones for a telecast.
</P>
<P>
The league also said it will continue to give coaches the
option for the rest of the season of whether to wear a wireless
microphone or have a boom microphone lowered into their huddles
during selected national broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
"We have had several discussions with the coaches' association,
" deputy commissioner Russ Granik said, "and we believe that all
of our coaches should be comfortable with this new approach.
</P>
<P>
The NBA handed out the fines last week. Westphal and Carter
felt strongly about the issue and said they were willing to pay
the fines out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
Some coaches and players have also complained about other new
media rules, including the use of an unmanned camera to give
viewers a glimpse of what an NBA locker room looks like during a
typical halftime.

China's first automatic target scoring system for firearms has
been developed by an institution attached to the Chinese People's
Liberation Army General Armament Department.
</P>
<P>
According to an expert on the development team, the automatic
system can report the positions of targets hit by bullets and
shells quickly and accurately, overcoming the disadvantages of an
inefficient and hazardous manual system.
</P>
<P>
The expert said the system has been configured to suit all
firearms in the Chinese arsenal, including scoring the shooting of
anti-aircraft machine guns and shooting at moving objects by
firearms in motion.

Chinese Scientist Discovers Revised Source of Yangtze River
</P>
<P>
A Chinese scientist using satellite imaging technology has
determined that the Damchu River on northwest China's Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau is more likely to be the source of the Yangtze River
than the well-known Tuotuo River.
</P>
<P>
The Damchu, which is larger than the Tuotuo in both water flow
and drainage area, is the true source of the longest river in
China, says Dr. Liu Shaochuang of the Institute of Remote Sensing
Application under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that his conclusion was made after intensive analysis
of the remote sensing data obtained through satellite imaging and
some topographic data.
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Pay Last Respects to Renowned Physicist
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people brought flowers with them as they paid their
last respects to renowned physicist Xie Xide on March 16 in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Xie, who was devoted to solid physics research and made
outstanding contributions to initiating and developing China's
work on semi-conductor and surface physics, died of disease on
March 4 at a Shanghai hospital at the age of 79.
</P>
<P>
High-Tech Zones Gain Fastest Growth in China
</P>
<P>
The 53 state high-tech development zones in China have become
the fastest growing part of the Chinese economy, dwarfing the
country's economic growth rate of seven percent in 1999 by more
than 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan told reporters
that the total technological, industrial, and trade revenue and
industrial output generated by the 53 high-tech zones jumped by 35
and 30 percent last year to 656 billion yuan (80 billion U.S.
dollars) and 566 billion yuan (69 billion U.S. dollars),
respectively.
</P>
<P>
These figures show that the zones, which were set up during the
past decade to speed up commercialization of the country's high-
tech achievements, have met the key economic development targets
set by the central government for the year 2000 a year ahead of
schedule, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
 Anhui Introduces New "Space" Vegetables
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector in east China's Anhui Province has
introduced new varieties of "space" vegetable seeds to replace
traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
The seeds were sent into space for two weeks for special
breeding, and the use of these seeds developed after exposure to
strong radiation in space has the advantages of being disease
resistant and high yielding.
</P>
<P>
Local agronomists note that the so-called "space tomato, red
pepper, and cucumber" are growing well at a number of farming
centers in the province.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Faces Another Belt Twist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- World heavyweight champion Lennox
Lewis of Britain now faces a legal challenge to one version of his
undisputed world heavyweight title, three days after doing a deal
to save another.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the World Boxing Association agreed to let
Lewis keep their belt and go ahead with a planned New York bout
with Michael Grant in April.
</P>
<P>
Their condition was that the Briton fight the WBA's leading
contender Johnny Ruiz in a Don King-promoted fight in London in
July.
</P>
<P>
But now a boxer who has knocked Ruiz out in just 19 seconds
said that he should be next in line to fight Lewis after Grant.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander David Tua is the International Boxing Federation'
s leading contender for their title.
</P>
<P>
The IBF has given Lewis a year to fight their man, although the
boxer himself said the bout should take place by mid-May, or at
least once Lewis has fought Grant.
</P>
<P>
Tua has now started a court challenge to the IBF, which he
hopes will force Lewis to fight him or lose this belt.
</P>
<P>
The organization will study the New Zealander's case at an
appeals hearing on Saturday before the matter returns to a US
courtroom on 27 March.
</P>
<P>
Tua said the IBF rules mean that new champions must make a
mandatory defense within six months of winning the title, in this
case by 13 May.
</P>
<P>
The IBF has already said it will extend this period to a year
and Tua is prepared to drop his case if Lewis agrees to fight him
after Grant and not Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
The latest situation appears to line up Ruiz and controversial
promoter King in one corner, with Tua hoping for the backing of
the courts as he steps out of the other.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, until this week's decision King would have actually
preferred Ruiz to take on Evander Holyfield for a vacant WBA crown,
while Lewis could then have fought Tua.
</P>
<P>
But the Briton must now wait until the courts decide whether
the IBF are acting lawfully in extending their deadline over Tua.

<HEADLINE> Charleroi Stadium Fears for England Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The football stadium due to host
England's clash with Germany in Euro 2000 is unsafe, according to
BBC reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
BBC's Weekend Watchdog said the Stade Communal at Charleroi,
Belgium, has several features branded by British experts as
dangerous for fans.
</P>
<P>
The ground has a capacity of just 30,000 so a temporary tier
has been fitted to one of the stands.
</P>
<P>
The English Football Association said the stadium met safety
and security criteria laid down by UEFA, European football's
governing body.
</P>
<P>
But crowd safety expert Jim Dickie told the program the
temporary section was too steep, the railings too low and there
was a risk of people falling.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If this tier was erected under UK regulations it
would not be granted a safety certificate.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody offered me a ticket for the England-Germany game
in this area of the stand I would decline the offer because I
think the levels of risk are unacceptably high."
</P>
<P>
Dr Dickie, who advises some of England's top Premiership clubs,
said the stairways were also too wide meaning that during a crowd
surge there could be a risk of people falling.
</P>
<P>
At 38 degrees, the tier is one of the steepest in Europe and
four degrees steeper than British regulations would allow.
</P>
<P>
Each row has 40 seats between the gangways which is 16 more
than is allowed in the UK and, Dr Dickie said, narrow exits
increase evacuation time in the event of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
During safety tests it took emergency services using
mountaineering equipment 25 minutes to carry one person from the
empty stadium. In Britain it is expected to take half that time.
</P>
<P>
There are also concerns among the Belgian police that crowd
trouble in and around the stadium may be difficult to control.
</P>

The head of the Belgian Police Federation, Paul van Kerr, said:
"The view of the police officers is clear. Charleroi is not a
stadium to stage matches like this.
</P>
<P>
"One of the simple solutions is to take the match to Brussels."
</P>
<P>
Officials at Belgium's largest football ground, the 50,000-
seater King Baudouin stadium in Brussels, told the BBC they were
willing and available to host the game.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA said it had no safety concerns and did not plan a
venue switch.
</P>

A spokesman said a recent friendly between Belgium and Portugal
at the stadium had passed off safely.

<P>
FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said English and German officials
had visited the Stade Communal.

The FA respected the views of UEFA and tournament organizers,

<HEADLINE> EU Plans Curb on Foreign Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- European football clubs may be
forced to field at least six home-grown players, under new
proposals from the European Union aimed at limiting the amount of
foreigners in the game.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to have a big impact on many of the
continent's leading teams, who are becoming increasingly
multinational.
</P>
<P>
But the clubs, who are now the powerhouses of the game, are
likely to oppose any new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The plans were announced after EU officials met Sepp Blatter,
president of the sport's governing body FIFA, and UEFA chief
executive Gerhard Aigner at a summit in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The EU is ready to step in to regulate football after the "
Bosman Ruling" of 1995 changed the way clubs recruited players.
</P>
<P>
Up until then there were strict limits on the number of non-
domestic players in a team - but Belgium's Jean-Marc Bosman won
his challenge to the rule, effectively ending the limits on EU
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
FIFA believes football should be treated as a special case and
should be exempt from other EU regulations on freedom of
employment.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said: "There should always be six players eligible for
the national team on the field of play. But that is not compatible
with the consequences of the Bosman case."
</P>
<P>
And UEFA boss Aigner added: "The rules were defined for
economic and not sporting situations."
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Interior Minister Fernando Gomes, whose country
holds the EU presidency, said a working committee was being set up
to report back to ministers within two months with proposals.
</P>
<P>
"There is a clear conflict of interest," he said of the Bosman
Ruling.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who has special responsibility for sport, said
there was a "need to safeguard sport, notably soccer, from some
perverseness that has emerged from the ruling".
</P>
<P>
The first step for FIFA and UEFA is to secure special treatment
for soccer under European Union law.
</P>
<P>
The issue of foreign domination of English football has become
more high-profile this season, particularly after Chelsea became
the first club to field a team with no English players in a
Premiership match.
</P>
<P>
A UEFA spokesman said European football's administrators wanted
to bring back the old rules because the current ones stifled local
talent.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There are too many foreign players in teams and it is
holding back young players.
</P>
<P>
"This is something UEFA is fighting for. The clubs themselves,
well they want to win so they might not be so keen.
</P>
<P>
"If they go back to the old rules then Chelsea will have to
sell some players or introduce new young players," he said.

ANKARA -- A powerful windstorm hit Turkey's central Kayseri
province on Saturday, leaving nearly 100 people being poisoned by
charcoal fumes, the Anatolia News Agency reported.

Gusts at the speed of about 100 kilometers per hour tore roofs
of many houses, destroying the charcoal-fueled heating system and
thus causing the leak of the poisoning fumes.

The poisoned people have been taken to hospitals and there is no
immediate report of any casualties.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves for South Asia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left Washington on Saturday for a week-long visit to three
countries in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit by a U.S. president to India in 22 years
and to Pakistan since 1969. And Clinton will be the first U.S.
president who embarked on Bangladesh ever since.
</P>
<P>
His visit represents a strategic shift in U.S. policies toward
the Indian subcontinent, a shift from its alliance with Pakistan
in the era of the Cold War to its cooperative partnership with
India.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will spend five days of his week-long trip in India,
showing U.S. intention to enter this potential great market.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton must first focus his attention on the security in
the region as the situation there has deteriorated since India
first conducted nuclear tests and Pakistan followed suit to
counter-balance its influence, in May 1998. Conflicts in Kashmir
in October 1999 put the two rivals on the verge of a war.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Friday that he hoped to use his trip to reduce
tension between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"I want to do what I can to reduce tensions on the India
subcontinent, to reduce the likelihood of weapons proliferation
and the likelihood of conflict," he told reporters in the Oval
House.
</P>
<P>
He said that he made it clear that "a nuclear future is a
dangerous future for them and for the world."
</P>
<P>
He warned that India and Pakistan must exercise military and
diplomatic restraint if they expect good relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's trip was finally included into Clinton's visit to
South Asia after several weeks of debate with the administration.
Clinton agreed that it would be a mistake not to go to Islamabad
as the United States has to tackle the problem of terrorism with a
cooperative Pakistan.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil said Saturday that
it will fulfill the plan of retention of coffee exports agreed on
with the Coffee Producing Countries Association (APPC) to stem a
further drop of the price of the grain in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes said
that Brazil, first coffee producer and exporter in the world, has
no other way but to respect the agreement made with the APPC,
ratified with Colombia, second producing country, to prevent a new
drop in the price of the grain after the supply of the APPC non
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government committed itself to attaining from
exporting its quota of 17 million 60-kilo bags between July of
2000 and June of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian coffee harvest is not as good as the previous one.
Brazilian coffee exports dropped almost 30 percent in February of
this year, compared to the same month of 1999. The volume went
from 1.851 million bags in the second month of 1999 to 1.314
million in February of 2000.

Income from exports dropped from 207.5 million U.S. dollars to
156.2 million dollars in the same period.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Weed out Corrupt Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Civil Service Head
Richard Leakey warned on Saturday that all corrupt and lax civil
servants, and those who fail to execute their duties properly
would be weeded out.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony of the consultative forum on
poverty reduction strategies held in the capital Nairobi, Leakey
said: "We will continue to stamp out corrupt civil servants and
all those who are not straightforward (in their duties)."
</P>
<P>
The consultative forum, which opened Thursday, discussed the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper launched by the government
recently. The forum came hot on the heels of high government
expectations on resumption of donor aid by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan to
Kenya due to rampant corruption, bad governance and mismanagement
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
During the consultative forum, World Bank country director
Harold Wackman promised it would resume its aid to Kenya by the
middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the forum, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
urged Finance Minister Chrysanthus Okemo and his team to push
negotiations with IMF and the World Bank to achieve the resumption
of donor funding as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone to Establish Reconciliation Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone will set up a truth
and reconciliation commission to step up the disarmament process
and ensure lasting peace, said the west African country's Vice
President Joe Demby on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Government has already put in place the mechanism for the
setting up of the truth and reconciliation commission," Demby said
on the state radio in the capital Freetown, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty alone is not enough to persuade the people to
forgive," he said, referring to amnesties offered to former rebel
fighters who handed in their weapons and demobilized.
</P>
<P>
The move was apparently inspired by a similar organization in
South Africa to heal the wounds left by apartheid.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 civilians were killed and even more maimed
during Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war, which ended in July
1999 with the signing of the Lome peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The accord gave the rebels led by Foday Sankoh full amnesty and
 government posts in the unity government.
</P>
<P>
But disarmament and demobilization has dragged and parts of the
country, including the diamond mining areas, are still under rebel
control.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force sent to Sierra Leone by the United
Nations has had problems deploying in some areas held by former
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Deep distrust of the rebels to the government and late payment
of funds promised by foreign donors were blamed for the tardiness.
</P>
<P>
"A number of pledges have been made by the international
community that are yet to be fulfilled," said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
"Ex-combatants are willing to disarm, to surrender their
weapons in exchange for money and since the money is not available
it is indeed a setback," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Iran to Respond to U.S. "Major Overture" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Saturday urged Iran to respond to the "major overture" made
by the United States to Tehran Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
that the U.S. was promising steps towards the return of assets
frozen since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, was lifting a ban on
imports of Iranian luxury goods like carpets and caviar, and
making it easier for Iranian scholars and athletes to visit the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Albright on the margins of an Aspen
Institute conference held in Venice, Dini said it was now up to
Tehran to respond to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy supports the U.S. action, and underscored that
Tehran must understand how important the U.S. move is and follow
up in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
Iran is locked in a battle between conservatives and the
reformists who won the February elections.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the overture Friday, Albright said the U.S. was
seeking to encourage the reformers who back moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, elected in 1997.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Congress Held in Karlsruhe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- German Greens party congress is
being held from March 17 to 19 in Karlsruhe.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Greens voted against possible sales of
tanks to foreign countries, but the government allowed the sales.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 305 to 296 with 19 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The Greens have been alarmed over reports this week that the
German government may export Fox tanks to the United Arab Emirates
and 1000 Leopard II main battle tanks to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greens human rights spokeswoman Claudia Roth earlier warned
that the sale to Leopard IIs to Turkey would lead to a collapse of
Schroeder's coalition with the Greens.
</P>
<P>
"That would be the end," Roth said, adding that if the Greens
did not pull out of the government after an arms deals with Turkey
they would have no chance in the next election.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is a leadership member
of the Greens. He called on his party late Friday to ease its
hardline stance on arms exports and he said that the Greens would
not be able to oppose all arms sales.
</P>
<P>
Another top issue of the Greens congress is naturally the
closure of nuclear power plants. On the first day of the party
congress the Greens called to close the nuclear power stations
swiftly and threaten to pull out of the coalition if Germany
agreed to sell tanks to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greens was founded by anti-nuclear activists as an
ecological party 20 years ago and it opposed building of the
nuclear power station. Now a top priority of the party still
adheres to closing 19 nuclear power stations in Germany.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the Greens won the election allied with the German
Social Democratic Party (SPD) and entered into Schroeder's
coalition government. the SPD has promised to shut down the
nuclear power stations in Germany, but Schroeder is seeking to
come to an agreement with the nuclear sector and wants to close

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Asks Adequate Prices for Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too high or too low prices do no good to any nation and have
adverse repercussions on the growth of the world economies, said
Zedillo in a speech on occasion of the 62nd anniversary of the
Mexican oil expropriation.
</P>
<P>
The country will maintain its cooperation with the producing
countries for the stabilization of the international oil market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is not member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). However, it cooperates with major OPEC members
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for supporting an increase of the world
supply of crude to reduce the prices that this year reached their
highest level of 30 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said at the National Palace that his government will
avoid "irresponsible optimism," referring to bigger budget
spending because of the rise in the oil prices that produce bigger
tax income for the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the State will maintain the control of
the oil and the state oil monopoly Petrleos Mexicanos (Pemex)
will never be privatized.
</P>
<P>
Finance authorities have said that Pemex is the biggest
taxpayer of the country, since it represents no less than 30
percent of tax income.
</P>
<P>
Pemex director Rogelio Montemayor said during the celebration
that Mexico has proven reserves of 58.204 billion barrels of crude,
which guarantees the extraction of oil for the next 40 years at
the present rate in the country.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Balkans "Test Bed" For Future European Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright praised the role of conduct of Italy in the Balkans and
Kosovo, saying that the Balkans were a significant "test bed" for
the future of European security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini on the sidelines of an Aspen Institute conference held in
Venice,Albright said that Italy has a very important role in the
Balkans underlining Italy's work in the Balkans and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The two officials stressed there were still many problems to be
solved in Kosovo, where attacks on Serbs have escalated in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Albright said cooperation was needed in setting up a civilian
administration, stressing the importance of beefing up the police
force and making the rule of law stick.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the situation "is not easy" but added that it is
better than a year ago and economic life is slowly getting back
into gear.
</P>
<P>
But there is "the lack of an authority" due to the delays in
establishing an administration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy this week upped its contingent in Kosovo, becoming the
top contributor to KFOR, the peacekeeping force.
