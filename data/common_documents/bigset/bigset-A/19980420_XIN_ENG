<HEADLINE> CPP Nominates Hun Sen as Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian People's Party
Sunday formally nominated Hun Sen, the incumbent second prime
minister and vice president of CPP, as the premier.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a six-point statement released
after a special session of the party's central committee held
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the session unanimously agreed to nominate
Hun Sen as the premier of next government once the CPP won the
elections. CPP will form, according to the legislation, a
coalition government which will have only one prime minister and
will cooperate with all legal political parties, it added.
</P>
<P>
The CPP reaffirmed that the cooperation will exclude those
politicians and parties who attempt to split or oppose the
high-ranking leadership of CPP.
</P>
<P>
The general elections scheduled for July 26 would be held as
scheduled, it said, warning that any postponement would bring
unpredictable negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
The CPP also welcomes the return of Prince Ranariddh to
participate the forthcoming elections, and the defectors of Khmer
Rouge to come back to the society and royal government.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community and the United
Nations to ensure the polls be held freely and fairly on the
basis of respecting Cambodia's sovereignty and independence.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the establishment of international tribunal
to trial Pol Pot, Khieu Sam Phan and other Khmer Rouge leaders.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists May Support Kiriyenko: Duma Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Head of Russia's lower house of
parliament predicted Sunday that the Communist Party may vote for
Sergei Kiriyenko's candidancy as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview, Gennady Seleznev, chairman of the
State Duma, said the Central Committee of the Communist Party may
ask its deputies in the Duma to vote for approval of Kiriyenko in
the third round of voting scheduled for April 24.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's constitution, the president will either present
a new candidate, or disband the Duma and call new elections, if
Duma fails to approve his premier's candidancy for the third time.
</P>
<P>
Since the disbandment of the lower house would also paralyze
the Federation Council, or the upper house of the parliament,
Kiriyenko's nomination must be supported, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are well aware of the fact that no candidate of the left,
patriotic forces will be nominated as long as Boris Yeltsin is in
office."
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not forgive us if we sacrifice the State Duma over
a nomination for the prime minister," Seleznev added.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Meets Foreign Ministers of ASEAN "Troika" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk met with foreign ministers from Thailand, Indonesia and
the Philippines, the so-called Troika of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in the Cambodian town of Siem
Reap Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, they discussed the organization's role in the
upcoming elections in Cambodia in July and measures to ensure a
free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said after the meeting
that they were all satisfied with the results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, they did not discuss details concerning the fate of
General Nhiek Bun Chhay, who was tried and sentenced to prison,
along with Prince Ranariddh, by a Phnom Penh military court in
March.
</P>
<P>
Alatas and his counterparts, Surin Pitsuwan of Thailand and
Domingo Siazon of the Philippines, also notified the King the
content of a joint statement issued by the Friends of Cambodia,
which comprises mainly of donor countries like Japan, France and
the United States, in Bangkok Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk expressed his gratitudes to the three countries for
their efforts to end Cambodia's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The "Troika" and representatives of the Friends of Cambodia met
and discussed the future situation in Cambodia and ways to help
the country establish peace and stability in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was scheduled to join ASEAN last July. However, ASEAN
put off Cambodia's entry into the association due to the July 5-6
fighting which effectively ousted Prince Ranariddh.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Pledges Support for FTAA Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- James D. Wolfensohn, President
of the World Bank Sunday told the 34 leaders of the West
Hemisphere that the Bank would continue to support the process of
the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Second Summit of the Americas, Wolfensohn
said that the Bank would triple its budget for regional policy
studies and conferences. Especially in the area of education,
which is the major topic of the Santiago Summit, the World Bank
would sponsor a ministerial meeting of Education and Finance to
study educational reforms. There will be another meeting of
business leaders to discuss measures for the realization of the
targets for educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that his bank was also ready to do more to
promote development at the national levels. Over the past three
years, the World Bank has lent over 10 billion U.S. dollars
equivalent of financing to the region of Latin America and the
Caribbean, which has been directed to the areas of education,
governance, regional integration and infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief proposed to increase the Bank's support
for the region's chosen priorities to 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Wolfensohn's proposal, the World Bank's lending
for education will be increased from 2 billion dollars to at least
3 billion dollars, lending for poverty-reduction projects will be
raised from 3.5 billion dollars to 5.5 billion dollars. In the
areas of governance and institution building, the Bank's lending
will be increased from 700 million dollars to more than 2 billion
dollars. In addition, the World Bank would consider increasing
lending for economic integration and free trade from 4.5 billion
dollars to some 9 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Further Investigation into Tehran Mayor's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Parliament (Majlis) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri Sunday called for further investigation into
the embezzlement case of Tehran Municipality after Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an open session of the Parliament, Nateq-Nouri
called on the judiciary and officials in charge of the
investigations of the case to tackle the issue at a court and "on
the basis of justice and law," and keep the public informed of the
developments, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Karbaschi was detained on April 4 by the
conservative judiciary on charges of embezzlement,
misappropriation of public funds and mismanagement, which were
rejected by the moderates as politically motivated with the aim of
weakening the government of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Following an intervention by former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, Karbaschi was released on Wednesday after Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei agreed with a request of President
Khatami, who strongly opposed the mayor's detention.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the political row between the two rival political
factions over the detention of the Tehran mayor, Nateq-Nouri said
that foreign and Zionist (Israeli) media took advantage of the
situation and fanned the flames in an attempt to escalate tension
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the case created tension in the society
and anxiety among people, the supreme leader calmed the situation
with his decree issued upon Khatami's request.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran mayor, who strongly supported Khatami in last May's
presidential elections reportedly returned to work on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran Sign Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi and Iranian Red Crescent
Societies signed an agreement for consolidating bilateral
cooperation in the fields of relief, training and exchange of
expertise Sunday, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two societies will exchange
information in the fields of drugs, medical appliances and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Chairman of the Iraqi Red Crescent
Society Khaldoun al-Bakri expressed appreciation for efforts made
by the Iranian Red Crescent Society for the release of Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs), hoping that these efforts would go
ahead to see an end to this humanitarian problem.
</P>
<P>
During the latest rounds of release of POWs between the two
countries that started early this month, Iran set free nearly
6,000 Iraqi POWs captured during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, while
Iraq released nearly 400 Iranian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bakri's Iranian counterpart Saifullah Dastajrudi said his
society is ready to offer necessary medical assistance to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people caused by the
U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Iranian Red Crescent delegation left
Baghdad, winding up a week-long visit to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform Policy Is Positive To Long-Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's major policy directions in
the coming years outlined by its new Premier Zhu Rongji are
positive to the long-term growth prospects, the influential
quarterly, Global Outlook, said.
</P>
<P>
The Quarterly, released on Sunday by HSBC, the largest
commercial bank in the world, said the reform will also help to
cut inefficiency and red-tape and will save on fiscal expenses.
</P>
<P>
The renminbi stabilized at the 8.28 level against the U.S.
dollar in the first quarter of 1998. "It will remain so in the
months ahead," HSBC expected.
</P>
<P>
China's real GDP grew by 8.8 percent in 1997, down from 9.7
percent in 1996, due largely to slower growth in agriculture and
the collective industrial sector and possibly a fall in stock
levels, HSBC argued.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, slower growth is expected to be seen in both domestic
consumption and external demand in China. Asia's financial crisis
will restrain export growth, while the growing unemployment will
dampen consumption, according to the Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
However, the slow-down in aggregate demand is expected to be
partly offset by increased investment. Overall, real GDP is
expected to grow by 7.0 percent in 1998, the Global Outlook
expected.
</P>
<P>
February's retail price index in China fell for the fifth
consecutive month by 1.9 percent and consumer price index fell by
0.1 percent for the first time in many years. The Quarterly
believed that China's consumer price inflation should remain close
to 5 percent in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien will visit Cuba from April 27 to 28, reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be the first by a Canadian prime minister since
Pierre Trudeau made the trip to the Caribbean island nation 22
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is in Chile to attend the 34-nation summit of
Americas, which is focused primarily on launching a new
trans-America free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Given Canada's long-standing relationship with Cuba, "it was
about time" he makes the visit, Chretien was quoted as saying by
the reports, which were filed from Chile.
</P>
<P>
"We have normal relations with Cuba and have been invited by
Mr. Castro and we believe in constructive dialogue with them,"
Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it was worth the risk of rupturing relations with
the U.S., which has maintained its embargo against Cuba for the
past 37 years, Chretien said his support of the Cuban government
is no secret to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
"They have known our position for a long time. We've never
changed since they had a revolution there," Chretien said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A team of biological experts of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament in Iraq
arrived here Sunday, according to Iraqi sources.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate, the
UNSCOM's Iraqi peer, said the biological team's mission is
expected to last until May 2.
</P>
<P>
The sources said another UNSCOM team for surveying
weapon-destructing sites also arrived here on Sunday and is
scheduled to wrap up its mission on April 24.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, 10 UNSCOM monitoring groups made surprising or
scheduled visits to 12 Iraqi sites, and used helicopters to reach
some of the sites, the Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Routine inspections of Iraqi sites by UNSCOM monitoring groups
have been going on on daily basis since UNSCOM inspectors returned
to Iraq last November after a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had expelled six Americans with UNSCOM last November on
the ground that they were spies with the Central Intelligence
Agency of the United States.
</P>
<P>
So far, these UNSCOM routine inspections have received full
cooperation from the Iraqi side, nothing has been announced found
by arms inspectors in Iraqi presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 can not be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that Iraq
is free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President: Santiago Summit Enhances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- While concluding the 2-day
Second Summit of the Americas here Sunday, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle said the participants have reaffirmed the
deep ties uniting the 34 countries in the West Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chilean leader, the Presidents and Heads of
State of the Americas are concluding a "wide-ranging, frank and
fruitful dialogue", which is manifested in the Santiago
Declaration which has been signed by the 34 leaders along with its
complementary Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
Frei termed the documents as "of far-reaching and systematic."
"The historic Miami Summit, the first held in our hemisphere in
nearly two decades, set in motion a planning and evaluation
process and a search for agreement which has borne fruit in the
documents approved here", the Chilean President said.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Santiago Summit has formally broken the ground for
the creation of the largest free trade area in history, the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which will bring together more
than 750 million people with a combined GNP greater than nine
trillion U.S. dollars. The goal of completing this process by the
year 2005 still stands, and "we have taken great strides in
defining concrete steps toward the construction of this great
common market."
</P>
<P>
During the Santiago Summit, the 34 leaders have emphasized the
importance of education as the decisive factor in furthering the
economic, social, political and cultural development in the
region. "Education is the most effective mechanism for
guaranteeing true equality of opportunity to the women and men of
the Americas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about expanding and enhancing democracy in the region,
the Chilean President stated, "From personal experience, we know
that there is no one single model of democracy. Many of our
countries have been in the process of constructing democracy for
nearly two centuries and still have much to accomplish."
</P>
<P>
The 34 leaders also talked about the Asian financial crisis and
its repercussions to the West Hemisphere. "We agree on the
importance of adequate, strict and transparent supervision of
national financial systems which does not stand in the way of
private activity or the internationalization of the economy. We
are also in agreement about the necessity to maintain frugal and
disciplined fiscal policies," Frei said.

<HEADLINE> Dar to Host Congress on Diabetes Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The sixth Pan-African
Diabetes Study Group Congress will be held here on May 24-26 to
deliberate on how to cure the disease, said a Tanzanian health
care official.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of Tanzania Diabetes Association Dr. Kaushik
Ramaiya told reporters over the weekend that the congress will be
attended by representatives from 34 African countries, and from
Denmark, Britain and Switzerland as well as other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ramaiya said prior to the congress, a workshop for training
nurses from various countries in the field of diabetes will be
conducted in the Tanzanian capital during May 17-23.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that cases of diabetes worldwide have more than
tripled since 1985. And diabetes has become the fourth biggest
killer in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are about 135 million people with diabetes in the
world, he said, adding that the number may rise to 300 million by
the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
"The rate is set to rise by 45 percent in developed countries
and almost 200 percent in developing countries," he said, noting
that the majority of new cases will be in China, Indian
Sub-continent and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes is imposing a huge burden on health care services,
Ramaiya said. It is estimated that a country has to spend five to
10 percent of its health care budget to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
To cure diabetes, a patient needs some 300 U.S. Dollars a year
for insulin alone, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is clear therefore that neither individuals nor the
government can afford the cost, said Ramaiya, who called on the
international community to lend help.
</P>
<P>
The last Pan-African Diabetes Study Group was held in Yaounde,
Cameroun last year, he said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Eight people died
instantly and 13 others were injured when a mini-bus hit a
heavy-duty truck, causing it to be overturned in Dar es Salaam
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe told
reporters that seven of the dead are men and one is a woman.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been sent to the Muhimbili Medical Center
(MMC), with six in critical condition, Gewe said, adding that the
other wounded have been treated and discharged from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
MMC's public relations officer McDonald Mwaijande said so far
only one of the deceased has been identified. His name was
listed as Deogracias Lugambandana, 30.
</P>
<P>
According to 33-year-old Wilson Mbeyale, one of the
eyewitnesses, the accident happened when the mini-bus was passing
by the truck which had just stopped on the road because its cargo
was shaking.
</P>
<P>
Before the mini-bus could pass on the right side of the truck
heading toward the same direction, the truck, which was carrying
two huge rolls of high-voltage insulated electric wires,
overturned and rammed the rear left part of the mini-bus, said
Mbeyale, who is also a driver.
</P>
<P>
Both of the drivers sustained minor injuries and the truck
driver was still helping the police with the investigations.
</P>
<P>
The police said that the accident caused traffic jam for
several hours.

for drastic tax cuts in a bid to win back voters' support it lost
heavily over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Adopted by a large majority at a special party congress in
Berlin on Sunday, the FDP program called for a one-third tax cut
for all taxpayers, including reducing the country's top income tax
from 53 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
In total German taxpayers should see 30 billion marks (16
billion U.S. dollars) in net tax reductions, the FDP paper
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, noted that the FDP did not spell out how to
finance the radical tax cuts at a time when the country is
laboring under heavy financial burden to rebuild eastern Germany
and a tight budget in order to qualify for the single European
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
As a junior partner in German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
center-right ruling coalition, the small, pro-business FDP has
seen its popularity plunging over the past few years due partly to
a voters' resentment over its frequent retreats from its
traditional anti-tax principles.
</P>
<P>
With Germany's joblessness stuck at post-war record highs of
about 4.8 million, the FDP's free-market platform might also clash
with now-dominant notion in the country of insecurity about jobs
and fears about cutbacks in social protection, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to most recent opinion polls, the FDP's support rates
have been hovering around the dangerous five percent. Under
Germany's election law, the five percent is the threshold in order
to enter a party into the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
Defending his party's policy, FDP chief Wolfgang Gerhardt
assured the delegates at the party congress that "If we hold on to
our course, we will win and gain ground".
</P>
<P>
He also rejected a possible alliance with the main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD), the current frontrunners in opinion
polls, and indicated that the FDP would remain loyal to the
coalition with Kohl's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The FDP congress on Sunday is the first of three planned by the
party before the general elections on September 27 this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Second Summit of the
Americas concluded its last session here Sunday by adopting the
Declaration of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
The 34 leaders of west hemisphere directed their Ministers
Responsible for Trade to "begin negotiations for the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA), in accordance with the March 1998
Ministerial Declaration of San Jose."
</P>
<P>
The participants of the Summit reaffirmed their determination
"to conclude the negotiation of the FTAA no later than 2005, and
to make concrete progress by the end of the century. The FTAA
agreement will be balanced, comprehensive, WTO-consistent and
constitute a single undertaking," the document said.
</P>
<P>
Although significant progress has been made in the formulation
and execution of joint plans and programs since the First Summit
of the Americas was held in Miami in December 1994, the leaders
expressed their resolve to redouble their efforts to "continue
reforms designed to improve the living conditions of the peoples
of the Americas and to achieve a mutually supportive community,"
the Declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that globalization offered great
opportunities for progress to the region and opened up new areas
of cooperation for the hemispheric community. "With steadfast
determination to reap its benefits and to face its challenges, we
will give special attention to the most vulnerable countries and
social groups in the Hemisphere."
</P>
<P>
Education was on the top of the agenda for the Santiago Summit.
"Education is the determining factor for the political,social,
cultural and economic development of our peoples," the Declaration
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We undertake to facilitate access of all inhabitants of the
Americas to preschool, primary, secondary and higher education,
and we will make learning a lifelong process," it said. "In order
to meet our goals within the agreed timeframes, we reaffirm our
commitment to invest greater resources in this important area, and
to encourage civil society to participate in developing
education."
</P>
<P>
The 34 leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate
their efforts in fighting against corruption, money laundering,
terrorism, weapon and drug trafficking and all forms of
discrimination, and for strengthening democracy, justice and
promotion of human rights on the Hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Readjust Foreign Policy, PM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The setback in Turkey's bid for
full membership of the European Union (EU) has forced Ankara to
reconsider its ties with world powers, Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remarks at a press conference here on the
performance of his government in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Describing EU's attitude toward Turkey as "discriminatory,"
Yilmaz said Turkey's strong reliance on the European countries
must be changed.
</P>
<P>
"We have focused on the United States, Russia, China as well as
countries in the region since that day (when EU rejected Turkey's
bid for membership)," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has traditionally attached great importance to its
relations with the EU, especially in the economic field,
</P>
<P>
EU's Luxembourg summit held last December rejected Turkey's bid
for full membership, saying that it has much to do in human
rights, its ties with Greece as well as the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the EU decision, Ankara halted the political dialog
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that Turkey's readjustment of its foreign policy
only means that it will develop a multilateral diplomatic
strategy, adding that Ankara will continue to improve its
relations with EU and its member states.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have been at odds over the protracted Cyprus
problem. Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko: State Duma May Confirm Him as Prime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting prime minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said on Sunday that the State Duma may probably
confirm him as the prime minister on the third vote.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview with the program Itogi at the NTV
channel, Kiriyenko said, "the chance of endorsement is rather
high."
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said he was unruflfed by the outcome of the second
State Duma vote on his candidacy on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Our Home is Russia faction Alexander Shokhin
believed that the Duma will vote for any candidate, including
Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Gennday Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, said that "The
candidature of Kiriyenko is not acceptable." He stated that his
party will insist on the opposition to the president's nomination
in the third vote.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimier
Zhirinovsky said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had promised
his faction some positions in the government. If Yeltsin keeps his
words, LDP will vote for Kiriyenko, he said.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of Yabloko faction in the Duma,
said, "If the president does not change his stance, Kiriyenko will
become the prime minister anyway." In his view, the president
should nominate to the post of prime minister "a political rather
than a party figure with sufficient political prestige."
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky noted, the premier's candidate should not intend to
run in the 2000 presidential elections, but should be able to
maintain the continuity of power in case of a political or an
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: U.S. Proposals Provide Framework for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that U.S. peace proposals provide
framework for the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with visiting British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Netanyahu told reporters that "we are all aware of the fact
that there are American proposals that provide the framework for
discussions."
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Netanyahu expressed his welcome to
the U.S. peace proposals, which reportedly call on Israel to hand
over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the
second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross will return to the
region on Friday to present a modification of the American
proposals, which have been widely seen as imposing pressure on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu stressed that the number one consideration
for Israel is security and this should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that any redeployment in the West Bank
should be linked to the fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Blair, as the current president of the European Union (EU),
also said that the American proposals are "proper basis" for
advancing the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU will do its best to help Israel and the
Palestinians make a breakthrough in the peace talks, which have
been deadlocked since Israel began construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Blair is currently on his five-day visit in the Middle East
region, which has taken him to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. He
will also hold talks with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat Monday in Gaza city.

<HEADLINE> Second Summit of Americas Concludes in Santiago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The 2-day Second Summit of the
Americas wounded up here Sunday with the 34 leaders signing the
Santiago Declaration and adopting its complementary Action Plan for
pushing forward the process for a Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Declaration announced the 34 leaders consensus of
formally launching negotiations for the duty-free area across the
Americas by 2005. The 41-page new Plan of Actions put forward some
concrete plans for the hemispheric integration in education,
political system, economic integration and free trade, as well as
poverty-reduction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the summit, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle said that the Santiago meeting has formally
broken the grounds for the creation of the largest free trade areas
in history, and also established clear objectives and identified
concrete means for achieving the goal.
</P>
<P>
"We have approved a solid and far-reaching document containing a
large number of short-and medium-term measures, aimed at directly
improving the quality of life for the inhabitants of the Americas,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton termed the journey from Miami where
the First Summit of the Americas was held in December 1994, to
Santiago, as "from words to deeds."
</P>
<P>
He urged the leaders of the West Hemisphere to "continue to stand
fast for democracy for the entire hemisphere, with no hold-outs and no
backsliders." He also called for continued efforts to bring the free
economies of the Americas together and to make concrete progress
toward that goal by the year 2000, including greater transparency in
government procurement and banking operations.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Willing to Meet Arafat on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Sunday declared his willingness to meet Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat anywhere in order to advance the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that I am prepared to go anywhere at
any time, and specifically next month, to any location, and
possibly to London, to try to advance the (peace) process,"
Netanyahu told a joint news conference with visiting British Prime
Minister Tony Blair following their two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
While declaring that Israel would not yield on some critical
issues such as security, Netanyahu said that, with good will on
all sides, it is possible to arrive at a breakthrough through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Blair welcomed Netanyahu's willingness to meet with Arafat,
saying that with good negotiations "there is a chance that we can
get the type of agreement that can give people peace with security
in the long term."
</P>
<P>
Noting the widespread frustration across the region due to the
over one-year deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
Blair urged Israelis and the Palestinians to make real efforts to
resume talks so to move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"And the best cure for that frustration is actually that
progress is there and can be seen, and people believe that there
are positive and concrete steps being taken in order to bring
about a negotiated settlement," Blair told the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace agreement he secured in the Northern
Ireland peace talks, Blair said he believes that as long as people
continue talking, the prospect for progress in the peace talks
will grow accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Blair recently helped broker a power-sharing agreement between
the Protestants and the Catholics of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But he played down any expectation for his visit here to
achieve drastic breakthrough, saying there exists huge difference
between Northern Ireland peace process and the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While securing Netanyahu's commitment to meet with Arafat to
discuss ways of breaking the prolonged deadlock, Blair carefully
avoided the impression that he was trying to upstage the role of
the United States as the leading mediator in the process.
</P>
<P>
He said any discussions would be based on the U.S. proposal on
Israeli further troop redeployment, to be brought here later this
week by the U.S. special peace coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Blair, visiting in the capacity of the European Union's
rotating Presidency, specified on the issues that the EU wants to
play a crucial role, such as the opening of Gaza airport and the
Karni industrial park between Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived here Sunday afternoon from Jordan, and paid a
visit to Israel's Holocaust Museum and laid a wreath at the
grave site of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Mount
Herzl.
</P>
<P>
Before Jordan, he had already visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia
to discuss with Arab leaders ways of advancing the Middle East
peace process. On Monday, Blair is to travel to Gaza to hold
talks with Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Studying Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here
today that a course on Deng Xiaoping Theory for college students
is especially important, because they are successors in the cause
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks while speeking at a forum on teaching Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory is the most
important requirement in the implementation of the spirit of the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and that
colleges should make greater efforts in compiling textbooks to
arm students with the theory.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Marxism in modern
China, is the only way to settle the fate of the Chinese nation
and that only when students' minds are unified under Deng Xiaoping
Theory and the basic lines of the Party can they be qualified
successors in the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the principle of integrating theory with
practice must be used in studying Deng Xiaoping Theory and that
this was important in Beijing University's success in teaching the
theory.
</P>
<P>
Significant issues in the reforms and opening-up must be
part of the education, he said, and teachers need to adopt various
teaching methods like discussion groups, videos, or the study of
documents to stimulate the students.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the requirement for qualified teachers,
saying that it is only when teachers improve that Deng Xiaoping
Theory can be taught well.
</P>
<P>
Li asked the Ministry of Education and its subordinates to
work hard at compiling textbooks on Deng Xiaoping Theory to
provide more efficient education.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)'s basket of seven crudes rose
slightly to 12.63 U.S. dollars a barrel last week, from 12.59
dollars a week earlier, the secretariat of the leading
international oil group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The average crude oil price in March stood at 12.41 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that daily oil production of OPEC countries in
March was about 27.41 million barrels, 100,000 barrels less than
the average daily output in February.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers attended a special meeting last month at
which they decided to set the daily production ceiling at 26.3
million barrels, starting from April 1. The move was aimed at
boosting oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes fell to 10.91
dollars a barrel on March 16 and oil markets experienced nine-year
lows the next day as producers failed to curb the swelling supply.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC groups Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab
Emirates. It is estimated that OPEC members possess 75 percent of
the world's known reserves of crude oil.

working on a draft of regulations for a mutual fund started by
Sino-foreign corporations, according to Zhou Zhengqing, chairman

<HEADLINE> Iran, Germany Urged to Repair Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Vice Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Hassan Rowhani Monday called on Germany and Iran
to rebuild confidence in order to repair their stalled relations.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani issued the call in his meeting with visiting German
parliamentarian Gunger Verhugen, who is also vice president of the
Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the German parliament, according
to the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the confidence between the two nations has been
damaged and therefore the two countries should build mutual
confidence and repair the damage inflicted on their relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Germany cooled down their relations in April last
year after the Berlin court verdict accused Iranian leaders of
sponsoring terrorist actions against Iranian Kurdish rebel leaders
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-Bonn rapprochement was also retarded by Iran's
death sentence on a German merchant, Helmut Hoffer, who was jailed
in Iran for having illegal sexual relations with an Iranian
woman.
</P>
<P>
Verhugen arrived here on Monday to urge Iran to release Hoffer
in order to remove hurdles for normalization of relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani lauded Verhugen for his visit to Iran, saying that the
best way to gain knowledge about Iran was face-to-face
negotiations with Iranian officials and direct contact with the
government and the people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the best way to know Iran is the direct contacts
with the officials and exchange of diplomatic delegations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The German parliamentarian said that Iran plays a key part in
the security of the region and any security arrangement without
Iran's presence is not possible at all.
</P>
<P>
He said that his visit to Tehran was aimed at improving
Tehran-Bonn relations and getting acquainted with Iran's views,
adding that Germany is willing to develop relations with Iran in
economic, political and other areas.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that his visit would serve to upgrade the level of
bilateral relations, calling for fostering of parliamentary
relations between the two countries.

conference opened here Monday for dialog with the government on
the Gulf state's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is being held at a time of Kuwait's highest

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Labor Dispute at Critical Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The dispute between the 1,400
sacked Australian dock workers and their employer Patrick
Stevedores reached a critical point on Monday as the company,
backed by the Australian government, has gained an upper hand over
thousands of protesting union members in a court battle.
</P>
<P>
Victorian state's Supreme Court issued an order on Monday
barring all the public, not just the workers and their supporters
from protesting Melbourne's docks, as national stevedore Patrick
said it may seek to widen the ban to other states.
</P>
<P>
The order was regarded as a major setback for the workers
trying to recover their jobs and their union, and a victory for
Patrick, which sacked its entire unionized workforce on April 7
throughout the nation in a bid to break the 60 year-old monopoly
of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) over the nation's docks.
</P>
<P>
With the workers and other union members barred from strikes,
including public protest ban set to cover major ports in other
states, the dispute reached a critical point.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say if the union abides by the order and the law,
Patrick and the government would achieve their goals. Otherwise,
the union would almost certainly clash with the police who are
ordered to enforce the order and law.
</P>
<P>
Greg Combet, assistant secretary of the Australian Council of
Trade Unions (ACTU), vowed on Monday to defy the order, which bans
the public from being within 200 meters of Patrick's Melbourne
terminals where protesters have maintained a vigil for nearly a
fortnight.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, more than 2,000 National Union of Workers (NUW)
members walked off the job to join the dockside protest in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another development, the Australian government
moved to counterattack foreign labor unions' ban on Australian
farm produce.
</P>
<P>
American, British and Japanese unions have ordered bans on
Australian farm produce, over Patrick stevedores' sacking of its
unionized workforce.
</P>
<P>
In response, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer asked
Genta Holmes Hawkins, United States ambassador to Australia, on
Monday to pass on Australia's concern at the international
boycott.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard also condemned the
boycott, saying he was sickened by the international boycott as he
strongly backed any legal action against unions in the ongoing
waterfront dispute.
</P>
<P>
As the dispute escalated, protesting union members' blockade of
some ports have already affected the country's import and export.
</P>
<P>
As containers unloaded by Patrick's new non-union workforce
around the country continued to pile up, with most terminals
between 50 and 90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
In New South Wales state, where Sydney is located, more
frustrated farmers blocked Premier Bob Carr's exit from an airport
in the north-west of the state for more than an hour, accusing the
premier of opposition labor party of supporting the union.
</P>
<P>
The Cattle Council of Australia (CCA) warned Australia's status
as the world's largest beef exporter was at risk from the
industrial action, while the Australian Cotton Industry Council
said cotton exports worth 120 million U.S. dollars were at risk.

MOGADISHU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- New hope for the release of
the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) aid workers
appears in the Somali capital at a time when a word of threat to
kill them was also spread by the abductors if no ransom is
offered until Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali Mahdi Mohamed's special envoy for the release
efforts, there's no such danger surrounding the ICRC staff
members kidnapped by the Somali gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ugas Abdulle, former Mogadishu mayor, accompanied by the
prestigious Imam of Abgal, Imam Mohamud Imam Omar, Monday
continued the negotiations which have been characterized as their
best stage since the abduction on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Both sides, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and the abductors have tightened
security in the area as Ali Mahdi re-engaged for the first time
heavily armed militiamen along Mogadishu's former green line
which has been abolished immediately after the Cairo agreement
signed in late December last year, while the abductors are
guarding their hostages attentively by using six battle wagons.
</P>
<P>
The militia deployment came after a suspicion arose that the
kidnappers might even try to escape to the south of the capital
if the pressure on them further increases. However, Ali Mahdi's
side had ruled out the use of force for the release of the ICRC
people.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's top lieutenants were very optimistic Monday,
saying they can assure the safe release of the ICRC people within
Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said there is no way that the kidnappers may kill
their hostages even though they might pose verbal threats and
torture. They are also worried that if they start shooting, Ali
Mahdi's overwhelming power will be put into use against them.
"The devils are always more worried for themselves than others."
</P>
<P>
The abducted had reportedly been offered new Somali
traditional clothes, electric fans, a generator and they are fed
well three times a day. This is the most serious abduction case
in Somalia since the civil war broke out seven years ago.

<HEADLINE> IFP Has No Comment on ANC's Call for Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) said Monday that it had no further comment on
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's call for a merger between the IFP
and his African National Congress (ANC), South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"The IFP would like to confirm that it has issued statements
regarding this matter in the past, and at present, the party has
no further comment on this subject," IFP spokesman Lauren
Winchester reportedly said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki repeated his call for a merger on Sunday at the
unveiling of former ANC president Oliver Tambo's tombstone at
Wattville outside Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The IFP, the biggest black-based opposition party, had
dismissed the idea of a merge after President Nelson Mandela said
late last year that he would welcome it.
</P>
<P>
The IFP also said Monday that it was surprised by the ANC's
attack on IFP chairman and Kwazulu-Natal Premier Ben Ngubane
after he addressed the Institute of Race Relations on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said Ngubane criticized the proposed employment equity
bill, which is under parliamentary scrutiny, as reinforcing
racial classification in the name of employment equity.
</P>
<P>
The new employment bill, which at best was expected to be
passed in parliament by July, requires companies with 50 or more
employees prepare and implement specific employment equity plans,
or they could face huge fines.
</P>
<P>
The IFP said Ngubane was deeply worried about economic growth,
without which there would be growing poverty for millions of
black people.
</P>
<P>
The IFP called on Kwazulu-Natal ANC chairman Jacob Zuma to
repudiate the "irresponsible" statements about Ngubane, which
described him as a "desperado" and as a "number one enemy of
transformation".

<HEADLINE> Slow Growth In Chinese Revenues And Expenditures In 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance
announced today that revenues were up 8.7 percent in the first
quarter of this year from the same quarter last year, while
expenditures rose 16.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the revenues exceeded the expenditure by 27.6 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry, central government revenues for the
quarter were up 5.3 percent, and local government revenues, 12.2
percent. Central government expenditures grew by 16.9 percent, and
local government expenditures, 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Revenue growth, especially in sales taxes and value-added
taxes, slowed down somewhat for the quarter because of a decline
in industrial production, prices and market demand, a Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the country's budgetary practices in
the first quarter is basically in line with the situation of the
national economy.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Warns Farmers against Sabotaging Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai Monday warned commercial farmers against
sabotaging the land redistribution exercise.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Zimbabwe News Agency that owners of some
designated farms might try to destroy property or
indiscriminately shoot wild animals as a way of sabotaging the
land reform program.
</P>
<P>
"We have people in every farm who see what is happening. If
we discover anyone behaving in an anomalous way, the government
will take drastic action against these people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of people would start moving on the
designated farms in June this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are starting with a small number of people in order to
test our capacity with implementing agencies, agricultural
technical extension services and the district development fund,"
Kangai said, adding the program would then accelerate from
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister described as "rubbish" reports that
the government was backing down on the land-redistribution
exercise.
</P>
<P>
"What we are only doing is de-listing some farms which do not
conform to the required criteria such as those that are derelict,
under-utilized or owned by people with more than one farm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government designated more than 1,400 farms to
resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Economy Still in Doldrums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit during
the first nine months of the 1997-98 fiscal year (June 30 -July
31) has reduced extensively. But, the country's overall economic
performance is still not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) show
that during the first three quarters of the 1997-98 fiscal year,
Pakistan's trade deficit has narrowed to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars
compared to 2.62 billion dollars in the same period of the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of 48.47 percent in the trade deficit is mainly
due to the 11.11 percent fall in imports and 4.7 percent increase
in exports.
</P>
<P>
The imports during the first nine months of the current fiscal
year stood at 7.77 billion dollars while the exports stood at 6.42
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chronic trade deficit is believed to be one of the major
problems inflicting Pakistan's economy. The massive drop in the
trade deficit is by no means a welcome sign.
</P>
<P>
However, it could hardly change the whole economic scenario, at
least for the time being. And if one goes deep into the realities
of the foreign trade sector, it may not be difficult to reach a
conclusion: The reduce of trade deficit is achieved due mainly to
the continued recession facing the economy.
</P>
<P>
The decline in imports during the past nine months was
witnessed mainly in imports of machinery, petroleum and
agricultural products which are badly needed for Pakistan's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by BOS, during the period
imports of machinery went down by 25.23 percent from 2.41 billion
dollars in the corresponding period of last fiscal year to 1.80
billion dollars, signifying slowdown of economic activity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The major decline in this group was recorded in imports of
power generating machines, which fell by 43 percent from 696
million dollars to 395 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters of 1997-98 fiscal year, imports
of textile machinery, construction and mining machinery witnessed
a major growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 4.7 percent increase of exports during the
period was mainly due to exports of primary commodities, which
stood at 936 million dollars against 762 million dollars in the
corresponding months of last fiscal year, showing an increase of
22 percent.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The second Summit of the Americas ended in Santiago on
Sunday with U.S. President Bill Clinton and 33 other Western
Hemisphere leaders signing a declaration that promised everything
from a rethinking of the drug war to negotiations that could
create the world's largest free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates will start off the
week by debuting the company's newest version of its software
for personal computers, the Windows 98 operation.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A small group of unarmed Palestinian shepherds confronted
three Jewish settlers on Sunday on a rocky field that both claimed
as theirs, and in the ensuing fight one of the settlers was shot
dead, another was injured and one of the Arabs was severely
wounded.
</P>
<P>
-- Astronauts on the space shuttle Columbia removed the fetuses
of nine pregnant mice to see how the nervous system develops in
space. The experiment may help scientists learn whether gravity is
needed for normal brain development.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. trade deficit swelled to 12.11 billion U.S. dollars
in February amid falling export to Asia. Meanwhile, Japan's
merchandise trade surplus grew substantially to 9.51 billion

<P>
However, the figures by BOS revealed that textile and carpet
exports, two of the major foreign currency earners of Pakistan,
registered a major fall.
</P>
<P>
Local economists held that the fall of these two export items
are mainly because of the economic crisis in east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Multiple taxes, including the levy of sales tax on the cotton
sector which effectively tightens their liquidity, and the delay
in payment of duty drawbacks are believed to be some of the major
factors that have a negative impact on exports.
</P>
<P>
With hardly one quarter to go before the ending of the current
fiscal year (June 30), the much-expected economic recovery seems
to be far away.
</P>
<P>
Besides the unsatisfactory performance on foreign trade and
balance of payment on foreign debt, figures concerning the
domestic industrial production and revenue collection also
indicated that Pakistan's economy is still in doldrums.
</P>
<P>
As far as the domestic growth is concerned, the industrial
production grew more than seven percent during the first three
quarters of the 1997-98 fiscal year. However, a sole area
responsible for the growth was soft drinks, which grew as a result
of reduced tax on the industry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the heavy industry responsible for the
much desired industrial growth revival did not turn up. In fact,
the import of heavy industrial machinery dropped heavily, giving
the economy a true bubble nature.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most important economic indicators, revenue
collection remains the worst area. During the first three quarters
of the current fiscal year, the central government collected only
197 billion rupees (4.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that no more than 298 billion rupees (6.8
billion dollars) of revenue could be collected by the central
government during the outgoing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Board of Revenue (CBR) is, therefore, in a real fix
once again with a massive shortfall of about 127 billion rupees
(2.8 billion dollars) in revenue collection to meet the original
target of 324 billion rupees (7.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pakistani government set the export target for
the 1997-98 fiscal year at 9.57 billion dollars. During the first
nine months, it has only achieved 6.42 billion dollars of exports.
It would need to export at the average monthly rate of 797 million
dollars in order to come at par with the target, in contrast to
the performance of the monthly export of 713 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the continued slowdown in economic activities, it seems to
be hard, if not virtually impossible, for Pakistan to achieve the
desired export target during the remaining three months of the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
And it may also be a tough job for the CBR to fill the vacancy
of 127 billion rupee revenue shortfall before the end of the
1997-98 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Volkswagen Brings Out New Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive
Company Ltd. introduced its Santana 2000 GSi car to the Beijing
market today.
</P>
<P>
The new car has an AJR engine jointly developed by Shanghai
Volkswagen and Germany's Volkswagen and Audi AG.
</P>
<P>
It also has an ABS system, an anti-theft device, and a
freon-free air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
A company official said that the car is suited to Chinese road
conditions and marks a step forward in power, comfort, safety, and
environmental awareness.
</P>
<P>
Hong Jiming, managing director of Shanghai Volkswagen, said
that the new model is meant to help the company deal with the
increasingly intense competition.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the new car is about 10,000 yuan (1,200 US
dollars) more than the previous model, but that the new technology
far more than compensates for that.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Volkswagen has sold more than one million cars in
China and accounts for near 50 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
It triggered a price war among manufacturers by lowering the
prices of the popular Santana at the beginning of this year. A
number of other manufacturers have already put new models on the
market in the past six months.

<HEADLINE> 5th Nigerian Party Adopted Abacha as Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Grassroots Democratic Movement
(GDM) Monday become the last of Nigeria's five political parties
that have adopted the head of the military government, General
Sani Abacha, as its sole candidate for the August 1 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
GDM's decision paved the way for an unopposed election for
Abacha, who took power in 1993 and has promised to give up power
to an elected civilian government this October.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's candidacy was approved at the GDM's national
convention in Maiduguri, Borno State, which lasted from Sunday
afternoon until Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the four other parties which don't have any aspirants,
the GDM's adoption of Abacha received strong resistance from
supporters of its three aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Tunji Braithwaite, a Lagos-based lawyer, withdrew his
candidacy Sunday night in protest, after an amendment was done to
the party's constitution so that "a registered member of the GDM
may nominate any Nigerian to contest for the party's presidential
candidacy."
</P>
<P>
Another aspirant, Josiah Obiechina, a businessman from Abia
State, failed to secure a nomination.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was eventually adopted in a ballot, in which he won
1,368 votes against 408 for a third aspirant, former police head
Mohammed Yusuf.
</P>
<P>
The four other parties, the United Nigeria Congress Party, the
Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN), the Congress for National
Consensus and the National Center Party of Nigeria (NCPN), have
all adopted Abacha as their sole candidate last week.
</P>
<P>
The DPN and the NCPN both amended their constitutions to
accommodate the candidacy of Abacha, who is not a member of any
of the five parties.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who has been silent on whether or not he will run, has
not reacted to the parties' decisions.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that in the absence of any other
candidate, the August presidential election will be replaced by a
national referendum.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Companies Urged to Improve Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- There is need for companies to
continuously improve productivity by raising product quality and
technology through the adoption of efficient manufacturing
processes, Zimbabwe's industry and commerce deputy minister Obert
Mpofu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day international conference on manufacturing
processes, systems and operations in the country's second largest
city of Bulawayo, Mpofu said a nation's standard of living
depended on the capacity of its companies to achieve high levels
of productivity over a period of time, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained productivity growth requires that an economy
continually upgrades itself. Most less developed countries have
great potential as exporters of manufactured products," Mpofu
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, many of them fail to utilise the potential because
of weak or almost non-existent manufacturing systems," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's manufacturing sector contributed between 18
percent and 25 percent of GDP and absorbed 17 percent of the
labour force but exports from the sector only formed 18 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the country needed to export more given
the size of its manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
He said firms in less industrialised countries had negative
perceptions about manufacturing processes, systems and operations
management despite overwhelming benefits of putting these in
place.
</P>
<P>
"Redesigning the manufacturing processes can lead to
substantial reductions in overall production costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop which is jointly organised by the
Zimbabwe International Trade Fair and the National University of
Science and Technology. It is aimed at bringing together
industrial and academic research workers from around the world to
discuss issues and challenges to improve the manufacturing and
performance of small-to-medium scale enterprises in less
developed countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Union Communications
Minister Buta Singh was sacked by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP)-led coalition government here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sacking of Buta Singh, who has been chargesheeted in a
bribery case of MPs in 1993, came after he refused to resign when
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Sunday night suggested to him
that he step down, the prime minister's political advisor Pramod
Mahajah said at a press conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Union minister who resigned or was sacked
since swearing-in on March 19 this year. Union Surface Transport
Minister P. Muthiah resigned on April 8 after he was chargesheeted
by a local court for his illegally getting 0.119 million U.S.
dollars from the public funds.
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Vajpayee, Jayalalitha, chief of All-India Anna
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), one of the BJP allies,
demanded that the prime minister drop Buta Singh and other two
tainted Union ministers from his government or re-induct her party
nominee S. Muthiah. The three cabinet ministers have criticized
Jayalalitha before. AIADMK has 17 MPs in Parliament and their
support is essential for the survival of the Vajpayee coalition
government.

intra-day high of 4286.84 on sustained speculative support, yet
prices fell back later as operators along with financial

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese law makers will make
inspection tours around the country this year to check out the
enforcement of five national laws and two resolutions by the
Standing Committee of the National People' Congress(NPC).
</P>
<P>
The five laws are about agriculture, water and land
conservation, taxation administration, marine environmental
protection and utilization of results of scientific and
technological researches.
</P>
<P>
The two resolutions are on strengthening legal education and
comprehensive management of public security.
</P>
<P>
A meeting attended by the NPC Standing Committee's chairman and
vice chairmen today decided to form several inspection groups that
will go to localities and grassroots units to look at how these
laws and resolutions have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The inspection groups should work hard to know the true
situations by holding panel discussions, conducting sample surveys
and visit individual persons who have opinions on particular
issues, in addition to hearing reports by local officials, the
meeting pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The inspection results should be reported to the NPC Standing
Committee which will raise the issues to the law enforcement
departments, according to the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Satisfied with Kawana Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who returned from Japan Sunday evening, is satisfied with his
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Kawana.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced
this Monday. Yeltsin described the second informal meeting with
Hashimoto as "eight scores out of the possible ten", the Itar-Tass
news agency quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders earmarked more contacts,
agreed to broaden out the Yeltsin-Hashimoto plan and discussed a
Russian-Japan Peace Treaty and economic cooperation in the
southern Kurile region.
</P>
<P>
The next summit between the Russian and Japanese leaders is
scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the Summit of Eight
meeting in Birmingham, Britain, the secretary told a news briefing
at Yuzhno-Shakhalinsk, in Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky, who accompanied Yeltsin during his Japanese
trip, refuted allegations that his country may cede four southern
Kurile islands to Japan after Yeltsin's visit. He said such
guesswork was "groundless."
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Russia and Japan over the sovereignty of
the four islands has remained unsettled for many years. Both
countries have claimed sovereignty over the territory.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian-Japanese Peace Treaty, Yastrzhembsky said
Russian diplomats were drafting the details in line with Russian
policies on territorial integrity, which were set by the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Hashimoto held their second informal meeting in
Kawana, Japan, on April 18 and 19.

<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Interior Minister
Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein arrived here on Monday to attend
joint meetings of Arab interior and justice ministers due to open
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency said that about 30
ministers will initial a pan-Arab anti-terrorism pact during the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Hussein described the pact as "a step forward towards achieving
an atmosphere of security and stability and opening prospects of
cooperation and serious anti-terrorism efforts."
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by Sudan's security chief to Cairo
after years of tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Hussein will hold talks with his Egyptian counterpart Habib
Ibrahim el-Adli on issues of mutual concern, according to the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The Egypt-Sudan ties soured after an Islamic government came to
power in Khartoum in 1989. The two quarreled bitterly over border
disputes and traded accusations of harboring opposition members
and militants.
</P>
<P>
A thaw seems within reach now that the two countries have
voiced readiness to resolve their problems through dialog and have
taken several positive steps.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the Egyptian Voice of Arabs Radio,
Hussein said the bilateral relations are making great strides and
that further efforts should be exerted to achieve full solidarity
and integration.

CANBERRA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Rupert Murdoch's international
media group News Corp Ltd made an unusual move into the
telecommunications industry in Russia on Monday with the
acquisition of a stake in PLD Telekom Inc worth 81 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The global media concern announced it would purchase a 38
percent stake in PLD Telekom Inc, a NASDAQ listed
telecommunications company with operations in Russia, from
London-based Cable and Wireless Plc (C&AMP;W), the Australian
Associated Press reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
C&AMP;W later confirmed a sale price of 81 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said News Corp's move indicated its intention to
launch pay television media into Russia, despite no direct
statement of such motives.

News Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch focused
on the telecommunications benefits of the deal which will give
News Corp exposure to Russia's market.

"This agreement offers an opportunity for News Corp to be part
of a company that is prepared to capitalize on the growth of
telecommunications services in this market," Murdoch said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe the move provided a toe-hold in Russia and
eventually East Europe, previously untapped markets for the media
giant.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
at 64.72 U.S. cents in Sydney on Monday from 65.38 U.S. cents at
Friday's close after a report from Access Economics said Australia
was facing its toughest export environment in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The influential Australian think tank said the worst of the
Asian economic downturn would not be felt here until next year.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the Aussie will be under pressure for the rest
of the week. There are not too many positives out there," said
Brent Aggar, associate director of foreign exchange with Macquarie
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of the ACCESS report is intriguing given the
dockyards strike and the ACTU (Australian Council of Trade Unions)
announcing there will be nationwide strikes."
</P>
<P>
The dispute on Australia's waterfront remains a negative for
the Australian dollar as there is no sign of comprise between
Patrick Stevedores and the 1,400 employees whom Patrick sacked
almost two weeks ago, and the employees' representative, the
Maritime Union of Australia.
</P>
<P>
A weak Australian dollar means a rate cut is less likely
because lower interest rates could undermine it further.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was at 85.68 Japanese yen from
a close of 86.22 yen last week and at 1.1696 Deutsche marks from
1.1801 marks.

seeking a second term and would step down on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos welcomed Estrada's offer, but clarified at the same time
that the vice president was not the first to make such an offer.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome all the offers of all the candidates because Vice
President Estrada was not the first one to offer a position to
me," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos reiterated that he does not want to be inactive after he
"graduates" in June, adding he would be around to give both
solicited and unsolicited advice to the new government.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Turning Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The red tide that hit the coastal
waters of China's Guangdong Province and Hong Kong is beginning to
ebb and water in some places has returned to normal, an official
from the Ministry of Agriculture said here today.
</P>
<P>
So far, the red tide has killed more than 300 tons of fish off
Guangdong, causing losses of more than 40 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Red tide is a dense aquatic population of microscopic organisms
that breed from the abundance of salts in surface water combined
with a certain amount of sunlight. The micro-organisms can appear
in most of the world's waters and most are harmless. However, some
dinoflagellates (single-cell organisms or algae) can be harmful
because they produce a poison that paralyzes and kills fish. They
may also suffocate the fish by consuming nearly all the oxygen in
the water.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Province was hit by a small-scale red tide last
October. Environmental protection specialists say that sewage
discharges were also an important cause of the dead fish, as well
as climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
The related state departments are closely watching the
development of red tide and urge the local authorities to keep
monitoring it, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Strives to Curb Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is striving to reduce the
unemployment rate in urban areas to 5.86 percent, and raise the
employment of rural labourers to 73.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The targets have also been set at five percent and 75 percent
respectively for the year 2000, the Vietnam News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has restructured businesses to raise
their efficiency, and encouraged all economic sectors to invest in
rural areas to generate more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The government also provided soft loans to poor farmers to help
them develop side-line, household-based production.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs is
making joint efforts with relevant organizations to organize job
training courses to meet the increasing demand for skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
The south-east Asian nation experienced a 6.01 percent urban
jobless rate in the last months of 1997 and the first months of
1998.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, job hunters accounted for about 27 percent of
the potential labour force.
</P>
<P>
The present financial crises sweeping through Southeast Asia,
coupled with low competitiveness of home-made products, are blamed
for the unsatisfactory urban job market.

<HEADLINE> Blair Unhappy with Rash Netanyahu: Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair was not happy with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin
Netanyahu's earlier announcement that London is to host an
Israeli-Palestinian summit, British Embassy officials said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday meeting, Blair told Netanyahu that London is
willing to host an Israeli-Palestinian peace conference, to be
attended by Netanyahu, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat, as well as Blair and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in early May.
</P>
<P>
But this could only be announced after Blair's consultation
with Arafat in Gaza on Monday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The summit idea was discussed by Blair and Netanyahu when the
two met alone. When announced by Netanyahu Sunday evening in a
joint press conference with Blair, it came as a surprise even to
the senior officials who joined the two in the larger meeting.
</P>
<P>
"For such summit, you have to seek support from Arafat,
otherwise, there will be no such summit at all," said the
officials, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here assumed the U.S. was aware of this
impending move and unequivocally in favor, mainly because of the
positive impact it could have in reviving the peace process and
high-profile status it would give the European Union as an
effective partner in the peace-making effort.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the proposed summit would be the American
proposals to end the deadlock between Israel and the PNA on the
extent of Israel's next redeployment in the West Bank. The U.S. is
in favor of an withdrawal from 13 percent of the territories, four
percentage points more than Israel is willing to give up.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor party Chairman Ehud Barak, while meeting with
Blair here Monday morning, said the summit idea is vary good,
which would help break the impasse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Sha'ath said in Gaza Monday that the outcome of the meeting
between Blair and Netanyahu suggested no positive changes of
Israel's policy towards the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Understanding on major issues of the peace process must be
achieved before the summit, he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair also met with Israeli President Ezer Weizman here Monday
morning before travelling to Gaza, where he is to hold talks with
Arafat later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived here from Jordan on Sunday to continue his
current Middle East trip, which had taken him to Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He will hold another round of talks with Netanyahu Tuesday
morning before leaving for home.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Center to be Operational in India This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer giant Microsoft's
proposed software development center in India's Hyderabad city is
likely to become operational in the second half of this year,
official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first Microsoft center outside the United
States. The proposed center would serve as a strategic arm of
Microsoft for developing its core technologies. The center is
expected to focus its research work on windows operating system
and backoffice technologies which formed the fastest growing area
for Microsoft's business in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The project will provide an opportunity for local talent to
work on cutting edge technologies and develop products that are
truly world-class," the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
After a year-long evaluation process, the U.S. software giant
in March this year finally settled in favor of Hyderabad, capital
of Andhra Pradesh, in southern India to locate its center. The
State government has initiated "information technology friendly"
policies and has high quality professionals, the sources further
said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Dark Horse in Philippine Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- When then Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
decided to throw his hat in the ring last December, many doubted
this partyless late comer would be a major contender in the
country's presidential polls to be held on May 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
At that time, conventional wisdom held that the May 11 showdown
would be between Vice President Joseph Estrada, the candidate of
the United Opposition, and Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia, the Ramos-anointed candidate for the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the 90-day official campaign period started on
February 9, however, Lim emerged as the closest rival to
front-runner Estrada, a former action movie star who used to play
Robinhood gangsters in his youth.
</P>
<P>
In a February survey conducted by the Social Weather Station
(SWS), the country's most respected pollster, Lim, picked by the
tiny Liberal Party as its standard bearer, garnered 14 percent of
support against 28 percent for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who resigned in March to show his resolve in his quest for
the presidency, retained the second place in a March SWS poll in a
tie with De Venecia, who has the ruling party's rich resources at
his disposal but had been lackluster in many previous opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
Now, many poll pundits are betting that the presidential fight
will be a three-cornered one among the three major candidates of
the 11 official presidential contenders -- Estrada, Lim and De
Venecia.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with Lim's performance compared with
others who have strong political machinery and have prepared for
years," said Miguel Gil, a media strategist of Lim.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Lim who had not been publicly considered for the
presidency until late last year, Estrada set his eyes on the
country's highest post six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Estrada originally tried to run in the 1992 presidential
elections, but later slid down to vie for his present post in
favor of another candidate. He formed the United Opposition out of
three parties last June.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who played a major role in helping Ramos land the
presidential palace in 1992 by establishing the Lakas party, has
long been seen as a certain successor of Ramos by his supporters
and himself.
</P>
<P>
Lim's surge was due to his anti-crime record and the fact that
he is backed by former president Corazon Aquino and the
influential Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin, the country's
leading prelate, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the issue of unchecked kidnappings and other
crimes has worried the people no end, Lim came into the scene at
the right time, they said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of law and order is the second major concern for the
electorate in this year's general elections, according to an
earlier SWS poll, which showed economy is No. one election issue.
</P>
<P>
"Much of this support may be traced to the Manila mayor's
'dirty harry image' as an uncompromising crime fighter and the
endorsement of former president Corazon Aquino," said columnist
Nelson Navarro.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, the law-and-order stance has given him a
strong base in the middle classes and the Cory plus Cardinal Sin
alliance has endowed his campaign with the initial organizational
and financial boost," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Dirty Harry" after the character popularized by
Hollywood star Clint Eastwood, Lim was well known for his valorous
style in cracking down on criminals when he was a police chief of
a Manila district.
</P>
<P>
When the retired police general became Manila mayor in 1992, he
continued to push hard against criminal syndicates. He launched a
high-profile clean-up of Manila's red-light districts in 1992 and
then a massive shame campaign against drug pushers in the city.
</P>
<P>
During his controversial but effective shame campaign, Lim led
the police to stray-paint warnings on convicted and suspected drug
dealers to keep youths away.
</P>
<P>
Lim's anti-crime record endeared him to Manila residents and
the country's powerful Roman Catholic Church. He won easily a
second term in the 1995 midterm election.
</P>
<P>
In his campaign platform, Lim promised to restore peace and
order in the country, rid the government of graft and corruption,
and offer free college education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
As a no-nonsense leader, Lim has an advantage in charisma over
many other candidates, including Estrada and De Venecia.
</P>
<P>
Reena Guiwa, a student of the University of the Philippines,
said: "I will vote for Lim because of his strong leadership... I
dislike Erap (nickname for Estrada), a womanizer and a drunkard."
</P>
<P>
The portly Estrada, a college dropout, has been accused by his
critics of having a series of vices, including drinking,
womanizing and gambling. Although he denied all the allegations,
the controversial ex-movie star was loathed by intellectuals and
the business community.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is also suffering an image problem which had been
blamed for a main cause of his poor rankings in many opinion
polls. Widely seen as a "trapo" (short form for traditional
politician) fond of power and good at backstage maneuvering, De
Venecia is not popular among many classes, particularly the
ordinary masses, according to some opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said Lim also has weaknesses -- lack of a
strong political party with massive grassroots following and,
probably, insufficient campaign funds as a result of his lateness
in joining the race.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the combination of a strong political
machine and money will make the difference in an election since
the two elements are vital in making political deals at the local
level.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was widely believed that if he can maintain
his current campaign momentum in the remaining 20 campaign days,
Lim will be a man to watch when the curtain opens on May 11.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said Monday that his government adopted a holistic and
people-centered approach to development.
</P>
<P>
At an opening ceremony of the ministerial segment of the 54th
Commission Session of the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Chuan said: "the
welfare of the people must be the center of our development
strategy."
</P>
<P>
It is time to view people as "more than resources, more than
cheap labor to fuel Asia's growth machine," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time we viewed people not as the means to development,
but the ends," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also vowed to redouble the government's efforts to
provide people with the best in education and health care.
</P>
<P>
"We should work with them to improve their lives, not by
turning them into cheap, unskilled labor, but by helping them to
develop the potential of their local communities and resources."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, only in a society where all people enjoy such rights
and freedoms can we achieve sustainable development and true
prosperity for our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also quoted the King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, as
saying that the Thai people should live by the concept of
self-sufficiency in order to weather the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan elaborated the concept, saying it means using traditional
strengths to complement development endeavors so as to better
prepare for globalization and market liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is confident that by aiming for reasonable rates of
growth, with better income distribution and sustainable use of
resources, Thailand should be better protected from future
economic turbulence.
</P>
<P>
"With sound fundamentals, abundant natural resources, and
well-educated and hard-working human resources, there are reasons
for optimism," Chuan added.

The last batch of aid workers left the divided capital on
Friday for Nairobi, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Mogadishu indicate that all relief services to
the city's one million inhabitants have ceased pending the
resolution of the hostage crisis that saw the abduction of 10 aid
workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies have withdrawn their staff and services until the
hostages are freed and security is improved. About 45 percent of
the city's population is dependent on relief services.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, hospitals, health centers and feeding centers
were reported to have stopped operating as the medical staff had
been flown to Nairobi. The ICRC terminated flights to Somalia
last week.
</P>
<P>
A Somali envoy in Nairobi, identified as Abdilatif Afdub, said
Sunday that Mogadishu now faced disease and starvation problems,
warning that the situation could degenerate into a humanitarian
disaster in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the city has witnessed a malaria and cholera
outbreak prior to the hostage-abduction incident of last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming 10 days, people could begin dying in large
numbers," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the withdraw of the expatriates, health authorities
had reported a daily infection rate of 10 to 20 new cases per day
for both diseases.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu does not have a functional water and sanitation
system.
</P>
<P>
However, Afdub was optimistic that the hostages, among them a
Kenyan pilot, will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
He further said Somali factional leader, Ali Mahdi Mohammed,
is negotiating with the kidnappers in the Karan District of north
Mogadishu, which he controls.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the ICRC withdrew its remaining staff and flew them
to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The workers were abducted by nearly 40 armed militiamen loyal
to a renegade member of Ali Mahdi's Hawiye clan, known as Ahmed
Adley of the Da'ud sub-clan.
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages are a South African pilot, an American, a
French, a Norwegian, a Belgian, two Swiss doctors, a German and a
Somali from the Somali Red Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are said to hve demanded a
one-million-U.S.-Dollar ransom.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman at the ICRC in Nairobi said last week that
the agency had not been approached by any faction over demands.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong Development Zone in
Shanghai celebrated its eight-year anniversary Sunday with
on-the-spot handling of simplified foreign trade formalities.
</P>
<P>
Cao Hengli, director of the Shanghai Customs Office, announced
that the move jointly launched by seven government departments
aims to accelerate the growth of overseas-oriented finance, trade
and processing industries in the development zone.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed the Customs Office's intention to sustain
cooperation with Sharp Electrical Co. in extending the automatic
account settlement networks.
</P>
<P>
As to large overseas-funded projects -- such as General
Motors' automobile joint venture, NEC's super integrated circuit
project and the Pudong International Port -- more time-saving
services will be provided in conducting Customs' formalities, Cao
said.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Office plans to lift all the barriers between the
port area and the cargo storage area of the Waigaoqiao Free Trade
Zone in Pudong within the year to allow multinational firms and
companies engaged in high-tech industries to set up distribution
centers and warehouses.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- In a move to expand in the
insurance market, Hang Seng Bank will be actively promoting an
entire range of personal insurance products in its extensive
branch network, the major bank in Hong Kong announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The products, offered by the bank's wholly-owned subsidiary
Hang Seng Insurance Co. Ltd., cover personal accident, hospital
cash, home care, domestic helper, travel and motor insurance
plans, with new benefits introduced.
</P>
<P>
When a large-scale marketing campaign is launched Tuesday, more
than 560 branch managers, assistant branch managers and customer
service officers that have been trained and registered as
insurance agents will offer professional services to customers in
the bank's 145 branches across Hong Kong .
</P>
<P>
Mok Wai-kin, general manager, retail banking of Hang Seng Bank,
and director and general manager of Hang Seng Insurance Co. Ltd.,
told a press conference: "While life insurance is unanimously
valued as the basic and most important protection among customers
and their families, personal insurance products -- in particular,
home care, hospital cash and travel insurance -- have become
increasingly popular."
</P>
<P>
This tread is reflected by the average annual growth of over 30
percent in terms of premiums in the bank's home care plans in the
past two years, Mok noted.
</P>
<P>
And compared with more matured European and United States
markets, their is plenty of room for further expanding personal
insurance services in Hong Kong, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate Drops to 7.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate declined
further from 8.3 percent as at the end of 1997 to 7.7 percent in
February, the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) said.
</P>
<P>
The continued decline of the inflation rate, from 72.8 percent
in 1995 and 29.3 percent in 1996 to the present level, was seen
by the government as a great success.
</P>
<P>
The government has also said that it will keep the inflation
rate at a single digit level.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts, however, have argued that the lower level
of inflation rate was artificial, achieved through measures like
the non-release of capital votes, according to a report by the
Post Express.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the rate could run out of order again once
the tight fiscal policies of the government were relaxed in the
process of revitalizing the depressed economy.
</P>
<P>
They also contended that the declining inflation rate has not
translated into better living standard for the people.
</P>
<P>
But the FOS explained that the fall in inflation rate does not
translate immediately into lower cost of items, pointing out it
can only start making impact when the rate falls to zero.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Withdraws From Nigeria's Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Tunji Braithwaite, one of the
three Nigerians that have expressed interests to contend for the
presidency in the August 1 election, has withdrawn his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Guardian newspaper, the
Lagos-based lawyer made the statement Sunday night in Maiduguri,
Borno State, where his party, the Grassroots Democratic Movement
(GDM) was holding a national convention, trying to choose a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The convention started at 6:35 P.M. and ran into trouble from
the beginning, when the national secretary, Ogbuefi Ozogbachi
proposed to amend the party's constitution so that "a registered
member of the GDM may nominate any Nigerian to contest for the
party's presidential candidacy."
</P>
<P>
The motion was resisted by supporters of Braithwaite and those
of two other aspirants, former police head Mohammed Yusuf, and
Josiah Obiechina, a businessman from Abia State.
</P>
<P>
Braithwaite announced his withdrawal at around 11:15 P.M.,
when the amendent was eventually passed after much confusion and
chaos.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear to me to observe that it seems that some
people are desperate, desperate to ruin this country. I have no
regrets whatsoever for the efforts we have made to salvage this
country", he said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that "I am confident that God himself will set
things right in due course in this nation. For my supporters, I
say please exercise understanding because we cannot continue in
this disgraceful thing".
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed report, the convention continued
until Monday morning, ending with the adoption of the military
government, General Sani Abacha as the sole presidential
candidate of the party.
</P>
<P>
GDM is the last of Nigeria's five political parties to take
the step. The four others, the United Nigeria Congress Party, the
Democratic Party of Nigeria, the Congress for National Consensus
and the National Center Party of Nigeria have all adopted Abacha
as their sole candidate last week.

<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The creation last Friday of a new rightwing party, "La
Droite," by former Defense Minister and president of regional
council of Rhone-Alpes Charles Millon answered the atmosphere of
the time and was welcomed not only by those who supported his
alliance with the extreme-right National Front, but also those who
don't. The French rightwing is now seeking a re-claiming of their
identity which will put together different strategies and can
hardly hide the differences in their programs.
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on arrival in Israel on
Sunday to "give a new impulsion to the peace process," was
welcomed by a new incident between Jewish settlers and
Palestinians in the West Bank in which one Jew was killed. His
visit was put under high surveillance by the Israeli authorities
who were angered by the visit to Har Homa in East Jerusalem by
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook last month.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In order to avoid further protests from farmers following
the protests by cauliflower growers, Minister of Agriculture Louis
Le Pensec will discuss state aid for the fruits and grapes growers
from the southeastern part and central part of the country, who
suffer chronically from bad weather such as springtime freezing.
</P>
<P>
-- The French rightwing parties of Rally for the Republic and
Union for French Democracy are now in the painful process of
remoulding itself, as the president of the Rhone-Alpes Charles
Millon is beginning a nationwide tour to seek support from the RPR
and UDF militants to the new party "La Droite" he has just
created.

<HEADLINE> Counties in Three Gorges Reservoir Area Keen on Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- To develop tourism, Badong and
Changyang counties in the Three Gorges Project reservoir area of
central China's Hubei Province are making the most of the
worldwide attention raised by the project's construction.
</P>
<P>
The Shennong Stream in Badong, for example, received 160,000
visitors last year, and expects 300,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the two counties started such major
projects as a shelter-forest project along the middle and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, a tree-planting project using World
Bank loans, and an ecological shelter-forest project financed by
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, they also launched a forest project in the
Three Gorges reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the two counties have planted trees in an
area of 100,000 hectares along the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, with Badong's forest coverage rate reaching 55
percent and Changyang, 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 500 kinds of wild animals and 2,000
species of plants have been preserved, including some rare species
such as dove trees, metasequoia, gingko, leopards, and golden
monkeys.

 Unemployment
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Poverty and Unemployment should
be given priority when governments addressing their social
development problems, top Chinese delegate said Monday during the
54th Commission Session of the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for the Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
Head of Chinese Delegation and Vice Foreign Minister Yang
Jiechi said at the ministerial segment of the commission session
Monday that poverty and unemployment constitute the most salient
and urgent social development problems at present.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty and unemployment have become the root cause of many
social problems. As long as these problems remain unsolved, social
development and progress will be but empty talk," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He also stresses the guarantee of resources in solving social
development problems, calling the developed countries to take
concrete actions to fulfill at an early date their commitment that
official development assistance should take 0.7 percent of their
GNPs.
</P>
<P>
he said ESCAP and other U.N. agencies should be provided with
adequate fund.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is deeply aware of the importance of
promoting comprehensive social progress while developing its
economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Social development has been taken as "an alienable part" of
China's development strategy, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the recent financial crisis, Yang said it is
necessary to handle properly the mutually supportive and mutually
reinforcing relationship between economic development and social
progress.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that an important condition for developing
countries to achieve economic development is to enter into
international cooperation and create a favorable international
environment.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP's 54th annual commission session, inaugurated last
Tuesday, focused on the region's social problems which were
aggravated by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to end on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Criticized for Defending Tehran Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani has been criticized by the hardline faction for
supporting reformist Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi in his
legal battle.
</P>
<P>
The moderate newspaper Iran News reported Monday that a member
of Iran's Majlis (Parliament) attacked Rafsanjani's using the
Friday prayer sermons to amplify support for the disgraced mayor.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was detained on April 4 by the conservative-led
judiciary on corruption charges, but released on bail Wednesday
under the order of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said President Mohammad Khatami had sent an appeal
to Khamenei and Rafsanjani intervened in person to secure the
mayor's release from prison.
</P>
<P>
"How can Mr. Rafsanjani defend a detained suspect at a sacred
place such as the Friday congregational prayers," Ahmad
Rasoulinejad said. He called such support "wrong and below
Rafsanjani's dignity."
</P>
<P>
He threatened to "disclose the names of those who have pocketed
windfall wealth due to connection with these gentlement (Tehran
mayor and his supporters)" if the support goes unabated.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, now chairman of the influential State Expediency
Council, spoke out for the Tehran mayor on Friday, praising him as
"the cleanest in the world."
</P>
<P>
He called the quarrel between political factions row over the
case as a "bitter" experience for the country and the Islamic
regime.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi reportedly will be tried in public in two weeks on
charges of embezzlement, misappropriation of public fund and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the mayor was hated because he had used
resources to fund Khatami's victorious presidential campaign over
hardline competitors last May.
</P>
<P>
His detention deepened the rift between moderates and
conservatives. The moderates rejected the charges as politically
motivated in an attempt to weaken Khatami's government and put
Rafsanjani and his policies on trial.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, however, said Rafsanjani's remarks indicated
that opposition to Karbaschi means opposition to his
administration during his eight-year presidency from 1989-1997.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Hails Zambia's Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is impressed with
Zambia's macro-economic successes and optimistic that the country
will receive favorable response from donors at the consultative
group meeting to be held next month, a World Bank official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Monday quoted the Bank's country director
Phyllis Pomeratz as saying here at the weekend that Zambia has
scored "extraordinary successes" in its economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there is a rapid increase on non-traditional
exports and the government has managed to reduce inflation to
less than 20 percent from astronomical levels of early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The country has made major strides in poverty reduction and
launched the public service reform program to create efficiency
in the government operations, which promise general growth in the
economy in the long run, Pomeratz noted.
</P>
<P>
She said the Bank's programs are going on extremely well in
the country resulting in 16 investment projects worth a total of
500 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bank is not so much concerned with issues of good
governance but will provide a risk guarantee based on political
considerations, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Pomeratz, the World Bank is also impressed with
the government policies in the health, road and agriculture
sectors.
</P>
<P>
On the privatization of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), the Bank official supported Zambia's stand on the sale of
Nchanga and Nkana mines, saying the two major mines should be
sold profitably.
</P>
<P>
The Bank could not intervene over the collapsed talks between
Zambia and the Kafue Consortium over the sale of Nkana and
Nchanga mines, she noted, adding it is important that the mines
are sold at actual value since it is a commercial deal.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the sale of the two mines collapsed
recently due to disagreements on the price between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia says it will not sell its mines at give away
prices.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Play Key Role in Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawyers are contributing
much to the ongoing Three Gorges Project, according to Zhang Geng,
China's Vice-Minister of Justice.
</P>
<P>
He said that lawyers have provided good legal service to the
project by participating in all commercial negotiations, contract
examinations, bidding and financing.
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers helped to make the operation of the project better by
dovetailing international practices," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that lawyers also helped to protect the lawful rights
of various sides participating in the project, and by doing so
overseas investors and experts will have more confidence in
cooperating with China.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister urged the related departments to draw useful
experience from the legal services in the Three Gorges Project and
spread them throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Ministry of Justice has issued a circular
asking the related departments and firms to better serve the
nation's large- and medium-size construction projects.
</P>
<P>
With the total investment estimated at more than 200 billion
yuan (25 billion U.S. dollars), the Three Gorges Project is now
the largest construction project in China. To participate in the
project, many famous international equipment manufacturers have
spent more than one million U.S. dollars each in formulating
their bidding documents.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bank Workers Threaten to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan bank workers are
threatening to paralyze operations from Tuesday if the Standard
Chartered Bank pushes ahead with its planned staff retrenchment,
the Daily Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat comes barely over a month after bank staff went on
strike to protest at moves to impose a higher tax for
low-interest-rate loans, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"If the (Standard) Bank goes ahead and implements this,
definitely there will be an all-banks strike to protect their
colleagues," warned Jacob Opiyo, chairman of the All Banks
Shopstewards Committee, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told Standard workers not be lured into accepting letters
of retrenchment "because the retrenchment is null and void."
</P>
<P>
Standard wrote to its staff on April 17, announcing it would
implement the retrenchment program targeted 200 of the bank's
1,200 permanent employees from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst provocation in the banking industry because
it will be against the entire Labor Laws and the Industrial
Relations Charter," said Opiyo.
</P>
<P>
An emergency meeting of the All Banks Shopstewards Committee
has been called for Monday afternoon to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
February's week-long strike paralyzed bank operations
countrywide as staff refused to resume work unless the government
scrapped the new tax rule.
</P>
<P>
They wanted the tax, which applied to all income-earners in
the country who enjoy interest-free loans from their employers,
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the controversial tax, which was raised
from 15 percent in a Kenya Revenue Authority notice, was
suspended after the striking bank staffs were later backed by the
Central Organization of Trade Unions, which threatened to call a
general strike.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank Increases Loans for Fixed-Asset Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) will increase its loans for fixed-asset investment by 15
billion yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) this year, according to a
bank official.
</P>
<P>
The new loans, which will be used to fund infrastructure and
technical renovation projects, are designed to help reach the
nation's economic growth target, which is set at 8 percent
this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Loan projects will be selected in line with state industrial
policies, the official said, adding that priority will be given to
technical renovation and technology development projects in
state-owned enterprises with marketable products and economic
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Bank figures indicate that ABC, one of the country's big-four
state-owned commercial banks, issued an average of 6 billion
yuan for infrastructure construction and technical renovation
between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of a credit quota system has made it possible
for ABC to make loan decisions freely, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China phased out its credit quota system among commercial banks
on Jan. 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Nuclear Plants Exceed Power Generation Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- India's Nuclear Power
Corporation (NPC) has exceeded its target of electricity
generation for the past two years, the Hindustan Times said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98 alone, India's four commercial nuclear power plants
have generated about 9.617 billion kwh of electricity, compared
with the planned production target of 8.515 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear power generation accounted for 2.67 percent of
the country's total electricity production in 1995-96, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The NPC made a loss of 1.337 billion rupees (41.78 million U.S.
dollars) in 1994-95, but made a profit of 1.52 billion rupees
(47.50 million dollars) the following financial year.
</P>
<P>
The star performers of the NPC were the two generating units of
220 MW each at the Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS) in Uttar
Pradesh and the two of 160 MW each at the Tarapur Atomic Power
Station (TAPS) in Maharashtra State.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel to Jointly Produce New Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel will start a new
project to jointly produce medium-range defensive missiles with a
range of about 150 kilometers, the Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a unnamed senior military official with
the Turkish General Staff as saying that details of the project
are to be discussed during the visit of a high-ranking Turkish
military delegation to Israel next month.
</P>
<P>
"This missile is similar to the Arrow missile (which is being
developed by Israel and the United States), but its name and
specifications are different," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on the project during an Israeli military
delegation's visit to Ankara last month, the official said. He
added that the new medium-range missiles will further strengthen
Turkish armys' defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Turkey is speeding up cooperation with
Israel in developing missiles because it feels increasing missile
threat from its neighboring Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
At present, Israel's industrial companies are actively
participating in Turkey's key defense projects such as the
development of Popeye missile and the upgrading of aged F-4 and
F-5 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding Turco-Israeli military cooperation has
prompted grave concerns from Iran and Arab nations in the region,
which accused Turkey of betraying interests of the Muslim world by
coalescing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular country,
repeatedly explained that its military collaboration with the
Jewish state is not directed against any third party.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Liaoning Auctions Off Wasteland Use Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has auctioned off the use rights for 153,333 hectares of
wasteland so far, in a bid to speed up rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
It has earned 60.7 million yuan from the auctions, and the
money has been set aside under a special bank account and will be
mainly used for projects to halt soil erosion in the province,
said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 hectares of the auctioned wasteland have been
reclaimed thanks to the spending of 35 million yuan in extra
funds, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The wasteland refers barren hills, idle slopes and tidal zones,
as well as waste gullies. A survey by satellite remote sensing
shows that Liaoning has 2.2 million hectares of wasteland, 1.33 million
hectares of which are suitable for reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The term of the use rights for wasteland for auction
ranges from 50 years to 100 years, a local official said, adding
that his province welcomes domestic and overseas investors
to purchase their ideal plots in the province.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Helps Build Police Stations to Monitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is financing the construction
of two police stations in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region to
maintain the civilian character of the refugee camps there, The
Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma Regional Commissioner, Ukiwaona Ditopile Mzuzuri,
told the newspaper Saturday that the U.N. refugee agency has
started building a police station in the Kasulu District and will
build another one in the Kibondo district.
</P>
<P>
The one at Kasulu will assist in monitoring security at four
refugee camps, namely Nyarugusu, Muyovosi, Mtabila One and
Mtabila Two#,which have a total refugee population of 118,000.
</P>
<P>
The police station in Kibondo will keep a watchful eye on the
camps of Mkugwa, Nduta, Mtendeli and Kanembwa, with a total of
78,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
The move follows allegations that Hutu rebels were using the
camps as training base to launch attacks on Burundian government
led by strongman Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the civilian character of the refugee camps, the
Tanzanian authorities have separated about 30 Burundi combatants
early this year from a refugee camp in Kibondo district, and
transferred some of them to a refugee camp in Tabora Region where
they were being closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania plays host to around 225,000 mainly Hutu refugees who
fled Burundi's civil war, according to UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's relations with Tanzania hit a low late last year,
with several incidents of cross-border fire. The Burundi
government pulled out of peace talks with rebels in north
Tanzania last August, citing security concerns.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Give Rice Loans to El Nino Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Food
Authority will soon give rice loans to families in areas affected
by the El Nino-induced drought, the Philippine News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rice loans will be offered at 700 pesos (18.3 US dollars)
each bag, the report quoted Presidential Assistant for Mindanao
Jesus Dureza as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dureza explained that local government units will get the rice
in bulk from national food authority using their respective
internal revenue allotment. Since it is a loan, the authority will
charge an interest of 12 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
He said the local governments can recover the money they will
spend since beneficiaries of the rice loans will later pay for the
loan.
</P>
<P>
Dureza also said that they are awaiting the release of
200-million pesos (5.2 million dollars) poverty alleviation fund
from the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used in various projects to help cushion the
devastating effects of the long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine National Red Cross rice distribution
is still going on in several affected areas in South-central
Mindanao using the calamity fund released by president Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Some 497,238 families have been affected by the drought in the
southern provinces of South Cotabato, Sarangani, Sultan Kudarat,
Maguindanao, Cotabato and Davao del Sur, Dureza said.
</P>
<P>
Among them, some 211,903 families are classified as being in
dire need of food.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Non-Traditional Exports Poised to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is poised to increase
non-traditional exports this year following the increase in the
number of countries interested in importing agricultural-based
products, Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the latest export review released in Lusaka
Sunday by the Export Board as saying that Zambia's agricultural
produce are in demand in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will start importing sunflower seed, rice, potatoes and
sorghum from Zambia through Georgeco Papyrus of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The company will further increase Egypt's meat and bone meal
imports from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Other companies interested in Zambian products, said the
report, are from Canada, the United States and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-based company will be importing mushrooms from Zambia
while a Canadian company will be buying okra, beans, blended tea,
paprika, sweet potatoes and textile products from the country.
</P>
<P>
This will increase Zambia's non-traditional exports and boost
its foreign exchange earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- When then Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
decided to throw his hat in the ring last December, many doubted
this partyless late comer would be a major contender in the
country's presidential polls to be held on May 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
At that time, conventional wisdom held that the May 11 showdown
would be between Vice President Joseph Estrada, the candidate of
the United Opposition, and Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia, the Ramos-anointed candidate for the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the 90-day official campaign period started on
February 9, however, Lim emerged as the closest rival to
front-runner Estrada, a former action movie star who used to play
Robinhood gangsters in his youth.
</P>
<P>
In a February survey conducted by the Social Weather Station
(SWS), the country's most respected pollster, Lim, picked by the
tiny Liberal Party as its standard bearer, garnered 14 percent of
support against 28 percent for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who resigned in March to show his resolve in his quest for
the presidency, retained the second place in a March SWS poll in a
tie with De Venecia, who has the ruling party's rich resources at
his disposal but had been lackluster in many previous opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
Now, many poll pundits are betting that the presidential fight
will be a three-cornered one among the three major candidates of
the 11 official presidential contenders -- Estrada, Lim and De
Venecia.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with Lim's performance compared with
others who have strong political machinery and have prepared for
years," said Miguel Gil, a media strategist of Lim.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Lim who had not been publicly considered for the
presidency until late last year, Estrada set his eyes on the
country's highest post six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Estrada originally tried to run in the 1992 presidential
elections, but later slid down to vie for his present post in
favor of another candidate. He formed the United Opposition out of
three parties last June.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who played a major role in helping Ramos land the
presidential palace in 1992 by establishing the Lakas party, has
long been seen as a certain successor of Ramos by his supporters
and himself.
</P>
<P>
Lim's surge was due to his anti-crime record and the fact that
he is backed by former president Corazon Aquino and the
influential Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin, the country's
leading prelate, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the issue of unchecked kidnappings and other
crimes has worried the people no end, Lim came into the scene at
the right time, they said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of law and order is the second major concern for the
electorate in this year's general elections, according to an
earlier SWS poll, which showed economy is No. one election issue.
</P>
<P>
"Much of this support may be traced to the Manila mayor's
'dirty harry image' as an uncompromising crime fighter and the
endorsement of former president Corazon Aquino," said columnist
Nelson Navarro.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, the law-and-order stance has given him a
strong base in the middle classes and the Cory plus Cardinal Sin
alliance has endowed his campaign with the initial organizational
and financial boost," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Dirty Harry" after the character popularized by
Hollywood star Clint Eastwood, Lim was well known for his valorous
style in cracking down on criminals when he was a police chief of
a Manila district.
</P>
<P>
When the retired police general became Manila mayor in 1992, he
continued to push hard against criminal syndicates. He launched a
high-profile clean-up of Manila's red-light districts in 1992 and
then a massive shame campaign against drug pushers in the city.
</P>
<P>
During his controversial but effective shame campaign, Lim led
the police to stray-paint warnings on convicted and suspected drug
dealers to keep youths away.
</P>
<P>
Lim's anti-crime record endeared him to Manila residents and
the country's powerful Roman Catholic Church. He won easily a
second term in the 1995 midterm election.
</P>
<P>
In his campaign platform, Lim promised to restore peace and
order in the country, rid the government of graft and corruption,
and offer free college education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
As a no-nonsense leader, Lim has an advantage in charisma over
many other candidates, including Estrada and De Venecia.
</P>
<P>
Reena Guiwa, a student of the University of the Philippines,
said: "I will vote for Lim because of his strong leadership... I
dislike Erap (nickname for Estrada), a womanizer and a drunkard."
</P>
<P>
The portly Estrada, a college dropout, has been accused by his
critics of having a series of vices, including drinking,
womanizing and gambling. Although he denied all the allegations,
the controversial ex-movie star was loathed by intellectuals and
the business community.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is also suffering an image problem which had been
blamed for a main cause of his poor rankings in many opinion
polls. Widely seen as a "trapo" (short form for traditional
politician) fond of power and good at backstage maneuvering, De
Venecia is not popular among many classes, particularly the
ordinary masses, according to some opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said Lim also has weaknesses -- lack of a
strong political party with massive grassroots following and,
probably, insufficient campaign funds as a result of his lateness
in joining the race.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the combination of a strong political
machine and money will make the difference in an election since
the two elements are vital in making political deals at the local
level.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was widely believed that if he can maintain
his current campaign momentum in the remaining 20 campaign days,
Lim will be a man to watch when the curtain opens on May 11.

<HEADLINE> Booming Island Province Eyes Higher Environmental Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Island, China's
southernmost province, has extended greater efforts in
environmental protection while maintaining rapid economic growth
during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The tropical province, China's second largest island, separated
from Guangdong Province and became a province and the country's
largest special economic zone in April of 1988.
</P>
<P>
An environmental survey of more than 30 Chinese cities shows
that Hainan's air quality is the best.
</P>
<P>
However, Hainan is not satisfied with what it has achieved. The
province this month became the first in the country to require the
use of leadless gasoline in all its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The province has passed more than 20 rules and regulations on
environmental and forest protection and adopted a contract
responsibility system under which government officials of
different levels are in charge of local environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Hainan banned the felling of natural forest and fenced
hills for planting trees. As a result, the acreage of tropical
forest has increased from 330,000 hectares in 1988 to the current
600,000-plus hectares.
</P>
<P>
Major polluting industries such as chemicals, building
materials, energy resources and paper-making are concentrated in
the industrial corridor in western Hainan for centralized
pollution control.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years the province closed 75 seriously
polluting enterprises and urged some 400 enterprises to control
pollution within fixed terms. Hainan also has refused the
establishment of more than 10 projects which produce
hard-to-control pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Building new grassland is also a part of Hainan's efforts in
environmental protection. Four gardens built in 1994 increased the
per capita public greens in the province to 8.4 square meters.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 environmental projects including a wild animal zoo
and a marine park are under construction or have been built.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage rate in the province has increased from 38
percent in the early years after Hainan became a province to the
present 50 percent, with nearly all its barren hills turned green;
sulphur dioxide and suspended substances in the air are better
than the first grade set by the state; the water quality of 80
percent of offshore areas and inland rivers belong to the first
and second grade set by the state.
</P>
<P>
Haikou city, the province's capital, is the first Chinese city
chosen by the World Health Organization to become a health city.

<HEADLINE> Land Row Hits Canadian Firm's Mining Plan in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian firm's plan to mine
large deposits of titanium at the Kenyan coast may have run into
difficulty following a dispute with villagers whose land was to
be acquired for the project, the East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A row erupted over the multi-billion titanium mining project
last week when National Resources Minister Francis Lotodo
rejected the company for allegedly failing to follow the right
land acquisition procedure.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Mwaumba Village of Kwale District, Coastal
Province, accuse Tiomin Resource Inc. of using questionable means
to acquire their land for mining the highly valued mineral.
</P>
<P>
The company was given the green light by the Kenya authorities
in October to begin the project worth six billion Shillings (100
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Just as the mineral's discovery was announced in Canada
instead of Kenya in the middle of last year, the firm's
operations had been kept secret, raising doubts over its
intentions.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Black Horse in Philippine Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- When then Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
decided to throw his hat in the ring last December, many doubted
this partyless late comer would be a major contender in the
country's presidential polls to be held on May 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
At that time, conventional wisdom held that the May 11 showdown
would be between Vice President Joseph Estrada, the candidate of
the United Opposition, and Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia, the Ramos-anointed candidate for the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the 90-day official campaign period started on
February 9, however, Lim emerged as the closest rival to
front-runner Estrada, a former action movie star who used to play
Robinhood gangsters in his youth.
</P>
<P>
In a February survey conducted by the Social Weather Station
(SWS), the country's most respected pollster, Lim, picked by the
tiny Liberal Party as its standard bearer, garnered 14 percent of
support against 28 percent for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who resigned in March to show his resolve in his quest for
the presidency, retained the second place in a March SWS poll in a
tie with De Venecia, who has the ruling party's rich resources at
his disposal but had been lackluster in many previous opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
Now, many poll pundits are betting that the presidential fight
will be a three-cornered one among the three major candidates of
the 11 official presidential contenders -- Estrada, Lim and De
Venecia.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with Lim's performance compared with
others who have strong political machinery and have prepared for
years," said Miguel Gil, a media strategist of Lim.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Lim who had not been publicly considered for the
presidency until late last year, Estrada set his eyes on the
country's highest post six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Estrada originally tried to run in the 1992 presidential
elections, but later slid down to vie for his present post in
favor of another candidate. He formed the United Opposition out of
three parties last June.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who played a major role in helping Ramos land the
presidential palace in 1992 by establishing the Lakas party, has
long been seen as a certain successor of Ramos by his supporters
and himself.
</P>
<P>
Lim's surge was due to his anti-crime record and the fact that
he is backed by former president Corazon Aquino and the
influential Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin, the country's
leading prelate, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the issue of unchecked kidnappings and other
crimes has worried the people no end, Lim came into the scene at
the right time, they said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of law and order is the second major concern for the
electorate in this year's general elections, according to an
earlier SWS poll, which showed economy is No. one election issue.
</P>
<P>
"Much of this support may be traced to the Manila mayor's
'dirty harry image' as an uncompromising crime fighter and the
endorsement of former president Corazon Aquino," said columnist
Nelson Navarro.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, the law-and-order stance has given him a
strong base in the middle classes and the Cory plus Cardinal Sin
alliance has endowed his campaign with the initial organizational
and financial boost," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Dirty Harry" after the character popularized by
Hollywood star Clint Eastwood, Lim was well known for his valorous
style in cracking down on criminals when he was a police chief of
a Manila district.
</P>
<P>
When the retired police general became Manila mayor in 1992, he
continued to push hard against criminal syndicates. He launched a
high-profile clean-up of Manila's red-light districts in 1992 and
then a massive shame campaign against drug pushers in the city.
</P>
<P>
During his controversial but effective shame campaign, Lim led
the police to stray-paint warnings on convicted and suspected drug
dealers to keep youths away.
</P>
<P>
Lim's anti-crime record endeared him to Manila residents and
the country's powerful Roman Catholic Church. He won easily a
second term in the 1995 midterm election.
</P>
<P>
In his campaign platform, Lim promised to restore peace and
order in the country, rid the government of graft and corruption,
and offer free college education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
As a no-nonsense leader, Lim has an advantage in charisma over
many other candidates, including Estrada and De Venecia.
</P>
<P>
Reena Guiwa, a student of the University of the Philippines,
said: "I will vote for Lim because of his strong leadership... I
dislike Erap (nickname for Estrada), a womanizer and a drunkard."
</P>
<P>
The portly Estrada, a college dropout, has been accused by his
critics of having a series of vices, including drinking,
womanizing and gambling. Although he denied all the allegations,
the controversial ex-movie star was loathed by intellectuals and
the business community.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is also suffering an image problem which had been
blamed for a main cause of his poor rankings in many opinion
polls. Widely seen as a "trapo" (short form for traditional
politician) fond of power and good at backstage maneuvering, De
Venecia is not popular among many classes, particularly the
ordinary masses, according to some opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said Lim also has weaknesses -- lack of a
strong political party with massive grassroots following and,
probably, insufficient campaign funds as a result of his lateness
in joining the race.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the combination of a strong political
machine and money will make the difference in an election since
the two elements are vital in making political deals at the local
level.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was widely believed that if he can maintain
his current campaign momentum in the remaining 20 campaign days,
Lim will be a man to watch when the curtain opens on May 11.

CHENGDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have built two
special wind tunnels in southwest China's Sichuan Province for
development of the country's aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
The new tunnels will be used for testing China's space shuttle,
carrier rockets and strategic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The high-frequency plasma wind tunnel and the supersonic speed
propelling wind tunnel are being built by China Aerodynamics
Research and Development Center and will be the most advanced in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Before the building of the two wind tunnels, the regular
tunnels could not meet the needs for aerodynamic testing of space
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the building of the two tunnels will also
promote the country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans Africa Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
intends to host a Washington summit with heads of "reforming"
African states before his term ends, the East African weekly
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The list of leaders to be invited to the first-ever conference
of this kind will be determined over the coming months, said the
report, adding that it is likely to include presidents Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Possible dates for the summit are also being discussed, with
the likely options said to be sometime late next year or early
2000, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the meeting are "those nations undertaking
serious economic reforms and making significant progress in that
regard," a U.S. government official told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether political reform would serve as a criterion for
participation, the official who refused to reveal his name said
that "economic and political reforms tend to go hand in hand."
</P>
<P>
Clinton first called for the convening of a sub-Saharan summit
in Washington during his visit to South Africa last month. But
scant media attention was given to the announcement which was
made at a ceremony for a Johannesburg commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said the envisioned summit would be followed by
regular meetings of American and African finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Washington gathering of African leaders were
mentioned again on April 14 by Susan Rice, the U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Rice said at the time that the summit would contribute toward
the Clinton administration's effort "to change American
perceptions of Africa and to get beyond the images of famine, war
and disease."
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the summit suggest that Clinton's six-nation
sub-Saharan tour should not be seen as a one-off publicity
exercise, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would be risking political embarrassment if no
substantive progress was achieved in the U.S.-Africa relations in
the interim between his recent trip and the planned summit in
Washington, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Ecology in Three Gorges Project Area Sound, Officials Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ecological conditions in the Three
Gorges Dam area remained fairly sound last year, according to the
regional environmental protection authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Water Resources Protection Agency said that
water quality at the dam site stayed between grade two and grade
three throughout 1997, which suggested the water was clean.
</P>
<P>
The major indicators for atmospheric quality stood at grade one
to two while noise levels at key construction sites were kept
within Chinese national standards.
</P>
<P>
The agency that also closely monitors health conditions of the
people in the dam area said that no epidemics or contagious
diseases caused by environmental problems were reported last year.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam project in central China, believed to be
the largest of its kind in the world, underwent crucial
construction last year, including damming the Yangtze River to
build a 175-meter high dam.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to protect the environment, the government has
already spent a total of 23 million yuan (2.8 million US dollars)
on trees and landscaping, in addition to installing environmental
protection facilities.

<HEADLINE> More Money Used on Education, Entertainment in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- People in Shanghai, China's
largest industrial and commercial center, now spend more on
education and entertainment than before, according to a city
official.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey answered by 500 local families showed that per
capita spending on education, entertainment and tourism have
climbed to 869 yuan in 1997, 3.7 times that in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Shanghai now give more attention to education than
entertainment, the survey added. Money spent on education averaged
310 yuan per person, an annual increase of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many parents said hundreds of yuan had been used to help sons
and daughters enroll in key schools in neighboring districts for
better education, since local government encourages boys and girls
to go to nearby schools.
</P>
<P>
Purchasing reference books and increases in tuition also led to
rising expenditures on education, parents said.
</P>
<P>
Adults in the city also flock to mushrooming night schools for
self-improvement or job skills, and they spend more on books,
newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed each used about 300 yuan to buy a color TV and
VCD players for entertainment, according to the survey, and they
also did a lot of travel on two-day weekends or holidays with
tourism expenditures of 213 yuan per capita last year, triple that
of five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Starts New Move to Fight Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
started setting up a special police unit to probe and prosecute
tax offenders as the nation battles economic difficulties arising
from a 133.3-million-U.S. Dollar budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the unit under the Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) marks a major step in the country's campaign against tax
evasion, which is estimated to deprive the country of some 183.3
million Dollars annually, the East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uncollected customs duty and outstanding value added tax (VAT)
make up a substantial portion of this shortfall, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The police unit, which will be made up of about 50 officers
from the regular police force, is likely to be headed by an
officer of a rank not lower than Assistant Commissioner of
Police. They will receive special training in tax investigations.
</P>
<P>
The unit will give the KRA, which administers all of Kenya's
taxes, the ability to investigate, arrest and prosecute people
suspected of breaching tax laws.
</P>
<P>
Revenue shortfalls have contributed significantly to the
financial difficulties facing the Kenyan government which is
considering drastic measures to improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures are a freeze in the civil service wage
bill, retrenchment of government workers, severely limiting
expenditure and other efforts towards seeking a loan resumption
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the governmental revenue was reported
to be 86 million Dollars below target. A high-profile crackdown
on tax evaders saw the government exceed its revenue target last
month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Concern over customs evasion centers on importers who divert
transit goods, especially petroleum products, onto the local
market and corruption among officials at the port of Mombasa who
allow goods into the country without proper duty being paid.

<P>
YANGON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A former central executive member
of the Kayin National Union (KNU), an anti-government ethnic armed
group in Myanmar, Monday called on other KNU leaders and followers
to make peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
Phado Aung San, who was in charge of the economic affairs of
the KNU and recently crossed over to the government side, made the
call at a special press conference at the state-run Myanmar Radio
Broadcasting Station here.
</P>
<P>
Aung San, together with more than 200 of his men from the KNU,
"exchanged arms for peace" with the government in Hpa-an area,
capital of Myanmar's Kayin state on April 7.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the government for making arrangements for their
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the KNU leaders and those in the refugee camps
on the Thai-Myanmar border were longing for peace with the
government.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, a government official quoted
Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, as reiterating that the government continues

</P>
<P>
A total of 17 rebel ethnic armed groups in the country have

LHASA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- In the vast and sparsely populated
Tibet Autonomous Region, people traditionally visit relatives by
riding horses. However, more and more Tibetans are turning to
taxis for outings.
</P>
<P>
"It's more comfortable and more fashionable to take a taxi,"
said one Tibetan youth who just got out of a taxi.
</P>
<P>
The average annual income of Tibet's farmers and herdsmen was
about 1,000 yuan in 1997, while the lowest monthly income of taxi
drivers in Lhasa, capital of Tibet, is more than 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Being a taxi driver is good," said 30-year-old Cedan, a
Tibetan farmer-turned taxi driver. "It not only promises a modest
salary, but also makes me more clever as a result of communicating
with all types of people from different places."
</P>
<P>
Losang Duoje, director of the management office of the City
Taxi Management Office, pointed out that some cab drivers in Lhasa
have monthly incomes of more than 3,000 yuan, which is the primary
reason an increasing number of Tibetan farmers go into the
business.
</P>
<P>
Since the first taxi company was established in Lhasa in 1994,
the number of taxi cabs has surged to 970 from ten.
</P>
<P>
"To take a taxi" has become one of the most frequently used
phrases among Lhasa's residents, but "the business is more
difficult because of fiercer competition," said Cedan.
</P>
<P>
The first group of taxis roaming the streets of Lhasa are used
cars from other parts of China, according to Bailing, manager of
the Holy Land Taxi Company.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum charge of those cars was three-to-four yuan, but
ordinary Tibetans were afraid of the 'new creature' of which they
knew so little."
</P>
<P>
They preferred to take a mini-bus or other transportation and,
as a result, the company lost half a million yuan in its first
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only four years later, Tibetans not only have become accustomed
to taking taxis, but also have begun to choose the more luxurious
cars.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese brand-name taxis, including the Santana, are now
roaming the streets of Lhasa, carrying tourists from across the
world to their destinations.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Irrigation Project Effective in Combating Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Dujiang Weir water
conservation project in Southwest China's Sichuan Province,
verified as the world's oldest, has proved its efficacy in
irrigation during sustained drought.
</P>
<P>
The water in the Minjiang River running through the weir has
reached a 60-year low of 11.5 billion cubic meters, since the
region endured a serious drought last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the irrigated fields as a major grain production area
yielded 5.97 billion kilograms (kg) of grain last year, 94 million
kg higher than the record harvest in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest has been attributed to improved water-saving
irrigation and timely precautions by the local administration
bureau last winter when the project supplied 1.05 billion cubic
meters of Minjiang River water to 300 reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
So far, 73,013 hectares of seedling fields in the weir area
have been watered, according to Peng Shuming, director of the weir
administration bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that water flow in the Minjiang River
originating on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has only totaled 866
million cubic meters in the first four months of this year, 223
million lower than last year and 566 million lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
The 2,254-year-old gravity irrigation project has been expanded
3.5 times since the founding of New China in 1949. It has radiated
its effects to 670,666 hectares of fields.

<HEADLINE> 290 Ancient Tombs Discovered in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered more than 290 tombs dating back to the Han Dynasty (206
BC-AD 220) in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said the ancient tombs were discovered in the
last five years when the autonomous region launched large-scale
farm-development and tree-planting projects.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand pieces of relices were unearthed from the
tombs. They included millet, pottery models of grain stores, pig
and chicken houses, cooking utensils, and jars and bowls.
</P>
<P>
They also included silk, embroidery, ivory rulers, lacquerware
and big conches from the South China Sea, which indicated
extensive cultural exchanges between northern and southern China.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries are considered of great importance to research
into relations between the Han people and other minority ethnic
groups, border area development, establishment of an
administrative system and economy in northern China nearly 2,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
After the Han Dynasty authorities ended its war with the
Xiongnu, an ancient ethnic nationality in China, it established
eight prefectures in central and western Inner Mongolia and
implemented an emigration policy for reclaiming land in the border
areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's largest sewage treatment
plant, located in Gaobeidian, east of Beijing's urban area, is
under construction.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to be completed in September of 1999 with
a daily capacity of one million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Municipal Engineering Corp., which is
responsible for the project, the construction of the plant is
divided into two stages. The first stage was put into use at the
end of 1996, with a daily capacity of half a million tons. The
second stage, which was started in 1997, is 50 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
At present, the urban area of Beijing releases about 2.4
million tons of waste water every day, 39 percent of the waste
water running in the east area where the plant is
located.
</P>
<P>
However, the city has only three sewage treatment plants,
including the first stage of the Gaobeidian plant, with a total
daily capacity of 580,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
An official said after the second stage of the plant is
completed Beijing's total sewage treatment capacity should reach
1.08 million tons every day, with 45 percent of waste water
treated.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Hopes Talks with India Resume in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan has expressed the hope that the Pakistani-Indian
talks would resume after the meeting of the two countries' prime
ministers in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in July this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Saturday with the private news agency, News
Network International, Gohar said any decision concerning the
resumption of the talks would be taken after the meeting between
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee on the sidelines of the next summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I think the meeting will be an indicator as to when the
forthcoming foreign secretary-level talks (between Pakistan and
India) would be held," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said that the government in New Delhi is new and would
take some time to settle down as it is a coalition. "Let us see
how the Indian government establishes itself..." he added.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the forthcoming talks, Gohar said that
Pakistan would have a high priority on Kashmir. "The Indians seem
to be backtracking. They are more interested in trade, visa
restrictions and cultural exchanges."
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan has indicated to U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Bill Richardson, who visited Pakistan this week,
that there would be no meeting of the Pakistani and Indian foreign
secretaries before the Sharif-Vajpayee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Pakistani-U.S. relations, the foreign
minister said that Pakistan and the U.S. want to put all the past
irritants behind them. "We want to start positive, constructive
and progressive outlook for the future of our relationship with
the visit of President Bill Clinton (to Pakistan) later this
year."
</P>
<P>
He said that after four "unprecedented and unjustified"
embargoes imposed by the U.S., Pakistan no longer depended on the
U.S. for military equipment.
</P>
<P>
"It would be really a folly on the part of Pakistan to purchase
any American equipment knowing that we would be imposed sanctions
or embargoes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have diversified ourselves...so now we are not really
depending on any one," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pakistani leadership had told Richardson that
"we should not be stuck on small issues but look at the future and
more positive things."

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Over 93 Billion Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in the fiscal year of 1997 surged by 79.7 percent from a year
earlier to 11,442.3 billion yen (about 93.4 billion U.S. dollars),
posting the first increase in five years, the Japanese Finance
Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the upsurge to the robust exports of
automobiles and the yen's fall against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1997, which ended March 31, Japan's exports grew by
11.7 percent to 51,411.5 billion yen (about 419.7 billion
dollars), while imports inched up by 0.8 percent to 39,969.2
billion yen (about 326.3 billion dollars), the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States in the year also
rose by 44.3 percent to 5,423.5 billion yen (about 44.3 billion
dollars), posting the first increase in three years, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus with the European Union grew for the first time
in five years, surging by 109.0 percent to 2,971.6 billion yen
(about 24.3 billion dollars). The surplus was boosted by higher
auto and office equipment exports.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with Asia also edged up by 13 percent to 5,972.2
billion yen (about 48.8 billion dollars), the report added.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that the surplus will keep growing for a while, a
Japanese economist at private sector said that "as long as the
Japanese government fails to map out effective economic stimulus
measures, the surplus will remain at a high level."

<HEADLINE> Thai Furniture Exports Hit by Economic Turmoil in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Furniture Industry
Association is pessimistic about furniture exports this year
because of the economic turmoil in Japan, Thailand's largest
furniture export market, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that furniture exports in baht terms
were not progressing with growth, but slowing to just 5 percent
compared to annual growth rates in the previous years of more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in growth is due to the economic recession in
Japan, which bought 50.7 percent of the total furniture exports
from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Thailand exported 10.6 billion baht of furniture and
parts to Japan, up 15.9 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Theinchai Prayuenyong, president of the association, was quoted
as saying that Japan faces recession in its domestic economy this
year, and that will result in a sharp decline of orders from
there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand was facing fiercer competition from
Malaysia, whose furniture industry had been aggressively supported
by the government.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has successfully developed the quality of its
furniture production, which is now accepted internationally,
according to Theinchai.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now the twelfth largest furniture exporter, coming
closer to Thailand, which lies in the eighth place.
</P>
<P>
In baht terms, Thailand exported 20.9 billion baht of furniture
and parts in total in 1997, 20.6 percent up from 1996's 17.4
billion baht.

<HEADLINE> Fires Reduce Insects in East Kalimantan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The fires which have been raging
in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province since January this year
have brought insect index down from 30 to five, a new study finds.
</P>
<P>
The new index signifies a remarkable loss of insects, thus
adversely affecting the ecosystem, Abubakar Lahji, who conducted
the study, was quoted as saying by Antara News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Mulawarman University in the
Soeharto Hill National Park.
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance of insects poses a problem (as to how) to
rehabilitate the burnt forests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The study also shows that some animals have fled the
conservation area due to the damaged habitat and food shortages.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to watch wild boars now because tubers, which
are their main food, were destroyed by the fires," said Lahji.
</P>
<P>
The conservation area is home to a variety of endangered
animals including orangutans, bears, deer, monkeys and porcupines.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the East Kalimantan Environment Impact Assessment
Agency say dozens of rare animals have died because of the forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
The agency's data show that the fires have destroyed 393,850
hectares of forest and bush land since January 17, causing
material losses of 7.32 trillion rupiah (918 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of people in East Kalimantan are now
suffering serious health problems, especially respiratory
ailments, due to the thick smoke from the forest fires.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Cancels Talks With Taliban Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations team Sunday
canceled its planned visit to the Afghan capital of Kabul for
talks with Taliban leaders, U.N. sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The visit was cancelled because the U.N. rejected the Taliban
militia's demand to replace the senior U.N. official for
Afghanistan, Alfredo Witschi-Cestari.
</P>
<P>
Taliban officials in Islamabad, however, said on Sunday they
were still awaiting the visit, but reaffirmed their demand that
Cestari be replaced.
</P>
<P>
"Cestari ... always misappropriated Afghanistan's funds," the
News Network International quoted a Taliban official, who
requested anonymity, as saying Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"We do not trust Cestari because of his conduct and bias
attitude," the Taliban official said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. delegation was scheduled to visit Kabul on Monday for
talks with the Taliban leaders on difficulties the U.N. staff is
facing in Afghanistan. The U.N. withdrew its staff from the
southern town of Kandahar, Taliban's headquarters last month after
an alleged attack on a U.N. staff member.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official said they had not been told of the
cancellation of the U.N. visit. "We have not received any official
communication by the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He dispelled the impression that the Taliban are dictating the
United Nations. "We had given the proposal to the United Nations
which could not be described as dictation."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Shrimp Producers Seeking Ways to Foil U.S. Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN shrimp-producing countries
will seek ways of safeguarding their industry from a possible U.S.
import ban when they meet in Phuket, southern Thailand on April
27-29, according to the ASEAN Shrimp Industry Task Force.
</P>
<P>
Plodprasop Suraswadi, secretary of the group, was quoted Monday
by the Bangkok Post as saying that it wanted to adopt a joint
policy to assert sovereignty in international trade involving the
shrimp industry.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) recently upheld a complaint
by Thailand, Malaysia, India and Pakistan against a U.S. attempt
to ban shrimp imports from countries whose shrimping fleets were
endangering sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled that the United States could not apply its own
laws outside its borders. Meanwhile, more countries are equipping
their fleets with turtle-excluder devices.
</P>
<P>
Washington has certified that Thailand has taken the necessary
steps to protect turtles. Only about 20 percent of the shrimps
exported by Thailand are caught at sea, while the rest are farmed.
</P>
<P>
Sea turtles are a protected species under the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flowers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's largest shrimp exporter.

<HEADLINE> Eight Percent Economic Growth Possible, Says Chief Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- There is high hope that China
will accomplish an 8 percent economic growth rate this year after
implementing various pre-set policies, today's "Shanghai
Securities News" quoted Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The SSB spokesman made this remark over the weekend while
addressing a high-level forum on China's industrial development
held in the Party School of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The economist coached more than 300 executives of industrial
and commercial businesses and financial and securities
companies about China's promising economic development prospects
this year with data and an analysis of policies.
</P>
<P>
China is now at the most relaxed time in 20 years in terms of
material conditions, with a marked alleviation of such
"bottleneck" problems in agriculture, energy, raw materials and
transport, which had long restricted national economic
development, and with rich foreign exchange reserves, said the
chief economist.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China's policies this year have been
designed to solve the problem of a sluggish economy and to
maintain a fair growth rate, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the emphasis of the country's macro-economic control
will also shift from mainly controlling inflation to solving
problems like underemployment and full re-employment.
</P>
<P>
The current policy environment is considered the most relaxed
in the past five years. Money supply in a broad sense, or M2, is
set to grow by 16 percent to 18 percent. If this goal is realized,
the 8 percent economic growth rate is sure to be scored, said the
chief economist.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the economic performances in the first quarter
this year, Qiu predicted that China's economic growth rate this
year might reach 8.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals Returning to Beijing's Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Traces of many wild animals have
been found on the mountains in suburban Beijing because of the
efforts of local governments to plant trees in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to wild animal experts, traces of leopards were
discovered in the Lingshan Mountain area, Mentougou District to
the west of Beijing proper, and the cry of wolves was heard by
villagers in Yanqing County at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This has been attributed to the improvement of people's
awareness of environmental issues and wildlife protection in
addition to bans on hunting wild animals, according to today's
Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that large birds such as herons, black
cranes, wild ducks and wild geese, are the first group of visitors
to Beijing's mountains. Last year, more than 3,000 black-crowned
night-herons were found in the mountains in west Beijing suburbs
and are expected to return this summer.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that an estimated 40 brown-eared pheasant
have been found in the Lingshan Mountain area. And the number of
leopards, wolves, wild boar, giant salamander and soft-shelled
turtles is also on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Navy Sinks Five Tamil Rebel Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy Sunday
destroyed five powerful Tamil rebel boats and killed at least 30
rebels in the north of Trincomalee port in Eastern Province, the
official Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted military sources as saying that the navy had
detected a flotilla of 11 rebel boats heading towards Trincomalee
from the north.
</P>
<P>
The navy, supported by air cover, attacked and destroyed five
of the boats which were loaded with explosives.
</P>
<P>
Each boat was manned with at least six rebels. One of the boats
is reported to be the rebels' Sea Tiger command boat called
"Mirage," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said it was likely the rebel flotilla was on its way to
attack Trincomalee port.
</P>
<P>
After the five boats were sunk, the rest fled towards the coast
of Chenmalai near Mullaitivu, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the third anniversary of the Tamil rebels reneging
peace talks with the present government and resuming hostilities
with an attack on Trincomalee Port, sinking two naval gun boats in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting government troops for a
separate state in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> East China's Zhejiang Province Reports Moderate Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province on the east
China coast recorded 103 billion yuan in GDP (gross domestic
product) in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise of 9.8 percent increase over the
same period last year in constant prices. But the growth rate for
this year is smaller than that of last year, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year agricultural production,
forestry and fisheries remained stable on the whole. Industrial
production rose by 11 percent in the first three months, with
added industrial value amounting to 52.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the province invested 9.9 billion yuan
in fixed assets, up 11.2 percent over last year. The rate is 0.9
percent more than 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade continues to increase. The province chalked up
3.14 billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade from January to March,
a rise of 5.3 percent according to comparable figures for last
year. Exports made up 2.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 16.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, prices in the province continue to go down.
The average retail price of commodities went down 0.8 percent from
January to March according to last year's comparable figure, while
the consumer price index went up by 1.1 percent, said local
officials.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Balance of Payments Surplus Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) surplus increased by 220 percent to 1.828 billion
U.S. dollars in the first three months of this year from the
year-ago level of 570 million dollars, according to a report by
the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The surplus level as of the first quarter is already double the
central bank's whole year surplus target of 920 million dollars,
the local press reported on Monday, quoting the report.
</P>
<P>
Diwa Gunigundo, director of the economic research department of
the central bank, said the improvement in the BOP figures reflects
the "strong inflows" of foreign capital into the economy.
</P>
<P>
The strong inflows allowed the central bank to make significant
foreign exchange purchases and to conduct so-called exceptional
financing or borrowing activities meant to shore up the country's
supply of dollar resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BOP indicates the flow of real resources between the
Philippines and the rest of the world, and reflects changes in the
country's foreign assets and liabilities arising from economic
transactions including transfers.
</P>
<P>
According to Gunigundo, the balance of payments deficit posted
in the whole of last year was largely the result of the financial
turmoil starting in mid-1997 which weakened the peso and other
Asian currencies and sparked a region-wide regime of high interest
rates which dampened economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Young Farmer Becomes Civil Servant in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Gao Zhifeng, a native farmer in
Pinggu County of Beijing, has now become well-known in his
hometown since passing an examination to become a civil servant
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Gao, 29, is the only winner among 87 farmers who took the open
exams for civil servants organized by the Beijing Personnel
Bureau in February.
</P>
<P>
Gao, now a clerk of the Achieves Bureau of Pinggu
County, is modest about the congratulations from friends and
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
Whenever he heard flattering words on his success in the
competition, he would say, "No, no. I am just a civil servant on
probation."
</P>
<P>
In the past, it was impossible for a farmer to be enlisted into
governmental bodies, and for many years the examinations for
enlisting civil servants were open only to urban residents.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, Beijing for the first time decided to allow
farmers to join in examinations for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The decision was regarded as one of the major measures to
promote reforms in the personnel system.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, 2,600 young people throughout China's rural areas
have passed state civil servant exams to work in government
offices at all levels.

<P>
In Beijing, Gao is the first farmer to become a civil servant.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, Gao rides his bicycle to his office in the
county seat, arriving a half hour earlier than his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"I feel pressure on me, for my future depends on my performance
in my probation period," he said.
</P>
<P>
His diligence has won the appreciation of his colleagues. Wang
Chunjiang, one of Gao's colleagues, said, "Gao has few words, but
is enthusiastic about his work."
</P>
<P>
Gao has paid a lot for his changes today. A decade ago, he
failed to pass the university entrance exams and worked at a farm
tool-repair center run by his uncle.
</P>
<P>
"I can earn more than 20,000 yuan a year and I got married," he
said, "but I have never given up study, for I believe that one day
I will use what I learned in these years."
</P>
<P>
He said that now he is studying law for a three-year college
diploma.
</P>
<P>
Gao's presence in the Achieves Bureau of Pinggu County has a
great impact on more than 30 staff members there.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongkai, deputy director of the bureau, said, "Many of
us civil servants have seen the changes in the personnel system
and have a crisis feeling with the 'iron bowl' concept in our
jobs."

<HEADLINE> Special Economic Zone Legislates Better Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Investors have found it much
easier to go through real estate procedures and obtain loans for
housing in the city of Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong Province,
one of the country's five special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The city has granted more than 7,000 property certificates
during the past three months, more than the total for 1997, in an
effort to invigorate the local housing market.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders attribute this to two regulations passed by the
Standing Committee of the Zhuhai City People's Congress,
which was authorized by the National People's Congress on March
17.
</P>
<P>
Since then the city legislative body has adopted 17
regulations concerning market-economy management mechanisms, urban
management, environmental protection and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have been successful in safeguarding investors'
legal rights and interests, insiders say. As a Taiwan
businessman put it, a good legal environment is the most-favored
investment environment, especially when more internationally
accepted practices are being introduced.
</P>
<P>
The City People's Congress also published texts of draft
regulations in local newspapers to solicit opinions and
suggestions of people from all walks of life.

JINAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The city of Qingdao is offering
preferential policies and extending financial support to Southeast
Asia-financed businesses to help them weather financial
difficulties in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jiabin, Qindao's deputy mayor, said: "We take our friends'
difficulties as ours. The city government has proposed to help
Southeast Asian investors to settle down and turn a profit."
</P>
<P>
This tourist port city in east China's Shandong Province is one

<P>
According to Zhou, 22 key overseas-financed companies have
received bank loans from the city's financial institutions. The
Customs office is working on solutions to problems raised by 58
overseas-funded firms here. A large number of such companies are

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Groups Play Expanded Role in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The formation of enterprise
groups has boosted the development of the petrochemical industry
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 industrial output value for 26 petrochemical
enterprise groups in Liaoning totaled 11.6 billion yuan, 66
percent of the combined output value for the 424 enterprises in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the five major enterprise groups hit 5.4
billion yuan, or 31 percent of the total, with their profits
accounting for 90 percent of the total for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Huajin Group, a inter-regional company established a little
over a year ago, earned profits of 273 million yuan in 1997, or 56
percent of total profits recorded by profitable local state-owned
firms. The group has total assets worth 10.8 billion yuan and an
average annual sales of five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of the three leading petrochemical production
bases in China. The province's complete petrochemical system

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Auction Industry Rolling on Regular Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has undergone a
rejuvenation of its auction industry in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has taken steps to establish fair competition while
setting up a few large-scale auction houses and encouraging
specialization, according to Lin Yiping, vice-chairman of the
Shanghai Auction Association.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's auction history dates back to 1874, when the first
auction house was set up by the British. The auction business was
thriving at the end of the War of Resistance to Japan (1937-1945),
when a large amount of Japanese and American military materiel was
sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
The industry nearly expired for three decades until Shanghai
Material Auction House (now named International Commodity Auction
Co. Ltd.) was established in 1988. The restoration has taken a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 37 auction companies, mainly comprehensive
ones, and the city plays host to 1,000 shows a year on average.
</P>
<P>
Auctioned items include such things as confiscated materials,
works of art, stamps, coins and floral commodities, lucky mobile
phone numbers, overstocked goods and assets and property rights.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Defense Minister Accuses Albania of Splitting Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle
Bulatovic Sunday accused Albania of supporting the terrorist and
splitting activities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic said in a press interview that in order to prevent
arms from being smuggled into Kosovo from Albania, his country has
strengthened its border defense, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has so far captured a large amount of arms and
military equipment along the border, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that some European and non-European countries have
shown strategic interest in the region but lack good will.
</P>
<P>
The current situation is quite similar to that in 1991 before
the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, some countries declared their support for
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity, but on the other hand
immediately recognized the republics when they declared
independence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Serbian province with ethnic Albanian majority. The
ethnic Albanians who called for independence from Serbia clashed
with local Serb police this year, plunging the country into
chaos.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Listed companies in Shanghai,
China's largest commercial and financial center, have reported an
improved profit picture because of more efficient operations.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven listed companies based in Shanghai have unveiled
their annual reports for 1997. Of those, 61 firms had their net
asset return ratio exceeding 10 percent last year, compared with
52 companies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the companies averaged a 19 percent
increase in principal business income and a 42 percent growth in
net profits, which was worth 85 million yuan each. Only two have
reported a downturn.
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in the workforce and the lastest capital reformation
in the form of mergers and purchases are cited as the main impetus
to profit growth in these enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Output to Fall in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The long dry spell has taken its
toll on the Philippines' sugar industry, forcing the country to
import sugar next year to meet domestic demand, the Daily Inquirer
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) has projected a 20
percent drop or 360,000 metric tons in the 1.8 million-metric ton
sugar output expected for crop year 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
The drop means a loss of about 5.1 billion pesos (134 million
U.S. dollars), the report quoted SRA administrator Michael Suarez
as saying.
</P>
<P>
To meet the domestic demand, the country would have to import
about 400,000 metric tons of sugar next year, Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
He said the drought had made planting of sugarcane difficult.
Milling is also expected to start late in December instead of
August, as the lack of moisture has stunted the growth of
sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
This year, only a minimal amount of raw sugar may have to be
imported because of adequate production last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SRA had expected an output of 1.67 million metric tons for
crop year 1997-1998, but the Philippine Sugar Millers Association
said it was 1.8 million metric tons.

VIENNA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas Klestil
was re-elected to a second six-year term Sunday with a landslide
63.5 percent of votes, the Interior Ministry announced the result
Sunday evening after all the votes were counted.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy and contented that such a clear majority of
Austrian men and women have given me their confidence," the
65-year-old re-elected head of state told the Austrian television,
adding that the vote was a confirmation of his "fair and
non-partisan office" during the past six years.
</P>
<P>
A former diplomat, Klestil was first elected in 1992 as the
candidate of the Austrian People's Party. In this election, he
stood as a non-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
Klestil is expected to start his new term on July 8.

<HEADLINE> More Economic Cooperation Between Inland And Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese inland areas are
increasing economic cooperation with Macao to maintain vitality
there when it returns to China on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Macao had a year of economic setbacks and economic growth of
only 0.8 percent in 1997 and economists say that closer
cooperation with the mainland could help the region get through
its economic readjustment period sooner.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wende, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation's Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao Affairs
Department, says that economic and trade departments in inland
areas are now exploring new methods of economic cooperation, and
that this cooperation could have good prospects and be in both
sides' interest.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Mainland enterprises are also being encouraged to
invest in Macao."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, minister of Science and Technology, recently led
a group of scientific research officials on a visit to Macao, and
signed accords with the Portuguese Macao authorities. Officials
and economists from Macao and the mainland agree that there are
many possibilities for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Macao can also continue its economic cooperation with the Pearl
River Delta and serve as a bridge between the mainland and other
parts of the world. Scientific cooperation would help the economic
and scientific development of Macao and would help give the
mainland more links with international markets and increase the
competitiveness of their products.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Plans to Make More Products in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Kodak Company, the world
leader in imaging, has revealed its plan to invest one billion
U.S. dollars in China over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
According to Kodak Chief Executive Officer George Fisher, the
investment will be used to increase Kodak's production capacity in
China, establish distribution networks, conduct marketing
activities, and assist technology upgrading of its local imaging
partners.
</P>
<P>
Kodak is committed to "localizing" in the Chinese market,
Fisher said. By 2000, the majority of Kodak products in the
Chinese market are expected to bear "made in China" labels, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The one-billion-dollar investment is spelled out in two
recently signed agreements between Kodak and local partners.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were executed following the formation of two
Kodak-controlled Chinese limited-liability companies: Kodak
(China) Company Ltd. and Kodak (Wuxi) Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese photographic operations in Shantou in Guangdong
Province and Xiamen of east China's Fujian Province will transfer
their major business assets to Kodak (China). A third Chinese
enterprise in Wuxi of east China's Jiangsu Province will transfer
its major assets to Kodak (Wuxi).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Kodak will own 80 percent of Kodak
(China) and 70 percent of Kodak (Wuxi), and the Chinese partners
will have the rest.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming years," said David Swift, chairman and president
of Kodak's Greater China Region, "Kodak will invest to create a
world-class manufacturing capability."
</P>
<P>
Swift will also serve as chairman of both new companies.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the agreements lasted four years, and involved
five provinces and two municipalities, two Chinese government
administrative bodies in charge of the chemical industry and light
industry.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new operations that will be engaged in production
and sales of photographic materials, Kodak already set up two
businesses in Shanghai to make 35-mm cameras, electronic camera
parts and film-developing equipment.
</P>
<P>
It also has a software development center in Shanghai, and a
joint venture for lens production in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Kodak estimates, China will become the largest
market for imaging products by 2010 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, China ranked the 17th largest market for
Kodak, and it moved into second place last year.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Host Next Summit of Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada has been asked to host
the Third Summit of the Americas, but no concrete date has been
given so far, according to an announcement from the Second Summit
of the Americas concluded here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the concluding session of the Summit as the
next host, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said:"Four years
ago, we laid out a vision for our common future. A vision of
prosperity. A vision of progress. A vision of partnership."
</P>
<P>
"Here in Santiago," the Canadian leader continued, "we
reaffirmed the fundamental principles laid down in Miami. And we
took new and specific steps to make these principles a concrete
reality in the lives of all of our people."
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that the history of this century showed the
undeniable failure of isolationism and protectionism. "They
impoverish our citizens. They undermine stability and
international understanding. They result in stagnation."
</P>
<P>
He termed the coming century as "the Global Century". And in
this new century, "the free flow of products, know-how and
investment will be the engine of economic development and
prosperity; the key to a higher standard of living and a better
quality of life."
</P>
<P>
Chretien said, the 34 countries in the West Hemisphere were
gradually becoming a family. "A family of different cultures, of
different languages and many races, but a family nonetheless...A
family that may not always be in perfect harmony--after all, no
family ever is."
</P>
<P>
However, "a family that cares for each other. That reaches out
to help and encourage each other. Not in judgement or
competition...but in acceptance and understanding", he said.

<HEADLINE> Second Summit of the Americas Launches Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- As an important step to the
establishing of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the
leaders from 34 countries in the West Hemisphere Sunday directed
their ministers in charge of trade to start negotiations for the
goal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Plan of Action endorsed by the 34 leaders who
have just concluded their Second Summit of the Americas, the
ministers for trade were requested to initiate the negotiations
for the FTAA, in accordance with the principles, objectives,
structure, modalities and all other decisions as set out in the
San Jose Ministerial Declaration last month, by convening the
Trade Negotiations Committee no later than June 30, this year, and
Negotiating Groups no later than September 30, this year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also asked their negotiators to "achieve concrete
progress in the negotiations by the year 2000 and agree on
specific business facilitation measures to be adopted before the
end of the century."
</P>
<P>
The plan also urged to ensure that the negotiating process is
transparent and takes into account the differences in the levels
of development and size of the economies in the Americas, in order
to create opportunities for the full participation of all
countries, including the smaller economies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to launching the negotiations for the FTAA, the
plan also listed a series of further actions which must be
consistent with FTAA negotiations, aimed at deepening the process
of economic integration, as well as to create opportunities for
the full participation of all countries. The plan contained a
series of proposals to advance the modernization of financial
markets, programs of science and technology, energy cooperation
and hemispheric infrastructure, in particular in the fields of
transportation and telecommunications.

<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The 34 leaders who attended the
Second Summit of the Americas adopted a Plan of Action here
Sunday, stressing that education is the key to social progress.
</P>
<P>
The document said, the Governments, fully recognizing and
respecting national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the
institutions of the respective countries with regard to education,
reiterate the commitment of the Miami Summit to ensure, by the
year 2010, universal access to and completion of quality primary
education for 100 percent of children and access for at least 75
percent of young people to quality secondary education, with
increasing percentages of young people who complete secondary
education, and assume responsibility for providing the general
population with opportunities for life-long learning.
</P>
<P>
For the realization of the objectives, the Governments are
resolved to implement targeted and inter-sectoral educational
policies and develop programs that focus specifically on groups at
a disadvantage in the areas of education, functional illiteracy
and socio-economic conditions, with attention to women, minorities
and vulnerable groups, the Plan noted.
</P>
<P>
Other steps include strengthening education management and
institutional capacity at the national, regional, local and school
levels, increasing the availability of teaching materials in
collaboration with official institutions, seeking to use
technology to link schools and communities as a way of
establishing ties in the Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Summit also requested the Organization of American
States (OAS), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World
Bank and the UN Economic Commission on Latin-American and the
Caribbean to provide financial assistance to education and use
their mechanisms to develop and strengthen regional cooperation in
areas such as distance education, upgrading information technology
for education and updating statistics and quality assessment for
education.
