<HEADLINE> Syria Shelters 410,000 Palestinian Refugees: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 370,000 Palestinian
refugees are formally registered in Syria, in addition to 40,000
unregistered refugees, a latest study showed.
</P>
<P>
The figures means that the Palestinian refugees represent 2.5
percent of the Syrian population. More than half of them live in
Damascus, capital of Syria, according to the study undertaken by
the Canadian government in cooperation with Syria and the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East (UNRWA).
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees fled their homes in Palestine between 1947
and 1948.
</P>
<P>
They enjoy almost all civil rights such as education,
medication and employment in Syria, except for Syrian citizenship,
the Arab Syrian News Agency quoted the UNRWA study as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the refugees in camps felt alienated from the
Palestinian leadership in the self-rule areas and many of them
expressed concern that the talks between the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) and Israel showed no interest in their affairs,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees said they did not get adequate share in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, it added.
</P>
<P>
The study urged the donor countries to provide UNRWA with
adequate resources to meet the humanitarian demands of the
refugees' self-reliance projects.
</P>
<P>
The refugee issue is among the thorniest topics to be dealt
with in the final status talks between the Palestinians and
Israel. Israel has so far rejected Palestinian refugees' right to
return home.

LUANDA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
Angolan government have reached agreement on the abbreviation of
the U.N. mission in Angola, United Nations Office to Angola, as
"UNOA".
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Foreign Ministry received on Tuesday the
information through a letter written by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, as a reply to a letter of the Angolan government sent
on October 18, an official source said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda has expressed his
satisfaction with the comments made by Annan on the content of
UNOA, which means a suspension of the quarrel about the U.N.
presence in Angola between the two sides, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that with the agreement on the abbreviation,
the United Nations and the Angolan government can sign in next
week an agreement for formalizing the 30-strong presence of UNOA
in the Angolan territory.
</P>
<P>
The new U.N. presence in Angola is fundamentally aimed to
reinforce the institutional capacity of the war-torn country in
the field of humanitarian assistance and human rights, the source

<HEADLINE> U.S. Circulates Draft Resolution on Renewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States had
circulated among the members of the United Nations Security
Council a draft resolution on the U.N. oil-for-food program in
Iraq, U.N. Spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution will be discussed by the Commission of
Experts this afternoon, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program will expire
on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, U.S. Deputy Representative to the United
Nations Peter Burleigh said the United States proposed the
extension of another six months of the program on the basically
the same standard as earlier, and the U.S. had argued in the
Council that it wants to make that technical, straightforward and
no controversial in the Council.
</P>
<P>
The United States hoped to have vote on the draft resolution on
Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats the Russian Ambassador to the
United Nations Sergev Lavrov had submitted some proposals and
amendments to the U.S. draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996
in a bid to ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq
caused by the stringent U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil to buy food and medicine as well as other
necessities for its people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Meets Rwandan Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe met a three-member Rwandan delegation Wednesday and
discussed the cease-fire agreement signed in Zambian capital
Lusaka four months ago for the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Mugabe, Rwandan Minister of State in the
 President Office Patrick Mazimhaka told reporters that they
discussed among other issues the Lusaka peace accord and how they
could map a way forward in implementing and seeing that countries
abided by the rules of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka said he obtained first-hand information about the
progress of the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord from
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge, who is Chairman of the
Joint Military Commission, a body comprising of representatives
from all the belligerent forces involved in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the cease-fire pact, DRC rebels backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, and the forces of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
which supported President Laurent Kabila's government had not
stopped fighting.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka confirmed that the fighting continuing in the DRC was
much more serious than before the signing of the cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The whole cease-fire violations have degenerated into a new
war in the Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Rwandan official expressed optimism that although
the cease- fire agreement had been violated on numerous occasions,
it had not collapsed as warring parties were determined to see it
holding.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka said he was hopeful the situation in the DRC would
soon improve following a Joint Military Commission meeting held in
Lusaka last week and another one to be held in Harare next week to
discuss on the implementation of the peace accord.

PARIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The 187 member countries of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) adopted Wednesday a resolution calling for the
strengthening of foreign language training besides English for
high school students.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by Ecuador and Guatemala, the resolution is aimed at
facilitating communication between peoples and preserving the
linguistic and cultural heritage of all countries.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the "globalization of communication"
could threaten the linguistic diversity of the world and result in
the use of one single language (English) by all and a
marginalization of other major languages.
</P>
<P>
It said that the English language itself is threatened with
"being divided into many dialects and a declination in syntax,
lexicology and phonetics."
</P>
<P>
It suggested that high schools open at least a second foreign
language course to enable students to speak three languages.

<HEADLINE> Putin, U.N. Commissioner Discuss Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin met here Wednesday with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
Sadako Ogata and discussed with him possible assistance to people
fleeing Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin reaffirmed Moscow's readiness for cooperation in
resolving humanitarian problems of Chechen migrants but insisted
they were not refugees, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The people who left Chechnya cannot be called refugees" as
"they are not going to other countries but seek protection from
the Russian government," Putin said. "This difference is of
principal importance in comparison with similar cases."
</P>
<P>
"They suffer because of international terrorists whom we must
fight now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces launched an offensive against rebels in the
breakaway republic about seven weeks ago following armed
incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist
bombings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other
cities.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities have accused Chechen warlords Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last
name, of masterminding the incursions and blasts.
</P>
<P>
Putin said around 220,000 Russians and 500,000 Chechens left
Chechen territory in the past few years. They were provided with
accommodation in Russian territory and Russia assumed this
particular burden, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following her talks with Putin, Ogata told reporters that
Moscow is open for international participation in the solution of
humanitarian problems of people who were forced from the territory
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin had demonstrated the openness of the Russian side on the
matter, Ogata said, expressing the hope that Russia would
guarantee all the necessary efforts to offer humanitarian aid to
refugees from Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: More Must Be Done to Improve Health, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Benon Sevan, executive
director of the U.N. Office of Iraq Program, said Wednesday that
much more must be accomplished if the oil-for-food program to
realize its potential to improve the health and well-being of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council on the
implementation of the U.N. humanitarian program in Iraq, Sevan
said the program began to be implemented three years ago and the
humanitarian situation in Iraq has improved considerably in those
three years.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for implementing the program effectively is
shared between the Security Council and its sanctions committee,
the government of Iraq, the U.N. Secretariat and agencies, funds
and programs of the United Nations systems as well as the
suppliers and their respective governments, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a welcome improvement in the arrival of
contracts for targeted nutrition supplies, and for food basket
items such as pulses and full cream milk that were previously in
short supply. However, we are concerned that we have seen
relatively few applications in Phase VI for health, oil spares,
water and sanitation, education and infrastructure," he said.
</P>
<P>
As on November 15, the total value of applications placed on
hold amounted to 1.042 billion U.S. dollars compared with approved
applications worth 8.770 billion dollars, since the start of the
program, the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are around 73 million dollars worth of contracts
on hold from phases IV to VI in the agriculture sector, and the
Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
estimates that some of these holds have resulted in significant
reductions in the use of land for grain crops and the loss of as
much as 20,000 tons of wheat production, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the electricity sector to date, of the 746.8 million of
applications submitted to the sanctions committee under phases IV,
V and VI, 377.7 million or 51 percent remain on hold, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Development Program, if all
contracts on hold were to be released, the government of Iraq
would, in theory, be able to add 1,900 megawatts of the new or
rehabilitated power generation capacity and prevent the loss of
approximately 800 megawatts from national grid, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
With approximately 28 million dollars worth of maintenance
equipment on hold, the Iraqi authorities will not be able to slow
down system deterioration and, unless other resources are
identified, this will contribute to an increased number of forced
outages, increased failures in power plants, thus shortening the
lifetime of existing generating units and their auxiliaries, Sevan
said.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said the Office of the Iraq Program remains fully
committed to assisting the sanctions committee and all others
concerned in expediting a review of the holds.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Bahrain have
reached an agreement on diplomatic cooperation, said a joint
statement issued here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Either country, according to the accord, can tackle the affairs
of the other's citizens in any country where the other has no
diplomatic representation, said the statement issued at the end of
a one-day visit to Kuwait by Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad
Al-Khalifa, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two countries are keen on boosting
bilateral ties and expressed hope the 20th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states, due late November in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh, would realize the aspirations of the Gulf
peoples.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
While voicing sympathy with the Iraqi people and asserting
keenness on safeguarding Iraq's independence and sovereignty, the
two Gulf Arab states called on the Iraqi government to abide by
the relevant United Nations resolutions, especially those related
to the Kuwaiti and third nation's prisoners held by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists there are still more than 600 Kuwaiti and third
country nationals held in Iraqi jails, an allegation denied by
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On the dispute between the UAE and Iran over three Gulf
islands, Kuwait and Bahrain expressed hope that the GCC
tripartite committee charged with the job of preparing for direct
talks between Abu Dhabi and Tehran would succeed in its mission.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the strategic Gulf
islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are currently
controlled by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
GCC foreign ministers set up a committee in Saud Arabia's Red
Sea port city of Jeddah last July aimed to work out a mechanism
for a peaceful solution to the UAE-Iranian dispute.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Urges African Support for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid called Wednesday on African leaders to support
the peace efforts on Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid made the call in three separate messages to the
Algerian and Djiboutian presidents, Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Omar
Djila, and chief of the Organization of African Unity Salem Ahmad
Salem, said Ahmad Bin Helei, Arab League assistant secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
The Djiboutian president holds the rotating presidency the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, of Eastern
African countries, which have been mediating between the Sudanese
government and the country's southern rebels.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum urged the three
leaders to support the efforts to help realize national
reconciliation in Sudan, Helei was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The messages reflected the league's keenness on giving a
momentum to the efforts aimed at coordinating an Egyptian-Libyan
peace plan and the role played by IGAD, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid spelled out Arab consensus on the necessity to
preserve Sudan's unity and territorial integrity and rejection to
any foreign interference in its internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August a five-point plan, calling
for a permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a meeting of the
preparatory committee for a peace conference to be attended by the
parties related to the Sudanese issue.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the opposition Muslim parties have
accepted the proposal. But the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA) has expressed reservations over the plan, saying it
favored the IGAD role.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties, which want to share power with Sudan's
Islamic government, and SPLA, which has been fighting since 1983
for greater autonomy for the south, form an umbrella opposition
group, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). NDA is expected to
forge a final stand on the Egyptian-Libyan initiative during a
meeting in Kampala, Uganda, on Monday.

questions regarding to the charter: the OSCE role in peacekeeping
operations, the conditions required to approve the use of force,
the OSCE role in members' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The charter was intended to strengthen the OSCE's role in the
peaceful settlement of disputes within its region by further
enhancing its effectiveness for early warning, conflict
prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that under the charter, the member states will
pledge to act in solidarity and partnership to ensure the
implementation of, and respect for, OSCE principles and
commitments and decisions.
</P>
<P>
They will further strengthen "non-hierarchical cooperation"
between the OSCE and other organizations within a platform for
"cooperative security." They will examine how the organization can
facilitate international efforts, in addressing new risks and
challenges to security.
</P>
<P>
The charter will also oblige the member states to ensure that
the economic dimension receives appropriate attention as an
element of the early warning and conflict prevention activities
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The member states will confirm the importance of implementation
of existing arms control and confidence and security building
measures as well as their adaptation to the new security
environment.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Forum for Security Cooperation of
the OSCE on Tuesday adopted the Vienna Document 1999 on the
Negotiations on Confidence and Security Building Measures
(CSBMS). It is an amended version of the Vienna Document 1994.
</P>
<P>
The CSBMS in its latest version is claimed to be designed to
promote mutual trust and dispel concern about military activities
by encouraging openness and transparency.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Document 1999 contains provisions regarding the
exchange of verification of military information between member
states, including the size of defense budgets, the location, size
and strength of military units and formations.
</P>
<P>
Such information also includes prior notification of certain
military activities, observation of certain military activities,
exchange of annual calendars of military activities, constraining
provisions for military exercises, verification measures and
military contacts and co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Document 1990 has previously been revised and
expanded in 1992 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Five Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon: Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Force
(IDF) claimed Wednesday that five "terrorists" were killed last
weekend by the IDF and the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA)
in military operations in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But the IDF intelligence in south Lebanon could not confirm
whether the five were members of the Lebanese military group
Hezbollah or of the Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian faction based in
Lebanon, the IDF said in press release.
</P>
<P>
Fighting intensified in the so-called "security zone" in south
Lebanon recently. The Hezbollah, or the Party of God, conducted
military operations against the IDF and its puppet SLA, while the
IDF attacked back with the support of constant air raids against
Hezbollah positions by the Israel Air Force (IAF) jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah gunmen shelled an IDF position in Israel's northern
border Tuesday night, but there were no reports of explosions
inside Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
The IDF said mortars were also fired Tuesday at the IDF's
Karkum outpost in the western sector of the "security zone,"
causing some damage but no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The IAF jets were called twice into action Tuesday night
against Hezbollah positions north of the zone, the IDF added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern security.
Hezbollah and other Lebanese military groups have been fighting
against Israeli occupation since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor and Social
Affairs Minister Eli Yishai reported on Wednesday to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak an emergency plan to fight child poverty,
which will cost the government more than 60 million shekels (15
million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The main targets of the plan include providing lunches to
schools in developing towns and low-income neighborhoods and
increasing the State payments for families with more children to
ensure the basic living standards.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted out following worrisome statistics
published Tuesday by government welfare agencies, which revealed
that one in every four Israeli children is living below the
poverty line, a fourfold increase within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
After an emergency meeting Tuesday with heads of ministries
with responsibility for the social and economic affairs, Barak
pledged to make changes in the society to help needy Israelis.

<HEADLINE> BSEC Summit Held to Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Organization
of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) met here Wednesday
afternoon to discuss ways and means to further strengthen
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came prior to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe Summit on November 18-19.
</P>
<P>
The "Istanbul Declaration", drafted by senior officials of the
BSEC member states, was adopted at the informal summit meeting,
chaired by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. The document
envisages its perspective for the near future.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the member states confirm their commitment
to promote effective economic, social and democratic reforms in
the BSEC area, the establishment of vigorous market economies and
the development of civil societies, which are of importance for
the BSEC area cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This commitment will also be instrumental to meeting the
aspirations of the member states wishing to fully integrate into
Europe," it added.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on the European Union to develop a
comprehensive strategy towards the BSEC region and assist the BSEC
in the elaboration and implementation of concrete regional projects.
</P>
<P>
President Demirel said in his address that the organization
has a vital mission, which is to act as a "vital and vibrant link"
between Europe and Asia, between the Caspian, Black sea and
Mediterranean Basins.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a Black Sea economic cooperation zone was put
forth by Turkey. Within its framework, Balkan countries such as
Albania, Greece and Romania, came together with the Ukraine,
Russia, Turkey and the countries of the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC is a loose organization with a secretariat and a
parliamentary assembly comprising of elected representatives of
the member states.

<HEADLINE> No Security Cooperation Before Peace: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Wednesday ruled out the possibility to discuss security
cooperation in the Middle East before peace is realized in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was in Istanbul, Turkey to attend a summit of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). "Only
in an atmosphere of comprehensive and just peace (realized in the
Middle East) could such cooperation be considered," he told
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A plethora of complications compounded by doubts over the
Arab-Israeli peace talks invalidated Mideast security cooperation
at present, the Egyptian official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Arabs' confidence in the peace process is waning due to
Israel's repeated delay of carrying out the signed agreements with
the Palestinians. They are also frustrated by the failure to
resume the peace talks between Syria and Israel, which was
suspended in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moussa further rejected the notion of copycating other
security institutions in the world, in reference to OSCE.
</P>
<P>
"A desire to establish security cooperation in the Middle East
should emanate from a common interest that is yet to evolve," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE summit will discuss, among other things, the security
cooperation in the Mediterranean region rather than in the Middle
East, he said.

MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday denied
allegations that it violated strategic arms reduction treaties
(START) by accepting strategic bombers from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Moscow was not going beyond limits set by the two stages of
START by moving eight Tu-160 and three Tu-95MS jets from Ukraine
to its territory, said Anatoly Kornukov, commander of the Russian
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
"We are even below the line" set by the treaties, the Interfax
news agency quoted Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commander also dismissed reports that Russia plans to send
strategic planes to Cuba. "We won't be flying there next year or
the year after," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is "possible" that Russian long-range aircraft
would fly to its naval base at Cam Ranh, Vietnam, Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
However, the flight will be only for "examination purposes," he
said. "We don't intend to stay there."
</P>
<P>
Russian strategic planes, as NATO ones, do make flights over
the Atlantic but only in specially designated areas, Kornukov
said.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. End Talks Without Deal on Nazi Slave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany and the United States
ended here Wednesday without any new breakthrough their sixth
meeting on the fund to compensate the victims of Nazi slave labor.
</P>
<P>
But the two negotiators, Otto Graf Lambsdorff of Germany and
Stuart Eizenstat of the U.S., said their stands were coming
"significantly closer" over how much money the German government
and business should contribute to the fund so that they expected
to achieve an overall deal in the coming three weeks in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The German side has agreed to raise its contribution by 2
billion marks up from the previous offer of 6 billion, 1 billion
from the government and the business each, and has set a range
between 6 billion to 10 billion in talks.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the victims have said the sum should
between 10 billion to 15 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff and Eizenstat said they had reached a "legal
solution" to protect German firms from state or local sanctions in
the U.S. caused by this issue as well as agreements on "technical
details" related. They called this round of talks "considerable
progress."
</P>
<P>
"We are now so close, the gap has narrowed considerably. I
appeal to the German companies to do what they can to narrow the
gap," said Eizenstat, the deputy finance secretary who led the
U.S. side in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"All parties should show more flexibility to achieve an end
solution," said Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff praised German business for raising its contribution
to 5 billion marks as he had demanded earlier this week, saying,
"it is a great success that industry has offered this amount."
</P>
<P>
However, that 5 billion marks is offered on conditions that
German companies are guaranteed against further lawsuits, and that
German business is given enough time to collect the sum, he told a
press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We must provide German business with as much protection as
possible," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The chancellor and I have agreed that we should not leave
German business under further pressure," Lambsdorff said,
referring to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat and Lambsdorff urged more German firms to take part
in the fund. By now some 60 German concerns have agreed to take
part in the fund.
</P>
<P>
But the business representatives said it would be
"understandable" that many German companies were reluctant to
participate in a solution with too many problems.
</P>
<P>
What German companies want is "an overall package" without any
flaw, said Manfred Genz, the financial chief of automotive giant
Daimler-Chrysler who represented German business in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It should be specified and guaranteed, and this figure is not
to increase at all," said Genz, stressing the over 10 billion mark
demand of the victims' lawyers was "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, German firms need three to four months to collect
money, said Genz, assuring, "we should do everything within the
period to raise the sum."

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches Operation to Help Internally Displaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
World Food Program (WFP) announced Wednesday it is launching an
appeal for the internally displaced in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The WFP warned that the internal armed conflict has caused
massive social dislocation which could provoke one of the worst
humanitarian crises in the Western Hemisphere this decade.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, the world's largest food aid agency, will give food
assistance to 227,000 destitute displaced people in ways designed
to restabilize their lives, encourage their voluntary return home
and help prevent further displacement.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which starts in February, will target mainly
women and children, as they are the poorest, most powerless people
in the violence and they constitute the majority of the internally
displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The two-year operation addressed the range of consequences
spawned by displacement in Colombia, the rate of which has doubled
since 1996 to 180,000 people a year. More than 1.5 million people
have fled their homes over the last 15 years, most of them never
to return, and they face a daily struggle just to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. release, at present, there are more
internally displaced people in Colombia than in any other Latin
American country.
</P>
<P>
The WFP operation assists two groups of people. The focus is on
the newly displaced, who are still in close proximity to their
original homes in the sparsely populated rural areas where the
conflict takes place. These people will be encouraged to stay
where they are until they return or resettle elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Among the WFP assistance for both groups will be job training,
upgrading of community infrastructure and food production
projects.

</P>
<P>
In the report submitted to the council Tuesday, Annan said the

<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia, Mexico and
Venezuela have reached agreement on keeping their previously-set
oil production cuts until March 2000.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of a tripartite meeting here Wednesday
among Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Bin
Ibrahim Al-N'aimi, Mexican Secretary of Energy Luis Telles and
Venezuelan Minister of Energy and Mines Leonel Loqez Rodas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with the situation on the world oil market
and cooperation among the three countries, the Saudi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers issued a joint press release after the
meeting, expressing their satisfaction with the positive results
of cooperation among the oil-producing countries as well as their
commitment to output cuts.
</P>
<P>
Such a commitment contributed to the stabilization of world oil
reserve and prices, they said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. They, together with non-OPEC
Mexico, initiated a drive last year to cut oil production in an
effort to shore up flagging oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The move grew into a concerted action by the 11 OPEC members
and other oil producers, and has boosted oil prices from around 10
U.S. dollars per barrel to about 24 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will continue implementing the oil cuts
agreement till March, 2000, to maintain the balance of world oil
market and serve the interest of oil producers and consumers
alike, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also voiced determination to continue consultation
with other OPEC members and non-members with the view to achieve
transparency on the oil market through and beyond 2000, according
to the joint statement.

<HEADLINE> GCC Defense Ministers End Meeting, No Pact Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Differences over military
in meet to prepare a draft for the
defense pact, he added, without mentioning when the meeting will
be held.
</P>
<P>
Ahead ojoint defense pact.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the failure to sign the pact reflects that
the six allies still differed on the issue of military
integration, although they have made great progress toward this
end.
</P>
<P>
A major difference may lie in the choosing of potential
enemies. For example, the six GCC members hold ostensibly
different views as to whether Iran should be regarded as a friend
or foe.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE have been locked in a decades-long dispute
over the sovereignty of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs,
the three strategic Gulf islands which are now under Iranian
control.
</P>
<P>
The GCC have repeatedly vowed support to the UAE's claim of
sovereignty over the islands, but Saudi Arabia, a powerful member
of the alliance, has in recent years become more inclined to
improving ties with Tehran, which makes the UAE irritated.
</P>
<P>
In October, Chief of Staff of the UAE armed forces Sheikh
Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan called on the Gulf Arab states to
overcome obstacles to closer military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Key plans include taking practical steps to establish a secured
military communications network including radar coverage and early
warning system among the six states as well as holding joint
military exercises, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
The six states, which depend mainly on western powers for
their armament, are keeping a 4,000-strong joint defense force,
known as the Peninsula Shield, which currently uses a Saudi army
base in Hafar al-Batin.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Replace Gas-Threatened City with New One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Housing
and Urban Development Ali Abdolalizadeh said on Wednesday that a
city named Parsomash would be built in the coming years to replace
Masjid Soleiman, a city facing threats of poisonous gases.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Ahwaz in the southwestern Khuzestan province,
Abdolalizadeh said Masjid Soleiman, the once oil-rich city in the
province, is facing possible leakage of mustard and cyanide gases
and the city residents should be evacuated within the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
The toxic gases, which normally lie deep under the ground,
would come out of the ground surface even if a minor earthquake
with a magnitude of four or five degrees on the Richter scale hits
the city, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a quake-prone country and some experts, including those
from the United Nations, have warned of possible major earthquakes
in the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the oil fields which were explored in the
city some 100 years ago are the sources of the poisonous gases.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new city is to be built some 17 kilometers
away from Masjid Soleiman and the first phase of it would become
operational within the next three years in an area of 200 hectares
to accommodate a 174,000-strong population.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South African Airways
(SAA) Wednesday announced that it has got ready for the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing here, the company's president and
chief executive Coleman Andrews said SAA started working on its
Y2K project as early as 1996 with more than 250 people involved.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 74 million rand (12.3 million U.S. dollars)
has been spent on the project in assessing, rectifying and testing
the critical mission information technology systems, he said,
adding that all of the 53 aircraft run by the company are ready to
fly safely through the millennium.
</P>
<P>
He said that over 550 main suppliers have been contacted
regarding their state of readiness, with the key contractors
reviewed by the special SAA Y2K legal task team.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the International Air Transport Association
and International Civil Aviation Organization, SAA will continue
to monitor the Y2K dependencies on all routes the company is
currently serving, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that regional centres have been established to monitor
the Y2K rollover and a high degree of global readiness has been
established.
</P>
<P>
On new year's eve the flights would be monitored closely
worldwide and controllers would know of any problem on any
particular flight, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
"Safety of our passengers will not be compromised and we will
not hesitate to re-schedule or re-route flights if the need
arises," he said.

<HEADLINE> Prisoners Clash With Police, Killing 11 in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were
killed and a jail official burnt alive and over 150 injured in the
worst ever rioting Wednesday at a prison in south India, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
While unconfirmed reports put the death toll at 16, Law and
Prisons Minister of the southern state of Tamil Nadu aladi Aruna
said details could not be divulged as the state assembly was in
session.
</P>
<P>
Many of the seriously injured prisoners, who were brought to
the local government hospital, said that the toll was much higher
than what was stated, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the riot at the central prison in Madras, 2,090
kilometers south of here, appeared to be an altercation picked up
by some prisoners with a deputy jail warden over the death of a
detainee.
</P>
<P>
the prisoners allegedly attacked the warden and set fire on the
room in which the altercation took place, PTI said.

<HEADLINE> UK Queen Unveils Government Program in Coming Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government
Wednesday set stable economic growth and employment as its main
targets for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth outlined the government's program in a speech
to parliament that showed Prime Minister Tony Blair's
uncompromising attitudes on welfare reform and crime.
</P>
<P>
"My government's aim is to promote fairness and enterprise,
providing people with real opportunities to liberate their
potential," the queen declared.
</P>
<P>
"(But) the central objectives of my government are high and
stable levels of economic growth and employment."
</P>
<P>
The government plans to present 28 bills with the main emphasis
on welfare reform, crime and improving Britain's creaking
transport system.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging anti-crime measures aim to fulfill Blair's
"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime mantra."
</P>
<P>
Government officials emphasised five key bills:
</P>
<P>
-- a crime bill focusing on "the menace of drugs;"
</P>
<P>
-- a sweeping transport bill to regulate rail travel better,
improve bus services and introduce charges to free clogged roads;
</P>
<P>
-- a welfare reform bill tackling parents who refuse to pay for
their children and the creaking pensions system;
</P>
<P>
-- an e-commerce bill to help Britain dominate the internet;
</P>
<P>
-- local government laws to extend the idea of city mayors to
the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The government will also extend its terrorism laws to include
religious groups and animal rights extremists.

<HEADLINE> 21 Arrested in Pak Accountability Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one prominent
politicians or renowned industrists have been arrested for loan
default or corruptive practices in a nationwide operation in
Pakistan, the country's National Accountability Bureau (NAB)
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Former federal minister Anwar Saifullah, former federal
minister Islamuddin Sheikh, former Chief Minister of Punjab
province Manzoor Wattoo were among those arrested Wednesday,
according to an official press release here.
</P>
<P>
Legal proceedings have been initiated against the arrested
persons as per law, NAB said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the persons who are defaulters or wanted in
accountability cases were already under detention like deposed
prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif, and
former accountability bureau chief Saif-ur-Rehman Khan, said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
Some persons like Asif Ali Zardari, husband of former prime
minister Benazir Bhutto, are already in jail while Benazir
herself, wanted in a number of cases, is outside the country, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are in progress to nab some other culprits who have
gone underground, said the press release which listed the names of
those arrested and those wanted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said that
banks had recovered 8 billion rupees (154.7 million U.S. dollars)
in cash from loan defaulters till November 16.
</P>
<P>
November 16 is the deadline set by Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf for loan defaulters to pay their
outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures clarified by the National Bank
of Pakistan, the total loan default including non-performing loans
in the country stands at 211 billion rupees (4.1 billion dollars),
out of which the defaulted loan amounts to 146 billion rupees (2.8
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Besides cash, the loan defaulters have begun surrender of
property, shares to get the loans settled," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has no plan to give extension in
time limit to defaulters.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the banks have been asked to ensure that
normal business operations are not affected during the course of
recovery of loans.
</P>
<P>
"Banks have been told to continue with prudent lending to new
applicants," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mid-January Seen Fit for E. Timor Peacekeeping Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian-led
multinational force in East Timor (INTERFET) and the United
Nations prefer a takeover of East Timor peacekeeping by the U.N.
in mid-January, the INTERFET said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its fourth fortnight report to the U.N. Security Council,
the INTERFET said that with its continued success, conditions are
moving towards the point where the transition to a peackeeping
operation under U.N. administration can take place.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET would welcome the early deployment of the advance
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping operation and early
discussions on the requirements of the transition.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET was mandated by the Security Council to restore
peace and security in East Timor following the August 31
referendum which resulted in independence of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The council requested that the INTERFET should transit to a
U.N. peacekeeping operation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET started its presence in East Timor on September
20. It now has a strength of 9,400 troops including 4,100
Australians and 5,300 from 16 other countries.
</P>
<P>
They are Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, South
Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Britain, and the United States,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report, covering the period from October 27 to November 10,
said there have been no significant security incidents since the
last report.
</P>
<P>
The main challenges for the remainder of 1999 are humanitarian
such as the return of internally displaced persons to East Timor,
their reintegration into East Timorese society and the territory's
reconstruction, the report added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Accused of Not Being Committed to Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A visiting senior Rwandan
official Wednesday accused the United Nations of not being
committed to intervening and ending the 15-month war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in
Harare, Rwandan Minister of State in the President's Office
Patrick Mazimhaka said that they had asked the U.N. to deploy
peace-keeping forces in the DRC, but the U.N. had not done so up
to now.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan official said the absence of U.N. peace-keeping
forces in the DRC was one of the reasons why the cease-fire was
being violated.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. was avoiding making definite resolutions and
decisions as to when the forces could be deployed. This had led
to their loosing faith in the world organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was determined
to push ahead and end the war in the DRC, only that its efforts
were sometimes hampered by lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its commitment, he said, the OAU deployed its
forces in Kabinda and Lesala areas of DRC's Kasai Province on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said funds amounting to one million U.S. dollars were now
available for the OAU to deploy more forces in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the move was likely to make things easier in the
war-torn central African country.

<HEADLINE> Commander: U.S. Missile Defense System No Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military officer
said Wednesday that the national missile defense system planned by
the United States "will not guarantee an effective protection even
from limited nuclear attacks."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Russia should not be deploying its own missile
defense system throughout its entire territory in response to the
U.S. move that represents a withdrawal from the 1972 ABM treaty,
said Colonel General Vladmir Yakovlev, commander-in-chief of
Russia's Strategic Missile Force.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. system "will not meet its name of missile defense
because it will not guarantee effective protection even from
limited nuclear attacks," the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev described as inadequate the cost effectiveness of the
national missile defense system that the U.S. plans to deploy.
</P>
<P>
"There is no absolute protection from nuclear weapons today,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev expressed the belief that the initiators of the
missile defense system in Washington "intentionally distort a
whole number of parameters of strategic offensive arms limitation
treaties in the interests of certain U.S. political and industrial
circles."
</P>
<P>
He warned that Russia has planned "a number of asymmetrical
military-technical measures that will be adequate and may be even
more serious than the steps now taken (by the U.S.) to sever the
ABM treaty."
</P>
<P>
"I would not want to name them, but I will only say that I see
no sense in the development of missile defense," Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
In a related topic, he said Russia would not bring back into
operation the missile attack warning station in Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
In stead, a transfer will be made to a new type of observation
and warning system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Krasnoyarsk station was fully dismantled and it won't be
restored," Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia is designing new warning stations that
"will be based on new principles and the latest electronic
equipment."
</P>
<P>
"They will consume much less electricity and they are more
economical and efficient than their predecessors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs More Friendly Courts for Victims of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- There is need to build more
victim- friendly courts in Zimbabwe to effectively deal with the
increasing cases of child sexual abuse, a Zimbabwean official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Harare senior regional magistrate Alfas Chitakunye made the
call when presenting a paper at a four-day World Health
Organization (WHO) inter- country training workshop for the
prevention and management of child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
The victim-friendly court system, which was introduced in 1997
in Zimbabwe, enabled the vulnerable witnesses to be placed in a
separate room from the court so that they could give evidence
without fear.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people now have access to the victim-friendly courts,
but there is still need to educate the public on the functions of
the court system as many feared that they were parading their
children," Chitakunye said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Family Support Trust, more than 1,500 children
below the age of 16 years were sexually abused countrywide over
the past 10 months, with the youngest victim being a
three-month-old baby. At least 3,000 rape cases were reported to
the police during the same period, mostly statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, violence against women and children often
went unrecognized and unreported.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, being attended by representatives from 14 African
 countries, sought to provide guidance on the diagnosis,
management of follow-ups of medical, psychological and legal
needs for sexually abused children.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at identifying the role of governments and
the community in the management of child sexual abuse.

LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets
ended lower Wednesday owing to weak performances from Wall Street
and global bond markets.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 gave in to a bout of profit-taking
to close down 0.41 percent, or 27.3 points, at 6,555.7 amid a
sharp slide in shares of index heavyweight BT.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking hit telecoms shares as investors awaited news of
the next development in the Vodafone Airtough/Mannesmann story.

BT contributed all but four points of the overall FTSE declines
as it tumbled 5.6 percent from Tuesday's closing high of just
under 1,289 pence.
</P>
<P>
Germany's DAX lost ground on the day, led lower by a 6 percent
slide in Mannesmann amid rumors Vodafone might abandon a fresh bid
for the German group and uncertainty about the terms of any
potential offer.

<P>
The Xetra Dax ended 0.67 percent lower, at 5,870.17, after

<HEADLINE> OSCE Leaders in Istanbul for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the member states
of the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) have gathered here Wednesday for their last summit of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The summit was to deal with a wide range of issues, including
regional conflicts, which undoubtedly will be a heated topic
during the two-day session on November 18-19.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said defended his country's military operation in its
Muslim-populated republic of Chechnya in an effort to "wipe out
terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Russia is acting in Chechnya according to international norms
so it will not accept criticism by western powers at the summit,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and European leaders have been
calling on Russia to halt its offensives against militants in
Chechnya, who the Russian government said carried out a spate of
bomb attacks in September, claiming 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Yeltsin is expected to have a meeting with
Clinton who is currently on a visit to Turkey. Clinton said on
Wednesday he will urge Yeltsin to seek a political solution to the
ongoing conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder are among the heads of state or government who will
attend the summit. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected
to address the summit.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the OSCE's six Mediterranean Partners for
Cooperation - Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia,
and two Asian ones - Japan and South Korea - are to attend, as are
representatives of some 30 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
About 100 non-governmental organizations are also registered
for the meeting. As many as 2,000 journalists are reportedly
covering the event.
</P>
<P>
Dominating the summit will be the adoption of Charter on
European Security, the signing of an adaptation agreement of
Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) and a
decision on the OSCE's chairmanship next year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government have beefed up security by deploying
tens of thousands of police in Istanbul, the country's largest
city straddling Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, member of both OSCE and NATO, has been making efforts
for full European Union membership without substantial progress,
due to its differences with the European body over the human
rights and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE, a pan-Europe security organization currently with 55
member states across continental Europe, the Caucasus, Central
Asia and North America, was established on January 1, 1995 on the
basis of the Convention on Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE), which had only been a forum.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise Slightly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices rose
just 0.2 percent in October, as gasoline and other energy prices
dropped down, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the small gain in its Consumer Price
Index, the most closely watched inflation gauge, followed a modest
0.4 percent rise in September. It was the smallest increase since
June, when consumer prices were unchanged, and was in line with
most analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 2.8 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase in 1998,
but all of the acceleration has reflected higher energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up
by 0.2 percent leaving the "core" rate of inflation rising at a
much more moderate 1.9 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said in a separate
report that construction of new homes and apartments rose 0.1
percent in October to 1.63 million units, in line with analysts'
expectations. New construction rebounded following a 1.8 percent
decline in September, reflecting in part the impact of Hurricane
Floyd, which raked the East Coast that month.
</P>
<P>
On the consumer price front, energy costs, which had increased
sharply over the last three months, fell by 0.1 percent in
October, the biggest decline since a 1.2 percent drop in June.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices declined by 0.4 percent in October, also the
best showing since June. The lower gasoline prices reflect a
modest drop in crude oil prices and less demand by motorists after
the peak summer driving season. Natural gas prices also fell by a
sharp 1.4 percent, the biggest decline since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
In October, food costs were also tame, rising 0.2 percent as
sharp declines in prices for pork, poultry and fresh vegetables
helped to offset rising prices for beef and dairy products. Fresh
fruit prices held steady.
</P>
<P>
The decline of 0.6 percent in cigarette and other tobacco
prices helped to restrain growth in overall consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
While inflation was contained in most other areas, apparel
prices rose for the second straight month, increasing by a brisk
0.6 percent in October reflecting higher prices for fall and
winter clothing.
</P>
<P>
New car prices also picked up 0.1 percent in October and
airline fares rose a sharp 5.3 percent, the biggest increase since
July.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration: Y2K Won't Derail U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has spent
more than 100 billion U.S. dollars in preparing for the Y2K bug
and the glitches that pop up next year should not have a
significant impact on the economic growth, Commerce Secretary
William Daley said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I do strongly believe that the U.S. is ready for Y2K," Daley
said at a press conference where he issued a report on Y2K
preparedness. "In February 2000 we will be celebrating our
nation's longest economic expansion in the nation's history."
</P>
<P>
The report said America's booming economy was sufficiently
"stable, large and resilient" that Y2K-related computer failures
-- even those overseas -- will not seriously affect the nation's
9-trillion-dollar gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Y2K worries arise from the fact that many older computer
systems were programmed to recognize only the final two digits of
a year and so may be stumped when 2000 occurs because they do not
recognize "00" as a valid year. Some may stop working altogether
or may make inaccurate calculation.
</P>
<P>
Those rising expenditures, for example, could add to growth
during the last three months of 1999 but likely would slow it
during the first months of 2000 to compensate.
</P>
<P>
John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, also cautioned Wednesday that "several hundred
thousand" smaller companies nationwide have not performed any
repairs and apparently intend to fix problems after they occur.
</P>
<P>
The new report said spending on Y2K repairs climbed from 5
billion dollars in 1995 and peaked last year and this year at
about 30 billion dollars each. It was predicted to drop next year
to about 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has said previously it will spend 8.4
billion dollars on Y2K repairs.

In a statement issued late Wednesday, the Georgian Foreign

<HEADLINE> UN Security Council Still Deadlocked on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council are still too far
to reach an agreement on its new policy towards Iraq, a U.N.
diplomat said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United States, Britain, France,
Russia and China have been discussing the new policy for a few
months and they intensified their talks these days in a bid to
break the deadlock as soon as possible, said the diplomat, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomat, the United States and Britain
have maintained that Iraq must allow the U.N. weapons inspectors
back into the country and allow surprise inspections of any
suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Russia and France want sanctions against Iraq, including
restrictions on investing in the country's oil industry, to be
lifted as soon as possible, with a less strict weapon inspection
system.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been sharply divided on its policy
towards Iraq after the U.S.-led military strikes against the
country last December. Since then, U.N. weapons inspection in
Iraq has not been resumed.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq has reiterated that it will never accept a new U.N.
agreement unless it lifts sanctions.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. According to relevant U.N.
resolution, Iraq must be declared free of weapons of mass
destruction before sanctions can be lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Mauritian Prime Minister
Navin Ramgoolam has vowed to cooperate with China in international
issues.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam made the pledge when meeting Wednesday with visiting
Chinese top legislator Li Peng in Port Louis, capital of the
African island country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Mauritius is willing to strengthen
its cooperation with China in international affairs, and agrees to
China's proposal on the convocation of a "Forum on China-Africa
Cooperation -- Ministerial Conference Beijing 2000".
</P>
<P>
Mauritius attaches great importance to the forum and will

</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam also assured Li that Mauritius fully supports China
to become a partner of dialog of the Indian Ocean Rim Association
for Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said China attaches great importance to promoting relations
with African countries including Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese proposal to host the China-Africa cooperation forum

<HEADLINE> Longer Life Gene Identified in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Italy identified a
gene that may be able to extend life as much as 35 percent and
have tested it on mice.
</P>
<P>
The results of the experiments were announced Wednesday by
Prof. Pier Giuseppe Pelicci, who is now leading a research group
at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in Italy's northern
city of Milan.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of our discovery," observed Pelicci, the head
of the IEO's experimental oncology department, "is that it has
demonstrated that the duration of life is genetically controlled."
</P>
<P>
For over ten years, he recalled, it has been known that certain
genes determine the duration of life, in such subjects as worms
and flies.
</P>
<P>
However, "No one up until now had been able to demonstrate that
the same was true for mammals".
</P>
<P>
Pelicci added that "the identification of this gene, named
'p66sch', has thus opened a new chapter in bio-medical research:
the study of aging genes".
</P>
<P>
The IEO researcher went on to stress that there exist
"well-founded reasons to believe that there is not just one gene,
but a whole family of genes that work in a similar ways as
p66sch."
</P>
<P>
While the mechanisms of how p66sch determines the duration of
life remains to be discovered, Pelicci said, "one fact is certain:
this gene controls the cell's response to stress oxidization, that
our organism is constantly subjected to because of oxidization
substances, also known as "free radicals", that are brought about
by environmental factors, like ultraviolet rays and diet, or
produced within the cell itself during cell respiration."
</P>
<P>
Turning his attention to the impact this could have on man,
Pelicci said "for the moment we have only hypotheses: the p66sch
protein usually is not operational. It becomes so when the cell is
subjected to oxidization stress. In this case, the protein is
activated by an enzyme. Thus it is possible to hypothesize that a
specific enzyme inhibitor may have the same effect on the cell as
eliminating the gene."

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Power Project in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 177.3
million U.S. dollars in financing to support Termoelectrica del
Golfo, a private sector project for a 230 megawatt power plant in
San Luis de Potosi of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Termoelectrica del Golfo is one of the first private
self-generation projects to be developed under Mexico's new
regulatory regime for the electricity sector, which allows tariffs
to be set freely among private parties.
</P>
<P>
As such, the project represents a key step towards the creation
of a competitive electricity market, the Washington-based IDB
said.
</P>
<P>
The new thermoelectric plant will supply electricity to 13
cement plants owned by Cemex, S.A. de C.V., the largest Mexican
cement producer and the world's third largest, in the central and
northern regions of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Surplus power generated by Termoelectrica del Golfo will be
sold to state utility Commission Federal de Electricidad.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a loan of 75 million dollars from
the bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of 102.3 million
dollars, with funds provided by commercial banks under
subscription of participation agreements with the IDB. Deutsche
Bank Ag of Germany and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. of the Netherlands are
the arrangers of the syndicated loan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) - The UK unemployment data for
October released Wednesday reveals a slight decrease to 4.2
percent, the lowest rate since April 1980.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the number of people claiming
benefit fell by 8,400 to 1,204,000, while the number of people in
work rose to a new record.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in work has risen to record of 27.5
million - an increase of 329,000 in the year, according to the
Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.
</P>
<P>
The employment Minister, Tessa Jowell, said: "This record
number of people in jobs clearly shows that the government's
policies of moving people from welfare into work and of making
work pay are taking effect."
</P>
<P>
However, despite the healthy employment figures, the ONS
reported a continuing decline in manufacturing jobs, down by
156,000 to 3,971,000 in the three months to September.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the largest fall has been in textiles and
leather firms, while nuclear fuels and coke reported increases.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Privatize Rail System Within 12 Months: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government plans
to privatize the rail system within the next 12 years, the Ghana
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Within the next 12 months, the government intends to place the
running of the rail system into the hands of investors," Minister
of Roads and Transport, Edward Salia, told a group of 28 visiting
French investors to Ghana Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is working out modalities for privatizing the
rail sector under a policy aimed at reviving its dilapidated
railways into a viable alternative transportation system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not elaborate on the rail
privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Salia said a study conducted by a French consultancy group has
brought to the fore the need for a sub-urban rail system to
address the transportation problems facing commuters in capital
Accra.
</P>
<P>
Other major areas being considered for foreign private
investments are in airport construction, toll roads, water
transportation for goods and services and air transportation,
Salia noted, urging closer cooperation between Ghana Airways and
Air France.

<HEADLINE> China to Lower Legal Reserve Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China,
the central bank, announced today that it will lower the legal
reserve requirements of financial institutions by two percentage
points beginning November 21.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, from the current eight percent to six percent,
is expected to increase the available funds of Chinese financial
institutions by nearly 200 billion yuan (some 24 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks could use the increased sum of available funds
for providing more loans to enterprises, according to the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the move will give an impetus to the nation'
s economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The central bank hopes the downward adjustment will also help
commercial banks to restructure their fund structure, increase
paying ability and improve management, thus paying the way for a
steady transition of financial institutions to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The reduction decision was made after a careful study of the
current economic situation, the need of commercial banks for
increasing loans and the shortage of fund confronting small and
medium-sized financial institutions all over the country, the bank
explained.
</P>
<P>
The deposited reserve is the fund held by financial
institutions for meeting requirements of fund settlement and for
customers drawing from savings deposits. It is widely used by
central banks in various countries as an important tool of their
monetary policies to regulate money supply.
</P>
<P>
China established the deposited reserve system in 1984. The
central bank reformed its deposited reserve system in March 1998
by reducing the legal reserve requirements from 13 percent to
eight percent following the establishment of policy-oriented banks
and the improvement in the management of commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plays Down New Beef Dispute With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday tries to play
down a fresh dispute with Germany over British beef after reports
said that Germany might be in a quarrel with Britain on whether it
will lift the ban on the import of British beef.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said he was
confident the German government wanted to allow British meat
imports once again.
</P>
<P>
"The Germans have indicated they are seeking to get the ban
lifted," the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They start from that standpoint," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the array of safety procedures and scrutiny British
beef had gone through in the wake of the mad cow disease crisis,
it could be marketed "as the safest beef in the world" if clearly
identified, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown told
fellow ministers Thursday in Brussels that he remained confident
that a deal with France would be sorted out in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the European Commission lifted a 3-1/2 year ban on
British beef. But France, on the advice of its own scientists, has
refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman refused to say whether labeling of British
beef could form part of a solution with France.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton, Differing over Chechnya, Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and United States President Bill Clinton held a
45-minute-long one-on-one meeting at the Cirangan Palace here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders did not speak to the press after their meeting
and the details of their meeting are not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Later, Yeltsin had a meeting with French President Jacques
Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder but the meeting
lasted only five to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he was flying home to deal with the rebel republic
of Chechnya, but the three leaders agreed to meet again on
December 21 in Paris, Chirac's spokesman Catherine Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the Summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which kicked off this
morning, Yeltsin and Clinton confronted each other over the
Chechnya issue.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said the Russian army's offensive in
Chechnya is a fight against international terrorists, whose aim
is to spread extremism throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton warned that Russia's actions can increase rather
than reduce the threat of terrorism, and result in an endless
cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said there can be no negotiations with bandits and
that peace requires their "complete destruction," adding "we do
not accept the advice of so-called objective critics of Russia."
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned that Russia's international ties may be damaged
if it does not halt its military actions in the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov earlier stressed that
Moscow does not want Chechnya discussed at the summit, saying the
"local matters" should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Russians troops backed by tanks and artillery are launching
large scale attacks on the Chechnya-based militants, who twice
invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer and are blamed for a
series of apartment bombings that killed some 300 people in Moscow
and other cities across Russia in September.

In October 1991, Chechnya declared independence but Russia has
never accepted it.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Elaborates on Chinese Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TWON, South Africa, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Top
Legislator Li Peng on Thursday pledged to build a socialist
democracy, adhere to and improve the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China, told a special meeting of the South African
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces that China
attaches great importance to the work of legislation and has made
major progress in this area.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that a socialist legal framework with Chinese
 characteristics as required by the strategy of ruling the country
according to law will be well in place by the year 2010," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li reviewed the legal process in the last two decades and more
in China, saying that while pressing ahead with the economic
restructuring, China has also taken steps to steadily advance the
political restructuring and strengthen democracy and the legal
framework.
</P>
<P>
"We have also set forth the national strategy of running the
country according to law and building a socialist country based on
the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since 1979, China has enacted or made over 360
laws or law- related decisions, on top of which over 800 national
administrative regulations and over 7,000 local laws and
regulations have been introduced.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, all the main aspects of the state and
social life in China are now covered and regulated by law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize that legislation should take into consideration
major policy decisions on reform and development, and fully
reflect the will and desire of the people. In the meantime, we
also draw on the law-making experience and legislative
achievements of other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To sum up, a socialist legal framework based on the single
most important law, the constitution, has taken initial shape in
China," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In china, democracy and the legal system are developed in a way
that best suits China's conditions, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Wednesday from Mauritius on a six-day visit
to South Africa, the second leg of his six-nation Afro-Asian tour
that will also take him to Kenya, Israel, Palestine and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Calls for Equality Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top
legislator Li Peng Thursday called on the international community
to strive for equality among all countries so as to create a
rational and just international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
"China has always held the view that all nations, big or small,
rich or poor, weak or strong, should be equal members of the
family of nations," said Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
Li, in his address at the special meeting of the South African
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, said that
it is simply unimaginable if the world of over 200 countries and
six billion people should be dominated by one country or a group
of countries.
</P>
<P>
"Nor would it be possible for all countries to adopt a single
social system or a single economic model," he said.
</P>
<P>
he said "a multi-polar world is after all better than a
unipolar one, as it is conducive to world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a world of diversity and complexity. Therefore, the
people of all nations are equally entitled to choose whatever road
they think best suits their national conditions and conforms to
their fundamental interests, " said Li, who arrived here on
Wednesday on a six-day official good-will visit.
</P>
<P>
In international relations, Li Peng said, all countries should
strictly observe the principle of non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, adding that all international disputes or
regional conflicts should be settled in a just and rational manner
by means of peaceful negotiations and equal consultations.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no use or threat of force in their
settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance of peace, the pursuit of stability, the
promotion of cooperation and the attainment of development have
become the common aspiration of the people of all countries and
represent an irresistible historical trend, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the reality at the turn of the century tells us
that humanity is still confronted with new and severe challenges
in its pursuit of peace and development. Destabilizing factors
have increased markedly and the world is still far from being
tranquil. Hegemonism and power politics still linger on in the
international political, economic and security fields, and have in
fact manifested themselves in new expressions," Li said.
</P>
<P>
This being said, the overall international situation is still
moving towards relaxation and the world is further moving towards
multi-polarity, he observed.

ISTANBUL -- In their speeches at the opening session of the
OSCE Summit held here on Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin held a completely different
tone on Chechnya issue.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia has launched military offensives in
Chechnya to wipe out terrorists and bandits, and its fight against
terrorism not only benefits the country itself, but also serves
the interests of the international community.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Replaces Senior Police Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Thursday replaced all of the 14 provincial police chiefs as well
as the heads of eight bureaus of the National Police Agency.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, Lee Moo-young was appointed as the chief of the
National Police Agency, replacing Kim Kwang-shik.
</P>
<P>
The replacement came after the fire on October 30 in a bar in
Inchon which killed 55 people and wounded 58, most of whom were
teenagers who should not have been allowed into the bar or served
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that police officers and other public
servants took bribes from the bar owner in return for keeping
silence over his illegal operation of the bar.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the National Police Agency announced it would
replace all officers at police stations in charge of managing
entertainment industries by November 20, with a 13-point program
to eradicate corruption in police institutions unveiled.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, at least 1,000 police officers
will be replaced and Seoul is now preparing to choose new police
officers.

<HEADLINE> China to Be Partner in Global AIDS Vaccine Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Developing a widely adaptable
AIDS vaccine is the goal for scientists who fight against global
spread of the deadly disease. Now, some are focusing their study
in China, thinking that the country may be the perfect partner for
collaboration in vaccine research.
</P>
<P>
An international AIDS vaccine workshop which opened here today
stressed the importance of participation in the global AIDS
vaccine effort from developing countries, which are the home to
almost 90 percent of new HIV infection cases but cannot afford
drug therapies.
</P>
<P>
China, with an increasing HIV/AIDS problem, can play a leading
role among developing countries in this monumental task, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest producer of vaccines in the world, China has
sufficient research and clinical skills to contribute to the
global effort, and has taken a leadership position in this area,
according to Seth Berkley of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, a worldwide non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
"We have conducted fruitful genetic and epidemiological studies
of the AIDS virus for vaccine development," said Shao Yiming of
China's National Center for AIDS Prevention and Control (NCAIDS).
</P>
<P>
Chen Xianyi, an official with China's Ministry of Health, noted
that breakthroughs and success in AIDS vaccines rely more and more
on cooperation between industrialized and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting, which is for the first time held in China,
demonstrates such a spirit of collaboration," he said.
</P>
<P>
With about 16,000 people infected by HIV each day worldwide,
AIDS has now become the most deadly infectious disease in the
world. However, no drugs or vaccines have been reported to be
effective in curing or preventing the disease.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Urged to Face Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TWON, South Africa, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top
legislator Li Peng said here Thursday that developing countries
should learn to grasp the opportunities offered by economic
globalization while successfully avoiding its risks.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that economic globalization is an inevitable
outcome of the world economic development and represents the
general trend of the times," Li, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, said
in an address at the special meeting of the South African National
Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that economic globalization is conducive
to international exchanges and economic development, Li said the
trend "means new opportunities as well as risks and challenges".
</P>
<P>
Li said all countries, whether developed or developing, are
economically inter-related, inter-dependent and mutually
complementary, and their interests are interwoven.
</P>
<P>
"Given the wide range and complexity of the international
economic activities, the question of economic security has become
even more striking, " said Li, who arrived here on Wednesday for a
six-day official good-will visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, developing countries may benefit from the
global flow of essential production factors such as capital,
technology and information.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, western developed countries still occupy a
dominant position in the process of economic globalization while
most developing countries are still relatively weak in their
capacity to make full use of the opportunities brought by the
globalization and to prevent and withstand the possible
accompanying risks," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that another factor seriously hindering the
economic development of developing countries is the widening gap
between the North and the South.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore essential that the international community
should work hard to reform and improve the existing international
financial system and to establish a new just and rational
international order," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, developing countries on their part should
learn how to best protect themselves and should size up the
situation and formulate their own economic and financial policies
in the light of their actual conditions so as to prevent and
defuse any economic risks that may rise and safeguard their
economic and financial security," he said.

"No significant efficacy information is yet available on any
candidate AIDS vaccine, though over 30 candidate HIV vaccines have
been evaluated in over 60 clinical trials worldwide since 1987,"
said Margaret Johnston from the U.S. National Institute of Health.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists hold that safe and effective AIDS
vaccines would still be among the best medical and cost effective
prevention tools.
</P>
<P>
They called for further fundamental studies, lab experiments,
and clinical evaluations, along with considering social and
ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
In a major development in this effort, Chinese scientists and
their foreign counterparts agreed tonight to jointly set up a
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The NCAIDS signed an agreement with the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center of the U.S. to start a clinical virology lab in
Beijing, through which information, technology and research
personnel will be exchanged between China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
David Ho, internationally-known researcher of the well-known "
cocktail" combination therapy against HIV and the head of Aaron
Diamond center under the Rockefeller University, said that he has
long hoped to work with the Chinese counterparts to tackle the
increasing problem of HIV/AIDS in China.
</P>
<P>
China is feared to have more than 400,000 HIV carriers since
the first AIDS case was reported in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Turkey's Entry into EU: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said in Istanbul on Thursday that Greece supported
Turkey's European Union (EU) perspective.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Bulent
Ecevit, Simitis said Greek government wanted all the European
governments to be included in the EU, the semi-official Anatolia
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Turkey's neighboring rival, has long been accused of
attempting to block the Euro-Asian country's entrance into the
club of European nations.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, who came to Istanbul for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe Summit on November 18-19, said
that the meeting between him and Ecevit had focused on the Cyprus
issue, the Aegean dispute and regional problems within the scope
of the international law.
</P>
<P>
A lasting peace in this region should be instituted between
Turkey and Greece, said Simitis.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of cooperation between Turkey
and Greece against natural disaster, hoping that the two
countries will continue to make cooperation in coming days.
</P>
<P>
The Greek prime minister pointed out that he had observed
Turkish people's willingness to further improving cooperation with
Greece during his brief visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ecevit said that he held a positive and productive
meeting with Simitis, adding that Turkish and Greek people's
voluntary solidarity had accelerated the dialog progress between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we should give priority to the relations between
Turkey and Greece."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also said that he had an opportunity to thank Simitis
at the meeting for Greece's contributions to heal the wounds of
the quake disasters in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over issues of territorial waters, air space limits and
the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The recent devastating earthquakes in the two countries,
however, have provided an opportunity for them to improve their
strained ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Rises Further in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit rose
to 24.4 billion dollars in September although its farmers saw
their exports climb to the highest level in 19 months, according
to the Commerce Department's report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the September trade deficit was 3.7
percent higher than a revised 23.5 billion dollars of August's
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The widened deficit in September left the overall trade deficit
running at an annual rate of 255.5 billion dollars this year, 56
percent above last year's record of 164.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For exports, which had hit a record in August, edged back a
slight 0.9 percent to 81.7 billion dollars, reflecting sharp
declines in exports of commercial airliners and autos.
</P>
<P>
Imports hit a monthly record, rising 0.1 percent to 106.1
billion dollars as the price of foreign crude oil shot up to the
highest level in 31 months.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit, which has been blamed on the worldwide
economic crisis of the past two years, is the one blot on an
otherwise superior economic performance that has pushed the U.S.
unemployment rate down to a 30-year low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers, however, have lost a half-million jobs
since early 1998 as the world economic crisis has cut sharply into
exports of U.S. manufactured goods and contributed to a flood of
cheaper-priced imports into the country.
</P>
<P>
The nation's farmers, who export one-fourth of their output,
have also been seriously hurt, with the slump in exports, low
global commodity prices and floods contributing to the worst
crisis in the farm belt in a decade.
</P>
<P>
But the new report showed that U.S. exports of agricultural
products actually rose by 2.5 percent in September to 4 billion
dollars, the highest level since February 1998.
</P>
<P>
Even with the widening of the deficit in September, many
economists believe the worst may be over for the trade
deterioration as countries hit by the global financial crisis,
such as South Korea, Thailand and Brazil, mount solid economic
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
Still, the trade imbalance has created political headaches for
President Bill Clinton, allowing administration critics to charge
that Clinton's trade policies have been a major failure that have
put U.S. jobs at risk without getting significant openings in
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the U.S. deficit with China rose by 0.5
percent to 6.9 billion dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan widened by 3.8 percent to 6.6 billion
dollars, the second highest imbalance with Japan on record,
exceeded only by 6.7 billion dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries also set a record in September, rising to 3 billion
dollars as the U.S. foreign oil bill climbed 6.8 billion dollars
for the month, reflecting higher volume and higher price.
</P>
<P>
The average price for a barrel of crude oil rose to 19.52
dollars in September, the highest level since crude oil was
selling for 20.48 dollars per barrel in February 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Groundnuts Cause Liver Cancer: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research has found
that Sudanese groundnuts contain a kind of poisonous substance
that causes liver cancer more rampant among men than women.
</P>
<P>
All kinds of groundnuts grown in Sudan have been attacked by a
sort of fungus that is directly related to liver cancer, said
Mohamed Osman Idrees of the Disease Control Department of the
Faculty of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The research, also conducted on groundnuts grown in India,
Kenya and Malaysia with similar climate to Sudan, found out that
the fungi do not die in heat. The only way to get rid of them is
to wipe out the crop or treat it in a complex chemical procedure.
</P>
<P>
Fungus poison in groundnuts produced in western Sudan is 20
times the permissible limits set by the World Health Organization
(WHO), which allow only 10 particles in 1 billion, the Al Sahafi
Al Dawli newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the fungus poison was developed through improper
storage and subsequent fracturing and humidity, said the research
findings.
</P>
<P>
With regard to exports, Sudanese peanuts are subject to
internationally recognized specifications and standards. But
peanuts which are locally consumed are polluted by poisons.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I believe that a basis now exists for devolution to occur, for
the institutions to be established and for decommissioning(
guerrilla disarmament) to take place as soon as possible." he told
reporters in Belfast in announcing his final report on his 11-week
talks with the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Mitchell suggested that the coalition government
should meet on the same day as the Irish Republican Army appoints
a go-between to open discussions with disarmament officials.
</P>
<P>
"Devolution should take effect, then the executives should meet
and then the paramilitary groups should appoint their authorized
representatives, all on the same day, in that order," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said a series of statements by the key players in the
long drawn out process were "extremely positive" and would build
mutual confidence in each other's commitment to the 1998 Good
Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said a
foundation stone for a peace has been laid in Northern Ireland and
the political parties now had a great responsibility to make sure
what was achieved was taken forward.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson made the commitment at the completion of a review of
the Good Friday Agreement made by Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
He added that Mitchell had transformed the situation from
conflict and confrontation to dialogue and peace.

He said that Burundi will continue to stick to its "one China"
stand and to support China's reunification efforts. Moreover,
Burundi supported China's stance on the issue of human rights and
agreed that the understanding of human rights in different
countries should be based on the their own sense of values.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade cooperation, Jiang described the existing
bilateral cooperation as "fruitful." The projects built by China
in Burundi have played a positive role in the country's socio-
economic growth and enhanced the people-to-people friendship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in carrying out bilateral cooperation, China
emphasizes equality, mutual benefit, efficiency and for the good
of common development.
</P>
<P>
China never uses any means to interfere in the internal affairs
of Burundi, Jiang said, adding that the economic cooperation would
be even more promising after the situation in Burundi turned
better. Buyoya also hoped to enhance economic cooperation with
China by various means.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya briefed Jiang on the domestic situation of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
China has been following the development of the Burundi
situation, Jiang said. Since Buyoya assumed the presidency, Jiang
said, Burundi promptly regained domestic political stability by
advancing national reconciliation meant to create conditions for
economic recovery and development.
</P>

neighborly policy and actively improved the relationship with

<HEADLINE> ADB Makes 5-Country study on Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said Thursday that the high concentration of corporate
ownership is one of the main reasons for weak corporate governance
in the countries most affected by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a five-country study conducted by the ADB, other
main reasons for weak corporate governance include poor
enforcement of corporate laws and regulations, underdeveloped
capital markets, and weak competition.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted in Indonesia, Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The ADB study confirms that weaknesses in corporate governance
and financing contributed to the Asian financial crisis although
the quality of corporate governance and financing varies across
countries.
</P>
<P>
The study also identifies priority areas for reforms, including
strengthening banking supervision and regulation and improving
financial reporting standards and their enforcement.
</P>
<P>
To develop capital markets, promote competition, and encourage
institutional investors' participation in corporate governance are
also essential and should be implemented without delay, said the
study.

BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry
announced on Thursday that the U.S. and British representatives
at the U.N. Sanctions Committee had suspended another 29 of its
contracts signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said in a statement that the
U.S. and British representatives at the Sanctions Committee put
on hold those 29 contracts during the committee's sessions held
on November 9-11.
</P>
<P>
Those contracts were concluded in the fifth and sixth phases of
the oil-for-food program with companies of France, Germany, China,
Japan, Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Macedonia and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The blocked contracts were for the purchases of oil spare
parts, electrical, medical and agricultural equipment and other
prerequisites.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program now in its final days of the
sixth phase, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of oil in
every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys in
the Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Wireless to Dominate Asia as Internet Access Medium: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Asia is rapidly becoming the
proving ground for the next great trend in telecommunications --
the merging of mobile telephone and the Internet, according to a
Benchmarks report published by Pyramid recently.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the new Pyramid Benchmarks report, entitled
Internet Connectivity in Asia, estimate that Asia's cellular
population will be approximately 125 million by the end of this
year and should reach over 310 million by 2004.
</P>
<P>
As cellular service becomes more ubiquitous in the region and
new data-centric applications rush in with the advent of third
generation technology, the mobile phone will likely become the
Internet access choice, said Ross O'Brien, Asia research director
of Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said they believe that nearly half of all cellular
subscribers in the Asian region should have mobile data service
capabilities in the next 10 year.
</P>
<P>
The Pyramid reported noted that there are more cellular phones
in South Korea than fixed lines, and the same will be true in Hong
Kong and the Philippines in the next year.
</P>
<P>
China, which has become the world's largest mobile phone
procurer, continues to add nearly one and a half million new
cellular subscribers every month, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Antarctic Ozone Hole as Big as Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that the ozone hole in
the Antarctic is as big as ever and much more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
The hole covers an area of 22 million square kilometers - an
expanse more than twice the size of China, a UNEP release
reaching here on Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, UNEP Executive Director based in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi, said "scientific evidence proves that we are on
the right path to heal the ozone hole, but much more needs to be
done."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the progress being made to repair this seemingly
irrevocable damage to the Earth's stratosphere is largely due to
the research undertaken by scientists around the globe.
</P>
<P>
To protect the ozone layer, Toepfer said, an ozone meeting is
scheduled to take place in the Chinese capital Beijing from
November 29 to December 3 this year when 172 countries will come
together to agree on funding for eliminating chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) and ozone-destroying chemicals.
</P>
<P>
At the Beijing meeting, member countries of the Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer will decide on
how best to replenish the Multilateral Fund over the next three
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fund would make it possible for developing countries to
meet their treaty commitments, including the phasing out of CFCs
and halons by 2010, Toepher said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting, consideration will also be
given to further strengthening the Protocol as it relates to
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and Methyl Bromide.
</P>
<P>
According to the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal
Protocol, the ozone layer is projected to recover to pre-1980
levels in 2050, provided that the Montreal Protocol is
implemented and all countries completely phase out the consumption
of ozone-depleting chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the total consumption of CFCs has fallen by 84
percent globally.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 scientists from
27 countries are expected to gather here later this month for the
world's first international symposium on development strategies
for "Digital Earth."
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, president of the organizing committee and member

be the first of this kind in the world since the "Digital Earth"
concept was unveiled by United States Vice-President Al Gore in
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The concept is another major strategic development initiative
of global importance, following other U.S. vital concepts such as
"information highway" and "knowledge-based economy," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Digital Earth" is the process through which any geographical
object on earth can be digitized and made available on the
Internet for either economic and military use.
</P>
<P>
Vital expertise and hardware for launching "Digital Earth" are
information and space technology and related infrastructure, among
others.
</P>
<P>
The five-day symposium, launched by 17 Chinese ministries, is
scheduled to begin on November 29 at Beijing's International
Convention Center.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Cancel Talks with MILF if Attacks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada warned the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
Thursday that the government will cancel the formal peace
negotiations with the MILF should they continue to conduct attacks
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the southern province of North Cotabato,
the president renewed his pledge to pursue just, lasting peace in
the south, but warned MILF rebels who jeopardize the talks that
"there will be no letup against their terrorist activities".
</P>
<P>
"I will cancel the talks if the MILF launches another assault
on our military and our civilian population," he told provincial
and municipal officials, as well as troop commanders in the area.
</P>
<P>
The president made an unannounced visit Thursday afternoon to
see for himself the plight of residents displaced by the recent
clashes between military troops and MILF rebels and the situation
of soldiers wounded in the encounters.
</P>
<P>
Estrada promised relief goods to help the 30,000 civilians
rendered homeless as a result of the military-MILF clashes.
</P>
<P>
The president maintained that he will not allow the MILF to set
up any additional camp in any part of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also renewed his call for an end to decades of strife
and violence in Mindanao to enable the island to win its war
against poverty and chart a new path towards sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the president pointed out that he cannot allow the
country's territorial integrity to be compromised and stressed
that this position should be defended "at all costs."
</P>
<P>
Formal peace negotiations between the government and the MILF
opened on October 25 in Maguindanao province and were tentatively
scheduled to resume later this month.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between government troops and the rebels started on
November 3 when 200 MILF members attacked a village in North
Cotabato province. The encounter left several soldiers, rebels and
civilians dead and injured.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects for Franchise Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Experts and business people
attending today's Franchise Symposium all believe that franchises
will become a favorite marketing pattern in China in a few years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuqing, a high-ranking official with the Ministry of
Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that the franchise pattern
provides opportunities for the inflow of overseas capital and
technology, which will be favorable for upgrading China-made
products.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Xin, deputy director of the Trade and Marketing
Department under the State Economic and Trade Commission, said
that with name-brand competition becoming stiffer these days,
franchising has found favor among investors here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has more than 1,500 chain stores with annual
sales exceeding 100 billion yuan, and the industry continues to
grow at a rate of 40 percent annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Hans Lang, president of the German Chain Store&AMP;
Franchise Association, franchising is a marketing pattern "
suitable for China's current development."
</P>
<P>
He said that after China joins the WTO, foreign investors will
find more business opportunities in developing franchises in China,
and that franchising is not restricted by trade or regions.
</P>
<P>
Li Xihua of the State Administration of Internal Trade said
that in China franchising was born out of the fast-growing chain
store sector, and now covers every aspect of the national economy,
from education to home remodeling.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, China still needs specific laws to
standardize the sector, and the shortage of internationally
competitive brand-name products, professionals, and quality
services stand in the way of the full development of franchise
businesses at present.

Standing Committee and president of the China Association for
Science and Technology, said at today's session that the Sino-U.S.
trade agreement just signed will accelerate the process of China's
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. After China's entry to
WTO, Chinese companies will face fierce international competition,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese enterprises should depend on innovation to beat the
competition," said Zhou, adding that the forum offers a good
opportunity to find new and innovative ideas to boost Chinese
businesses.

<HEADLINE> Georgia to Enhance Control of Border With Russia on Chechen Section </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Russian Mi-8 helicopter reportedly dropped a large quantity
of anti-personnel mines Wednesday on the territory adjacent to the
Georgian village of Shatili near the Chechen border, and another
Russian gun-ship broke into the Georgian air space over the
Chechen sector of the Georgian-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry said that more troops and border guards
would be dispatched to the Shatili area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Valery Chkheidze, Georgia's border guard
chief, told reporters that his troops would "shoot dead " all
violators.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued by the Georgian foreign ministry Wednesday,
said "such action of the Russian forces, which cannot be described
otherwise than a direct aggression against a sovereign state, is a
continuation of a planned anti-Georgian propaganda campaign."
</P>
<P>
The ministry expressed its resolute protest and urged the
Russian leadership "to stop aggressive actions against sovereign
Georgia and also to find and hold the officials" who were
responsible for "the criminal action."
</P>
<P>
Georgian Interior Minister Kakha Targamadze also said Wednesday
that "all interior ministry troops have been mobilized."
</P>
<P>
However, Chief of the Russian General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin
earlier Thursday denied Tbilisi's statements alleging that the
Russian aircraft had bombed the Argun gorge on its territory.
</P>
<P>
"The strikes were videotaped, and the tape confirmed that the
strikes were aimed at Chechnya and there was no bombing of the
Georgian territory," Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry also denied bombing of the
Georgian villages, saying that "the allegations that a Georgian
checkpoint was bombed near the Georgian village of Shatili are
untrue."
</P>
<P>
It described the reports as deliberate misinformation aimed at
harming the traditional and friendly Russian-Georgian relations
and misleading the world public in its views of the Russian
troops' actual moves to eliminate bandits and terrorists in
Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Convert Vehicles Into Natural Gas Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government on
Thursday decided to convert all government and semi-government
vehicles into compressed-natural gas (CNG) users immediately to
check air pollution in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting at the Environment and
Forest Ministry, which was also attended by representatives of the
Finance Ministry, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, the CNG Gas Ltd. and the
Transport Pool.
</P>
<P>
Four CNG filling stations are already in operation in the city
so far and six more will be set up soon.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Energy, Power and Mineral Resources will
install 51 CNG stations across the country by the year 2001 in a
bid to save foreign exchange reserve and make the cities more
environment friendly, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,038 vehicles have been transformed into CNG-users since
the government initiated the program about 10 years ago, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The government has banned the import of leaded fuel, and has
decided to reduce sulfur in diesel and introduce catalytic
converter to contain pollution by automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Bangladeshi capital has reached a very
high level due to emission of suspended particulate materials by
vehicles at an increasing rate, according to a survey conducted by
the Department of Environment on the air quality in the city.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 motorized vehicles are operating in Dhaka
metropolitan area, with about one-third of them having no fitness
certificates, according to the Bangladesh Road Transport
Authority.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Summit to Focus on Regional Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The third Informal Summit of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will focus on
developments in the region over the past year, with special
emphasis on economic cooperation, a top Philippine official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Domingo Siazon, secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs,
said in a press conference that the informal summit, scheduled to
be held from November 24 to 28 in Manila, will also discuss the
future cooperation of the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the ASEAN leaders of Brunei Darussalam,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam will be joined by their
counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
On economic cooperation, Siazon cited as example the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA) whose target date has been advanced to 2002 and
that of the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA), which is also advanced to
2003.
</P>
<P>
But on top of the other items on the agenda, Siazon said, the
ASEAN leaders are expected to discuss the future of the ASEAN,
adding that this particular aspect will serve as the focal point
of their discussions during the five-day informal summit.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that for the future, ASEAN will continue to
maintain its increased pace of regional integration and will seek
to deepen economic cooperation, beginning with the reduction of
tariffs to zero.
</P>
<P>
"It will also call for the expansion of participation among its
members in economic surveillance, and subsequently, to pursue a
more active discussions on the creation of a single currency," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to Siazon, the ASEAN will seek to
broaden functional cooperation and explore ways to effectively
uplift the welfare of people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, as a whole, will be moving towards addressing the
asymmetry between economic and functional cooperation on one hand,
and political cooperation on the other, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also said that during the informal summit, the
Philippines will emphasize the need for more cross-sectoral
coordination through the convening of the Special Joint
Ministerial Meeting (JMM) of foreign, economic and finance
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Gathering together for the first time at the initiative of the
Philippines, the ministers are expected to discuss modalities to
hasten recovery from the economic crisis and to mitigate its
lingering social impact.
</P>
<P>
Another Philippine initiative, Siazon said, will be a meeting
between the ASEAN leaders and global information technology (IT)
representatives aimed at encouraging deeper collaboration between
the public and private sector in regional cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin at Odds Over Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- In their speeches at the
opening session of the OSCE Summit held here on Thursday,
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin struck a completely different tone on the issue of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia has launched military offensives in
Chechnya to wipe out terrorists and bandits, and Russia's fight
against terrorism not only benefits the country itself, but also
serves the interests of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said the militants in Chechnya are preparing "thousands of
mercenaries" to spread terrorism beyond Russia's borders.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin warned Western leaders not to interfere in Russia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"You have no right to criticize Russia for Chechnya," he
said. "We are obliged to put an end to the spread of the cancer
of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Russian president called on the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to give backing to Russia in its
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin ruled out the possibility of holding talks with Chechen
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no negotiations with bandits... we need to
completely eliminate the bandit formations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, however, blamed Russia for its military operations in
Chechnya, saying the military actions have caused heavy civilian
casualties and left a large number of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
" If such operations continue, the Russian sovereignty claim
over Chechnya may be rejected by Chechnya and Russia may be
isolated in the world," Clinton warned. He urged Russia to open a
dialog with the Chechen authorities to seek a political solution
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt not to irritate Yeltsin, Clinton
repeatedly expressed his respect for the Russian leader and
U.S. commitment to supporting Yeltsin's policy.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Briefed on Sanctions From Russian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz on Thursday received a letter from Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov on the latest debates on the Iraqi issue at
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The letter was handed over to Aziz by visiting Russian Foreign
Ministry official Nicolai Kortozov, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Ivanov briefed Aziz on the latest developments
of the U.N. Security Council's deliberations on a British-Dutch
proposal for a conditional suspension of the nine-year-old
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Kortozov, Aziz repeated Iraq's opposition to
the British-Dutch proposal, saying Iraq will reject any
U.N. resolution short of lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The proposal recommends a conditional suspension of the
sanctions after Iraq agrees to allow an enlarged U.N. weapons
inspection body to return to the country and put its oil revenues
under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Russia pledged to continue its consultations with Iraq on the
Iraqi issue at the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the
United States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- are reportedly
still too far to reach an agreement on a new policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have maintained that Iraq must allow the
U.N. weapons inspectors back into the country and allow surprise
inspections of any suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China and France want sanctions on Iraq, including
restrictions on investing in the country's oil industry, to be
lifted as soon as possible, with a less strict weapons inspection
system.
</P>
<P>
Prior to last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq,
U.N. weapons inspectors withdrew from Iraq under the order of
then chief inspector Richard Butler. U.N. weapons inspections have
not been resumed ever since.

<HEADLINE> Sex-scandal Allegations against Soccer Team Stun Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) - Israeli Sports, Science and
Culture Minister Matan Vilnai will meet Israel Football
Association (IFA) Chairman Gavri Levy on Thursday to discuss the
reported sex-scandal allegations against the national team players.
</P>
<P>
The national team returned home Thursday morning after
Wednesday night's 0-3 defeat in Copenhagen, which made the
aggregate scores 0-8 in the two-leg Euro 2000 playoffs. Israel had
a five-goal humiliation by Denmark in Tel Aviv last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As if its tale of woe wasn't enough, a stunning sex scandal
allegation against the team hit Israeli headlines Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The influential Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv devoted most of its
front page to a story which claimed that, on the eve of their 0-5
defeat on Saturday, some of Israeli players had invited call girls
to their hotel rooms. The story also said these players did so
again immediately prior to setting off for Denmark on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Wednesday that he could not believe that this story
is true, But he will look at ways to force Ma'ariv to reveal its
sources so that the IFA could investigate further.
</P>
<P>
Coach Shlomo Scharf, who looks certain to end his eight-year,
81-game reign, said he checked the team as he always do at 11:30
that night, but he could not be these players' nanny.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset (Parliament) member Avi Yehezkel called on
Ministry of Science, Culture and Sports to appoint a committee of
inquiry and suggested the players take lie detector tests.

<HEADLINE> Medicinal Herbs Gene Bank Set Up in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Of the 1,892 types of Chinese
medicinal herbs on record, more than 1,000 can be found in a four-
hectare garden at a botanical research institute in Hubei Province,
a place many scientists regard as a medicinal herbs gene bank.
</P>
<P>
Since the garden, known as Bencao Garden, was founded in 1956,
researchers have scoured the country to collect medically viable
herbs, from grosvenor momordica, which grows in remote mountain
areas, to saffron found on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The garden is designed to recreate the natural habitats of the
herbs to help preserve as much of their natural medicinal
qualities as possible.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qing, director of the garden, told Xinhua that scientists
are using gene technology to optimize the curative qualities of
the herbs.
</P>
<P>
China's ancient herbal medicine is regaining attention.
Although it is convenient to take Western medicine, many people,
especially Chinese, still believe that herbal medicine
prescriptions are more effective for curing serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei's city of Qichun, the hometown of China's most
prestigious herbal healer, Li Shizhen, there live some 200,000
herb farmers, accounting for a fourth of the local population.
</P>
<P>
They produce over 700 varieties of herbs, and those bearing the
brand name "Li Shizhen" sell well here and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The local herb wholesale market has become the third largest in
the country with 560 million yuan of annual trading volume.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the local government are confident of the
medicinal herb business, saying that Hong Kong's plan to build the
world's largest entry port of herbs will offer opportunities for
them.

Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee calling for developing space
applications for global peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Asian and the Pacific countries shared many challenges to
sustainable development especially in the areas of food security,
water conservation, environment protection, disaster management,
education and healthcare, Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Indian leader said, sustainable development of
the human race in the next century and millennium was unthinkable
without a similar vision for the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to re-focus our collective attention,
as also the attention of the entire world, to achieve improved
quality of life for the ever-increasing pollution in this region,"
Vajpayee told ministers and senior officials of the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is an immediate
follow-up of the Third U.N. Conference on Peaceful Use and
Exploration of Outer Space held in Vienna in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Twenty ministers from of 21 countries in the region including
China are participating in the ministerial conference that was
preceded by a three-day senior officials meeting which was closed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting adopted a draft report Wednesday
for approval by the three-day ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The draft report said that the senior officials meeting
observed the significant progress that had been achieved in the
field of space applications for sustainable development since the
first Ministerial Conference on Space Applications for Development
in Asia and the Pacific held in Beijing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting adopted strategy and an action
plan on space technology application for sustainable development
in the region and mechanism for effective regional cooperation,
and review the draft ministerial declaration that will be
submitted to the ministerial conference for adoption.

<HEADLINE> Washington to Consider Seoul's Demand to Develop Long-range Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Washington is prepared to
consider Seoul's desire to develop long-range missiles as an
effective deterrent against Pyongyang, said a senior U.S. official
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to consider South Korea's desire for missile
range flexibility in a sympathetic way," visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Rober Einhorn said before his group met South
Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
Einhorn, who arrived here early Thursday for a three-day visit,
is discussing with South Korean officials the technical issues on
the expansion of nation's missile range up to 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, South Korea has challenged the 1979 memorandum of
understanding between the two countries, which restricts South
Korean missile range to 180 kilometers in return for U.S.
provision of the technology for developing missiles of 180-
kilometer range.
</P>
<P>
South Korea called for an extension to 300 kilometers as
allowed by the Missile Technology Control Regime as the missile of
180-kilometer range fails to reach Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, at his meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung reportedly asked for
the development and deployment of the missiles with range up to
300 kilometers while Clinton agreed to restore the stalled talks
over the issue between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Washington agreed in principle on the Seoul's demand to develop
missiles with range of up to 300 kilometers, but the latter asked
for access to the former's missile development program, which
South Korea considers a grave violation of its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Meets South African Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua)-- Vice President Hu Jintao met
with a delegation from the African National Congress (ANC) of
South Africa here today and stressed relations between the
Communist Party of China (NPC) and the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also a standing committee member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, extended a warm welcome to
the delegation headed by Alfred Nzo, member of the National
Executive Committee of the ANC and its former general secretary.
Hu recalled his visit of South Africa earlier this year, and
expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality he received there,
saying that there is profound friendship between the two parties
and the two peoples, and bilateral ties have progressed smoothly
since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hu said high-level contacts have been frequent and cooperation
in various fields have been expanding, and he particularly touched
upon President Nelson Mandela's visit to China in May, during
which the leaders of the two states held productive talks. Right
now, Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), is visiting South Africa, Hu said, noting
that all these exchanges have greatly stimulated ties.
</P>
<P>
The CPC highly emphasizes its cooperation with the ANC, Hu said,
noting that as ruling parties, they both shoulder the heavy tasks
of developing their economies, improving their people's living
standards, and building their countries.
</P>
<P>
Further consolidating relations between the two parties will
not only benefit them and their countries, but also push forward
overall bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said China plays a key role in the world, and has always
been a sincere friend of South Africa. South Africa won support
from China during the long-term struggle against racial apartheid,
and its development today also requires China's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the ANC both treasure their friendship with
China and the CPC, he said, expressing the hope that this
cooperation will be reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Army Schools Offer Academic Degrees at All Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua)-- After decades of effort, higher
learning institutions attached to the Chinese People's Liberation
Army are now able to confer academic degrees at all levels,
according to army sources.
</P>
<P>
Currently, students at military universities and colleges study
a wide range of subjects including science, engineering,
management, medicine, literature, and military science.
</P>
<P>
The army schools have 41 mobile stations for postdoctoral
research, 31 doctorate-conferring units, 157 doctorate-conferring
stations, and 572 stations offering master's degrees. Over 8,000
students are now studying for their master's degree.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, army schools provided postgraduate education to
train senior officers, but this was hindered by the Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of young people have
graduated from military academies with master's degree or
doctorates, improving the quality of Chinese army officers
markedly.
</P>
<P>
These higher education institutions boast a large army of
experienced teachers including many well-known Chinese scholars.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, a series of laws and regulations
have been issued to strengthen the administration of the
conferring of academic degrees by army schools.

<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and three major foreign
oil companies have signed an agreement to invest about one billion
U.S. dollars in developing Nigerian oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture agreement signed Wednesday by the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the world's oil giants
Shell, Elf and Agip, will be financing the development of an oil
field known as EA/EJA having an estimated reserve of 350 million
barrels, the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Production is expected to start by the second half of 2002.
When fully developed, it is expected to produce over 100,000
barrels of oil and 100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the field development will be funded 77.14
percent by Shell, 12.86 percent by Agip and 10 percent by Elf.
</P>
<P>
The Group Managing Director of the NNPC Jackson Ganis Obaseki,
who presided over the signing ceremony, described the initiative
by Shell as a very commendable demonstration of the company's
commitment to the development of petroleum in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Shell's Managing Director Ron Van Denberg expressed confidence
in the Nigerian economy, saying that the petroleum sector, despite
of some temporary difficulties, had enormous potentials.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin at Odds Over Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- In their speeches at the
opening session of the OSCE Summit held here on Thursday,
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin struck a completely different tone on the issue of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia has launched military offensives in
Chechnya to wipe out terrorists and bandits, adding Russia's
fight against terrorism not only benefits the country itself, but
also serves the interests of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president called on the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to give backing to Russia in its
fight against terrorism, otherwise terrorism in Chechnya will
spread to north Caucasus and adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, however, blamed Russia for its military operations in
Chechnya, saying the military actions have caused heavy civilian
casualties and rendered a large amount of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
"If such operations continue, the Russian sovereignty claim
over Chechnya may be rejected by Chechnya and Russia may be
isolated in the world," Clinton warned. He urged Russia to open a
dialog with the Chechen authorities to seek a political solution
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt not to irritate Yeltsin, Clinton
repeatedly expressed his respect for the Russian leader and
U.S. commitment to supporting Yeltsin's policy.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Vows to Support E-Commerce Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Promoting e-commerce in Hong
Kong is one of the major initiatives of "Digital 21," the
government's information technology (IT) strategy, to make Hong
Kong a leading digital city in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the bi-monthly Seminar for Small and Medium
Enterprises Thursday, Director of Information Technology Services
Lau Kam-hung said the use of IT helped Hong Kong retain its
competitive edge and drive its overall economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"In the information world of tomorrow, digital technology
brings new business opportunities," Lau said.
</P>
<P>
"By using the latest technology, operators may provide new
multimedia services, overcome geographical and time constraints to
enter markets that were not possible in the past, and reduce
operating costs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that although only about 10 percent of organizations
in Hong Kong are engaged in e-commerce at present, the future
development of e-commerce in Hong Kong would be great.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) had adopted a proactive approach to
enhancing Hong Kong's infrastructure and services so as to promote
and facilitate e-commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One of the government measures is the implementation of the
Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) scheme next year through which
round-the-clock public services will be provided to business and
the community via electronic means.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure developed for ESD will be made available at
a later stage to the private sector for conducting e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology Services Department is going to set
up a Certification Authority Recognition Office by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Through the use of digital certificates issued by certification
authorities and digital signatures, participants in electronic
transactions will be able to ensure the authenticity, security,
integrity and non-repudiation of messages exchanged in the
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The government also introduced the Electronic Transactions Bill
into the Legislative Council in July this year to provide a legal
framework for the conduct of e-commerce in Hong Kong.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's national soccer
captain Kiatisak Senamuang will be joining English first division
club Huddersfield Town at the weekend, the Bangkok Post reported
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talented 26-year-old striker will be flying to England
early on Saturday morning, officials from Huddersfield and his
present club Rajpracha confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Hudderfield's public relations officer said earlier in Hong
Kong that Kiatisak will hopefully play in the reserve team on
December 1 against Preston North End.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how he adapts to the frozen north," the officer
said.
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Zico" after the former Brazilian star, Kiatisak was
recommended to Huddersfield by Premiership club Middlesbrough who
gave him a trial earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Kiatisak said he was really looking forward to the challenge of
playing for Huddersfield, adding that he was already brushing up
on his English although he said the language barrier shouldn't be
too much a problem as he knew most of the football terms already.
</P>
<P>
He is also planning to take a lot of different medicine to
prepare for the cold weather in England.
</P>
<P>
As for the food, he said he knew it is going to be hard, but he
is confident that he will get used to English food.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he would be giving his very best in every
performance.

<HEADLINE> Signing of Charter on European Security Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The signing of the Charter on
European Security has been postponed till Friday due to
differences still existing among member states over some of its
provisions, OSCE Chairman-in-Office Knut Vollebaek announced here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
Vollebaek said the charter will be signed together with an
adaptation agreement on the Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces
in Europe (CFE Treaty).
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek, the Norwegian foreign minister, said on Wednesday at
a press conference that negotiations on the charter are only 80
percent complete though it had been scheduled to be signed on
November 18.
</P>
<P>
He said OSCE member states still differ on three major
questions regarding to the charter: the OSCE role in peacekeeping
operations, the conditions required to approve use of force, the
OSCE role in internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The charter has been intended to strengthen the OSCE as a
"primary organization" for the peaceful settlement of disputes
within its region. It calls for enhancing the organization's
"effectiveness for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis
management and post-conflict rehabilitation."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that under the charter, the member states will
undertake to act in solidarity and partnership to ensure the
implementation of, and respect for, OSCE principles and
commitments and decisions.
</P>
<P>
The member states will further strengthen non-hierarchical
cooperation between the OSCE and other organizations within a
platform for cooperative security. They will examine how the OSCE
can facilitate international efforts in addressing new risks and
challenges to security.
</P>
<P>
The charter will also oblige member states to ensure that the
economic dimension receives appropriate attention as an element of
the early warning and conflict prevention activities of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
In stressing the importance of politico-military issues, the
member states will confirm the importance of implementation of
existing arms control and confidence and security building
measures as well as their adaptation to the new security
environment.
</P>
<P>
The adaptation agreement to the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe is aimed at further weapons reduction in the
European continent.
</P>
<P>
The CFE Treaty, which was signed in November 1990, has so far
led to the destruction and conversion to other use of more than
50,000 battle banks, armored combat vehicles, artillery pieces,
combat aircraft and attack helicopters.

JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Cabinet had
adopted the draft Firearms Control Bill, sending a clear message
that the government was determined to fight violent crimes, Safety
and Security Minister Steve Tshwete said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Exchange Reserves Up 3.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign exchange
reserves rose to 4.6 billion U.S. dollars by the end of August, an
increase of 3.83 percent compared with the previous month,
according to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
</P>
<P>
Top CBN officials were quoted on Thursday by This Day newspaper
as saying that the country was able to achieve this feat because
of the deliberate determination of President Olusegun Obasanjo and
his government to increase the nation's reserves.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the tight fiscal discipline, the continuous rise in
the price of crude oil has also helped the country in shoring up
its reserves as over 90 percent of its foreign exchanges came from
oil export.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil, which was about 10 U.S. dollars per
barrel at the beginning of this year, closed on Wednesday at
26.06 U.S. dollars per barrel for December deliveries.
</P>
<P>
By May 29 this year, when the present civilian government took
office, the country's reserves had dwindled to 3.75 billion U.S.
dollars from 7.1 billion U.S. dollars recorded at the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
In his supplementary budget, Obasanjo said that one of the
foremost objectives of his administration is to cut back on
extra-budgetary spending and increase reserves by the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Japan Files Complaint With TWO Against U.S. Antidumping Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Japanese government
official confirmed Thursday that Japan has formally filed a
complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the
United States over its abuse of antidumping measures against steel
imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Washington's antidumping action on this case is illegitimate
under existing WTO rules...and Japan cannot tolerate the move,"
International Trade and Industry Minister Takashi Fukaya told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The minister refuted Washington's allegation that steel
products from Japan had been sold far below that sold in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Washington alleges Japanese steelmakers are dumping products on
the U.S. market. In June, it slapped punitive tariffs of up to 67
percent on hot-rolled steel from Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Tokyo called for bilateral talks with
Washington under the auspices of the trade body.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has ruled that three steel products from
Japan, including stainless sheets, were sold below market value.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. is linking the holding of a summit between
President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad to
favorable responses from Damascus to a long list of U.S. questions
on non-territorial aspects of peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has quietly posed the questions to Syria recently, and
so far has not received a Syrian reply, diplomatic sources have
told The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister David Levy said Wednesday that Israel
would not beg for the renewal of peace talks with Syria and the
ball is in the Syrian court.
</P>
<P>
Levy said all the messages indicate that Assad wants peace
and wants to take advantage of the opportunity. "There are a
thousand reasons for him to take the step for his own good,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Army Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said Wednesday that the
Israeli army would not oppose a unilateral withdrawal from south
Lebanon if the government decides to do so in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the army has been utterly opposed to a unilateral
withdrawal, even though its senior officers have always taken care
to emphasize that they will obey any decision made by the
political level.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The confrontation between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Labor and Social Welfare Minister Eli Yishai over the
government's social policy is worsening.
</P>
<P>
Barak's confidants said Yishai is exaggerating the number of
unemployed in order to show his leadership. But Yishai
retorted that the prime minister is being misled and he should
study the situation of the poverty.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Afghanistan Border to Reopen: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The border between
Afghanistan and Iran is to be reopened after several days of talks
between traders from both countries, the Afghan Islamic Press
(AIP) agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities have agreed to unseal the Islam Qila
post bordering the western Afghan city of Herat from Thursday,
said the Pakistan-based news agency.
</P>
<P>
No independent confirmation was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the border will allow Afghanistan to receive
trade convoys from Iran and Afghan traders will also purchase
wheat from Iran to overcome the current flour shortage, AIP said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the two sided agreed that the border will not
be closed again at least over the next five years even if there is
war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran closed its border with Afghanistan last year after the
Taliban militia captured several western and northern Afghan
provinces in their war against the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Taliban further worsened in
August 1998 when at least nine Iranian diplomats were killed after
the Islamic militia seized the Iranian consulate in the northern
4:4;3,:
Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Consider Seoul's Demand to Develop Long-range Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Washington is prepared to
consider Seoul's desire to develop long-range missiles as an
effective deterrent against Pyongyang, said a senior U.S. official
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to consider South Korea's desire for missile
range flexibility in a sympathetic way," visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Rober Einhorn said before his group met South
Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
Einhorn, who arrived here early Thursday for a three-day visit,
is discussing with South Korean officials the technical issues on
the expansion of nation's missile range up to 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, South Korea has challenged the 1979 memorandum of
understanding between the two countries, which restricts South
Korean missile range to 180 kilometers in return for U.S.
provision of the technology for developing missiles of 180-
kilometer range.
</P>
<P>
South Korea called for an extension to 300 kilometers as
allowed by the Missile Technology Control Regime as the missile of
180-kilometer range fails to reach Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, Pyongyang test-fired a rocket which flew over
the Japanese territory, causing great concerns in the world.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, at his meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung reportedly asked for
the development and deployment of the missiles with range up to
300 kilometers while Clinton agreed to restore the stalled talks
over the issue between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Washington agreed in principle on the Seoul's demand to develop
missiles with range of up to 300 kilometers, but the former asked
for access to the latter's missile development program, which
South Korea considers a grave violation of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Washington is concerned about the possibility of
Pyongyang's making use of the issue of extending missile range at
the improved atmosphere created after Pyongyang agreed not to test-
fire any more long range missiles in September this year.

<HEADLINE> International Discussion on Youth Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Relevant Chinese departments
and several United Nations (UN) organizations held their first
discussions on youth development here today.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day gathering, organized by the All-China Youth
Federation and the UN Youth Unit, representatives from China's
departments of health, culture, environmental protection,
education, trade unions, and women, and officials from various UN
organizations, including the United Nations Development Program
and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, discussed such issues as education, employment,
environmental protection, the eradication of poverty and the
prevention of juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jialu, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), told the gathering that the
Chinese NPC has strengthened juvenile legislation by enacting a
compulsory education law, an adoption law, and a law protecting
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a law on the prevention of juvenile crime went into
effect this month, Xu said, adding that this discussions mark a
new phase of cooperation between China and the UN on youth issues.
</P>
<P>
William Angel, chief of the UN Youth Unit, said that the unit
is ready to work hand-in-hand with Chinese government departments,
the All-China Youth Federation, and other UN organizations to
promote China's work on issues related to the young.
</P>
<P>
The youth population of the world now exceeded one billion, and
60 percent live in Asian developing countries. The problems of
young people include unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, lack of
leisure time and sports facilities, juvenile crime, and drugs.
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly passed the World Program of Action for
Youth towards the Year 2000 and Beyond in 1995, calling on the UN
to support all governments' efforts in youth affairs.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Youth Federation signed a memo with the UN Youth
Unit last year on promoting cooperation. These discussions are a
part of the implementation of the World Program of Action for
Youth towards the Year 2000 and Beyond.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports to Grow 5.5 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports this year
are expected to grow 5.5 percent, exceeding the government's
target of 4 percent, Thailand News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Staporn Kavitanon, secretary-general of the Board of Investment
(BOI) of Thailand, was quoted as saying exports of 600 large
manufacturers under the BOI's approved privileges rose to 560
million U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this year, a
4-percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The strong momentum of exports was gained from the increased
outputs and exports of all manufacturing sectors, especially
electronics, automobiles, rubber gloves, construction materials
and toys, he said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of electronic and electrical products reached 14.07
billion dollars in the first nine months this year, 5 percent more
than the same period of last year and accounting for almost
one-third of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle production doubled year-on-year to 229,300 units,
buoyed by increased demand helped by low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Staporn pointed out that the only key problem remained in the
Thai economy now is the high level of the non-performing loans in
the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
In a move to boost production in all segments, the board
announced Wednesday new conditions to encourage investors to
establish factories in industrial estates and investment zones in
Rayong province.
</P>
<P>
To encourage investment, incentives would be upgraded to match
those for the BOI zone there, including an exemption from import
duty on machinery and the waiver of corporate income tax, both for
eight years.

<HEADLINE> World's Longest Paper-cut to Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 18 (Xinhua)-- The world's longest paper-cut,
which was entered in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1997,
will be put on auction in a few days, the creator of the paper-cut
said today at an on-going national folk paper-cut exhibition in
the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
At a length of 128 meters and a width of 0.93 meter, The Return
of Hong Kong, as the paper-cut is called, will bid at a base price
of 500,000 yuan (nearly 57,000 U.S. dollars), according to Xie
Zhong, the folk paper-cut artist in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The grand picture shows scenes of Hong Kong from the Opium War
in the 1840s up to the present, with a total of 103 historical
pictures. It took Xie 18 months and more than 50 kilograms of red
paper to complete his magnum opus.
</P>
<P>
Now 54, Xie has been making paper-cuts for more than 30 years.
During his career, he has often expanded from traditional paper-
cut scenes to show more realistic aspects of everyday life in
China, as well as significant historic events.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the opening of the Fourth World Conference on
Women in 1995, Xie made a paper-cut called "Love to Mothers" which
was 6 meters long and 6 meters wide, with a flower in the middle.
</P>
<P>
Holding many titles bestowed by UNESCO (United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) for his special
contributions to the world's folk arts, Xie still works hard to
create paper-cuts of high artistic value. "There is no end to
artistic invention", he says.

candidates but this time, the burden is not as heavy as that he
had faced in the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the previous elections, he had made the
decision alone but this time, for the list of candidates of United
Malays National Organization (UMNO), the BN's backbone party, he
was assisted by the party's vice presidents and the
secretary-general, Mahathir, who is also UMNO president, said.
</P>
<P>
The list of the UMNO candidates will be announced Friday, one
day before the nomination day, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahathir assured the people that the November 29
general election will proceed smoothly although he anticipates
certain quarters will try to create trouble before the polls.
</P>
<P>
He said the security forces are capable of handling the
situation and would act firmly to thwart any such plans.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate attempts by the Opposition to disrupt the smooth
conduct of the election especially a few days before polling on
realizing they have a slim chance to win," Mahathir was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Opposition would hurl all sorts of accusations a
few days before polling to arouse the anger of their supporters at
the BN including alleging that this election is not being
conducted fairly and equitably.
</P>
<P>
He said the people however should not be scared to come out to
vote as the security forces are not only prepared and in fact are
capable of dealing with any eventuality.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A two-day symposium on WTO
research closed here today after participants reached the
consensus that Guangdong Province in south China will be prepared
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sponsored by the Guangdong Branch of the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the WTO
Research Institute under the Beijing university of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, attracted more than 300 people including
experts from the institute, members of China's WTO negotiation
team, and entrepreneurs in many fields.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that as China's reform pioneer, Guangdong has the "
responsibility" to take hold of this unprecedented market
opportunity to step up reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the Guangdong Branch of the China Marine
Arbitration Committee was announced at the symposium.
International arbitration of economic affairs is one of the most
important functions of the WTO, and the committee is expected to
improve China's involvement in managing the arbitration of marine
affairs in the South China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects for Environment-Friendly Paint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This experiment demonstrates that a new kind of paint, invented
by Wang Shuan, member of the Paint Standardization Technical
Committee of China, is entirely pollution-free and harmless to
human beings, noted experts here.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, a paint producer named Zhong Bang in central
China's Henan Province, has started to produce his new paint, and
already received sizable orders from Western businesses at a
recent trade fair in the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's paint industry has made rapid progress since the late
1970s when the country implemented the opening-up and reform
policy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has 4,500 paint producers,
most of them small firms with little new technology producing
traditional organic chemical soluble paints.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by the World Health Organization indicate
that traditional paints are usually poisonous and can do great
harm to people.
</P>
<P>
The world suffers from considerable economic losses annually,
as much as tens of billions of U.S. dollars, due to environmental
pollution caused by these paints.
</P>
<P>
Wang's new and environment-friendly paint, therefore, will
inevitably have a bright future, and can be widely used in fields
as diverse as households and national defense, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The study of environment-friendly paint in China began in 1984,
and most insiders are bullish about its market prospects.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Economic and Trade Commission, the
demand for paint in China is expected to reach two million tons
next year, far beyond the country's current production capacity.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Capital Faces Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Tanzania's
capital Dar es Salaam would face serious water shortage problems
in the near future due to the forecasted short rains in the
country, the Daily News newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa sounded the alarm Wednesday
shortly after he inspected water wells in the city and the two
pumping stations at Upper and Lower Ruvu River which is the main
water supply source of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
He quoted forecasts from the Meteorological Department as
saying the country should expect less short rains this year, a
factor which could lower water levels at Ruvu and Kizinga rivers
and subsequently affect the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
The minister said despite current satisfactory water levels at
Upper Ruvu which was 16 meters Wednesday, his ministry was taking
precautionary measures by ensuring that the 200 water wells dug in
various parts of the city are functioning efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Directorate of Meteorology of Tanzania announced
that water levels in catchments in the central, coastal and
northeastern parts of Tanzania would gradually run low from
December to February because of the short rains triggered by weak
northern winds and the cold La-Nina condition which dominated the
tropical Pacific areas recently.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam city residents consume 90 million gallons of
water per day and that the current water supply capacity stood at
60 million gallons per day, but due to various problems only 40
million gallons can reach the city.
</P>
<P>
Nkhangaa said plans are underway to construct a bigger water
reservoir at Ruvu River to ensure adequate water supply to the
city, adding that this is a long-term measure which might take
years to be implemented with the help of donors.
</P>
<P>
He called on city residents not to waste water on gardens as a
way of preserving water, saying this directive requires a moral
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the Ruvu Pumping Station was not too low at
the moment, according to officials.

<HEADLINE> South China's Travel Agency Follows ISO9001 Quality Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The China International
Tourism Service (CITS) Guangdong Provincial Branch was granted a
certificate of authentication for observing ISO9001 quality
standards here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, CITS Guangdong Provincial Branch is
the only travel service in this southern China province to become
so certified.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province has benefited greatly from the country's
reform and opening-up drive introduced nationwide in late 1978.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic expansion has turned Guangdong into a major
tourist destination, and with 484 travel services, 414 star-rated
hotels, the province is capable of handling 160 million tourists
arrivals, including 60 million from overseas, annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the province contributed one-fourth of both the
country's total tourism earnings and the country's hard currencies
earned from overseas tourism services.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weixiong, head of the Guangdong Provincial Tourism
Administration, said the quality of service decides the future of
a travel agency, and the introduction of ISO9001 quality standards
will help improve the service of travel agencies in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Lu considers this certification an important step made by local
travel agencies to greet China's admission as a full member of the
World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A fire which broke at a
department store in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin
Province on Monday, was caused by worker negligence.
</P>
<P>
Total losses were estimated at 10 million yuan (about 1.2
billion U.S. dollars), including 6 million in commodities and 4
million yuan in equipment..
</P>
<P>
According to a source at the local fire department, two workers
failed to operate electric welding safely on the tenth floor,
allowing sparks to spill down on nearby combustibles and directly
causing the fire.
</P>
<P>
Those believed to be responsible for the fire are now under
arrest.
</P>
<P>
The fire was put out after 15 hours of fire-fighting. No one
has been reported killed or injured. One fireman suffered from
smoke inhalation and is reported doing well at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
The 10-storey Ou Ya Shang Du Department Store caught fire at
about 10:00 PM on Monday, burning the ninth and tenth floors.
</P>
<P>
The department store reported the largest annual profits in
Jilin in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the city fell as low as -12 centigrade this
week, and the low temperatures along with strong winds added to
the difficulty of fighting the blaze.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Road accidents have
claimed an average of 1,600 lives and resulted in 20 billion
Tanzanian shillings (25 million U.S. dollars) of damages annually
in the past four years in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This was an extremely high price to pay for a poor country
like Tanzania, The Guardian newspaper quoted Tanzania Roads
Association (TARA) Chairman Immanuel Kimambo as saying on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What is more disturbing is the fact that most of the accidents
occur due to human errors and could in fact have been prevented,"
said Kimambo.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents have become a leading killer in the east
African country together with AIDS, malaria and cholera.
</P>
<P>
Kimambo suggested the National Transport Policy should be
urgently established in order to guide the development of the
sector, and all transport matters be put under one ministry in
order to ensure proper co- ordination and maximize the use of
resources.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Guerrillas to Halt Fighting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian guerrilla group
has promised to heed Lebanon's ultimatum to stop military
activities against Israeli forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Abu Imad Rifai and Abu
Tarek Nakhal met Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss Wednesday
night to discuss the government's opposition to Palestinian
fighters participating in resistance attacks, the Arabic daily Al
Nahar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The two officials said that their movement understood the
stand of the prime minister and the government," said a statement
issued by the office of Hoss after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the movement's readiness to cooperate with
the government to serve Lebanon's interests, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hoss in a statement called on Palestinians to stop
military action in south Lebanon, saying that it is not in the
interest of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said his government did not support any kind of military
activities in south Lebanon except those staged by the Lebanese
resistance movement, which is doing its job very well.
</P>
<P>
Late in October, the Syrian-based Jihad, which is strongly
opposed to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace moves with
Israel, returned to the last active Arab-Israeli front line in
south Lebanon after many years of absence.
</P>
<P>
It also announced its two fighters had been killed in their
recent attacks on Israeli troops in the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in the south in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government's statement reflected the public fear
that the Palestinian militants' action will trigger another
Israeli large-scale attack against Lebanon like the previous two
in 1978 and 1982.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hosts Regional Meeting on Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A first-ever South Asian
regional conference on competitiveness was inaugurated on Thursday
in Sri Lanka's capital to evolve an innovative concept of
competitiveness to meet the daunting challenges of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference on "Competitiveness: South Asia and
the Global Challenge," Sri Lankan Minister of Internal and
International Commerce and Food Kingsley Wickramaratne said
developing countries like South Asian nations remain poor despite
the tremendous advantage in natural resources, cheap labor and
incentives for investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason was that "these advantages, which can be
imitated anywhere in the world, have not supplied sufficient fuel
to the engine of growth."
</P>
<P>
Wickramaratne said, "Firms (in developing countries) compete on
price instead of quality and innovation," lacking competitiveness
to meet the demands of a sophisticated world marketplace.
</P>
<P>
"Competitiveness can be defined as sustained growth in
productivity resulting in rapid growth in income and purchasing
power for the average citizen," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said competitiveness should not be defined as abundant
natural resources, cheap labor or better incentives.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is sponsored by the Sri Lankan Ministry
of Internal and International Commerce and Food and the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
The conference brought together more than 200 participants from
the seven member countries of South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and the Maldives.

<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt pays great attention to developing its electronic
commerce as part of the efforts to promote exports and integrate
the Egyptian economy into the world economy, which requires
certain guarantees of privacy and transfer of information,
Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros
Ghali has said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government has rejected proposals made by Jewish
businessmen on establishing a railway paralleling with the
Israeli-Egyptian borders and linking the Mediterranean to the Red
Sea so as to to compete with the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Wednesday that it
was difficult to discuss prospects for security cooperation in the
Middle East under the current circumstances in the regional peace
process. Moussa is in Istanbul, Turkey to attend the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which
opened on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- A final decision on whether to investigate the EgyptAir
Flight 990 crash as a crime or an accident has been delayed so
Egypt can further examine the evidence, including a prayer uttered
by a crew member, U.S. officials said Wednesday. The U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board was waiting to turn the probe over to
the FBI until additional Egyptian experts, including translators,
arrive to review the data.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed sharply
higher in Tokyo Thursday, boosted by recovery in information and
telecommunications-related issues, with the key Nikkei index
hitting this year's intra-day high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced 257.99 points, or 1.
41 percent, from Wednesday's close at 18,532.81.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, rose 30.52 points or 1.92 percent to close
at a 37-month high of 1,622.05.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 768.84 million
shares from 735.25 million shares on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand-related issues such as real estate firms
continued attracting purchases, helping overall share prices rise
sharply, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Real estate firms remained the biggest winners for the second
straight day, jumping 11.74 percent as a group, helped by a news
report that the Finance Ministry plans to lift a ban on real
estate investment trusts in a bid to revitalize land transactions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the biggest losers were consumer finance firms,
falling 1.40 percent as a group, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers far exceeded
losers with a ratio of 932 to 336. 79 issues closed unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Brings Beijing Company To Court (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the first time in China that a final user was sued for
pirating software, the copyright of which belongs to Microsoft.
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court began an open trial today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Yadu Science and Technology Group was accused of using
computer software developed and owned by Microsoft by copying them
from pirated discs.
</P>
<P>
According to Microsoft's accusation, law enforcement people
from the Haidian District Bureau of Industry and Commerce in
Beijing found 37 sets of various Microsoft computer software that
were illegally copied and used in the office building of Beijing
Yadu Science and Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
Engineers at Yadu allegedly admitted that about 50 computers at
Yadu were installed with pirated Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft therefore appealed to the court to force Yadu to
immediately stop this piracy, make a public apology to Microsoft,
and pay 1.5 million yuan (about 180,700 U.S. dollars) for losses
suffered by Microsoft.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing Yadu Science and Technology Group, the accused, claimed
that neither the computers installed with pirated software nor the
witnesses are part of Beijing Yadu Science and Technology Group.
Rather, the accused said both were part of Beijing Yadu Science
and Technology Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The accused also said that Beijing Yadu Science and Technology
Group and Beijing Yadu Science and Technology Co., Ltd. were two
different companies, though their legal representative was one
person, He Lumin.
</P>
<P>
The accused further claimed that Microsoft tempted, deceived,
and misled witnesses while collecting evidence, and that some
notarized documents and relevant evidence were illusive. It
appealed to the court that the accusation ignored, and it reserved
the right to investigate, the behavior that caused damage to the
company's credit and profit.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft agreed to court mediation while Yadu declined.
</P>
<P>
After nearly two hours of questioning, the chief judge
announced that verdict will be pronounced later.
</P>
<P>
The piracy of computer software falls into four categories: by
final users, by hardware producers or dealers, sales of illegally
copied discs, and by free-will downloading from the Internet.
Piracy by final users is considered the most serious because the
final users seek commercial gain with use of the pirated software.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has succeeded in suing two other Chinese companies,
Beijing Hai Si Da Science and Technology Development Company, and
Beijing Min An Investment Consulting Company, in May, 1998 for
copyright violation. The two companies paid Microsoft total
compensation of some 790,000 yuan (about 95,000 U.S. dollars) and
made public apologies in designated publications.

<HEADLINE> Former Dutch PM to Head WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Prime Minister of the
Netherlands Prof Ruud Lubbers has been elected President of the
Board of Trustees of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the
conservation organization announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Analyzing global trends and the increasing destruction of
nature, I have come to realize that WWF, as a non-governmental
organization, most effectively achieves concrete conservation
results," said Lubbers, who was the former Dutch prime minister
from 1982 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor and a challenge for me to now serve as the
President of WWF International," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming prime minister, Lubbers was Netherlands'
Minister of Economic Affairs. He is currently head of Globus, the
Institute for Globalization and Development based in Tilburg,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
At the WWF 1999 Annual Conference held in the capital of Sabah
in east Malaysia, it was agreed that in the new millennium, the
WWF will embark on a whole new phase of conservation work.
</P>
<P>
The WWF will focus on ecoregions, enhancing campaigning as a
tool to deliver effective conservation.
</P>
<P>
Ecoregion-based conservation addresses the root causes of
biodiversity loss. It creates partnerships with key players and
stake-holders and provides a basis for establishing priorities.
</P>
<P>
The WWF has identified some 200 ecoregions it considers most
outstanding and representative of the world's major habitat types.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Economy Emerging From Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew at a 4.6 percent annual rate in the third
quarter of the year, indicating that the country's economy is
emerging from a three-year slowdown, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The growth followed a much stronger 6.5 percent surge in the
previous quarter, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said in a
report published Thursday. Economists said these figures showed
that the economy has been on the road to recovery for several
months.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance of the economy in the last two quarters
might boost the overall growth forecast for 1999 by half a
percentage point, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and economists have initially predicted
the overall growth rate at 2.0 percent this year, the same as that
of 1998 and the lowest in this decade.
</P>
<P>
The CBS report showed economic improvement in several major
fields in the third quarter. Imports of goods and services, for
example, grew by 13.0 percent, and private consumption surged by
7.3 percent, after a 6.2 percent rise in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Excluding durable goods, per capita consumption - a measure of
the standard of living - rose by 2.2 percent in the third quarter,
up from increases of 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent respectively in
the second and first quarters.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, exports grew by a relatively modest 5.1
percent, compared to 11.3 percent in the second quarter, and 10.1
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that the figures also indicate that the
government target growth rate of 3 percent for next year might be
too modest, especially considering that the budget deficit will
probably be less than the 2.9 percent to 3 percent predicted for
this year.
</P>
<P>
But they also cautioned that there would be possibility that
the growth would slow down in the fourth quarter because of some
one-time factors.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Children Spend 38 Hours Weekly Using Multimedia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) - A study released Wednesday
shows that American children spend an average of 38 hours a week
in multimedia activities outside their school, the equivalent of
nearly a full work week.
</P>
<P>
``Watching TV, playing video games, listening to music and
surfing the Internet have become a full-time job for the typical
American child,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation, sponsor of the study. For children aged eight and
older, the total amount is even higher, he added.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted between November 10, 1998 and April 20,
1999 was based on a sample of 3,155 children aged 2-18, with more
than 2,000 written questionnaires completed by kids eight and
older, more than 1,000 in-home interviews with parents of 2-7 year-
olds, and more than 600 week-long media use diaries maintained by
parents or children.
</P>
<P>
Among children aged eight and older, the study found that 65
percent have a TV set in their bedroom and say the TV is usually
on during meals in their home. Nearly that many, 61 percent, say
their parents have not set rules on their television viewing.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one in four kids this age spends more than five hours a
day watching TV, the study found.
</P>
<P>
For younger children, aged 2-7, it found that they spend an
average of 3.5 hours using various types of media. Television is a
favorite, with one in three having a TV in their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
The study did not find any case of children spending many hours
daily playing computer games or surfing the Internet. It said
fewer than one in 10 kids spends more than an hour daily using a
computer for fun, including 3 percent who spend more than an hour
on-line and 2 percent who spend more than an hour playing computer
games.
</P>
<P>
``Computers may be the wave of the future, but TV still
dominates kids' time and attention today,'' said Vicky Rideout,
director of the Foundation's Program on the Entertainment Media &AMP;
Public Health, which examines the impact of entertainment media on
society.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Fail to Observe Meteor Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronomers failed to
observe the Leonid Meteor Storm which occurred at 10:00 a.m.,
Beijing Time (2:00 a.m. GMT), said a scientist from the Beijing
Astronomical Observatory (BAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
today.
</P>
<P>
"I only saw a few dozen meteors during the observation from 1:
00 to 5:00 a.m.today at the BAO's Xinglong Station in north China'
s Hebei Province," said Dr. Zhu Jin, a research professor with the
BAO.
</P>
<P>
"Though the number of meteors increased at around five o'clock
early this morning, I still saw fewer meteors than during the
shower last year," Zhu concluded.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the station are well prepared for meteor
observation, with two CCD (Charged Couple Device) cameras, which
successfully took a dozen pictures of the meteors.
</P>
<P>
They have also tried hard to record the meteor shower process
by using a special video camera.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at an astronomical station in suburban Urumqi in
western China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region reported
observing more than 300 meteors an hour from 6:00 to 8:00 o'clock
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
A European research group observed the Leonid Meteor Storm at 2:
00 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (10:00 a.m. Beijing Time), with about
1,800 shooting stars an hour.
</P>
<P>
Leonid meteors form in the dust debris of the Tempel-Tuttle
comet's tail which orbits the sun every 33 years. The Earth
crosses the tail every November, and meteor showers occur when the
debris is particularly dense.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Syrians Hold Secret Talks: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Secret negotiations between
Syria and Israel via a third party are well underway with an
announcement of resuming peace talks expected within weeks, a
Lebanese newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star quoted a senior Arab source as saying that the
public perception of the peace process being in limbo was merely a
"smokescreen" to give the back channel time to work out.
</P>
<P>
Once direct official talks resume, a final agreement on
resumption of peace negotiations could be hammered out "within
just a few weeks," said the source, who is intimately familiar
with the mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle delaying progress was the health problem of
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, a key player in the negotiations, underwent
emergency heart surgery in Beirut last month.
</P>
<P>
Although the operation was a success and he has returned to
office, al-Sharaa has been reportedly advised to reduce his work
load.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that a revival of the peace talks
hinges on a Syrian demand that Israel honor its promise to
withdraw from all the occupied Golan Heights, a pledge Damascus
says was made by late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Israel says there was no such a commitment as the offer had
been hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have been stalled since February
1996. Syria demands that the talks be resumed from where they were
left off whereas Israel wants the talks to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Syrian Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
The source hinted that Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein is
the third party under the help of France.

<HEADLINE> 7 Suspected Robbers Killed by Philippine Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Seven unidentified armed men
were killed when they engaged operatives of the elite Philippine
Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) in a gun
battle in Quezon City of Metro Manila Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
An initial police report said the clash occurred at around 8
a.m. when PAOCTF operatives fought heavily-armed members of what
was alleged to be the Jaime Balmoris Group near the Shoemart (SM)
Fairview Mall in Quezon City.
</P>
<P>
Supt. Michael Ray Aquino, PAOCTF team leader, said those killed
were members of the group of former rebel New People's Army (NPA)
Commander Jaime Balmoris.
</P>
<P>
Aquino said the Balmoris group had been under surveillance
after one of them was arrested recently but was released after
posting a bail bond.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen rode in a mega taxi which was heavily-peppered with
bullets, Aquino said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were allegedly engaged in hijacking, bank robbery,
kidnapping, holdup and other illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
Aquino said the group was about to rob a wealthy family in
Fairview Mall, when the lawmen blocked the suspects' vehicle,
resulting in the fight.
</P>
<P>
The identities of the suspects have yet to be determined, said
the report.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China today reiterated its
opposition to any attempts to develop the Theater Missile Defense(
TMD), and stressed that it did not, does not and will never engage
in arms race.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question at a press conference, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said that to develop the TMD at a time when ten
years has passed since the end of the Cold War runs counter to the
trend of times, and is not conducive to arms control and
disarmament, and will also have a negative impact on regional and
world strategic balance and stability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has stood for complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of strategic nuclear arms, and China's
limited nuclear strength is only for self-defense, and China does
not pose any threat to any country, adding that China has the
resolve and ability to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial
integrity.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Consumer Loans Up to 51 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The consumer loans extended by
South Korean domestic banks totaled 65.51 trillion won (some 51.36
billion U.S. dollars) in the first ten months of this year, up 28
percent from the total amount of last year, said the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The figure would rise if consumer loans by foreign banks and
other domestic financial institutions in South Korea are included.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of the consumer loans have been used to repay
higher interest loans from the secondary financial institutions
and to buy stocks as the South Korean economy is recovering from
the financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank warned, a large part of the loans is
being funneled to the market, and those who invested in the stock
market with consumer loans will suffer a lot if stocks fall down.

<HEADLINE> UAE Sends Aid to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A ship loaded with 300 tons
of aid will set sail on Thursday from the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) to Iraq, the Gulf News daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The ship, namely, the Winston Churchill, will carry oil, sugar
and powdered milk to the Iraqi harbor of Basra.
</P>
<P>
"We have been told that the Iraqi government will not accept
aid any more. But we are sending our aid in an indirect way, under
the name of UAE nationals," explained Mohammed Al Shaibah, who
coordinates UAE aid to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the aid will be sent to public welfare organizations
in Iraq which will be responsible for distributing it to those
who are in desperate need.
</P>
<P>
The shipload will be the 27th mercy mission sent by the UAE to
Iraq since U.N. economic sanctions were imposed on Iraq in
1990. The last ship carried 300 tons of medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Al Shaibah said some of the Iraqi people were living under
extremely difficult circumstances and some 1,000 people were
reportedly dying every day, of which at least 600 were
children. Thousands were sleeping in the streets and begging for
their daily bread, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the UAE media to send a team of journalists to
Iraq and record the sufferings of the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest computer chip-maker, confirmed Wednesday that supplies of
new Pentium III chips have been limited, but the chip giant said
it is taking steps to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
"PC demand is very strong, and what we are doing is working to
ramp up production to meet orders over and above what we've
already committed to for the quarter," said Michael Sullivan, an
Intel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Computer makers have had a hard time getting Pentium IIIs for
the past few weeks, but Intel said Wednesday it is still on track
to ship "millions" of its newest chips this quarter.
</P>
<P>
Supplies remain tight across all PC processor lines -- not just
the newest Pentium IIIs launched in October -- and supplies of
chipsets are tight, too, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
PC demand has exceeded expectations, he said, leading to an
inability to fill all the orders beyond what the company's
original commitments were.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) has taken a new step to attract talent from among non-
military university graduates by offering scholarships for these
students, beginning this September, the China Youth Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University and Qinghua University, the two most famous
universities in China, are the first to have the National Defense
Scholarship which provides each recipient with about 5,000 yuan a
year to cover tuition and lodging fees.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the scholarship may be adjusted in accordance
with changes in these expenses, the paper quoted Zhang Weihua,
director of the PLA office on selection and training of reservists
at the two universities.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 students have applied for the scholarships and an
examination will be held to determine the recipients.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the army urgently needs talented professionals with
majors in subjects including electronics, computer science,
automation, and foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
Among the scientists rewarded by the government for their
contributions to the defense industry, many are from Beijing and
Qinghua universities, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Warns Against Consumer-led Boycott of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela has warned that a consumer-led boycott of
diamonds could ravage southern African economies.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a boycott of diamonds, the economies of especially
two countries, Namibia and Botswana, will collapse and we want to
avoid that," Mandela, who retired from office in June this year,
told reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as Britain-based Global Witness have raised
the prospect of a consumer boycott against diamonds which they
said have helped fund civil wars across Africa, particularly in
Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The "Fatal Transactions" campaign pulled together four European
non- governmental organizations last month to stop rebel armies in
Africa using diamond sales to fund their military.
</P>
<P>
The group has urged consumers to ask diamond firms such as
South Africa' s De Beers what they were doing to stop the region's
conflicts which has claimed countless lives.
</P>
<P>
"The diamond industry is vital to the South African and
southern African economy. We would be concerned that an
international campaign on these issues does not damage this vital
industry," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
It is a major revenue source for many southern African states,
notably Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Botswana is the world's biggest diamond producer in terms of
value and earns around two billion U.S. dollars a year from gem
sales.

the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito party, as well as the
major opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
</P>
<P>
One of the bills, submitted by the Japanese government, will
allow the Public Security Investigation Agency to regularly
supervise or restrict the activities of AUM followers.
</P>
<P>
Although not specifically name AUM, the bill says the purpose
of the legislation is to impose controls on any group whose
members have carried out or attempted "indiscriminate mass-murder,
including ones using sarin, during the past 10 years," in effect
limiting its scope exclusively to AUM.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, groups implicated in serious crimes could be
placed under the surveillance of the chief of the Public Security
Investigation Agency for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
Groups under surveillance must report their activities every
three months, and police and public security officials can inspect
their facilities.
</P>
<P>
If the groups are found to have broken the law, they can be
banned from using or acquiring facilities for up to six months.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Commission, at the request of the head of
the Public Security Investigation Agency, would decide whether to
place groups under surveillance or ban them from acquiring or
using facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government drafted the bill after receiving
complaints from local governments asking for measures against
increasing cases of friction between local residents and AUM. The
cult has been trying to expand its presence nationwide and has
encountered local resistance in the process.
</P>
<P>
Many AUM members, including its founder, Shoko Asahara, are on
trial for or have been found guilty of a series of crimes
including the subway gassing which killed 12 people and injured
more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The other bill, submitted by the LDP and its two coalition
partners, is aimed at facilitating the seizure of AUM's hidden
assets to compensate the victims of crimes committed by AUM.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows bankruptcy administrators to take control of
assets held before groups are declared bankrupt, even if those
assets have been transferred to other entities.
</P>
<P>
The two bills are expected to go into effect by the end of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Values Hamper China's Corpse Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua)-- Stubborn traditional Chinese
values are hampering efforts by Chinese authorities to obtain
donated corpses for use in medical training.
</P>
<P>
The corpse donation station at the Capital University of
Medical Sciences has received only four corpses since its
establishment on April 30, forcing students at the university to
share one corpse in anatomy courses.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wei, director of the station, said that the university
cannot make do with such lack of donations since they require 50
corpses for teaching and ten for medical research a year.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the university relied on unclaimed corpses in
hospitals as their main source.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that so far 230 people have registered at the station,
promising to donate their bodies after death, but only less than
half of them have completed the notarization process.  Wang
attributes the Chinese lack of willingness to donate their dead
bodies to traditional values, which determines that one's corpse
must be buried in the ground and return to nature because even
their hair has been received from their parents and shouldn't be
blemished by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
The donation station has also received applications from people
outside Beijing willing to donate their corpses after death, but
due to the high cost of transport the station has to reject these
offers.
</P>
<P>
The first corpse donation station was established in Shanghai
ten years ago, and Nanjing and Beijing are the only other cities
in China with such centers. Along with Wang's university, two
other universities and the Beijing Red Cross Society also set up
stations for receiving corpse donations this year.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and France will hold joint military exercises next year as
part of a defense agreement signed between the two countries in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvres, codenamed Gulf 2000, will be conducted in the
first two weeks of next February and involve more than 1,000
troops from both countries, announced General Jean Georges Brevot,
commander of the French Air Force and Air Operations Command.
</P>
<P>
The war games will be led by the French air force, followed by
the navy and the army, said the general, who is leading a
delegation to the ongoing Dubai 2000 Air Show.
</P>
<P>
The two defense teams will initially set up a joint combat
center and 12 Mirage 2000s from the French air force along with
other combat aircraft from the UAE air force will be deployed in
the war games, the Gulf News daily quoted the general as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joint military exercises are conducted once every three years
according to the 1995 defense agreement. The UAE also has similar
agreements with the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, General Brevot announced that the UAE air force
will get 33 French fighter jets Mirage 2000-9 by the year 2002
under a contract signed last year which is worth 5 billion
U.S. dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance industry
actively supports the country's efforts in joining the World Trade
Organization, said Ma Yongwei, chairman of the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference today, Ma said that
becoming a member of the WTO will help introduce overseas
competitive mechanism, prudent principles and advanced business
and service levels to China's insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that currently China's insurance sector is yet
to be improved in terms of service quality and business level, but
for the future of the industry, he remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of foreign insurance companies
dominating the Chinese market after WTO entry, saying that since
China opened its insurance market in 1992, 17 foreign insurance
companies have entered China, and presently they account for only
one percent of the market shares.

<HEADLINE> WTO Membership Will Bring Challenge, Opportunities to Chinese Agriculture. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Though China's accession to
the World Trade Organization may present challenges for some of
the country's agricultural products, it also will provide a rare
opportunity to development agriculture and the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Wan Baorui, vice-minister of agriculture, made this remark
today during an interview with Xinhua, adding that China's WTO
membership will play a positive role in accelerating the
modernization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
After entering the WTO, China will further open its market,
which will attract more foreign funds, technology, and managerial
expertise to the nation's agricultural sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's per-capita natural resources are low, and especially
insufficient in farmland, but China has a huge labor force, he
said, noting that although joining the WTO will facilitate the
import of resources-intensive products, the export of China's
labor-intensive products such as fruits, vegetables, livestock and
aquatics will rise accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that WTO membership means that China will enjoy the
same trade treatment as that enjoyed by the current 135 WTO member
countries, and this will help lower the cost of trade and solve
trade disputes in a regulated manner.
</P>
<P>
Access to the WTO, which may possibly mean lower tariffs and
the cancellation of non-tariff barriers, will bring challenges to
poor quality, low unit-yield and low technology-driven
agricultural products and processed products in some regions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To meet these challenges, China will further improve its
agricultural infrastructure, strengthen agricultural scientific
and technological research, step up the popularization of
practical techniques, actively develop and import new varieties of
grain seeds and technology, and readjust agricultural structure,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In this way, China will improve the quality of its agricultural
products, lower costs, and sharpen the country's competitive edge
for its products on the world market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bus Driver Killed By Tigers At Shanghai Safari Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A bus driver was killed by
three tigers at the Shanghai Safari Park on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Xu Weixing and 12 other drivers carried more than 500 junior
high school students in 13 buses on a tour of the Safari Park
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
At about 10:30, when they entered a tiger breeding area, the
bus that Xu was driving broke down. Xu got out of the bus to take
a look. Three Siberian tigers leapt at Xu tearing him to shreds.
Students shouted from the bus but were helpless to save him. Some
30 minutes later, park keepers arrived and rushed Xu to hospital.
Unfortunately, Xu died that morning at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
Animals have attacked humans before at the Safari Park, but
this is the first time someone has died as a result of such
attacks. On November 16, a six-year old girl was injured when she
was posing for a picture with a tiger cub.
</P>
<P>
Built only three years ago at a cost of 300 million yuan, the
Safari Park has more than 10,000 animals and some 200 species from
all over the world. Four million visitors have visited the park
since it was opened.
</P>
<P>
Safari Park rules clearly stipulate that visitors are
prohibited to alight from their vehicles while in the park. Park
authorities said that Xu should have first contacted park keepers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang Endi, in charge of the China program with the
Wildlife Conservation Society, said that tigers are a highly
independent and aggressive species who will normally kill anyone
approaching their domain.
</P>
<P>
Xie Yimin, secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Wildlife
Conservation Association, said that media reports often exaggerate
a close rapport between man and animals. Animals, especially
beasts of prey, he said, are by their very nature hostile to man.
"The key to protecting animals lies in providing them with a safe
habitat."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's National Assembly Opens Sixth Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said Thursday that the country has succeeded in
cushioning the adverse effect of the regional crisis, preventing
big changes in the macroeconomy and maintaining its economic
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
In a government work report at the sixth session of Vietnam's
10th National Assembly, which opened here Thursday morning, Khai
said most major socioeconomic targets set by the National Assembly
for 1999 have been fulfilled or surpassed. The gross domestic
product (GDP) rose by 4.7 to 5 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has grown by 5.2 to 5.3 percent and the sector
produced a record 33.8 million tons of rice, 2 million tons more
than last year. Industry also made great efforts to keep its
growth rate at more than 10 percent. Export turnover is estimated
at 10.7 billion U.S. dollars, showing a yearly increase of 14.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Khai also acknowledged that the economic growth rate
of 1999 is the lowest since 1990. Enterprises are unable to sell
their products and development investment in the economy is
stagnant while foreign investment flow has decreased. Consumer
demand is low and unemployment is serious, resulting in increasing
social evils.
</P>
<P>
Khai promised to make efforts in the year 2000 to achieve some
major targets including a GDP growth rate of between 5.5 and 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh
said the session will consider the government's report on
socioeconomic development, the state budget and other reports on
national defense and security and external activities.
</P>
<P>
The session, which is to last for more than one month, will
make decisions on major targets and tasks and the state budget for
the year 2000 and it will ratify the balance of the 1998 state
budget.
</P>
<P>
The assembly will also consider reports on law enforcement and
voters' opinions and decide on a program for promulgating laws and
ordinances in the year 2000. It will pass the remainder of the
Criminal Code and amendments to the Law on Land Use Right Transfer
and the Law on Officers of the Vietnam People's Army.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua)-- The "China Human Development
Report 1999," released by the United Nations Development Program (
UNDP) here today, calls for the "substantial and vigorous role of
the state".
</P>
<P>
Editor and chief author Carl Riskin, East Asia studies scholar
at Columbia University, gave a brief introduction to the report at
the releasing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to Riskin, the report presents a discussion of "the
most pressing human development issues that are being addressed in
China," including unemployment and laid-off workers, reform of the
social security system, and the growth of regional disparities and
inequalities.
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges the progress of China's 1994 fiscal
reform, but expresses concerns over the "decentralized and
fragmented" economy, and suggests that the government enhance
fiscal capacity by strengthening its financial and banking arms,
Riskin said.
</P>
<P>
The report also calls for increased government investment in
infrastructure, health, education, science and technology, and
innovation, according to the editor.
</P>
<P>
The protection of "China's injured and vulnerable natural
environment" is particularly emphasized in the report.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were representatives from the UNDP,
government departments, and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned by the UNDP and compiled by scholars
from China and other countries, is the second in a series since
1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurers Optimistic over WTO Prospects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance companies
are optimistic about the prospects of surviving and prospering in
international competition after the country enters the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission Ma
Yongwei made this remark today at a press conference held by the
Information Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is totally unnecessary to worry that
foreign insurance companies will dominate the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
A groundbreaking agreement signed by China and the United
States on Monday is seen as having paved the way for China's
accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, China will allow wider market
access to foreign insurers after the country joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that China's accession must be on the basis of a
balance between obligations and rights. Opening the insurance
market to foreign companies will help China introduce prudence,
competition, and advanced service skills into its insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the presence of foreign insurers in China
will greatly increase the competition for Chinese insurance
companies, forcing them to improve service quality, strengthen
self-regulation, enhance personnel training, and contribute to
perfecting the relevant legal framework.
</P>
<P>
"We have to confess that in terms of quality of service and
business skills, the Chinese insurance sector lags far behind its
foreign counterparts. However, we will reach the most advanced
level in the world in the near future if we work hard from now on,
" he said. "It won't take as long as 10 to 15 years."

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Surge To Three-Year High On U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices, which dipped
below 12 dollars last February, soared past the 26-dollar mark
Wednesday on several bullish news reports, including a renewed
commitment from major oil producers to hold global crude output
cuts, according to reports reaching here late in the day.
</P>
<P>
In New York, light sweet crude for December delivery rose to a
session high of 26.70 dollars a barrel, just shy of the January 9,
1997, high of 26.74 dollars, itself a post-Gulf War high. The
contract settled 90 cents up at 26.60 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Underlying support came from Wednesday's meeting in Riyadh of
the oil ministers of oil giants Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico,
who said the supply cutbacks should remain in place until their
March 2000 expiry. The trio spearheaded a series of cuts, which
culminated in doubling oil prices since last February.
</P>
<P>
Traders said another driving force behind the rally in U.S. oil
futures rally were government and industry reports on Tuesday and
Wednesday showing draws in inventories in the U.S., the world's
largest oil market.
</P>
<P>
A report by the American Petroleum Institute showed that
dwindling U.S. oil stocks were down 5 million barrels last week.
Another report by the U.S. Department of Energy a day earlier put
the figure at 4 million.
</P>
<P>
The data strengthened perceptions of a looming supply crunch
this winter on the back of supply cuts from OPEC and other major
producers.
</P>
<P>
Heating oil and gasoline futures also rose sharply after the
American Petroleum Institute said stocks last week fell by 932,000
barrels and 4.9 million barrels, respectively.
</P>
<P>
December heating oil was up 1.52 cents to 68.73 cents a gallon
and December gasoline rose 2.48 cents to 73.40 cents a gallon.
December natural gas settled up 0.5 cent at 2.456 dollars per 1,
000 cubic feet.

the next five years, the Chinese government will set no limits on
the number of foreign insurers it will allow into the country each
year. Instead, it will approve the entry of all companies that
meet scrutiny standards under the principle of prudence and
according to relevant law and regulations.
</P>
<P>
China will gradually accelerate the pace of opening its
insurance market over a period of time, Ma said, noting that both
foreign insurers and re-insurers will be allowed into the country
with their locations, operational scope, and organizational forms
expanded from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance companies are allowed to enter China in the form
of joint ventures and can own a maximum share of 50 percent of the
joint venture, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will gradually allow foreign life
insurance companies to expand their scope of operations to wider
areas from the current area limited to services for individuals
only.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that foreign property insurance company will probably
be allowed to set up solely owned subsidiaries in China soon.
</P>
<P>
He also said that foreign insurance companies will be allowed
to set up branches in places other than Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Chinese insurers will focus on fostering sophisticated
personnel and upgrading the technological level of services in a
bid to compete with foreign companies, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Summit Opens, Wide Spectrum of Issues on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) opened
here Thursday to discuss a wide spectrum of issues, ranging from
arms control, regional conflicts to economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government, including U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, French President Jacques
Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and more than
3,000 delegates from 55 member countries, are attending the
two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE's eight Mediterranean and Asian partners for
cooperation, namely Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan,
Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea, are represented at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is also
present at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony was chaired by Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Dominating the summit will be the adoption of the Charter on
European Security, the signing of an adaptation agreement of the
Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty), and a
decision on the OSCE's chairmanship next year.
</P>
<P>
The participants are also expected to deal with a wide array of
regional conflicts, including those in Chechnya, Kosovo,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nagorno-Karabakh and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
A series of declarations will be adopted to accelerate the pace
of their settlement.
</P>
<P>
Many signs show that Chechnya issue will be highlighted though
Russia has said it does not want the meeting to tackle it.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Wednesday that he will not accept criticism of
Russia's military action in Chechnya, adding his government is
acting in the area in accordance with international norms.
</P>
<P>
Charter on European Security is reportedly to strengthen the
OSCE as a primary instrument for disputes settlement by further
enhancing its effectiveness in early warning, conflict prevention,
crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
An adaptation agreement to the CFE Treaty has been intended for
further weapons reduction.
</P>
<P>
The CFE Treaty, signed in Paris in November 1990, has so far
led to the destruction and conversion to other uses of more than
50,000 battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery pieces,
combat aircraft and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known who will succeed Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek as the OSCE's chairman-in-office in
2000.
</P>
<P>
With the summit already underway, the Turkish government has
beefed up security measures by deploying tens of thousands of
policemen in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE, a pan-Europe security organization with 55 member
states across continental Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia and
North America, was established on January 1, 1995 on the basis of
the Convention on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which
had only been forum.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Economy Picking Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- India's economy is picking
up and showing sustained growth, with clear signs of recovery in
industry and exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistical Organization, India's
industry rose by an impressive 6.4 percent in the first half of
the 1999-2000 fiscal year (April-September), as against 4 percent
during the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports stood at 17.46 billion U.S. dollars in
the first half of the current fiscal year, up 7.39 percent from
16.26 billion dollars recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite a surge in oil imports, trade deficit narrowed
marginally to 5.01 billion dollars during the period as against
5.02 billion dollars during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Economic Editors' Conference Tuesday, Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha said India's economy is already showing
signs of a revival, with all macroeconomic indicators pointing
toward a rebound.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the country will witness a growth rate of
between 6.5 and 7 percent at the end of the current fiscal year as
against 6 percent recorded during the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinha said the fiscal situation continues to remain
tight with the huge burden of defense payments, police
establishments and food and fertilizer subsidy, although the
government has been making all efforts to control expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit for the first half of the current fiscal
year was 60 billion rupees (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), less than
the corresponding period last year. But it covered 66 percent of
the budget estimate as against 64 percent recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an international rating agency, Moody's Investor
Service, expressed confidence in the new Indian government, saying
 it has a fresh opportunity to undertake market-oriented
adjustments at the start of an apparently longer term in office.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report released in New York Wednesday, Moody's
said the increased probability of accelerated economic reform was
part of Moody's reason in raising a positive outlook on the
country's Ba2 ratings last month.
</P>
<P>
"Signs that industrial growth is recovering after three years
of weak performance indicate that corporate restructuring is
paying off, especially in the private sector where companies are
focusing increasingly on their core competencies," it added.
</P>
<P>
Over the medium term, the agency stressed, India's growth rate
will need to be higher than the roughly 6 percent average of the
1990s and in fact, even faster than the government's usual 7
percent target, in order to raise average living standards.

<HEADLINE> China Rectifies Economic Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a
nationwide drive to sort out and rectify the 20,000-strong
economic agents which employ a total of 330,000 people, the
Ministry of Finance announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The drive is aimed at severing the links between government
organs and these economic agents. No government organs will be
allowed to run such agents or have any form of economic links or
interests in them.
</P>
<P>
Among the targeted economic agents are accounting and auditing
offices, financial consultants, tax filing offices, lawyers,
assets evaluation agents, pricing assessment agents, and audit
agents of project costs, as well as relevant administrative
industry associations, consortia and administrative centers.
</P>
<P>
Those agents failing to comply with legal requirements or
having no approval from the State Council will have to re-apply
for approval. Some agents, which have overlapping operations,
will be merged, and some not recognized by the law or with poor
management will be closed.
</P>
<P>
The rectification endeavor will last until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has set up a special panel comprising
officials from 10 ministries and institutions to supervise the
conduct of the drive.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Opposition Accused of Distorting President's View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) has begun a campaign of distortion
against President Chandrika Kumaratunga's public statements,
official media sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources claimed that the UNP has been deliberately
distorting an interview given by President Kumaratunga to Time
International, a Tamil Magazine, in February last year.
</P>
<P>
The magazine had quoted Kumaratunga as saying that she would
hand over the administration of the north and east to Tamil rebels
for a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The president had specified that the proposal was under the
condition that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) must
stop the war, lay down arms and enter into certain agreements with
the government, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources charged that the UNP has been ignoring her
clarification and is twisting the situation to suit its purposes.
</P>
<P>
This issue has taken a major turn in the run-up to the
presidential elections scheduled for December 21.
</P>
<P>
In her campaign, Kumaratunga has been condemning opposition
leader wickremesinghe's statement publicized through the Tamil
News website last week that if he won next month's presidential
elections, he will hand over the administration of the north and
east to the Tamil rebels for two years as a temporary measure.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, however, denied that he had made such a
statement. What he had said was that he would set up an interim
administration comprising representatives of all Tamil parties
which could include the LTTE as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country since
1983.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the administration of the north and east based on
the statements of the two leaders has taken a prime position in
the upcoming election campaign, the sources said.

SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has independently
developed a self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery named Biho and
will deploy it next month, said the South Korean Army Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The army began to develop the 30-mm low-altitude aerial
defense artillery in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Carried by a 520 horsepower armored personnel carrier at a
maximum speed of 65 kilometers per hour, the double-barreled Biho
can reportedly intercept any planes that infiltrate at low
altitudes.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Seeks Special Parliament Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition
party is seeking to call a special session of parliament to
discuss the recent price hikes in fuel and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The central committee of the Communist Party of Nepal Unified
Marxist and Leninist (CPN-UML) Wednesday decided to ask the
party's parliamentary department to begin preparing for the
session, the Kathmandu Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders held a meeting Wednesday to discuss the steep
hike in prices of diesel, kerosene, electricity and fertilizer and
decided to launch protest programs, both on the streets and in the
parliament, said the party's spokesman and central member, Pradip
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"Our main purpose of seeking the special session is to draw
the attention of the government and demand that the government
withdraw its decisions to increase the prices," Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government increased the prices of diesel by 48
percent, kerosene by 32 percent and electricity charges by 30
percent in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take at least 15 to 20 days before the session
is called. The central committee of CPN-UML is holding a meeting
Thursday to decide when to file the petition with King Birendra.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time in the post-democracy years in
Nepal that a special session would be called to discuss an issue
that does not involve government ouster or formation.
</P>
<P>
In the past, all such sessions have been called either to file
motions of no-confidence or to remove governments, and most of
them during 1995-1999 when shaky coalition governments ruled the
country.

DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Employees of the Bangladeshi
government has announced a two-month agitation program to begin
next month if their demands were not met by the end of this month,
The Independent newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The program was announced by Harunor Rashid, president of the

Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 25,000 Australian Teachers Rally Over Wage Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- About 25,000 striking
teachers, who are angry over what they claim is an inadequate wage
offer, Thursday rallied outside the New South Wales (NSW) state
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Teachers Federation President Sue Simpson told the rally that
NSW Education Minister John Aquilina should scrap the offer
immediately.
</P>
<P>
She said the gathering sent a clear message to Aquilina that
teachers would not continue to work under current conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We want you to be in no doubt that the teachers of New South
Wales will never accept your wage document," she said.
</P>
<P>
Simpson also called on Aquilina to return to the negotiating
table immediately.
</P>
<P>
The state government has offered teachers a
600-million-Australian dollar (396 million U.S. dollars) salary
package, with rises ranging up to 9.6 percent over four years but
teachers are lobbying for a 30 percent pay increase over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
NSW opposition leader Kerry Chikarovski said the strike action
was regrettable, but could have been prevented had the government
been willing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't condone the strike, I could never condone a
strike, but I can understand the anger that has got it to this
point," Chikarovski said.

WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lennox Lewis-Evander
Holyfield rematch set a boxing record with $16.9 million in gate
receipts.
</P>
<P>
With 4,272 tickets sold at $2,000 each, the Saturday night bout
broke the previous record of $14.3 million for the second
Holyfield-Mike Tyson fight on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17,078 tickets were sold for the fight at the UNLV
campus arena in which Lewis won a unanimous decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the pay-per-view sales fell short of the Lewis-
Holyfield's first fight. Only 850,000 purchased the fight on TVKO,
HBO's pay-per-view arm, compared to 1.2 million buys for the first
bout in March.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's rematch with Tyson set a record with 1.99 million
buys while their first fight had 1.59 million.
</P>
<P>
Lewis-Holyfield I is eighth on the list, just behind Felix

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Sell Foreclosed Property Assets by Tender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Asset
Management Corporation (Danaharta) announced Thursday it will hold
its first sale of foreclosed property assets by way of open tender
beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta, set up last year specially to buy non-performance
loans from the banking sector and troubled corporate assets,
plans to dispose of foreclosed property assets on a quarterly
basis, it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The list of assets to be disposed of comprised 44 properties
with an indicative value of about 122.6 million ringgit (32.263
million U.S. dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
There were 11 residential properties, five commercial
properties, one office property, two retail properties, 16
industrial properties, three development lands and six
agricultural lands, according to Danaharta. Foreclosed hotel
properties, not included in the sale by tender, will be dealt with
separately as the needs of the hotel and leisure sector are
different from those of the broad property sector.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta said various financial institutions had indicated the
availability of financing from 70 to 90 percent to successful
tenderers.
</P>
<P>
The tender closes at 5.00 p.m. (local time), December 9, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Expanding Colored Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, China's largest cotton grower, has expanded its acreage of
colored cotton to 466 hectares of land, harvesting over 40,000 kg
of colored cotton.
</P>
<P>
The output value gained from colored cotton production and
processing has exceeded 100 million yuan, said an official with
the Xinjiang Junlu Group.
</P>
<P>
As the leading cotton grower in China, Xinjiang makes up one
fifth of the country's cotton growing area and one third of China'
s cotton output. Xinjiang turned out 1.4 million tons of ordinary
cotton this year, ranking first in China.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang experimented with growing colored cotton at Awat
County and the city of Shihezi in 1994. Colored cotton is
pollution-free, exempted from the process of bleaching and dying
and sold two times higher than the ordinary price of cotton. At
present, brown, green and light tan cottons are available on the
local market.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang plans to become China's largest colored cotton
production base by expanding the growing area of colored cotton to
23,300 ha next year, 50 times its present acreage. The annual
output of colored cotton is expected to reach 30,000 tons, 150
percent higher than the present combined world output.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agronomists in Xinjiang are developing a long-fibre
cotton ranging from 35 to 37 mm in length and a new cotton strain
which will resist cotton aphids and boll worms.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Prisons in South Asia are in
critical conditions, which needs immediate improvements, legal
experts from the region said.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said at the concluding session of a three-day
Conference on Penal Reforms in South Asia that prisons in the
South Asian region are in a neglected state and prisoners are
ill-treated.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ended Wednesday, stressed that prisoners
are entitled to the rights that are available within the
limitations of confinement.
</P>
<P>
Participants recommended setting up standards to improve prison
conditions and reduce the number of prisoners awaiting trial which
currently makes up 75 percent of the prison population.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggested that vulnerable groups, such as women,
children, juveniles, mentally and terminally ill prisoners,
disabled, aged and ethnic and religious minorities, foreign
nationals and political detainees be given special attention for
their mental and physical health.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for transparency in prison
administration, rationalization in the classification of prisoners
and regular training and sensitization of prison staff.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by legal experts from Bangladesh,
India, Nepal and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Shards of Painted Pottery Discovered in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Shards of painted pottery
dating to the Neolithic Period have been discovered in north China
's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The shards of pottery, perhaps a bowl can be dated 4,500 to 5,
500 years ago. Archeologists have excavated 177 items altogether,
including jade and stone artefacts from a tomb in Hulun Buir. The
discovery of these shards of pottery suggest frequent cultural
exchanges among northern ethnic groups and central China then,
said Zhao Yuming, a local official in charge of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Along with archaeological finds in the area dating back to the
Paleolithic Age and the Shang and Zhou dynasties (B.C.16th century
to B.C.221), a comprehensive study of the autonomous region's
cultural history is now possible, said archaeologists.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Government Opposes Observers For Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's People's Alliance
(PA) government is against inviting international and local
observers to monitor the forthcoming presidential election on
December 21, the PA sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This view was conveyed to Acting Commissioner of Elections
D.M.P.B Dassanayake by the government representative at a
conference of the representatives of the presidential candidates
convened to discuss matters related to the election, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Matters discussed at the conference included the conducting of
a peaceful and fair election, the enforcement of election laws and
the proposal to invite foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
When the main opposition United National Party and other
parties requested the acting elections commissioner to invite
foreign observers, the government representative said they were
opposed to the request.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted the government representative as saying that
in the past such observers had not been impartial in their
reports. The government was also opposed to local monitoring
groups as well and was not prepared to provide facilities for them
to monitor the election, the representative added.
</P>
<P>
However, a proposal by the government representative to
restrict the broadcast of election campaigns only to the state
electronic media was opposed by all the other parties and
independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
In view of the different opinions expressed, the acting
elections commissioner had requested all the representatives to
submit their views in writing within two days, for his
consideration.

SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of residents
in Shanghai prefer to save their money in two ways: they open tax-
free education savings accounts or foreign currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
Although China started a tax levy tax on interest from November
1, educational savings accounts -- a new service which started in
September -- are exempt from the tax.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who opens an educational savings account will be
entitled to receive 25 percent more interest than from other
savings account schemes.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the Bank of China reported that foreign
currency deposits in October were 200 million US dollars more than
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Rapid rise in foreign currency deposits were also reported at
the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Communications and Shanghai
branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that such increases are attributed to the higher
interest rate of foreign currency deposits.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Naxi Society
was recently founded in Lijiang, Yunnan Province. Over 200 Naxi
scholars from the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Japan,
China and many other countries attended the inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Naxi culture has attracted enormous interest around the globe.
The United States, Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, Japan,
Thailand and many other countries have many researchers engaged in
the study of Naxi culture.
</P>
<P>
The Naxi ethnic group is mainly distributed in Yunnan and
Sichuan provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Naxi
represents one of the world's last remaining matriarchal societies.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 years ago, the Naxi created a script with 1,500
words. The"Dongba Classic", written in the Naxi script, records
the history, language, literature and art, religion and customs,
astronomy, and philosophy of Naxi society. The "Dongba Classic"
constitutes an encyclopedia of ancient Naxi culture.
</P>
<P>
The study on Dongba Culture dates back to early this century.
Interest and research in Dongba Culture has also attracted a
veritable army of international scholars in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the International Naxi Society indicates that
Naxi culture has now been recognized as a serious study subject
among scholars in China and abroad and now joins the rank of
Dunhuang Studies and Tibetology, the Society's president said.
</P>
<P>
The Society will promote and protect Naxi and Dongba Culture
and encourage Sino-foreign exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Hunan to Reinforce Yangtze River Embankment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province will use 70
million US dollars in World Bank loans to reinforce the Hunan
section of the Yangtze river embankment.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 260 million US dollars. Reinforcing the

floods since last year, including the construction of more water
control facilities and the reinforcement of the Yangtze river
embankment.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Cultures Give Inspiration to Modern Fashion Designer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- "It is my dream that China's
diverse ethnic clothes and ornaments are used in the modern
fashion industry," said Wu Haiyan, a well-known Chinese fashion
designer.
</P>
<P>
Wu has always had a proclivity for China's traditional and
ethnic clothing. She brought her "Splendid Epoch" Collection to
the international stage, which melded clothing styles from the Sui
and Tang dynasties (581-907A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China has 55 ethnic groups with their own unique
fashion styles. But bringing these tradition to life does not
simply involve copying traditional designs. Making fashionable
ethnic clothes is based on market research and studies in ethnic
minority regions, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu has gained a wealth of experience and a steady clientele in
the fashion industry at home and abroad promoting her ethnic
clothing in Shanghai, Hong Kong and America.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Up Second Islamic Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Bank Syariah Mandiri (BSM),
the second commercial bank operating under Islamic Law in
Indonesia, was officially launched on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
BSM President Nurdin Hasibuan said the bank had opened five
branches in Jakarta and three others in Bandung, Surabaya and
Medan.
</P>
<P>
BSM offers conventional banking services such as savings, time
deposits, leasing and trade financing.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said the difference between BSM and other banks is that
all of its services are based on a profit-sharing scheme rather
than on interest or fees.
</P>
<P>
BSM, with a total equity of 330 billion rupiah (47 million U.S.
dollars), is 99 percent owned by Bank Mandiri, a state bank
recently established from the merger of four state banks.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said BSM, formerly known as Bank Susila Bakti, a
medium-sized bank, was owned by one of Bank Dagang Negara's
subsidiaries. The ownership of the bank, which received its
license to operate as an Islamic bank only last month, was
transferred to Bank Mandiri as part of the merger.
</P>
<P>
He said it planned to open 12 more branches next year as part
of its short-term business plan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we will have 100 branches within the next five years,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's first Islamic bank was Bank Muamalat, which was
established in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Although there are only two commercial banks operating under
Islamic law, the number of rural banks offering services has
exceeded 50.

WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The second-seeded Lindsay
Davenport rallied from behind to win over her hard-hitting
opponent Amelie Mauresmo 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 on Wednesday to reach the
quarter-finals of the Chase Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Local favorite Davenport, who won her sixth title of the year
Sunday in Philadelphia, had her upper left thigh heavily taped to
begin the match.

Davenport on the run along the baseline with her powerful and
penetrating ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
In the day's first match, Halard-Decugis of France became the
first seeded player to be eliminated from the elite season-ending,
16-player field when she was crushed by Germany's Anke Huber 6-1,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Huber only needed 44 minutes to grab a quarter-final berth
where her next opponent will be Davenport.
</P>

ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Pakistani prime
minister Nawaz Sharif was formally arrested in an alleged plane
hijacking case and was taken to Karachi Wednesday night, a local
report said.
</P>

According to the News Network International (NNI) agency

The deposed prime minister will be produced before a special

criminal conspiracy to hijack a plane which Pakistan's Army Chief
General Pervaiz Musharraf was aboard on October 12.

Four others accused in the case have already been remanded for

<HEADLINE> Sanex New Sponsor of WTA Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Women's tennis has secured
a worldwide title sponsor for the next five years, announcing an
estimated 40 million U.S. dollars deal in New York on Wednesday
with Sara Lee/DE and its body care brand Sanex.
</P>
<P>
Financial terms of the deal were not finished, but WTA Tour CEO
Bart McGuire said they were "very, very satisfied" with its deal
with Sanex.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the title sponsor fee that will have the women's
circuit known as the Sanex WTA Tour from January 1, Sanex will
pour additional money into advertising and promotional support.
</P>
<P>
The WTA Tour has been without a title sponsor for a year since
its deal with computer software company Corel elapsed.
</P>
<P>
The deal features an unusual twist, as hospitality and other on-
site benefits at Tour events in North America, 13 in the United
States and three in Canada, will not come to Sanex, which does not
yet market its product in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Frank Meysman, chairman of the Board of Management of Sara Lee/
DE, said that after two years, Sanex had the option to pick up the
North American tournaments in two years.
</P>
<P>
"It is definitely our vision, we would like to have a worldwide
brand called Sanex," Meysman told a news conference, suggesting
that Sanex could exercise its option for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Sanex is now marketed in 20 countries. The WTA Tour plays
tournaments in 28 countries around the world.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Ninety three percent of
Chinese urban residents have followed the WTO negotiations between
China and the United States, getting their news from media
coverage or the Internet, according to a survey conducted hours
after the Sino-US agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Social Survey Institution
affiliated to the National Bureau of Statistics, was based on
questionnaires given to 1,156 residents in major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
About 94 percent of those polled said China deserved the WTO
entry, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More then 80 percent believed China will play a major role in
spurring the development of world economy in the new century with
its huge market potential and significance in international trade.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 per cent said they believed China's WTO entry would
improve their standard of living as they gain access to more goods
with lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 85 percent said they see the deal as
applying pressure on State-owned enterprises and some industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The WTO deal, which came after a 13-year marathon bargaining
process, has triggered nation-wide debate and made the word WTO a
household name almost overnight.

ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday assured
Afghanistan's Taliban militia that it will make every effort to
resolve the issue of transit trade while keeping in view its
implications for Islamabad's economy as well.
</P>
<P>
The assurances were given by Pakistani Minister for Commerce,
Industries and Production Abdul Razak Dawood in a meeting with

All matters would be resolved through mutual consultations,
Dawood said.

A meeting of experts will be held between the two sides
Thursday to discuss the pending issue of Afghan transit trade.
</P>

Imports of 17 items had been banned by Pakistan under the
Afghan transit trade after Pakistani manufacturers complained that
growing smuggling from Afghanistan badly affected the local
industry.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Pakistani government ordered the release of
goods of 101 items, imported by Afghanistan through transit trade
and withheld at the Karachi port, waiving 8 billion rupees (154.7

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The China-US marketing-opening
agreement and the possibility of China's entry into WTO this year
have raised great challenges to the management of local private
enterprises, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuwu, vice-president of the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce, said that private firms would be forced to
restructure and abandon unprofitable products and poor management
in order to survive in the domestic and international competition.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, WTO membership will bring fundamental
changes to China's fledging market-oriented economy by introducing
fiercer competition from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that inefficiency dominates today, however, with the
more and more intense competition, new firms would emerge as the
old ones die out.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that private enterprises concentrate on sectors in
which they have always been successful, including light industry
and services.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises should improve management, invest more in
technological innovation and scientific research to turn into
modern firms, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the WTO membership will bring China into
the multilateral trade order and the mainstream trading community
that sets rules for international trade.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Protests to Britain Over Shipping Incident Near Malvinas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentina lodged a formal
protest Wednesday to the British government over a maritime
incident that occurred close to the Malvinas islands, said a
statement from the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
On November 9, a fishing boat named "Magallanes" flying the
Argentine flag was towed to the islands from international waters
because of mechanical failure. It lay at anchor near the Malvinas
till the next day and was obliged to fly the flag of the presumed
"Malvinas government."
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain have a long-standing dispute over the
sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands, which are known as the
Falkland islands among British residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the two armies fought a 74-day war and Britain
retained control of the islands. On July 14 this year, the
British government lifted the 17-year ban on flights and Argentine
tourists to the islands. However, the sovereignty dispute remains
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's statement, the Argentine government repeated
that it would not accept the illegal occupation of part of its
national territory and does not recognize the so-called "
government" or any symbol representing it.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that the "rescue" mission was politically
motivated, and warned that such procedures violated joint
declarations signed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government urged the British government to adopt
measures to avoid similar incidents, said the statement.

WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-China agreement on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is "
historic" and will strengthen relations between the two countries,
senior U.S. administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a far-reaching agreement," said Sandy Berger, President
Bill Clinton's national security advisor. He made the remark
Tuesday at a press conference in Turkey's capital of Ankara, where
he is accompanying the U.S. president on a visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement is a win for both China and the United
States as well as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's important for the world because China becomes a
part of a rules-based system of trade and agreement that ... will
strengthen the U.S.-China relationship considerably," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the U.S. and China signed an agreement on
China's accession to the WTO on Monday in Beijing after 13 years
of tough negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations came to a halt for a few months after the U.S.-

Embassy in Belgrade last May during a 78-day air campaign against
Yugoslavia.

The U.S. administration officials believe the U.S.-China accord
on China's accession to WTO will be conducive to a stronger
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"It's unquestionably an important step forward," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Susan Esserman told a seminar
at the Cato Institute Wednesday that the U.S.-China agreement is "
a historic agreement that is a win for America's export-related
jobs, for Chinese economic reform, for our global trading system,
and for long-term U.S.-China relations."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement's results first are comprehensive ... China,
like other new WTO members, will reduce its trade barriers to
levels comparable to those of major trading partners, including
some industrial countries," she said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Sets Range For Reported Forex Transactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia deputy governor
Achjar Iljas said the minimum amount of foreign exchange
transactions required to be reported under the newly enacted
foreign exchange monitoring law would be between 5,000 and 10,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the exact amount awaits the conclusion of an intensive
evaluation by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to find an amount level which is just
significant enough economically, but not too low as to
operationally burden the institutions who will do the reporting,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange monitoring law, enacted in May this year,
and attendant regulations require banks and non-bank financial
institutions in the country to report foreign exchange
transactions to the central bank starting next April.
</P>
<P>
Achjar said Bank Indonesia was talking with a number of banks
to discuss an appropriate minimum amount level for reporting
foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
He said a level which was too low would burden banks and other
reporting institutions with administrative work because of the
high volume of transactions.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia has until April to evaluate and determine the
reasonable minimum amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
Achjar said the foreign exchange monitoring system would mainly
provide the central bank with more accurate and timely statistical
data for the country's balance of payments and the flow of capital
records.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the law, Bank Indonesia issued Regulation
No.1/9/1999 on October 28.
</P>
<P>
Banks and non-bank financial institutions must report the
amount and type of transactions, the purpose of transactions, who
ordered the transaction, the name of the counter parties and the
countries where the counter parties are located.
</P>
<P>
Bank and non-bank financial institutions must also report
rupiah transactions with non-Indonesian residents.
</P>
<P>
Achjar said institutions failing to comply with the ruling
would risk incurring penalties. He stressed that Bank Indonesia
did not expect to issue the penalties and hoped all parties would
report their foreign exchange transactions voluntarily.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha
volcano erupted Wednesday afternoon, with a plume of smoke rising
5,000 meters above the volcano and ash raining down on Quito, the
country's capital.
</P>
<P>
The eruption occurred at 14:12 local time, and three hours
later a cloud of volcanic ash shadowed the city.
</P>
<P>
The ash cloud initially began to disperse towards the north-
east of the province of Pichincha and began to fall on the city at
approximately 5 p.m., according to the volcanologists.
</P>
<P>
The volcanic ash was in gray color, indicating that its
chemical makeup was of silicon, said experts with the Geophysical
Institute of Ecuador's National Polytechnic School.
</P>
<P>
The experts confirmed that over the last 24 hours they have
registered 930 seismic movements, 279 subsurface explosions and 47
explosions producing falling rocks.
</P>
<P>
The eruption caused panic among the capital's population, as
the sky was covered by the cloud and people masked their faces
with moist handkerchiefs to protect themselves from the volcanic
ash.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon's eruption of the Guagua Pichincha, 10
kilometers to the east of Quito, is the third largest recorded
since last eruptions on October 5-7.

</P>
<P>
A galloping horse with its right hind foot on a swallow, the

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey snatched a spot in Euro
2000 on Wednesday after a tense 0-0 draw against Ireland which the
hosts should have won comfortably in Bursa, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey won the play-off on the away goals rule following the 1-
1 stalemate in a tight game in Dublin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Though Hakan Sukur and Okan Buruk had chance to score, they
squandered two or three chances each, and Sergen Yalcin ran one-on-
one against Irish goalkeeper Dean Kiely in the last minutes but
fired into his legs.
</P>
<P>
Irish defender Denis Irwin also denied a number of Turkish
attacks in a match that grew more fraught as the end approached.
</P>
<P>
For the Irish, Niall Quinn put a header wide, and Roy Keane
took a few speculative long-range cracks, but neither really
troubled Turkish goalkeeper Rustu Recber or his replacement Ipek
Enginoglu.
</P>
<P>
Turkish coach Mustafa Denizli said: "This is an extremely happy
day for Turkey and for all of us. All our players must now
continue on this path. We now face new duties."
</P>
<P>
The Irish, who worked hard in midfield but rarely broke the
Turkish defence, it was a bitter blow. They have now failed to
reach the last three major tournaments after losing in play-offs.

KIEV, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia tied Ukraine 1-1 in the
Euro 2000 play-offs here on Wednesday to qualify for the finals 3-
2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Miran Pavlin's 79th minute equaliser 10 minutes after Serhiy
Rebrov fired home a penalty sealed Slovenia's first visit to the
finals of a major tournament since the country became independent
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rebrov put Ukraine ahead after fellow striker Andriy Shevchenko
was pulled down inside the box.
</P>
<P>
But Pavlin became the hero of the country which was once part
of Yugoslavia when his long range effort deflected off a defender
and wrong-footed Ukraine goalkeeper Olexander Shovkovsky.

<P>
Ukraine, clear favourites before the play-off, were stunned by
the goal and failed to mount any attacks in the last 10 minutes.

<P>
"It's a tragedy for us," said Ukrainian assistant coach Leanid
Buryak.

Slovenia coach Srecko Katanec said: "It's a great victory for

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Lenny left
two dead and thousands of others homeless on Colombia's Caribbean
coast on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit zone was the Guajira Peninsula, where two people
drowned in the sea, said local police.
</P>

Ranches of the indigenous Wuayu tribe were razed by strong
winds churned by the hurricane, leaving at least 540 families
homeless, according to Colonel Jaime Salcedo, the police chief in
La Guajira.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains, which fell for 48 hours and ended on

including the tourist cities of Cartagena and Santa Marta, which
were hit by five-meter-high waves. Authorities reported that over
3,000 people were left homeless in these two cities.

The hurricane is now located 600 kilometers north-east of the
Colombian coast, heading towards the British Virgin Islands, said
Humberto Gonzalez, chief of the environmental information service

The tail-end of Lenny aggravated the emergency situation

In a move to control sources of industrial pollution and clean

<HEADLINE> England Qualify Despite Losing to Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- England became the 16th and
final team to qualify for next year's European Championships
despite their 1-0 home defeat to aude enemy Scotland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scotland's fully-deserved win on the night was secured by a
39th minute Don Hutchison header but England qualified 2-1 on
aggregate following their 2-0 win at Hampden Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Scotland, who had not beaten England since 1985 and not scored
against them in their previous five matches, were by far the
better, balanced and more enterprising team against England who
were over-run in midfield, played like strangers and did not have
one shot on target in the entire match.
</P>
<P>
Their only salvation was that they just about defended well
enough to stifle the Scottish attack. But goalkeeper David Seaman
had to made one stunning point-blank save from a diving header
from Christian Dailly with 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
The only goal came when Callum Davidson broke on the left, and
sent Neil McCann away as Sol Campbell slipped. McCann crossed high
into the box and Hutchison rose above Tony Adams to head home.
</P>
<P>
That sent the 7,000 Scottish fans into raptures, but in the end
they had to be content with inflicting a first defeat on Kevin
Keegan in his ninth match in charge.

<HEADLINE> Large Ship to Be Sent to Recover EgyptAir Wreckage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A large ship with heavy lift
capability will be sent to the site of the EgyptAir plane crash
for the retrieval of human remains and aircraft wreckage, the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said the U.S. Navy has accomplished its
initial mission to recover the flight recorders from the crash site
and the commander of the Navy's recovery task force will turn over
responsibility of further salvage efforts to the U.S. Navy's
supervisor of salvage on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The supervisor has been directed to contract for a large ship
which can operate in heavy seas, and send it to the accident site
as soon as possible for the retrieval mission.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound Boeing 767-300 jet on EgyptAir 990 crashed into
the Atlantic 60 miles off U.S. southeast 40 minutes after takeoff
from the Kennedy International Airport in New York on October 31,
killing all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and U.S. investigators are continuing probe into the
cause leading to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Since the crash, the Navy, Coast Guard and other agencies have
deployed ten ships, four helicopters and almost 1,000 people in
direct support of on-scene recovery efforts, Hall said.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Wednesday on profit-taking from the strong rally in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 49.24 at
10,883.09. The blue chip index rose 171.58 points Tuesday.

Nasdaq composite index fell 26.13 at 3,269.39.
</P>
<P>
The market fell as investors withdrew money to lock in
profits from the strong rally Tuesday. The Dow rose sharply
while the S&AMP;P reached its new first closing high since July and
the Nasdaq hit its 11th record in 13 trading days in the
previous session after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates
for the third time this year in its determination to ward off
inflation.

Bond prices were also lower, pushing the yield on the
30-year Treasury to 6.12 percent, up from 6.06 percent late
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ministers: Germany Well Prepared for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany has been well prepared
for the millennium computer bug, or the Y2K problem, two ministers
Wednesday said in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
On releasing the second progress report on Y2K preparations,
Economics Minister Werner Mueller and Interior Minister Otto
Schily said, "Germany is fit for the date change" and the
Millennium bug would not cause any significant loss in its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Germany has completed most tests on computers deployed in "a
wide range from business to public sectors" for their "year 2000
stability", so that no serious problem in power supplying, public
transportation, insurance, or telecommunications would appear on
the first day of year 2000, said Mueller.
</P>
<P>
"These include our atomic power stations," he said, adding that
the atomic power stations in east European countries were without
any special risk, either.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is now among those leading nations in terms of Y2K
readiness," said Mueller, stressing, "any kind of over-reaction is
groundless at all."
</P>
<P>
But there are still 60 thousands companies, or 1.8 percent in
Germany's overall 3.3 million enterprises, that have not made any
special preparations for the new millennium, according to Mueller.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or Y2K, arises because many older computers
record dates using only the last two digits of the year. If left
unfixed, the computers could confuse year 2000 with 1900,
generating errors or even system crashes.
</P>
<P>
Schily assured that "every citizen will be able to celebrate
the new millennium safely."
</P>
<P>
However, German government has prepared an emergency plan to
prevent any "theoretical risk", said Schily, quoting that alone in
his ministry there would be a 212-strong emergency group, as well
as more than 1000 police staff, on duty from December 31, 1999
until January 3, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Private management of the port
of Maputo moved a step forward Wednesday with the signing of a
document between the Mozambican government and a consortium led by
the British Mersey Docks and Harbor company.
</P>
<P>
But the exact nature of the document, which was not made
public, is far from clear, the Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the consortium described the document
as "a framework agreement".
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of the Mozambican Government Inter-Agency
Committee, Abilio Portimao, who signed for the Mozambican side,
specifically declared that the document did not constitute an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The signing came after 18 months of negotiations between the
government and the consortium with Mersey Docks and Harbor as the
major shareholder owning 37 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The consortium said it was "committed to investing 50 million
U.S. dollars in a program intended to develop Maputo as a
competitive, quality port operation, which will win traffic back
from South African ports and generate new cargo flows through
Mozambique."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the consortium, Ken Wharton, was optimistic that
his consortium would start "operating in tandem with the current
management" early next year and that the total transfer of
operational responsibility to the consortium would take place in
July, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Neither Portimao nor Wharton would reveal how much the
consortium is willing to pay for an annual lease for the port.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Trans-Equatorian Oil
Pipeline began pumping oil again on Wednesday, after damage caused
by a bomb was repaired, said the state petroleum company of
Ecuador (Petroecuador).
</P>
<P>
Technical teams repaired four meters of the pipeline which had
been destroyed on Tuesday by a bomb, in addition to placing new
supports for the pipeline, said president of Petroecuador Jorge
Pareja.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack paralyzed the pumping of the Trans-Equatorian
Pipeline system (SOTE) and caused the spillage of 36,000 barrels
of crude oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces and the national police have begun
investigations into who placed the bomb, their accomplices and
also the people shielding them.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time attacks have been made on the petroleum
installations of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's damage to the pipeline occurred near the town of Santo
Domingo de los Colorados, 133 kilometers west of the capital
Quito.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, the local currency dipped to 18,100/18,200
against the dollar, falling 4 percent in mid-day trading.
</P>
<P>
The oil line explosion was the latest incident in a a bad run
of luck for Ecuador, which is suffering its worst economic crisis
in decades after being pounded by 1998 El Nino storms, lower
international oil and banana prices and fallout from an
international financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Says Crashed U.N. Plane Violates Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade
Wednesday offered condolences on the crash of a
U.N.-chartered plane last Friday which killed 24
people on board, but said that the flight over
the Serbian province of Kosovo violated the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the U.N.
Security Council, Vladislav Jovanovic, charge
d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United
Nations, conveyed "the commiseration of the
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
over the crash of the United Nations plane in
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has repeatedly protested that
various actions by the U.N. administration of
Kosovo -- including the opening of the airport
at Pristina, the provincial capital, usurp
prerogatives of the Yugoslav Government.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the crash will be established
by investigation, but it should be pointed out
that, regrettably, flights to Kosovo ... are
operated in violation of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The flight also ran counter to the June 10
Security Council resolution, which demands full
respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The flight was "specifically, in disregard
for air traffic norms and regulations for the
implementation of which the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is responsible under relevant
international agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In recalling that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia has, on a number of occasion, called
for its sovereign rights to be respected in its
entire air space, the Government of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia requests the United
Nations civil and security presence in Kosovo
... to bring their flight operations into accord
with the international air traffic obligations
and competencies of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," he added.
</P>
<P>
 By the U.N. presence in Kosovo, Jovanovic
was referring to the U.N. Interim Administrative
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the NATO-led
international peacekeeping force, which began
operations in the Serbian province under the
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a twin turbo-prop ATR-42, crashed
on its way to Pristina from Rome, the seat of
the headquarters of the U.N. World Food Program.
The plane, chartered by the U.N. agency, broke
apart but so far there has been no official explanation
for the crash.

<HEADLINE> Escalation of Rebel Attacks in Colombia Deplorable: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the
Colombian Military Forces Fernando Tapias described on Wednesday
that the escalation of guerrilla war in the country as deplorable.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have attacked
five municipals since Tuesday evening, in the provinces of Tolima,
Cundinamarca and North Santander, resulting in the deaths of at
least 10 policemen, five wounded and three people missing,
according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
President Andres Pastrana has proposed a truce to the guerrilla
movement, as of December 15 and continuing to January 15, in
order that "Colombians could have a moment of tranquility", said
Tapias.
</P>
<P>
However, the guerrilla movement "wish to continue committing acts
of terrorism" expressed the military chief.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the largest rebel group of the country, said on
Monday that they would accept the truce if the government agreed
to rise the minimum wage, refuse military cooperation and resolve
the problem of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
Government and FARC representatives met on Oct.24 discussing
how to bring an end to the 40- year conflict which has up to now
cost the lives of around 400,000 people.

the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made on November 8 by the U.N. special
representative in Kosovo, "constitutes a flagrant violation of the
provisions of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) of June 10,"
which reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government "will not recognize decisions taken by
the international security force (KFOR) or the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in gross
violation of the provisions of the said resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade, which has made its relevant position very clear in
its memorandum on the implementation of the Security Council
resolution, requested that "all such decisions be revoked and that
UNMIK and KFOR be enjoined to implement strictly Security Council
resolution 1244" and relevant documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has repeatedly protested that various actions by the
UNMIK, including the opening of the airport of Pristina, the
provincial capital, and the introduction of foreign currencies
into the province, usurp prerogatives of the Belgrade Government.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Leaves Six Wounded in Medellin </HEADLINE>

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- At least six people
were injured on Wednesday, by the explosion of a bomb in Medellin,
in the east of Colombia, said authorities.
</P>
<P>
It has not yet been determined if the bomb was an act of
vengeance between individuals from the underworld or an act of
terrorism, said the operating director of the national police,
Alfredo Salgado.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred opposite a dwelling in a zone which has
hospitals belonging to the social security and a university.
</P>
<P>
This bomb follows another explosion which occurred in Medellin
on Tuesday, leaving 16 wounded in an attempt to damage the
headquarters of the IV Brigade of the Army, confirmed Salgado.
</P>
<P>
The police chief attributed the explosion on Tuesday to the
urban guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), the largest rebel group of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Radio Chain (RCN), the army detained
three people on suspicion of being involved in the car bomb which
killed 8 people and wounded 40, on November 4th, in Santafe de
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were captured last Saturday by a military patrol
in Zipaquira, 60 kilometers to the north of Santafe de Bogota. No
names were disclosed by the army.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that if the recent bombings were
connected to the underworld, they could be reprisals against the
extradition of detainees to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Head of U.N. Mission in E. Timor Starts Full Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The head of the new
United Nations mission in East Timor started his first full day of
work Wednesday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The top official in the territory is Sergio Vieira de Mello,
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was named by Secretary-General Kofi Annan as his Special
Representative for East Timor and the head of the U.N.
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) soon after the
Security Council endorsed Annan's plan to set up the mission on
October 25.
</P>
<P>
UNTAET was mandated to take charge of all affairs in the
800,000 inhabitant territory until the transition to its
independence is completed in a period of two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said de Mello, who arrived in the capital of Dili
Tuesday, met with the commander of the International Force in East
Timor (INTERFET) Gen. Peter Cosgrove and with the outgoing acting
head of the U.N. mission Ian Martin Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, he met East Timor independence leader Xanana
Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
Indicating the improvement of the security situation in East
Timor, Eckhard said military escorts for de Mello are no longer
required as "all roads in East Timor have been designated as
secure by INTERFET".
</P>
<P>
As a sign of reconstruction, seeds for planting are being
distributed throughout the territory and 15,000 agricultural tool
kits are being distributed this week, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The 9400-strong nearly-two-month-old INTERFET said Wednesday
that it sees Mid-January fit to pass East Timor peacekeeping to
the U.N. with the improvement of the security situation there.
