After the expiration of an ultimatum on Monday to the oil

</P>
<P>
The trains hit each other head-on at 17:45 local time (1545
GMT) at Shirbin station, about 130 kilometers northeast the
Egyptian capital, Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations show that the accident was caused by

Rescue operations are under way to retrieve passengers from
four carriages that were destroyed in the crash.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Opposes Govn't Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National
Constitutional Assembly said here Saturday that it has completed
the drafting of a proposed legal instrument it wants in place
before taking part in the constitutional reform process.
</P>
<P>
Legal task force chairman of the opposition party, Welshman
Ncube said that an extraordinary general meeting of the party
would be held in Harare next Wednesday to discuss the draft before
it was presented to the government.
</P>
<P>
Ncube said this at a party meeting convened to explain why it
turned down the government's invitation to participate in a
commission which would be appointed by President Robert Mugabe to
redraft the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed commission provides for a people-centered and
comprehensive review of the constitution of Zimbabwe and its
eventual adoption through a national referendum," the Zimbabwe
News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
This would provide for the establishment, powers and functions
of the national consitutional commission.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the commission would be irrevocable and it
would be composed of the 150 members of parliament and not less
than 250 various other stakeholders in the country which include
religious groups and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party had argued that it was inappropriate to
proceed with the constitutional reform process under the
provisions and terms of Commissions of Inquiry Act, which formally
repose excessive powers on the state president on both the process
and the result.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants at the meeting were unanimous that the
organization should not join the presidential commission until the
legal framework has been put in place.
</P>
<P>
They were also confident that if the party remains resolute,
the government would give in to its demand for the legal
framework.
</P>
<P>
They said opposition parties must mobilize all Zimbabweans to
reject the method the government wanted to review the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it will go ahead with the process of
redrafting the constitution with those willing to participate.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not reveal the names of the people who had
confirmed to participate in the commission as promised this week.

ADDIS ABABA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, Saturday
expressed his "great shock" over the brutal assassination of
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Salim said that "I am extremely
distressed over the prevailing situation of uncertainty in the
Republic of Niger."
</P>
<P>
Salim also expressed his concern over "an attempt to bring
about political change violently and through unconstitutional
means," appealing to all political and military leaders as well as
the people of Niger to " remain calm in this difficult period of
their national history."
</P>
<P>
He recalled "the decision of OAU Heads of State and Government
during their 33rd Ordinary Session in Harare, Zimbabwe in June
1997, where they took a stand against unconstitutional changes of
government, and declared such changes unacceptable and
inconsistent with Africa's quest for democratization of the
continent."
</P>
<P>
"I wish in particular to urge the political leaders of Niger to

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Fight Against Illegal Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 10 (xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs said here Saturday that measures would be
taken against individuals and private entities that are illegally
sending Ethiopians abroad for employment.
</P>
<P>
"No agency has so far been licensed to engage in such business
and most of the people sent by these illegal agencies are being
victims of violent attacks," sources with the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian News Agency quoted the sources as saying
that several "unqualified" individuals who applied to engage in
employment services since the issuance of the "private employment
agency proclamation" a year ago have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
Information reaching the ministry indicate that the Ethiopians,
 especially young women, who have been sent abroad by the "illegal
 employment agencies", are being abused while some were killed in
violence.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that with the support of the police,
the ministry is taking legal measures against the culprits.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says Weather Against Operation Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A NATO spokesman said here
Saturday that poor weather had some impact on NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia over last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
NATO military spokesman K. Freytag told a news briefing that
the weather "hindered us significantly and affected our
operation". One group of combat aircraft flew and further three
were canceled due to the weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed that a radio relay facility near
Pristina was destroyed among the strategic targets hit by NATO
during Friday night and early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Through a video, the reporters at NATO headquarters watched the
pictures about the pre-and-post strike over the radio relay
station.
</P>
<P>
When asked about military purpose of the bombing against the
radio relay tower in Pristina, Freytag said the relay station has
been used for military end and has become the legitimate military
target. "That's why we took it out."
</P>
<P>
Asked if a mistaken bombing near a main phone exchange center
in Pristina happened because of mistaken information, NATO
political spokesman Jamie Shea said the accurate information
always delayed, and he hopes to get updated information as early
as possible. "It's best for you, and best for me."
</P>
<P>
"One of the bombs targeted on the facility may have span off
and been responsible for damage of surrounding building. However,
I believe that it was clear from the slide shown here, that
everybody could see graphically what it was struck, that the
collateral damage was very, very limited indeed, it was not on a
massive city busting scale, and it was very, very localized
indeed, " Shea said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also talked another reason why the collateral
damage is minor. "Given the fact that so many people have been
forced out Pristina, and I don't think it's any doubt about that,
there are well-documented television picture that showed the city
is close to a ghost town that I have seen recently."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the damage to the civilians would have also been, I
think a harm to civilians, moderate even if, of course, I don't
have an exact figure to give you," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Expansion of Tehran-Pretoria Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nour here on Saturday called for
expansion of political and economic ties between Iran and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the visiting South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo, Nouri said given the great potentials and capabilities
existing in the two countries, the present level of economic
exchanges between Tehran and Pretoria is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that obstacles standing in the way of implementing
the agreements signed between the two countries would be
identified and removed through the concerted efforts of relevant
officials, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Underling the need to harmonize bilateral political and
economic ties, the Iranian speaker said that promoting the level
of parliamentary ties would pave the way for the expansion of
all-out ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the independent policies pursued by South
African President Nelson Mandela on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who arrived here on Thursday to attend the fourth joint
Tehran-Pretoria economic commission, also hoped that the obstacles
standing in the way of implementing the agreements between the two
countries would be removed.
</P>
<P>
He described the close parliamentary ties between the two
countries as "very important" and voiced his country's readiness
to further expand these ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- After seven years of dispute
between Greece and Macedonia, the two neighbors appeared to settle
the thorny name issue over Macedonia this month.
</P>
<P>
Greece had agreed to recognize Macedonia under the name
Republic of Macedonia-Skopje, the Athens daily "The Tribune"
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov would sign the necessary
agreement in New York on April 25.
</P>
<P>
Greece opposes the use of the name "Macedonia" by the former
Yugoslav republic, saying that it implies territorial ambitions
over its own northern region of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Greece imposed a trade embargo over Macedonia and
claimed that relations between the two countries could not be
normalized until the name issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Trade ties between Greece and Macedonia have in recent years
been improved significantly, with Athens now becomes the largest
direct investor in Macedonia, which declared independence in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Face Unprecedented Drought, Officials Warn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior Iranian officials have
warned that Iran would face an unprecedented drought this year,
the most serious one in the past 30 years, as rainfall in the
country falls sharply.
</P>
<P>
"The country is expected to experience water shortages this
year," Deputy Energy Minister for Water Affairs Gholamreza
Manuchehri said on Saturday, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the amount of rainfall in Tehran's watershed
zones has dropped by 50 percent from the figure of last year and
by 20 percent compared to the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
However, water consumption has increased by 4 percent annually
in Tehran over the past 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Agriculture Minister Isa Kalantari on Thursday also
warned that the country would face a shortage of 1.2 billion
cubic meters in water resources for agricultural uses this year.
</P>
<P>
He said at least 15 percent of fertile agricultural lands
located by the Sefidroud river in the agricultural province of
Gilan would not be cultivated this year due to shortage of
water in the Sefidroud Dam.
</P>
<P>
The Aras Dam in Ardebil province and Sefidroud Dam saved water
behind them only to 30 and 60 percent of their capacities
respectively, he said, adding that the dry farming lands of
Ardebil province in northwestern Iran have been completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari called on farmers to adopt measure to reduce their
water consumption and said drilling of deep wells, which has
already started in Gilan province, could help solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> New Clews Found to Assassination of Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The senior Iranian military
commander Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi was gunned down
Saturday morning by an assassin disguised as Tehran city street
cleaner, the evening daily Kayhan reported.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that the assassin fired three shots in his
head when Shirazi was driving out of his house to send his child
to school on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Iranian armed forces, quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), said earlier that Shirazi,
deputy chief of the joint staff of Iranian armed forces, was
killed at 0645 hours local times (0215 GMT) as he left home for
work.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give more details about the assassination
and the identities of the assassin. However, IRNA reported that
the Iranian outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) has
claimed responsibility for the killing.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO said that Shirazi was targeted because he
was responsible for purging and executing military personnel, and
responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of teenagers in
the war with Iraq (1980-88), reports said.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi, born in 1944, served as commander of the Iranian
army's ground forces during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, the main armed Iranian opposition group, has claimed
responsibility for several assassinations in Iran, including
the killing of Assadollah Lajevardi, the former head of Iran's
Prisons Organization in last August.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a main political group which had fought against the
former Iranian shah regime, but it was outlawed in 1981 due to
sharp difference with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched various attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside Iran. In retaliation, the
Iranian armed forces also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq several
times.

KUWAIT CITY, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Ministers of Trade and

The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) monitored here said Trade Minister
Ussama Faqih reviewed with the WTO delegation the outcome of talks
a Saudi delegation recently held in several western countries

</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has concluded, during the past four years, five

the organization.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has been requiring Saudi Arabia to be flexible in its
trade policies to ensure conformation with the terms of
membership.

country would become an effective member of the WTO before the end
of 1999.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Condemns Assassination of Nigerien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Lansana
Kouyate, has strongly condemned the assassination of Nigerien
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Nigeria-based organization quoted Kouyate as
decrying ''this act of violence, and any attempt to seize power
through the use of arms.''
</P>
<P>
Mainassara was killed in an ambush by soldiers at the Niamey
Airport Friday following weeks of electoral dispute in the west
African country of some 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
Peace, progress and development can only be achieved "through a
peaceful and democratic transition process," the ECOWAS leader
noted.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to politicians, the army and the people in Niger to
"unite in ensuring that their country does not fall into a spiral
of violence which can only have negative repercussions for the
populace."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the executive secretary "is in constant
touch with the ECOWAS chairman, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of
Togo, who is monitoring events in Niger with close attention."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Secretary-General of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim are
among world leaders who have expressed concern over the
assassination, considering it a set back to democracy on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerien government reportedly reopened the land
borders Saturday in a fresh sign of normalization one day after
the "unfortunate incident" as it described.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the assassination remained unclear. But the
military sources said that those who killed the president were in
control behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Saturday said that Niamey, capital of the
former French colony was calm with state radio broadcasting Moslem
religious chants in keeping with a one-month declared period of
national mourning for late President Mainassara, who himself
seized power in a military coup in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Russia, NATO "Must Agree to Disagree" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Saturday Russia and Nato will have to agree to disagree
over the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We simply have to accept differences of opinion (with Russia)
over NATO action," Blair told reporters outside his country
residence, Chequers, where he held talks with Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
Blair spoke shortly after Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
told his British counterpart, Robin Cook, in a 45-minute telephone
call that Russia had no intention of becoming involved in any
confrontation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Russians) understand very well the action that we
are taking," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said Russia posed no threat to NATO
countries despite their differences over NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He again ruled out that NATO would send ground troops into
Kosovo to stop Yugoslavia's drive against ethnic Albanians in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Air attacks alone were working and, while all options were
always kept under review, NATO believed its strategy of not
calling in ground forces was right, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a British Foreign Office spokesman said that Cook
assured Ivanov that NATO's action posed no possible threat to
either the security or peace of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Like Russia we would welcome a political settlement (in
Yugoslavia). But it has got to be one that enables the refugees to
return in safety under international protection," Cook was quoted
by the spokesman as saying.

<P>
BONN April 10 (Xinhua)--Amid protest in several cities on
Saturday against NATO air raids and growing doubts inside his
ruling coalition, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder defended the
western military operations.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people Saturday rallied in the northern city of
Hamburg to protest against NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia. The
demonstrators carried placards reading " Stop The War" and "
Withdraw German Forces".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the western industrial city of Stuttgart, about
5,000 people held anti-war demonstration against NATO's hardline
policy in Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
About 50 sitting-in demonstrators blockaded until late Saturday
afternoon the gate of Spangdahlem air base, where thirteen U.S.
F-117 Stealth fighters were stationed for bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis we will be proven right and we will
achieve our goals," Shroeder told the press, adding, "You can not
counter genocide in Yugoslavia with pacifist positions."
</P>
<P>
A special congress of Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD)
was scheduled for Monday, when the traditionalists of the party
were expected to propose a new political solution to Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The pacifist Environment Minister Juergen Trittin of the Greens
Party, the junior partner sharing power with SPD, also expressed
his concern about the effectiveness of the NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
Trittin called for NATO to review its strategy of military
operations, saying, "I can not understand why a heating plant in
Belgrade or civilian installations in Montenegro are being
destroyed."

LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Saturday
rejected the accusations by commander of the west African
peace-keeping force of ECOMOG, Major General Felix Mujakpero,
that it allowed shipment of heavy arms to the rebels in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mubah dismissed as empty
alarm the involvement in the supply of heavy arms to the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) by the Liberian government,
according to a report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
General Mujakpero said in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown
Friday that a Ukrainian-registered cargo aircraft carrying 68 tons
of arms arrived in Burkina Faso and the arms were later
transported to the RUF rebels through Liberian territory.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG force which is mandated to support the Sierra
Leonean government threatened "to strike at all the channels
involved in the movement of heavy arms and ammunitions to the
rebels by land, sea and air."
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has consistently denied supporting the
rebels in the tiny west African country, but countries including
the United States and Britain have backed accusations against it.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year-old conflict in Sierra Leone has resulted a death
toll of more than 20,000 people and forced some 500,000 refugees
to flee to neighboring states.

aircraft will help "expand the number of strikes over any
24-hour-day period." They also provide "more deep strike capacity
as necessary. So, basically it will allow us to increase the
intensity of the air campaign over Kosovo and Yugoslavia," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It could take a month for 24 Apache attack helicopters to
arrive in Albania. Their introduction would mark an escalation of
the war and for the first time allow close-to-the-ground, direct
strikes against Serb troops and tanks during persistent bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also raised the possible need for the president to
call up military reserves because of the additional U.S. aircraft
joining NATO's campaign.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military began moving equipment to Tirana, the
Albanian capital, this weekend in advance of the Apaches, which
will fly there from Germany. But bad weather canceled several of a
few dozen flights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 150 C-17 cargo planes that will transport the
Apache-related equipment to Tirana must compete with hundreds of
flights carrying humanitarian supplies for more than 500,000
ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo. Only one C-17 at a
time can land at Tirana's airfield.
</P>
<P>
NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark requested the Apaches two
weeks ago. They were approved by the Pentagon April 3 and by NATO
on Monday along with a support package of 18 long-range multiple
rocket launchers, two dozen support helicopters, Bradley Fighting
Vehicles and about 2,600 U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said at first the helicopters and support package
would arrive in Albania within 10 days. But the military officials
said Saturday only a few Apaches might be ready then and it could
take 30 days for all 24 Apaches to become operational.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said Clark does not yet need the gunships,
which are vulnerable to the Serbs' still robust anti-aircraft
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen signed Clark's request
Saturday, calling up planes from U.S. bases as well as Atlantic
and Pacific commands to join NATO airstrikes within "a matter of
days," said Charles Wald, a strategic planner for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. Bacon said allies would add more in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. aircraft include 24 F-16CJ fighters, four A-10
"tank killer" aircraft, six EA-6B Prowlers that have radar-jamming
abilities, 39 KC-135 refueling tankers, two DC-10 tankers and
seven C-130 cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
The deployment will bring the U.S. aircraft contribution to
about 480 warplanes out of a total NATO force of nearly 700,
according to Bacon.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, congressional criticism continued against President
Clinton for refusing to consider using ground troops if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Fischer Calls for G8 FM Meeting on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 10 (Xinhua)--German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
Saturday proposed a foreign minister meeting on Kosovo crisis by
the seven western industrial nations (G7) with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is not to placate Russia, but to accept Russia with
earnest as a partner to solve the crisis, Fischer told the
Deutschlandfunk radio.
</P>
<P>
He is now in regular contact with his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov on the idea, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"That means, there must be some political substance for the
minister meeting," Fischer said, adding, "the failure of such a
meeting is worse than not to held it."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister denied that the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia in three weeks was fruitless, saying, "we must decide,
to accept (the Yugoslav President) Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic war
policy or not."
</P>
<P>
The western can achieve its political goal only after there is
some military success, Fischer said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Head Distressed at Assassination of Nigerien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, Saturday
expressed his "great shock" over the brutal assassination of
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Salim said that "I am extremely
distressed over the prevailing situation of uncertainty in the
Republic of Niger."
</P>
<P>
Salim also expressed his concern over "an attempt to bring
about political change violently and through unconstitutional
means," appealing to all political and military leaders as well as
the people of Niger to " remain calm in this difficult period of
their national history."
</P>
<P>
He recalled "the decision of OAU Heads of State and Government
during their 33rd Ordinary Session in Harare, Zimbabwe in June
1997, where they took a stand against unconstitutional changes of
government, and declared such changes unacceptable and
inconsistent with Africa's quest for democratization of the
continent."
</P>
<P>
"I wish in particular to urge the political leaders of Niger to
engage in immediate consultations and dialog in order to ensure
that the laid down constitutional procedures are followed, in
resolving the political crisis that has resulted from the
president's assassination," Salim said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The OAU head also hoped that the people of Niger "will endeavor
to overcome their current crisis and ensure that their country is
returned to the path of constitutional rule and that they will be
able to chart the future through a democratic process."
</P>
<P>
Late President Mainassara was killed in an ambush by coup
soldiers at the Niamey Airport Friday. He was elected as President
of Niger in July 1996.

ADDIS ABABA, April 10 (xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs said here Saturday that measures would be
taken against individuals and private entities that are illegally
sending Ethiopians abroad for employment.
</P>
<P>
"No agency has so far been licensed to engage in such business
and most of the people sent by these illegal agencies are being
victims of violent attacks," sources with the ministry said.
</P>

The official Ethiopian News Agency quoted the sources as saying
that several "unqualified" individuals who applied to engage in
employment services since the issuance of the "private employment
agency proclamation" a year ago have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
Information reaching the ministry indicate that the Ethiopians,
 especially young women, who have been sent abroad by the "illegal
 employment agencies", are being abused while some were killed in
violence.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that with the support of the police,
the ministry is taking legal measures against the culprits.

Sankoh, who is being detained in capital Freetown, will meet his
battlefield commanders in Togo on April 18, Togolese government
officials said in Lome Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the officials disclosed
that the meeting will take place in Kara, the hometown of Togolese
President Gnassinghe Eyadema who is to host the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah announced earlier

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Tries to Find Solution to Niger Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military leader who will step down on May 29 said here
before the closed door meeting that " I have called this meeting
for us to finally discuss and find lasting solutions to the
problem of the Niger Delta."
</P>
<P>
After the expiration of an ultimatum on Monday to the oil
companies operating in Niger Delta area, the youths from 61 jaw
communities seized five barges , four tugboats and one sea track
belonging to oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The onslaught against oil companies in the region took a new
dimension last Wednesday when the militant youths took over 13
flow stations.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the Association of Mobil Spill
Affected Communities, seven flow stations belong to Shell in the
Batan area and the other six in the North Bank oil companies
started after a 40,000 barrels spill took place at Idoho Oit on
January 12 , 1998 , affecting large area of the Niger Delta
region.
</P>
<P>
After paying 20,000 Naira (about 222 U.S. dollars ) to some
victims, Mobil is said to have refused to pay the rest of the 2
billion Naira (about 22 million dollars ) compensation demanded
by the affected communities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year , Nigeria's oil production has been
seriously affected by intermittent disturbances caused by local
youths demanding a greater share of the region's oil revenue for
impoverished farming and fishing communities.
</P>
<P>
Multi-national companies operating joint ventures with
state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation say that a
lasting solution should be founded to solve the dispute in order
to maintain normal oil production in the region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Opposes Govn't Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National
Constitutional Assembly said here Saturday that it has completed
the drafting of a proposed legal instrument it wants in place
before taking part in the constitutional reform process.
</P>
<P>
Legal task force chairman of the opposition party, Welshman
Ncube said that an extraordinary general meeting of the party
would be held in Harare next Wednesday to discuss the draft before
it was presented to the government.
</P>
<P>
Ncube said this at a party meeting convened to explain why it
turned down the government's invitation to participate in a
commission which would be appointed by President Robert Mugabe to
redraft the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed commission provides for a people-centered and
comprehensive review of the constitution of Zimbabwe and its
eventual adoption through a national referendum," the Zimbabwe
News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
This would provide for the establishment, powers and functions
of the national consitutional commission.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the commission would be irrevocable and it
would be composed of the 150 members of parliament and not less
than 250 various other stakeholders in the country which include
religious groups and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party had argued that it was inappropriate to
proceed with the constitutional reform process under the
provisions and terms of Commissions of Inquiry Act, which formally
repose excessive powers on the state president on both the process
and the result.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants at the meeting were unanimous that the
organization should not join the presidential commission until the
legal framework has been put in place.
</P>
<P>
They were also confident that if the party remains resolute,
the government would give in to its demand for the legal
framework.
</P>
<P>
They said opposition parties must mobilize all Zimbabweans to
reject the method the government wanted to review the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it will go ahead with the process of
redrafting the constitution with those willing to participate.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not reveal the names of the people who had
confirmed to participate in the commission as promised this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Lansana
Kouyate, has strongly condemned the assassination of Nigerien
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara.
</P>
<P>
A statement by e of arms.''
</P>
<P>
Mainassara was killed in an ambush by soldiers at the Niamey
Airport Friday following weeks of electoral dispute in the west
African country of some 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
Peace, progress and development can only be achieved "through a
peaceful and democratic transition process," the ECOWAS leader
noted.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to politicians, the army and the people in Niger to
"unite in ensuring that their country does not fall into a spiral
of violence which can only have negative repercussions for the
populace."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the executive secretary "is in constant
touch with the ECOWAS chairman, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of
Togo, who is monitoring events in Niger with close attention."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Secretary-General of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim are
among world leaders who have expressed concern over the
assassination, considering it a set back to democracy on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerien government reportedly reopened the land
borders Saturday in a fresh sign of normalization one day after
the "unfortunate incident" as it described.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the assassination remained unclear. But the
military sources said that those who killed the president were in
control behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Saturday said that Niamey, capital of the
former French colony was calm with state radio broadcasting Moslem
religious chants in keeping with a one-month declared period of
national mourning for late President Mainassara, who himself
seized power in a military coup in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Saturday
rejected the accusations by commander of the west African
peace-keeping force of ECOMOG, Major General Felix Mujakpero,
that it allowed shipment of heavy arms to the rebels in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mubah dismissed as empty
alarm the involvement in the supply of heavy arms to the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) by the Liberian government,
according to a report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
General Mujakpero said in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown
Friday that a Ukrainian-registered cargo aircraft carrying 68 tons
of arms arrived in Burkina Faso and the arms were later
transported to the RUF rebels through Liberian territory.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG force which is mandated to support the Sierra
Leonean government threatened "to strike at all the channels
involved in the movement of heavy arms and ammunitions to the
rebels by land, sea and air."
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has consistently denied supporting the
rebels in the tiny west African country, but countries including
the United States and Britain have backed accusations against it.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year-old conflict in Sierra Leone has resulted a death
toll of more than 20,000 people and forced some 500,000 refugees
to flee to neighboring states.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday welcomed the
decision by the United Nations to suspend sanctions against Libya
after Tripoli handed over two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am jet
bombing.
</P>
<P>
This position was delivered in a statement by Kuwaiti cabinet
after its regular weekly session.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet ministers also praised the mediation efforts,
especially those exerted by Saudi Arabia, South Africa and other
parties, that contributed to political solution to the Lockerbie
issue, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya since 1992
after Libya refused to hand over the two Libyans, Abdul Basset Ali
El-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who were charged of planting
a suitcase bomb that blew up flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland
in 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya turned over the two alleged former intelligence agents
to the U.N. on April 5.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year sanctions were suspended after U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan informed the Security Council of the handover.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects had been extradited to the Netherlands where
they will be tried by two Scottish judges according to Scottish
law.
</P>
<P>
Under Scottish law, their trial should start 110 days after
the extradition and arraignment. It is expected to last up to a
year.

<HEADLINE> Japan Deplores India's Missile Test-Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government Sunday
deplored India's test-launching of a ballistic missile, calling it
"truly regrettable" and "detrimental to the peace and stability in
the region."
</P>
<P>
"It is truly regrettable that India conducted a missile test ...
despite the repeated requests made by Japan against it," Japanese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sadaaki Numata said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The missile testing could be detrimental to the peace and
stability in the region, Numata noted.
</P>
<P>
"Japan earnestly hopes that this missile testing would neither
heighten the tension between India and Pakistan, nor intensify the
nuclear arms and missile development race in the region," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it successfully test-fired earlier
in the day a new version of the Agni ballistic missile, believed
to be nuclear capable with a range of 2,200 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Avian Flu Group Recommends Close Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Special Investigation Group
on Avian Flu met here Sunday to assess the impact of the recent
discovery of influenza A (H9N2), an avian influenza virus, in
humans.
</P>
<P>
The group initially considered that the discovery of the virus
does not appear to pose an imminent major threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
But the group added that several investigations should be
started in case more H9 human cases might appear, as H9 viruses,
similar to other influenza viruses, can change or re-assort and
become more easily transmitted.
</P>
<P>
The situation should therefore be kept under close monitoring
and surveillance, it said.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Department of
Health, Dr. Paul Saw, the meeting, attended by public health
doctors, veterinarians as well as both local and overseas experts
in microbiology and epidemiology, commended the prompt detection
of the two cases in Hong Kong, which reflected the effectiveness
of Hong Kong's influenza surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
The group also expressed satisfaction with the full recovery of
the two girls in Hong Kong found to have contracted influenza A (H
9N2).
</P>
<P>
The virus is usually causing mild symptoms, if any, among birds
and poultry, the group said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, chief of
Epidemiology Section of the Influenza Branch of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, said: "The major
question about the isolation of influenza A (H9N2) virus in humans
is whether they pose a major health risk for people."
</P>
<P>
He suggested investigations should be made on whether there are
other H9N2 infections in people in Hong Kong, the mode of
transmission of the virus to humans, the risk factors of
contracting the virus and the relation between H9 infection in
poultry and in people.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Saw said the Department of Health would coordinate
actions recommended by the Special Investigation Group.
</P>
<P>
The group agreed that chicken and poultry are safe to eat if
they are cooked thoroughly. However, the public are reminded again
to observe good personal hygiene by washing hands thoroughly after
contact with poultry, animals and their excreta.

HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The final of the 350,000-US-

postponed to Monday with third seed Andre Agassi of the United
States leading Germany's Boris Becker 2-0 in the decider.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the only non-German player in the last four and seeking
his first title of the year, fought to 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 with a
stubborn Becker in the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that a Hong Kong Open final is to be
played on Monday. The last time was the 1997 final between
American Michael Chang and Australian Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Agassi conceded no more than three games in every set he played
in the tournament before entering the final, which had been
delayed for over five hours due to intermittent rain after only
two points were played in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who had filed divorce with actress Brook Shields, said
he entered the Hong Kong event and next week's Japan Open because
of the need to "play more tennis." Becker anticipated the chances
are 50-50.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's Major Opposition Demands Pardon for Role in Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda's major opposition party,
the Republican Democratic Party (MDR), has publicly asked for
pardon and apologized for its role in the killings which rocked
Rwanda in the 1960s and culminated into the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
''The MDR demands pardon to all Rwandans for divisive teachings
 by some of its leaders which became the basis of the Hutu
''power'' (faction) and which led them into the 1994 genocide and
massacres,'' Prime Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigema, was quoted
Saturday by the Rwanda News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
''The MDR party re-affirms that those teachings are against the
 principles of democracy and republic of the party,'' he further
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The MDR party condemned some of its leaders who spread the
''genocidal'' teachings and promised to help the government to
bring them to court.
</P>
<P>
The party, also as well as the prime minister, announced
sweeping reforms of the party which buried the past Hutu extremist
ideology of its god- father, the MDR-PALIMEHUTU -- the party for
the emancipation of the Hutu people, which began the massacres of
Tutsis in 1959, and the year which followed.
</P>
<P>
As indicated by Rwigema, reforms within his party began in May
1998 with the setting up of a commission in charge of the
restructuring of the party's statutes, its interpretation of the
history of Rwanda, as well as its flag.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that late last month, a new executive committee
was set up in a special convention which adopted changes.
</P>
<P>
The MDR therefore distanced itself from its god-father the MDR-
PALIMEHUTU and shun for ever the divisive teachings of the past.
It changed its statutes and shifted its colours from the red-black
flag to the red-green one.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the red stood for the blood of the MDR fighters
who spilt their blood to liberate the country from the oppression
of Tutsis and colonists, while black meant ''four centuries'' of
darkness and oppression in which the Tutsis had kept the Hutus.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwigema, the colour red stands for the blood of
all Rwandans which was spilled at all times, and even during the
genocide, while green represents hope for the new reconciled and
unified Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The reforms within the MDR party are in line with other global
changes of all items recalling the tragic past of Rwanda, like the
national anthem, the national flag, and the court of arms, the
names of streets and places which were inspired by the same
divisive ideology.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports 7 Years' Negative Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
financial and manufacturing center, has reported negative
population growth for seventh consecutive year, the municipal
government announced today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Shanghai had 13.075 million people with
residence cards and 14.64 million permanent residents. Birthrates
for permanent residents were 5.2 per thousand in 1998, and the
death rate was 7 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The city has 7 million fewer people than what demographers
estimated before 1963, when the city introduced its family-
planning policy. The success in controlling population growth has
been attributed partly to 1998's per capita GNP, which is equal to
3,400 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city now faces the challenge of solving the problems caused
by a rapidly aging population, as one out of every 6 of its people
is above the age of 60 and it is estimated that the elderly will
account for up to 37 percent of Shanghai's people by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one study has shown that 0.98 percent of the
children below the age of 7 are handicapped. Shanghai has been
making an effort to deal with these problems.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao Beats Liaoning in Chinese Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao Hainiu defeated talent-
teemed Liaoning 2-1 in a home match on Sunday, pulling the biggest
upset in the fifth round of China's first division soccer league.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao, who came into the game as the penultimate team on the
league standings, met strong offense in the first 30 minutes but
the hosts' goalkeeper Jiang Hong performed superbly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made spectacular saves to parry off blasts from
Liaoning's Zhang Yuning, Qu Shengqing and Li Tie.
</P>
<P>
After the goalless first half, Zhou Xin received a pass in the
penalty area in the 54th minute to open the scoring for Qingdao,
who had only two draws and two losses before the game.
</P>
<P>
A Ivanoff header off a corner gave Qingdao a 2-0 lead in the
injury time but in the dying moments Liaoning was consoled when Qu
slotted the ball past Jiang into the net.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, defending champion Dalian Wanda had to come back
from behind twice to tie Shenyang Haishi 2-2 away.
</P>
<P>
The tie was the last straw for Dalian coach Xu Genbao, who
announced his resignation at the post-game press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I want to resign because I can no longer brook it any more,"
Xu said. "The club may perform better if I resign now," said Xu,
whose team only managed four draws and one loss in five rounds
this season.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang netted in the 23rd minute to lead 1-0 but Dalian
levelled the score two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Dalian beefed up their attacks but Shenyang
surged ahead again with a goal in the 76th minute and Dalian had
waited until two minutes from whistle to equalize.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, Chongqing Longxin pulled its first victory this
season by routing hosts Tianjin Taida 2-0. Both goals were scored
in the second half, in the 58th and 85th minute respectively.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Beijing Guo'an succumbed to Guangzhou Songri
1-0 away, Shanghai Shenhua tied with Sichuan Quanxin 1-1 home,
Shandong Taishan upset Jilin Aodong 2-0, while Wuhan beat
Shenzhen 1-0 at home.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Iraq over Assassination of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday lodged strong
protest with the Iraqi government about its support for the
Iranian outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) which
assassinated a senior Iranian commander Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Iraqi charge
d'affaires to Tehran to make the protest, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Director General on Persian Gulf, Ali-Asghar
Khaji, told the Iraqi envoy that such events would leave negative
and irreparable impacts on Tehran-Baghdad relations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Iraqi government to offer its explanations on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief of the joint staff of Iranian armed forces
Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi was gunned down by
unidentified persons Saturday morning as he left home for work.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO later claimed responsibility for the
killing and said that Shirazi was targeted because he was
responsible for purging and executing military personnel, and
responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of teenagers
in the war with Iraq (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Shirazi, born in 1944, served as commander of the Iranian
army's ground forces during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq
Nouri and Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
also slammed the western countries for supporting the MKO.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said those countries, which sheltered the terrorist MKO,
unfortunately encouraged them to commit such crimes by refraining
from adopting serious stands against them.
</P>
<P>
If such countries were really sincere in dealing with
terrorism and the terrorists, they should take practical and open
measures to cope with the terrorists to satisfy the world public
opinion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, one of the main political groups which toppled former
Iranian shah regime, fled into Iraq after it was outlawed in 1981
due to sharp difference with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has claimed responsibility for several assassinations
and bombings inside Iran during the past decades. In retaliation,
the Iranian armed forces also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq
several times.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly accused Baghdad of supporting the MKO,
which Tehran termed as a "terrorist" group.

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and its NATO allies announced a dramatic
buildup in the fleet of aircraft bombarding Yugoslavia Saturday,
boosting the number of allied warplanes deployed for the 18-day-
old Kosovo conflict to more than 600.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton on Saturday hailed a continuing
decline in the number of welfare recipients--at their lowest level
in 30 years-- and announced new regulations intended to give
states more flexibility in moving people off welfare.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With the NATO bombing of Serbia now in its 17th day, a
senior allied diplomat said in Brussels Sunday that the alliance
was prepared to continue the campaign "for many more weeks".
</P>
<P>
-- A secret Air Force inquiry has concluded that it was a
combination of tactics, quick learning and improvisation that
helped the Serbs shoot down a stealth jet two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
-- The Boeing Company and four airlines are seeking an
exemption from Government rules so the Boeing-777 jet can fly
farther from land. The effort has created a dispute with Airbus,
Boeing's only major competitor, as well as a re-evaluation by
safety experts of whether it is still appropriate to set safety
rules governing oceanic flights based on how many engines a plane
has.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- No draw is called and overtime is
frequent in the National Women's Judo Championships here as
organizers were expecting more exciting bouts in the domestic
competition.
</P>
<P>
Judokas who tied in the four-minute regular game are carried
into the overtime, in which the athlete who scores first or has
her opponent penalized wins the match.
</P>
<P>
"This change forces players to put up more attacking strategies,
" said Song Zhaonian, vice president of the Chinese Judo
Association. "Matches became more attractive under the new rule."
</P>
<P>
The sport of judo is not popular in China though it may has
origin in Chinese martial art. Only dozens of audiences watched
the top-level national tournament at the Guilin Sports Stadium in
Guilin, the capital city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Three judges handling a bout take the role to decide the winner
of a match by vote in the international and Olympics competitions
after competitors are tied in the fight.
</P>
<P>
But it is not always easy to draw out the more aggressive side
when a bout is fairly a match-up.
</P>
<P>
"Sometime it is really difficult to grand the victory to player
who fights harder and better in a close match," said Song, who
worked as a judge at the Bangkok Asian Games last December.
</P>
<P>
"The no-draw rule is also a great hit to those judokas who ask
for judges' favor on out-of-competition reasons."
</P>
<P>
Coaches and team officials seems to welcome the change in rule.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing coach said, "My players fought more aggressively in
this tournament than before."
</P>
<P>
Team leader of the Jiangsu Province said, "We always tell our
players to fight hard. We have no difficulty adapting to the new
rule."

<HEADLINE> ABCs Of Macao SAR's Basic Law (23) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 7 in a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will MSAR Government departments be responsible to
corresponding Central People's Government departments?
</P>
<P>
Although the MSAR is a local administrative region directly
under the Central People's Government, it enjoys a high degree of
administrative autonomy and has the power to handle local
administrative affairs on its own in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
MSAR departments are not responsible to the corresponding
Central People's Government departments. MSAR Government
departments are only responsible to the Chief Executive of the
MSAR, who is responsible to both the Central People's Government
and the MSAR, in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a high degree of autonomy in the MSAR, Article 22 of
the Basic Law states that Central People's Government departments
and provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly
under the Central People's Government can not interfere in MSAR
administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
If they wish to set up offices in the MSAR they must obtain the
consent of the MSAR Government and get approval from the Central
People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Offices set up in the MSAR by Central People's Government
departments, or by provinces, autonomous regions, or
municipalities directly under the Central Government and the
personnel of these offices must abide by the laws of the Region. (

<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 24 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the National Security Law apply to the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, only national laws listed in Annex
III to the Basic Law are to apply to the MSAR. The National
Security Law is a national law on independence, unification, and
security, but, because it is not listed in Annex III it does not
apply to the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Macao has long had a capitalist economy and its way of life and
values are different from those of the mainland. But, it is an
administrative region of China and has the obligation to safeguard
China's independence, unification and security. The law is not
listed in Annex III but this does not mean that there is no need
to safeguard national unification and security in the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Article 23 of the Basic Law says that the MSAR is to enact laws
on its own to prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition, or
subversion of the Central People's Government, or the theft of
state secrets, or foreign political organizations from conducting
political activities in the Region, and political organizations in
the region from establishing ties with foreign political
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the MSAR can enact laws on its own that
cover acts that endanger China's independence, unification, and
security. The enactment of these laws is an obligation of the MSAR
to China, and must proceed in accordance with the provisions of
the Basic Law

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regrets India's Test-firing of Agni-II Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Sunday
expressed regret over India's test-firing earlier in the day of
Agni-II, an extended range version of medium-range ballistic
missile.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the U.S. embassy in New Delhi said the
U.S. believed "concrete restraints by India would create a more
positive atmosphere for improving relations among the various
countries concerned and for addressing international
non-proliferation issues."
</P>
<P>
Information and Broadcasting Minister Pramod Mahajan announced
on Sunday that India "successfully launched" a Agni-II missile at
10:00 a.m. (0430 GMT) from Wheeler island in Balasore District,
east state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy statement expressed the hope that India would
provide tangible indications that it was prepared to practice
restraint consistent with its declared intentions.
</P>
<P>
The missile was test-fired exactly 11 months after India
conducted nuclear tests on May 11 last year, indicating an end of
a five-year restraint since the country test-fired its
1,500-km-range Agni-I in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Moscow, a Russian official expressed concern at
the arms race in South Asia in close vicinity of Russia and its
CIS allies in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said almost immediately
after the announcement of the test-firing that Islamabad might
give a "befitting response" to the latest test-firing by India.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern at the test-firing, saying it "introduces
a new weapons system in the subcontinent" and "obviously it is a
matter of concern" for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Japan's foreign ministry said in a statement that the
test-firing threatened regional stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is truly regrettable that India conducted a missile testing
on April 11 despite the repeated requests made by Japan against
it," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Iraq Over Assassination of Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday lodged a strong
protest to the Iraqi government for its support of the Iranian
outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) which assassinated a
senior Iranian commander on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Iraqi charge
d'affaires to Tehran to listen to the protest, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Director General on Persian Gulf Ali-Asghar
Khaji told the Iraqi envoy that such events would leave negative
and irreparable impact on Tehran-Baghdad relations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Iraqi government to offer its explanations
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief of the joint Staff of Iranian armed forces
Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi was gunned down by
unidentified persons at 0645 hours local times (0215 GMT) as
he left home for work.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO later claimed responsibility for the
killing and said Shirazi was targeted because he was
responsible for purging and executing military personnel, and
responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
teenagers in the war with Iraq (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Shirazi, born in 1944, served as commander of the Iranian
army's ground forces during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq
Nouri and the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi also slammed the western countries for supporting the
MKO.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said those countries, which sheltered the terrorist
MKO, unfortunately encouraged them to commit such crimes by
refraining from adopting serious stands against them.
</P>
<P>
If such countries were really sincere in dealing with
terrorism and the terrorists, they should take practical and
open measures to cope with the terrorists to satisfy the
world public opinion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, one of the main political groups which toppled
former Iranian shah regime, fled into Iraq after it was
outlawed in 1981 due to sharp difference with the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has claimed responsibility for several assassinations
and bombings inside Iran during the past decades. In retaliation,
the Iranian armed forces also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq
several times.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly accused Baghdad of supporting the MKO,
which Tehran termed as a "terrorist" group.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Expansion of Tehran-Bonn Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri here on Sunday called for further
expansion of relations between Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iran is willing to expand its relations with Germany on the
basis of mutual respect and preservation of national rights, Nouri
told visiting German special envoy and Head of the Federal
Chancellery Bodo Hombach.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany is a country which has great influence in
Europe and a country which enjoys a special status, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tehran-Bonn relations have undergone ups and downs in recent
years due to the interference of hidden hands who do not favor
promotion of political relations between the two countries, he
said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Terming Hombach's visit to Tehran as "constructive," the
Iranian speaker said that this visit and exchange of visits by
officials of the two countries can prepare a suitable ground for
further promotion of Tehran-Bonn relations.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of relations between
parliaments of Iran and Germany and called for exchange of
parliamentary delegations and formation of a parliamentary
friendship group between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hombach said in reply that his visit to Iran was aimed at
announcing his country's willingness to expand all-out relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The German official, who arrived here Saturday to submit a
visit invitation of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, also expressed hope that parliamentary
delegations would be exchanged between the two countries in order
to get familiar with each other's outlooks.

LUSAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Five Zambian government officials,
a Senegalese national and some street vendors have been arrested
in connection with a racket making and uttering false road
licenses.
</P>
<P>
The arrested government officials are from the Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC), Government Printers, Road Traffic Commission
(RTC) and the Road Safety Council, Sunday Times of Zambia
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, others involved in the racket are
a Senegalese national and some street vendors in Lusaka, the
capital, and Ndola and Kitwe in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The officials were arrested on the charge of making and
uttering false documents and obtaining a large amount of money by
false pretenses.
</P>
<P>
All the accused are expected to appear in court soon.
</P>
<P>
The government has lost billions of kwacha (millions of U.S.
dollars) in the racket, over which Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
recently raised concern because of the RTC's failure to meet
expected revenue targets from the sale of road licenses.
</P>
<P>
Out of an expected 10-billion-kwacha revenue for the first
quarter licences, only one billion kwacha was realized.
Investigations into the matter were made when it was discovered

licenses.

KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Four people were injured in a
bomb blast near Kakivubo Stadium in downtown of Uganda's capital,
Saturday evening, Police Spokesman Bog Ngobi told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Sunday morning in Kampala, Ngobi said:
"One was seriously injured in the blast and all the four injured
were rushed to Mulago hospital for treatment immediately after
police arrived at the scene."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure whether there were more injuries. But only four
were injured by last evening. We have not made any arrest nor
have we established the motivation behind the explosion," he
added.

Evening commuters and soccer lovers scampered for cover when an
 explosive device ripped through a shopping area around the New
Taxi Park.
</P>
<P>
Alice Namugabo, 48, who came to visit her daughter, lost her
left eye.
</P>
<P>
Police soon cordoned off the area and preliminary
investigations had found a shattered time device that indicated
the explosive was an improvised time bomb.
</P>
<P>
Security sources suspected that the bomb was originally
intended to go off during or shortly after the Uganda-Tunisia
match in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
This is the second blast that happened in the capital city this
year. On February 14, the Valentine's Day celebrations were
violently interrupted by two bomb blasts at a suburb of

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Decides to Cut Ties With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe Africa
National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) decided at its last
politburo meeting in capital Harare to cut ties with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank after
repeated trips to Washington for support over the past few months
yielded nothing, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Natan Shamuyarire, ZANU-PF secretary for information and
publicity, who is also Minister of Industry and Commerce, told the
Sunday Mail that after careful consideration, the party had
decided that Zimbabwe should seek alternative sources of funding
its programs.
</P>
<P>
Both the IMF and the World Bank, major backers of Zimbabwe's
economic reforms for the past seven years, had made unrealistic
demands on the Zimbabwean government as a prerequisite for
releasing balance of payment support and financing energy
development projects, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Research On Genetic Disease (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy to make disease-
related genetic research the center of its Human Genome Project (
HGP) is the correct course, according to one of HGP's major
researchers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have cloned genes that cause hearing loss
and exostosis, an abnormal bony growth on the surface of a bone,
and have made progress in research on leukemia and cancer of the
esophagus, liver, and nasopharynx area.
</P>
<P>
Some research findings have been reported in scientific
journals like Nature, Nature Genetics, and Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences of the United States, according to
Professor Chen Zhu, the director of a national HGP center in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The findings are expected to benefit health studies and the bio-
pharmaceutical industry in the next century, he says.
</P>
<P>
Global HGP research started in the United States in 1990. In 2
or 3 years scientists will try to identify all 100,000 human genes
and interpret their genetic codes. Only a small part of these
genes are useful to the study of disease, but they have enormous
potential for the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
When China's HGP program began some 5 years ago, researchers
had little technology and funding and decided not to follow the
path of their western counterparts who intended to map and
sequence all human genes, a multi-billion-dollar project which
could match the moon-landing program in scale.
</P>
<P>
China's HGP strategy was mainly to identify disease-related
genes to make use of China's advantages to develop genetic weapons
against major illnesses, Chen explains.

<P>
The advantage he refers to is China's large amount of genetic
resources because of its numerous ethnic groups living separately.
</P>
<P>
While cancer, respiratory diseases, cerebral vascular illness,
and heart disease are the major killers in China, depression,
hypertension, diabetes, and diseases of the elderly pose new
threats. Some illnesses with particular high incidences in China,
such as cancer of the liver, esophagus, and nasopharynx passages,
viral hepatitis and some hereditary diseases are pushing
scientists to look for gene-based therapies.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the past, China's HGP is getting increased policy and
financial backing. There have been HGP centers in Shanghai and
Beijing since last year that focus on identifying and cloning
genes related to liver cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and
other diseases. Some 30 laboratories are also involved in the
sequencing and analysis of human genes.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his colleagues are increasing genetic material
collections of DNA samples and establishing more cell lines. Last
year, the government restricted the removal of human genome
resources from China and began encouraging Sino-overseas
cooperation in genetics with shared intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we can find 1,000 disease-related genes by the
year 2001, and identify and clone the functional genes linked to 5-
to-10 major diseases," Chen says.
</P>
<P>
"A report in Nature last year described China's human genome
research as 'set to take off'," he says, "now the challenge for us
is how far we can fly."

SHENYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda coach Xu Genbao
announced he would resign following Sunday's 2-2 draw here with
Shenyang Haishi in China's professional soccer league.
</P>
<P>
Xu, a former national coach, said at the post-game press
conference he could not stand the huge pressure upon him.
</P>
<P>
"I want to resign because I can no longer brook it any more,"
Xu said after the defending champion had to rely on a goal two
minutes from time to grab a tie.
</P>
<P>
"The club may perform better if I resign now," said Xu, whose
team only managed four draws and one loss in five rounds this
season.
</P>
<P>
Club sources told Xinhua that Xu had told club management
before the match that he may resign if the result here turned
unsatisfactory. Now the club needed time to study Xu's decision.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 55, began to instruct the team in February, 1998 and guided
the club to league championship last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Regional Poverty Relief Cooperation Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao says that
cooperation in getting rid of poverty by more developed eastern
parts of the country and underdeveloped western parts is achieving
success.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a national conference on inter-regional
poverty relief that was held on April 9 in Guiyang, the capital of
Guizhou Province, where he urged the provinces and cities involved
to increase cooperation and to focus on improving the ecology and
solving food and clothing problems.
</P>
<P>
Wen is head of the State Council's Poverty-Eradication and
Development Leading Group. He said that in 1996 the State Council
drew up a program whereby 9 provinces and municipalities and four
cities with provincial economic decision-making power in the east
will assist 10 provinces and autonomous regions in the west.
</P>
<P>
Wen says that the program has far-reaching effects on economic
development and social progress in the poor areas and has provided
opportunities for economic development there. The two partners
need to carry out the program for mutual benefits in accordance
with market forces, he says.
</P>
<P>
China's goal to apply the national poverty-elimination plan,
whose pledge is to wipe out poverty in rural areas by 2000. The
developed areas have donated funds and material worth over one
billion yuan to the underdeveloped partners. They have reached
agreements on 2,600 projects involving 4 billion yuan in
investment.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 laborers from the western provinces and autonomous
regions have come to work in the eastern provinces and cities,
where they have earned more than 800 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rule Out New Talks With Rivals This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban militia have ruled
out the possibility of a new round of peace talks this month with
the rival northern alliance, the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Abdul Hai Muttmain, the Taliban's senior official
responsible for information, APP said in a report from Afghanistan
that the U.N.-sponsored peace talks last month was a failure as
the opposition has been on the offensive on the battlefield since
then.
</P>
<P>
Abdul said the Taliban's Supreme Council will decide whether to
continue peace talks with the northern-based alliance, but
certainly not this month.
</P>
<P>
"Only our supreme council can decide to resume talks with the
opposition. And it has not yet given the permission," said Abdul
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the last round of talks held in the Turkmen capital
Ashgabad, the two Afghan warring factions agreed to hold a second
round of talks inside Afghanistan at a mutually-agreed date.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. had hinted that the new round of talks will be held in
April.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to form a broad-based government to
restore peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
But soon after the talks, fighting started between the two
rivals on several fronts with each accusing the other of flouting
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Free Second Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Front
(NDF) on Sunday freed a Philippine army officer in Surigao del
Sur, the Southern Philippines, two days after it released a
policeman, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Army Sgt. Alipio Lozada was freed by the New People's Army
(NPA), the armed wing of the NDF, in an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lieutenant General Angelo Reyes, army
commander in the south, as saying that Lozada was turned over by
NPA operators to a group of humanitarian peace mission, which
facilitated the release.
</P>
<P>
"With the release of Lozada, we are looking forward for the NPA
to set free (Brig.) General victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo
Montealto," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lozada was captured by elements of the New People's Army after
an encounter near Tandag, Surigao del Sur, on March 5.
</P>
<P>
He is the second captive released by the New People's Army
within a week. The first was Chief Insp. Roberto Bernal who was
freed in Sorsogon Friday after 47 days of captivity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the NDF described Lozada's release as a
confidence-building measure and said it would pave the way for its
resumption of peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
During the last two months, the New People's Army abducted four
police and army officers, in addition to the one captured by the
group last year, demanding exchange of prisoners of war with the
government.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada suspended indefinitely peace talks
with the NDF last month after the abductions took place.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations by a third group led by church leaders, the
NDF promised to release all the five by April 19.
</P>
<P>
The government has welcomed the NDF move and expressed its
readiness to resume peace talks with the rebel group if it
releases all the hostages safely.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Parliamentary Union (
IPU) inaugurated its 101st conference on Sunday as
parliamentarians from 136 countries all over the world gathered
here in Brussels to discuss issues of common concern on the eve of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During their debates at the European Parliament, the European
Union (EU)'s main branch, the representatives will focus, in
particular, on parliamentary action to encourage all countries to
sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to encourage
universal and non-discriminatory nuclear non-proliferation
measures and to work toward the eventual elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the problem of metropolitan areas, a
global issue parliamentarians must respond in terms of urban
civilization and democracy, according to the agenda of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The IPU sources said it is also possible to add to its agenda
an emergency supplementary item relating to the event of
particular international importance which occurred in the month
before or during the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Parliament has put forward a proposal in
this regard: "The situation in the Balkans and parliamentarians'
role in putting an end to the escalation of the NATO aggression
against Yugoslavia and in normalizing the situation in the region".
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Belgian Federal Parliament, the week-
long IPU conference is hosting some 1,000 international delegates.
More than 600 parliamentarians, including 139 women, were

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 Serbians rallied in
central Sydney Sunday, urging the Australian government to take
steps to stop the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Serbian National Federation spokesman Ilija Glisic said NATO's
air strikes must be stopped and Albanian refugees "relocated" back
to Kosovo, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Television
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We're asking for Australia to do what it can to stop the
bombing and resume the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
A girl was shown reading her letter to U.S. President Bill
Clinton. With tears rolling off her face, the Serbian girl said:
"Even if one side is wrong, you are punishing two sides: the
Albanians and Serbians."
</P>
<P>
Sunday's peaceful rally was in stark contrast to the one held
two weeks ago in Martin Place in Sydney's central business
district where protesters pelted police with concrete and damaged
property.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police were deployed Sunday around the Domain where
the rally was held and more than 50 Serbian National Federation
officials wore clearly marked T-shirts in an effort to keep order.
</P>
<P>
Peter Ryan, police commissioner of New South Wales state, of
which Sydney is capital, oversaw the police operation, involving
plain clothes detectives and a helicopter which hovered over the
site for most of the rally.
</P>
<P>
Glisic described the heavy police presence as an overreaction
and a waste of taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Australian government's handling of the
Yugoslav crisis and said Australia's Serbian community leaders
were "disappointed" after holding talks with federal ministers and
the opposition.

Savad Shirazi was gunned down by unidentified men in northern
Tehran Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO has claimed responsibility for the killing,
saying Shirazi was targeted because he was held accountable for
purging and executing military personnel, and for the death of
hundreds of thousands of teenagers in the war with Iraq in 1980 to
1988.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi also
expressed regret over the "contradictory stands of some western
countries on the evil phenomenon of terrorism and the
contradiction in their beliefs and performance."
</P>
<P>
Expressing abhorrence towards the MKO's terrorist act in
killing the Iranian commander, Asefi said those countries, who
sheltered the terrorist group MKO, unfortunately encouraged them
to commit such crimes by refraining from adopting serious stands
against them.
</P>
<P>
If such countries were really sincere in dealing with
terrorism and terrorists, they should take practical and open
measures in this regard to satisfy the world public opinion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that there was no longer any
justification for some western countries to neglect the MKO
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi, born in 1944, served as commander of the Iranian
army's ground forces during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a main armed Iranian opposition group, has claimed
responsibility for several assassinations in Iran, including the
killing of Assadollah Lajevardi, the former head of Iran's
Prisons Organization last August.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, also a main political group which had fought against
the former Iranian shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 due to sharp
differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched various attacks on
Iranian targets inside and outside Iran. In retaliation, the
Iranian armed forces also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq several
times.

<HEADLINE> NATO "Turning The Screw" On Milosevic: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The latest NATO deployments in the
Balkans are intended to "turn the screw" on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are pilling on the pressure," Cook told the BBC. "We can
keep going longer than his war machine can."
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that unity among the NATO allies had
strengthened as the air campaign lengthened.
</P>
<P>
Cook insisted that Yugoslav forces were being weakened by NATO
attacks, saying Serbian forces were low on fuel and communication
centers had been hit so hard that field commanders now had to
communicate by mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of ground forces being sent in to impose a
peace, Cook said it would take two to three months to assemble
such a force.
</P>
<P>
"A ground war would involve a lot more casualties than the air
campaign on both sides. I think those who are perhaps rather
lightly calling for ground troops should reflect whether they
would still support it once the casualties started to mount," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that Britain will almost double its forces
committed to Kosovo with the announcement Sunday that the aircraft
carrier Invincible is to be deployed off the coast of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Deeply Concerned over India's Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Sunday promptly
reacted to an Indian missile test and said it was deeply concerned
over the fresh action by India.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said India's development
of Agni-II missile, an intermediate range ballistic missile,
introduces a new weapon system in the region which is "naturally a
matter of deep concern for Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said India was continuously engaged in massive acquisition
of weaponry from all sources in addition to its large indigenous
production and that the Indian armament acquisitions are
aggravating the conventional imbalance which already exists
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The development of Agni-II adds to our concerns and threat to
our security," the spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
India said it successfully test-fired Agni-II missile at 10:00
a.m. (0430 GMT) on Sunday from Wheeler island in Balasore
District, east state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the 20-meter long missile, with a range of
2,000 kilometers and capability to carry either conventional or
nuclear warheads, can strike any target in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan also complained that India failed to provide it timely
and sufficient information in advance.
</P>
<P>
"We were informed about the test only two days ago in response
to an inquiry by our High Commissioner in New Delhi. While
confirming their intention to test, the Indian side did not
provide information about the time or date for the test," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed
in Lahore in February this year obliged the two countries to
provide advance notification to each other in the event of a
planned test.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan is
obliged to maintain a deterrence in the interest of its security
and peace and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our indigenous missile program is part of this deterrence," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Leaves for Albania, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here Sunday that Turkey will expend all efforts to
overcome the problems Albania and Macedonia are facing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at Ankara airport before leaving
for the two countries, Demirel said that his one-day visit will
stress the solidarity of Turkey with Kosovar refugees who are in
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I believe that my visit is a timely opportunity
to show the support we extend to them and to stress the importance
Turkey attributes to the stability and tranquility of Albania
which we have perfect relations in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president said that he will discuss coordination
of humanitarian aid which Turkey started during the meetings with
the leaders of Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Demirel will visit the camps of Kosovar refugees and get
information about the works underway during his trip in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that today's most important problem was to
provide the transitory sheltering for refugees under the best
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Massive exodus of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, a Serbian
province in Yugoslavia, started following the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization unleased fierce air strikes against
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
NATO wanted to bomb the Yugoslav government into accepting a
peace deal with separatist ethnic Albanians and allowing foreign
troops to be stationed in Kosovo to enforce the agreement.
</P>
<P>
More and more Kosovar refugees are streaming into neighboring
Albania and Macedonia, causing a grave humanitarian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Accepts Invitation to Visit Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday accepted an invitation from German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder to visit Germany.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the invitation from visiting German special
envoy Bodo Hombach, Khatami said that he would visit Germany at
"an appropriate time."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that a new stage has started in relations
between Iran and Germany," he told Hombach, also Head of the
Federal Chancellery who arrived here Saturday, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami assured the German official that Iran is determined to
expand its relations with other countries based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Calling for promotion of political, economic and cultural ties
between Iran and Germany, he said that "when logic rules over
relations, every problem would be resolved."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Tehran and Bonn have been cooled down since
April 1997, after a Berlin court accused Iranian leaders of
sponsoring terrorist activities against Iranian dissidents in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
A possible rapprochement between the two sides was then blocked
by an Iranian death sentence on German businessman Helmut Hofer
for having "illegal" sexual relations with an Iranian Muslim
woman.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was sentenced to death in January 1998 under Iranian law,
which bans non-Muslim men from having any sexual relations with
Muslim women. Hofer rejected the charges and claimed that he had
converted to Islam before meeting the woman.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Judiciary released Hofer on bail Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Tehran and Bonn have reached a
compromise over Hofer's case and Hofer would be deported from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, an Iranian judicial official said on Sunday that the
57-year-old German businessman would not be allowed to leave Iran
and he would be brought back for retrial.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that relations between the two countries
would be warmed up following the settlement of Hofer's case,
since Germany is Iran's biggest trading partner.

Philippines, following its release of a police officer two days
ago, according to a local television report.

<P>
According to SNN television, Army Sgt. Alipio Lozada was freed

He is the second captive released by the New People's Army
within a week. The first was Chief Insp. Roberto Bernal who was
freed in Sorsogon Friday after 47 days of captivity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Enact Law to Protect Local Musicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
enforce the copyright law to protect Kenyan music industry from
being exploited by the media and entertainment agencies, Kenyan
Information and Broadcasting Minister Joseph Nyagah has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Nyagah said the government measures would cover music played
by the Kenyan Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) and other
broadcasting houses which owed the local industry a lot of money,
the Herald newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nyagah urged broadcasting houses and entertainment agencies to
pay musicians royalties as they were making enough money to pay
them.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) accused
Media Owners Association for failing to pay their annual fee
totalling 120 million shillings (nearly two million U.S. dollars)
it owed the music industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the KBC denied immediately that it owed the society of
millions of shillings.
</P>
<P>
"The money the radio and entertainment agencies make is enough
to pay musicians promptly on time. There is no reason why the
musicians should not be paid on time," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Musicians end up suffering because some people don't want to
pay them royalties. This should stop," Nyagah said.
</P>
<P>
He commended the MCSK for its efforts in trying to eliminate
and control piracy in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia welcomes the trade
breakthrough made by China and United States over the weekend, a
leading Australian official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tim Fischer, Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade
Minister, said the trade deal moved China a step closer to joining
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"These new Chinese offers are of great potential value to
Australian exporters and point the way to acceptable outcomes for
the unresolved trade issues of importance to Australia, which
include access for sugar and wool," the deputy prime minister said
in a statement received by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I will pursue these outstanding issues when I visit China next
month," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Fischer said he expects China now to move
progressively to resolve outstanding issues with other WTO members,
including Australia, so that China could enter the WTO later this
year.
</P>
<P>
"(The Australian federal) Cabinet this week authorized me to
push ahead with Australia's negotiations with China, and I remain
hopeful of a successful outcome when I visit China next month," he
said in a separate statement last week, commenting on the progress
made China and the United States in their trade talks.
</P>
<P>
He said he was encouraged by the details of the U.S.-China
trade pact, including improved market access for agriculture,
industrial tariff cuts, information technology and services.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued over the weekend, U.S. President
Bill Clinton and visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, said the U.S.
supports China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
They undertook that further negotiations designed to solve the
remaining trade issues between the two countries would be
concluded by the end of this year, paving the way for China's
accession by the end of this year.

LUSAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Five Zambian government officials,
a Senegalese national and some street vendors have been arrested
in connection with a racket making and uttering false road
licenses.
</P>
<P>
The arrested government officials are from the Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC), Government Printers, Road Traffic Commission
(RTC) and the Road Safety Council, Sunday Times of Zambia
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, others involved in the racket are
a Senegalese national and some street vendors in Lusaka, the
capital, and Ndola and Kitwe in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The officials were arrested on the charge of making and
uttering false documents and obtaining a large amount of money by
false pretenses.
</P>
<P>
All the accused are expected to appear in court soon.
</P>
<P>
The government has lost billions of kwacha (millions of U.S.
dollars) in the racket, over which Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
recently raised concern because of the RTC's failure to meet
expected revenue targets from the sale of road licenses.
</P>
<P>
Out of an expected 10-billion-kwacha revenue for the first
quarter licences, only one billion kwacha was realized.
Investigations into the matter were made when it was discovered
that many motor vehicles were displaying fake versions of the road
licenses.

<HEADLINE> Leading Trade Firm Strives to Expand Exports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The China National Cereals, Oils
and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation (COFCO), one of the
country's largest foreign trade firms, has urged its employees to
try "a thousand and one ways" to expand exports in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Mingchen, chairman and president of the corporation, said
COFCO will explore every possible means to "maintain export growth
" this year in the face of "a much more severe export situation
than expected."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not optimistic in spite of last year's good results," said
Zhou in an interview with Xinhua. "The financial crisis has
reduced the purchase capacity of southeast Asian nations, and has
at the same time increased the competitiveness of their export
products. This year's difficulties related to exports will be much
more serious than we anticipated."
</P>
<P>
COFCO has been listed as one of the top 500 strongest companies
in the world for three consecutive years. The corporation's 1998
export volume surpassed 2.40 billion US dollars, up 19 percent on
1997 and a record volume since 1988. COFCO accounted for 1.3
percent of China's overall exports for last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said COFCO will attempt to increase exports by actively
engaging in processing, barter, counter and border trade, as well
as various other traditional trade forms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that COFCO will maintain and cultivate traditional
export market such as Europe, the United States, Japan and
Southeast Asia, and will simultaneously accelerate efforts to
explore potential markets such as Russia, Africa, the Middle East
and Latin America.

"We will do our best to ensure the steady growth of 10-12 main
export products and will also develop new products and channels
for exports," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, COFCO has dispatched representatives
to fruit, rice and meat production areas to scout for new export
products. Zhou said the corporation's goal is to reduce costs and
raise the quality of products.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to cultivate new growth points for exports yielded
positive results in the first quarter of the year, according to
Zhou. Exports of peanuts and peanut kernel have witnessed
noticeable growth in the wake of sluggish markets over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted that exports of sesame and boiled bamboo shoots have
increased sharply.

JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon denied on Saturday that the attempts to
strengthen relations with Russia at this point were conceived
as a way to garner support from the Russian immigrant
community in Israel for the ruling Likud Party before the May
elections. Sharon's office issued a statement on Saturday, saying
that Sharon's scheduled visit to Moscow is aimed at exerting
pressure so as to stop the Russian technology leakage to Iran
and improving the ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said on Friday that
he plans to reduce the Israeli military's presence in southern
Lebanon and transfer many of the military's positions to the
pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army. Arens said that the plan is
aimed at reducing the risk to Israeli soldiers stationed in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Palestinian fishermen were wounded on Saturday when
they were shot by an Israel Navy patrol boat off the coast

<HEADLINE> German Businessman Released on Bail in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The German businessman Helmut
Hofer, who was sentenced to death in Iran for illegal sexual
relationship with a Muslim woman, was released on bail from
prison Saturday night, an Iranian judicial official announced on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The release came hours after German special envoy and
Chancellery Minister Bodo Hombach arrived here Saturday morning to
discuss Hofer's case and bilateral relations with Iranian
officials.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder last November appointed
Hombach as his special envoy in charge of Hofer's case and Bonn
has repeatedly called on Tehran to set Hofer free.
</P>
<P>
Director of Public Relations Office of the Iranian Judiciary
Fotowat Nassiri Savadkouhi told the Islamic Republic News Agency
that Hofer was released on a bail of 500 million rials (about
166,000 U.S. dollars) pending the convening of his next court
session.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer will not be allowed to leave Iran until his
trial reopens, the official said, but he did not disclose the
exact date of retrial.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September, 1997 at Tehran international
airport upon his arrival from Germany with an Iranian woman who
was waiting for him. He was sentenced to death by a local court in
Tehran for illicit sexual relationship in January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian law, non-Muslim men are forbidden to have
any sexual relations with Muslim women. Hofer appealed the court
ruling by claiming that he had converted to Islam before meeting
the Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Supreme Court in December rejected the sentence on
Hofer and returned the case to local court for retrial.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Thursday announced to grant a release on bail to the
57-year-old German businessman with the consideration of the need
for further investigation and the period Hofer has been jailed.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been Iran's biggest trading partner, but their
relations have been strained since April, 1997 after a Berlin
court accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring terrorist
assassinations against Iranian dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence against the German businessman blocked a
rapprochement between Tehran and Bonn.

<HEADLINE> Post-Jordan Bulls Slumps to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls earned a
place in the NBA history books as they were held to the lowest
point total since the advent of the shot clock by the Miami Heat
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, six-time NBA champions in the 1990s with retired
Micheal Jordan leading the way, became the first team since the
advent of the shot clock in 1954 to fail to break 50 points,
suffering a humiliating 82-49 loss to the Heat.
</P>
<P>
The post-Jordan Bulls also set an NBA record for fewest baskets
made with just 18. They shot a woeful 23 percent (18-of-77),
including 0-of-9 from 3-point range, and made only 13-of-24 free
throws.
</P>
<P>
In the laugher Miami scored the game's first 15 points and
things just got worse for Chicago, which managed a mere eight
points in the first quarter and 10 in the third.
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, rookie Pat Garrity scored 25 points and Cliff
Robinson added 22 as the Suns hammered San Antonio Spurs 110-84 to
cut their six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Chris Webber posted his league-leading 32nd
double-double of the season with 23 points and 11 rebounds as the
Kings beat the Denver Nuggets 110-104.
</P>
<P>
At Indiana, Bobby Phills hit a 15-foot jumper with 39 seconds
left to lift the Charlotte Hornets to a 92-90 win over the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Rasheed Wallace scored 19 points off the bench
to lead four Portland players in double figures as the league-
leading Trail Blazers fought back with their smothering defence to
record a 97-70 rout of the league-worst Clippers.
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, Shawn Kemp had 24 points and 12 rebounds and the
Cavaliers shut down the Atlanta in the first quarter on the way to
a 81-67 victory over the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, Terry Cummings sank the go-ahead jumper with 35
seconds left and blocked Gary Trent's potential winning shot at
the buzzer as the Golden State Warriors held on for a 91-90
victory over the Mavericks.

<HEADLINE> India Testfires Agni-II Ballistic Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- India successfully test-fired
advanced Agni-II, an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM),
Information and Broadcasting Minister Pramod Mahajan announced
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as "a historic feat," Mahajan said the extended
range IRBM was "successfully launched" at 10:00 local time on
Sunday from Wheeler island in Balasore District, east state of
Orissa.
</P>
<P>
The missile was test-fired exactly 11 months after India
conducted nuclear tests on May 11 last year, indicating an end of
a five-year restraint since the country test-fired its
1,500-km-range Agni-I in 1994.
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman said that India took neighboring Pakistan
into confidence about the test firing as under the "Lahore
Declaration" signed between prime ministers of the two countries
last February, both had agreed to inform each other before
test-firing any missile.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the India government had informed Pakistan about
its plan to test-fire Agni-II missile, Mahajan said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said almost
immediately after the announcement of the test firing that
Islamabad might give a "befitting response" to the latest
test-firing by India.
</P>
<P>
Agni, a re-entry missile system which goes into stratosphere
before coming down on its target, is capable of carrying both
conventional and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The 20-meter long missile, weighing 16 tons, is capable of
carrying a 1,000-kg warhead.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the test-firing has established
critical technologies associated with design, development and
production of long range missile system.
</P>
<P>
Agni-II is part of India's integrated guided missile
development program, other versions include surface-to-surface
"Prithvi", surface-to-air "Aakash" and "Trishul", and anti-tank
"Nag".

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Predicted to Grow 4 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines should expect to
see significant gross national product (GDP) growth this year from
3.5 to 4 percent, presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Subic, about 80 kilometers north of
Manila, Barican attributed the significant growth to the
"pump-priming" activities the government has been undertaking over
the previous months to create "a very vital factor to the
Philippine economy."
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Barican quoted Budget Secretary Benjamin
Diokno as saying that among the countries affected by the currency
crisis that began in mid-1997, the Philippines was not as affected
as the rest of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But due to the effect of the crisis and bad weather, the
country's GNP only grew 0.1 percent in 1998, while its gross
domestic product shrank by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that the government is concentrating on bringing
back investor confidence to the country to prevent net losses in
businesses here.
</P>
<P>
Barican also said the administration of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority, which oversees the development of the
55,000-hectare freeport land area, is doing a good job towards the
government's aim of attracting foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Subic, a former U.S. navy base, became a special economic zone
in the early 1990s after the U.S. withdrawal. It now serves as a
showcase of the country's economic reform success.

<HEADLINE> About 300,000 Drug Addicts in Sri Lanka: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- There are some 300,000 Sri
Lankans fell victim to narcotic drugs and 8 billion rupees (114
million U.S. dollars) go to the pockets of drug dealers annually,
according to the latest study.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Sri Lanka Anti-Narcotics
Association, said most drug addicts are within the age group of 16
to 25.
</P>
<P>
There are fears whether the lower limit is dropping still
further. At times 13-year-olds have been in the racket, according
to the study.
</P>
<P>
Police Narcotics Bureau said that out of about 300,000 drug
users in the country, nearly 100,000 are heroin inclined while the
rest are prone to use cannabis, an indigenous product more
popularly known as ganja.
</P>
<P>
The first user of heroin in Sri Lanka was detected in 1980. The
predominant method of abusing is inhaling the vapors of heated
heroin.
</P>
<P>
There have been 10,170 cases of heroin detection in the country
during 1998 while it was 4,888 for cannabis.
</P>
<P>
The International Narcotics Control Board said in its annual
report for 1998 that a significant amount of heroin is brought in
Sri Lanka from India in boats by traffickers operating between
southern India and the western coast of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997, 30 percent of heroin supplied to Sri Lanka had
been from India while 42 percent was from Pakistan. The balance 28
percent had come from other sources.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1998 supplies from India shot up to 71 percent
while those from Pakistan constituted only three percent.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 10 treatment centers for drug users in the
country out of which four are run by the state.

<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sun Jun of China failed to extend
his head-to-head winning record against Peter Gade Christensen as
the Danish retained the men's singles title at the Japan Open
badminton tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who defeat the Denish defending champion at the Copenhagen
Masters in December and the Grand Prix Final in February, bowed to
Gade Christensen 3-15, 10-15.
</P>
<P>
Sun was slow to adapt to the variety shots of Gade Christensen
who combined his soft-touched drops with an array of powerful
smashes to take the lopsided first game.
</P>
<P>
Sun, ranked fourth in the world, tried to change the pace,
moving the Dane around the court by hitting under-hand net shots
and drives in the second game.
</P>
<P>
But Sun found few chances to go back into the game as the
Denish defender kept his momentum to record a 11-3 lead before he
fired a smash to Sun's backhand to finish off the 37-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Sun said: "I had a fair wind in the first game and I couldn't
hit hard, allowing him to hit smashes. I got used to it in the
second game, but it was too late as I was already 4-11 down."
</P>
<P>
With the victory, which brough the winner a check of 14,400 U.S.
dollars, Gade Christensen reduced his record against Sun to three
wins against four defeats.
</P>
<P>
The women's singles champion went to China's Ye Zhaoying who
beat her compatriot Gong Zhichao 1-11, 11-5, 11-6.
</P>
<P>
In Mixed doubles final, China's pair Liu Yong and Ge Fei
overwhelmed the South Korean pair Ha Tae-Kwon and Chung Jae-Hee 15-
1, 15-3 for the title.

<HEADLINE> Shi Guangsheng on Sino-Canadian Trade Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, has announced that China
is ready to work closer with Canada to forge new areas of
cooperation and increased trade leading up into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
 Canadian investments in China have grown remarkably since the
early 1980s when a number of Canadian companies sought
opportunities in the country.
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1998, China had approved a total of 3,982
Canada-funded projects, with a contractual investment volume of 6.
4 billion US dollars; and actual investments reached nearly 1.8
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Such projects are scattered round 20 Chinese provinces and
cover a wide range of sectors including oil, electronics,
telecommunications, chemicals, light industry, foodstuffs,
textiles, agriculture, aquaculture, real estate and tourism
services.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade there has also been strong cooperation in
terms of government loans and international aid, mainly focusing
on agriculture, forestry, energy, communications,
telecommunications, hydro-power, petrochemicals, light industry,
construction materials, urban construction, paper pulp and paper-
making, environmental protection, personnel training and the
elimination of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Shi stressed that preferential loans and aid provided by the
Canadian Government have greatly improved the popularity and
competitiveness of Canadian enterprises in the Chinese market.
They have also helped contribute to the increase of Canadian
technology and equipment exports to China, bringing considerable
economic and social benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Canada, which
follows his current tour of the United States, will push forward
economic cooperation and trade relations as well as boosting ties
in a wide range of other areas.
</P>
<P>
In fact, non-governmental trade between China and Canada
started as early as the 1950s, and formal trade relations began in
1961 when the two sides signed an agreement on wheat. Diplomatic
relations were established in 1970 followed by an official trade
agreement in 1973.
</P>
<P>
As a result of frequent reciprocal visits by government leaders
in recent years entrepreneurs from both countries have been
encouraged to expand their cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the General Administration of Customs show
that trade volume between China and Canada has risen annually: the
bilateral trade volume hit 4.37 billion US dollars in 1998, 29
times the figure for 1970 and the 1998 figure was an 11.6 percent
growth from 1997.
</P>
<P>
While China's exports to Canada reached 2.13 billion US dollars
last year, up 11.7 percent, imports from Canada were 2.24 billion
US dollars, up 11.5 percent. Canada is now China's 10th largest
trade partner.

"China and Canada are influential countries across the Pacific
Ocean, sharing a tradition of friendship," Shi noted, adding that
there are no conflicts of fundamental interest.
</P>
<P>
"Economic and trade relations are a major part of the friendly
cooperative relations between the two nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Differences in social systems, history, culture and concept
of values should never obstruct the effective cooperation between
the two countries, and that has been proved over and over in past
years," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries are economically complementary, and there
is great potential for bilateral economic and trade cooperation,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has advantages in its well developed agriculture,
energy, transportation, electric power, telecommunications and raw
materials, while China is concentrating on economic construction
and puts a priority on the development in those areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In those fields China will provide Canadian companies with
huge opportunities for marketing and investment," he said. "And
the cooperation between the two countries will see a broad
prospect."

"The two countries have witnessed frequent exchanges of high-
level visits since 1994, including the visits by Canadian governor-
general and prime minister and Chinese premier and chairman of the
Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister went on to say, "During the state visit by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Canada in November 1997 the two
sides decided to establish a cross-century partnership of overall
cooperation and this is a landmark step."

The minister said that the proportion of trade volume in the
processing sector has also been growing steadily. Electronic
products and machinery are now the leading trade items that China
exports to Canada, and as a result the country's goods have become
more popular and competitive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the leading imports from Canada include wheat,
fertilizer, and paper products.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's major grain producers and exporters, Canada
first exported wheat to China 38 years ago and has so far sold it
more than 100 million tons, worth over 13 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade minister said that China's imports of machinery and
electronic products, especially technical equipment, have
increased annually over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
High technologies such as telecommunications and hydro-power
plants have also played a large part in this cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Candu (Canadian Deuterium-Uranium Reactor) equipment that
China bought from Canada for the third-phase project of the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, is the largest technology import
shipment from Canada to date.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- India's foreign exchange
reserves increased by 949 million U.S. dollars during the week
ending on April 1, thus pushing the total foreign exchange
reserves to the highest ever levels of 32.53 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase is mainly due to a rise in the foreign currency
assets which grew by 960 million dollars to 29.56 million dollars
for the week, according to official figures released Saturday by
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the jump in reserves, which included gold
and special drawing rights, primarily to "sterilization" efforts
by the RBI, India's central bank.
</P>
<P>
RBI said in its Weekly Statistical Supplement that since the
end of last December, foreign currency assets had gone up by 2.609
billion dollars and total reserves increased by 2.479 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, gold reserves went down by 11 million dollars to 2.96
billion dollars by April 1, the supplement showed.

<HEADLINE> Paper Says Philippines Not to Restructure Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Finance has
decided to shelve the planned restructuring of some 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars worth of Philippine debt instruments being traded in
the international bond markets.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Bulletin Sunday quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu as saying that there was no need to reopen anymore the
bonds since the government has already fully covered all its
financing requirements of this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the declining interest rates abroad, Espiritu dismissed
the idea of reopening of the country's outstanding bonds aimed at
issuing new tenors at a lower yield to save on interest cost.
</P>
<P>
The planned restructuring of these loans will eventually add up
to the outstanding debt stock of the national government, which
stood at more than 46 billion dollars in the third quarter of last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not doing it anymore. It will result in higher
(external) obligations for the national government," the secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government issued 1.3 billion dollars worth of
sovereign bonds in the international bond markets in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more commercial loans. We have covered our
foreign financing requirements for 1999," Espiritu said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Introduce Subsistence Allowance Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai authorities will
introduce a program to provide job losers with subsistence
allowance and retraining in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies, including the employment and skills
development departments of the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry
and Office of the Civil Service Commission, are looking into
suitable schemes, and public hearings would be held once the study
was complete, reported the Bangkok Post on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A royal decree to put the scheme in effect under the provision
of the Social Security Act would probably be issued in 2001, SSO
deputy secretary-general Somkiat Chayasriwon was quoted by the
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
More staff and additional equipment would be needed if the
scheme was to be implemented. Under the scheme, people out of work
would be paid a subsistence allowance for a certain period,
Somkiat said.
</P>
<P>
They would be required to register as unemployed with the
Employment Department. While waiting for a suitable job, they
would have to undergo training at the Skills Development
Department.
</P>
<P>
Employers and employees would be required to make equal
contributions to the job security fund, not exceeding five percent
of the workers' monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
To benefit from the scheme, a worker must have made at least
six contributions to the fund during a period of 15 months.
</P>
<P>
A worker sacked for dishonesty, negligence or criminal offense,
or violation of regulations would not be entitled to benefits.
</P>
<P>
Nikom Chantaravithoon, a labor expert, said a job security
scheme was even more necessary in times of economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
Similar schemes operate successfully in many countries.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Egyptian Ties Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The bilateral trade relationship
between China and Egypt is expected to receive a strong boost from
the just-concluded visit of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
reported Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs showed
that the two-way trade volume between China and Egypt amounted to
a record high of 606.5 million US dollars in 1998, representing a
16.3 percent surge over the year before.
</P>
<P>
"There is still great potential for further development of Sino-
Egyptian trade and economic cooperation," said Xu Changwen,
director of the Department of Asia and Africa Affairs under the
Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Urging Chinese enterprises to attach greater importance to the
Egyptian market, Xu said, "the Egyptian economy has developed
steadily in recent years and the Egyptian Government has
underscored the absorption of foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, Chinese businesses have showed growing
interest in Egyptian market, which can be seen from the increasing
number of business people who have gone to consult with them about
the economic situation, market condition and investment policies
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation between China and Egypt in developing the
latter's first special economic zone, which began last May, has
strongly pushed forward the economic co-operation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-
operation showed that by the end of last year, China's investment
in Egypt amounted to 12 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment areas ranged from garment production and
machinery maintenance to the production of furniture and solar
energy equipment for home use.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has encouraged domestic enterprises to
establish processing and assembly lines in Egypt to promote the
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"China has also made considerable efforts to reduce the
increasing trade imbalance between China and Egypt by encouraging
Chinese businesses to import more goods from Egypt," a Beijing-
based trade expert said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, said, "the strongly complementary nature of
the two economies determines there is great potential for
bilateral economic links."
</P>
<P>
China usually exports machinery and electronics products,
textiles and tools to Egypt, with imports ranging from petroleum
and minerals to cotton and cocoa.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Official on U.S. Lifting of Arms Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Croatia said Saturday that the U.S.
decision to lift arms embargo against it would enable it to
purchase arms and obtain military aid from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mate
Granic said over the Croatia television right after he returned
from a visit to the United States that he had discussed with U.S.
leaders issues on Croatia's joining the Partnership for Peace
program and the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the United Nations decided to impose an arms embargo
against former Yugoslavia which includes Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Granic admitted that the U.S. decision was connected with the
Kosovo crisis and Croatia's extensive reforms in its defense
system.
</P>
<P>
Croatian top leaders headed by President Franjo Tudjman were
determined to participate urgently in NATO's military actions
against Yugoslavia 15 days ago. In return, the United States said
that it will protect the security of Croatia if it is attacked on
revenge by Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent framework agreement
signed between AT&AMP;T and the Shanghai Municipal government has sent
a promising sign to foreign telecom service providers about easier
access to the nation's telecom market.
</P>
<P>
The deal enabled a foreign partner for the first time to
provide telecom services in China.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture will be set up under the agreement operating
value-added telecom services in Shanghai Pudong New Area, marking
a genuine breakthrough in opening up China's telecommunications
sector.
</P>
<P>
"The telecommunications service market must open up further to
the outside world and the joint venture with AT&AMP;T marks the first
step in this trend," said Wu Jichuan, the country's information
industry minister.
</P>
<P>
After the large price cuts in the telecom service sector last
month, the telecom administration is losing no time in drafting
the country's first telecommunications regulation, which is
expected to be released by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said the government's active measures,
including the break-up of the China Telecom monopoly, are aimed at
normalizing the rapid development of the telecom industry and
preparing for the opening-up of the world's largest telecom market.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, India Talk to Salvage Free Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and India are
continuing talks to salvage the bilateral free trade agreement
signed last December, the official Sunday Observer reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said India appears to be trying to link Sri Lanka's
tea export quota with exports of its own goods like Indian
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
"They have asked for concessions on exports of vehicles," the
newspaper quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The free trade deal, under which both countries progressively
cut tariffs, was to have come into effect on March 1, but hit
snags when India at the last moment withdrew concessions on the
export of Ceylon tea.
</P>
<P>
A team of Indian officials held talks here recently to try to
work out a compromise on the free trade pact on which both
countries have placed so much expectations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had been hoping that duty free exports of Ceylon tea
would be allowed by India.
</P>
<P>
However, New Delhi offered a tea export quota of 5 million
kilos or 10 million U.S. dollars worth of tea, whichever is
reached first within a specified time frame, subject to a
50-percent duty.
</P>
<P>
Besides, India also proposed quotas on garments, the island's
main industrial export product, which earlier was to be placed on
a "negative list" of products on which no tariff concessions will
be given.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka then asked for a much bigger tea export quota and
hopes to reach a compromise on the volume, the report said,
quoting official sources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka expects to export about 10-15 million kilos of Ceylon
tea to India annually.
</P>
<P>
It also hopes to make up for the loss of a big chunk of exports
to the Commonwealth of Independence States, the biggest buyer of
Ceylon tea, after the economic crisis caused by the devaluation of
the rouble last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Names Hendra-like Virus Nipah Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has named the new
Hendra-like virus the Nipah virus after the name of a village
where the new virus was first discovered.
</P>
<P>
The killer virus, named after Kampung Sungai Nipah in the
southern state of Negeri Sembilan, has so far claimed dozens of
lives in pig farming areas in the state.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign experts have determined that 88 of the
victims of viral encephalitis had the Nipah virus first discovered
on March 15 by Chua Kaw Bing, a researcher at University Malaya's
Medical Microbiology Department, while 11 had both the Nipah virus
and the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the naming of the new virus in Seremban, the state's
capital Saturday, Malaysian Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said
that the new virus has now been reaffirmed by the findings of the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta which
recently conducted a study on viral encephalitis patients from
Negeri Sembilan, Leading national daily New Straits Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern now is the Nipah virus, which is the first such
manifestation in the world. We are now trying to develop a
specific test for the new virus," the minister was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Chua said the government's priority is to contain the Nipah
virus while efforts to check the spread of the JE viral infection
would be continued.
</P>
<P>
He said infection caused by the JE virus or the Nipah virus is
still considered viral encephalitis as the viruses attack the
brain cells.
</P>
<P>
All soldiers involved in pig culling operations have been
ordered to undergo blood screening to ensure they are free of the
JE or Nipah virus infections.
</P>
<P>
The order issued by the health minister followed the admission
of an soldier involved in the pig culling operation into the
Seremban Hospital for suspected viral encephalitis infection on
April 2.

<HEADLINE> Fish, Prawn Trading Companies Closed in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A number of fish and prawn trading
companies operating along Myanmar's southwestern coastal areas
have closed due to unhealthy competition, according to the latest
issue of the local Myanmar Business News magazine.
</P>
<P>
Intense bidding among these companies have led to opportunistic
situation in the area, said the report, adding there remains only
a single company in the area carrying out export business to five
countries.
</P>
<P>
The fishery sector, which is the third largest foreign exchange
earner after agriculture and forestry, earned 167 million U.S.
dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year by exporting over 74,000 tons
of fish and prawn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar plans to build an international-level fish
wholesale center in the country to expand its sea fish and prawn
market.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also boosting its fish and prawn production by
allowing joint venture operation between the government and
private and foreign entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in the
sector, which came from Bangladesh, China, Germany, Japan and
Thailand, amounted to 275.35 million U.S. dollars in 18 projects
at the end of 1998, out of the 7.1 billion dollars' total foreign
investment in the country.

<HEADLINE> Increase in Demand May Propel Bike Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's bicycle manufacturing
industry still has bright prospects in spite of the current
problems in the sector, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Wang Fenghe, director of the china Bicycle Association, said
the bicycle industry could face the long term with confidence
given consumption trends on the domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest population in the world but has very low
average per capita income, so its people are likely to continue
choosing bicycles as their preferred mode of transport for a long
time yet.
</P>
<P>
According to industry analysts, the rural market of one billion
people is the most promising for the future.
</P>
<P>
Fifty million bicycles are estimated to need replacement every
year in china. a renewal peak period expected in two or three
years may bring a new upsurge of bike buying.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of people's living conditions, a special
consumer group has appeared which uses bikes as exercise and
recreational tools. Their demand will further stimulate production.
</P>
<P>
Dure to the need to protect the environment and save energy,
the governments of some developed countries are taking measures to
encourage the use of bicycles.
</P>
<P>
Certain problems remain in the sector in China despite many
years of development, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Owing to lack of rational macroeconomic measures, low level
reconstruction has created overcapacity and price cutting on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the bicycle industry needed to produce more high-
quality bikes and improve after-sales service.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises must quicken their restructuring to control
output and act according to market economic principles if they
want to survive and forge ahead in the reform.

<HEADLINE> Talks on China's WTO Membership Enter Final Stage, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
official said here Saturday that talks on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) have entered the final stage and
China and the United States have reached a key agreement on farm
issues.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, who accompanied Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on the
current visit to the United States, denied reports that China and
the United States have resolved their differences on all WTO-
related issues.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here after Zhu and President Bill
Clinton issued a joint statement on issues in Washington earlier
Saturday concerning China's accession to the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, issued after the signing of the
agreement, the United States committed itself to firmly supporting
China's entry into the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that talks on China's accession to the WTO have
entered the final stage," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
During the Chinese delegation's current visit, China and the
United States have conducted "intensive consultations" on China's
accession to the WTO, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it took a whole night of tough negotiations before
the two sides reached an agreement on farm issues, an important
component of a package of accords under negotiation on China's
entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese minister, the agreement was reached at
the last minute before the Chinese delegation left Washington for
Denver Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first agreement on the WTO signed between China and
the United States, and both sides attach great importance to it,"
said Shi.
</P>
<P>
It is really not an easy job to achieve the first agreement
since negotiations on China's accession to the WTO have gone
through hardships and suffered "twists and turns," he added.
</P>
<P>
Denying some media reports that China and the United States
have reached an agreement on all WTO-related issues, he said, "in
fact, the two sides have not yet achieved consensus on all WTO-
related issues except the agreement on agriculture."
</P>
<P>
The alleged "agreement" by the media is "nothing more than a
draft proposal floated by the U.S. side during the negotiations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that talks on China's accession to the WTO have already
lasted 13 years, Shi said China will work for the achievement of a
bilateral agreement on the WTO with the United States at an early
date in accordance with the joint statement, which will pave the
way for China's entry into the world trading bloc.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A police source confirmed the
press reports on Sunday that three people were killed in a
shoot-out between anti-drug squads and a narcotic-trafficking gang
on the Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out occurred in Pang Vour village in Chiang Rai,
northern Thailand on Saturday, killing one Thai police officer and
two ethnic Lahu drug-smugglers, said the source who refused to be
named.
</P>
<P>
Police officer Sanan Sasom was shot in the chest during an
operation to arrest armed drug smugglers who came to the village
to demand payment from certain individuals who had purchased
amphetamines from them, according to the Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated one AK-47 automatic rifle and scores of
bullets after the armed group fled to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
An area leading to the Myanmar border has been shut off and
more officers were called in to help track the armed
drug-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest in a series of violent clashes between the
Thai authorities and various Meanness armed groups that have
rocked the border, forcing the Thai authorities to close down some
border checkpoints to contain the violence.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Hints at Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
has hinted at a possible constitutional amendment to save the
state the burden of having to arrange for overseas Thais to vote
in national elections.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Bangkok Post quoted Chuan as confirming on Saturday
that he had discussed the matter with some election commission
members due to poor interest among overseas Thais in their
election rights.
</P>
<P>
The commission has yet to officially propose its idea to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who registered for the voting rights was
so small that some members believed the government should not
waste money to arrange for them to vote, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Some commission members were said to have been unhappy about
the low response from the overseas Thais to a commission
requirement for them to register for the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the number of people who wish to vote
is so small that the commission feels it may not be worthwhile
spending money on such votes," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The commission has reported that there are altogether 757,504
Thais in 78 countries worldwide who are eligible to vote. However,
only 16,309 have registered to exercise their voting rights until
April 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that the government may have to invest 1
billion baht (27 million U.S. dollars) to enable overseas Thais to
vote in the general elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria entered the second round of
the World Youth soccer championships on Saturday after Germany
suffered a shock defeat by Costa Rica.

giving a lift to the hosts who had bowed to Paraguay 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay upset Nigeria in the first 20 minutes with the goals
from Sergio Fernandez and Ruben Maldonado with the hosts pulling
one back before the break by Ganiyu Shittu.
</P>

Paraguay finished top of group A with Nigeria second from Costa
Rica on goal difference and Germany placed last. The top two teams
in each of the six groups go through plus the best four third-
placed teams.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, who will have to wait for the outcome of Sunday's
games to know if they can go through, pulled off the surprising
victory through Alberto Brenes and Esteban Santana. In between,
Christian Timm scored for Germany, who had Andreas Voss sent off
for a rash tackle.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- An expert from the United States
said that China's protection of intellectual property rights has
made substantial progress, according to Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
"China's Trademark Law has reached an extremely high level,"
Frederick W. Mostert, president of the U.S.-based International
Trademark Association, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
"I was told that China is developing a trademark dilution law.
This is a very advanced field even in world terms," said Frederick,
who led a delegation of U.S. lawyers and legal practitioners
specializing in intellectual property to China earlier this month
to discuss trademark and intellectual property issues with Chinese
officials and scholars.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out some famous Chinese trademarks have
been registered in overseas markets by foreign companies due to
the enterprises' lack of sense of trademark rights.
</P>
<P>
On this, an official of the China Intellectual Property
Society said that the Trademark Law is expected to be revised soon
to fight against trademark infringements.
</P>
<P>
He stressed China's access to the World Trade Organization
would help strengthen its protection of intellectual property
rights.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Ruxandra Dragomir of
Romania kept her giants-killing form at the Bausch and Lomb Tennis
Championships on Saturday as she halted the impressive run of No.
9 seed Anna Kournikova in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
She powered to a 6-3, 7-5 triumph over the Russian glamour girl,
setting up a final on Sunday against second-seeded American Monica
Seles, who rolled to 6-0, 6-1 victory over No. 7 Conchita Martinez
of Spain for her 15th victory in their 16 lifetime meetings.
</P>
<P>
Dragomir engineered the win by playing aggressively, going to
the net often on the slow, green clay of Amelia Island Plantation,
and mixing spin with power that kept Kournikova off balance.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova, 17, by far the tour's highest profile player yet to
win a title, had played some of her best tennis of her career as
she reached the Hilton Head final last week, where she lost to
Martina Hingis of Switzerland, then posted decisive upsets of top
seed American Lindsay Davenport and sixth seed Patty Schnyder in
the tournament.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest 250 Billion Yuan in Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 250 billion
yuan in railway construction during the five years ending 2002, an
official with the Ministry of Railways has announced.
</P>
<P>
Cao Qing, director of the development and planning department
of the ministry, said that by 2002, massive railway construction
will extend China's railway lines beyond 70,000 km.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is racing against time planning an
expressway linking Beijing and Shanghai, China's most economically
vibrant city, adding that hopefully the construction of this
expressway will begin sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that when the five-year plan is completed,
the mountainous Southwest China region will have easy access to
the coast, facilitating the region's foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The newly built railway lines will also enable coastal regions
to obtain abundant coal resources easily from north China, easing
its energy shortage.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that by November last year, China had
attracted 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in loans from international
monetary organizations and foreign governments for railway
construction, and that 218 foreign-funded companies were involved
in the railway sector, including 257 million U.S. dollars in
direct foreign investment.

YANGON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 340,123 foreign
tourists visited Myanmar in 1998, of whom 182,399 came over by

<P>
TIANJIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The electronics industry has good
prospects and potential in Tianjin Municipality and promises to be
a sound investment field for foreign businesses, the city's vice
mayor said in a meeting with a United States business delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The Tianjin Development Zone (TDZ) is the key area for

the city still depend on imports, according to the vice mayor.
</P>
<P>
The city has already attracted to its development zone an
electronics business group producing mobile telecommunications
equipment, PCs and compatible products, machinery, semiconductor
products, and automated meters.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 joint-venture electronics companies have been set up
in the zone, involving a total investment of about three billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investments in electronics in the TDN accounts for one-third of
the total investment attracted to the development zone, and
electronics enterprises contribute almost half of the output value,
exports, and taxes in the district.

Statistical Organization, the country's total import in 1998
amounted to 2.824 billion U.S. dollars, of which the private
sector shared 1.864 billion dollars or 66 percent, while the state
sector represented 960 million dollars or 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's total export volume of 1.137 billion dollars
in 1998, the private sector took up 819.5 million dollars or 72
percent, while the state sector represented 318 million dollars or
28 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar adopted a positive policy towards the
private sector such as leasing out some bad-running state-owned
small, medium and large economic enterprises to private
entrepreneurs who have technical skill, sound management and
strong financial backing, and implementing some related
preferential policies for them in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Benefits From New Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing has benefited greatly
from the government policy to stimulate the economy by increasing
investments in infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The central government initiated a new 1998 strategy to spur
the sluggish economy resulting from the negative impact of last
summer's record flooding and lingering financial turmoil in
various parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, a municipality placed under direct central
government administration in 1997, recorded negative income growth
for rural laborers in the first three quarters of 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Chongqing has been one of the major beneficiaries of
central government economic policies in place since the fourth
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Rural laborers have found new jobs in government-funded
infrastructure projects in various sectors, including water
conservancy, communications, environmental protection, the
construction of state-owned grain storage facilities and housing
for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the sharp increase in demand for
laborers to increased investments by central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Rising incomes have in turn increased demand for consumer goods
in Chongqing's rural markets.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Firms Gain Freer Access to Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's private businesses are
expected to play a greater role in China's drive to absorb foreign
investment thanks to a policy environment that is better than ever,
reported Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
To this end, a group of private companies would be first
allowed to attend the third China Fair for International
Investment and Trade this year, regarded as the most important
event for attracting foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"The move indicates that the central government is gradually
loosening its grip on cooperation between Chinese private
enterprises and foreign investors," said He Maochun, deputy
director of the World Trade Research Department of the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Another MOFTEC official said that encouraging private companies
to co-operate with foreign businesses complies with the trend of
diversification in the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
China's biggest city, Shanghai, is expected to launch a new
policy incentive, under which all kinds of standardized private
companies, as long as foreign investment does not exceed 50
percent of their own capital, will be permitted to co-operate with
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, various restrictions on the private
sector allowed a small number of such businesses to attract
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Only around 400 private companies in Shanghai co-operated with
foreign investors by the end of February, accounting for 0.4
percent of the city's total number of private companies.
</P>
<P>
But the situation is improving, particularly following the
raising of the legal status of the private sector in the newly
revised Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"In some respects, foreign companies will find it easier to
launch co-operative projects with China's private companies than
with state-owned ones, thanks to their similarities in management
regimes," according to Ma Yu, director of the Foreign Investment
Research Department under the Chinese Academy of International
Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Despite flexible operational mechanism, most private businesses
are still inferior to their state-owned counterparts in terms of
business size, capital resources and sales networks.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Asks his People to Help in National Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Saturday called on his countrymen to do their part in
restoring major facilities damaged by NATO air attacks.
</P>
<P>
If all Yugoslav citizens do their own jobs well and even better
in wartime than in peaceful period, that would be a best answer to
the aggressors, the president said while meeting Yugoslav and Serb
leaders on the reconstruction of facilities vital to the country
but damaged by NATO's bombs.
</P>
<P>
During wartime, the president said, the Yugoslav people should
overcome tremendous difficulties and do more and better, thus
proving to the world that the Yugoslav nation is a heroic nation.
</P>
<P>
Since March 24, NATO has sent more than 3,000 airplanes to bomb
Yugoslavia. Some 450 cruise missiles were fired from 20 naval
vessels, including two aircraft carriers. Thousands of tons of
bombs were dumped on Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
Apart from military facilities, civil facilities such as
resident buildings factories, mines, airports, roads, bridges,
communication systems, hospitals and schools were also bombed by
NATO, causing an estimated loss of 100 billion U.S. dollars to the
Yugoslav Federation.

<HEADLINE> China's Medicine Reform Advances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The medical system reform
starting last year in China aims to provide a fair competitive
environment for State-owned and foreign-funded medical enterprise,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
the ongoing reform campaign, through which medical services are
intended to be made available to more people, obliges individuals
and their work units to shoulder medical expenses jointly, instead
of leaving the State to pick up the whole bill.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, a list of medicines that may
be reimbursed will be issued in the near future. A committee
composed of specialists and scholars from all medical fields
nationwide will make out the list after a careful and scientific
assessment process.
</P>
<P>
Yu Mingde, pharmaceutical department director of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, said the reform had made people
more cautious in choosing medicines.
</P>
<P>
When buying regular medicines, people tend to favor products
manufactured by State enterprises, which have nearly the same
quality but much lower prices than those imported or made by
overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The medical reform will force overseas-funded medical
enterprises to lower their prices according to production costs
and medical efficacy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industry authority welcomes overseas medical
businesses to introduce new products with original curative
effects to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, domestic medical enterprises must cut output and
stop low-level reconstruction to check price-cutting competition.
</P>
<P>
government officials predict that the sales volume of the
medical industry will rise from last year's 106.8 billion yuan (12.
9 billion US dollars), but at rate less than the eight percent in
1998.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Worst Over for Asian Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- After a year of great depression,
Asia's property market may begin its much-awaited recovery later
this year as interest rates are falling across the region and
currencies are stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
Although Asia's property market had been sluggish for many
years due to over-supply, the year of 1998 could be described as
its worst in a decade. Throughout Asia, real-estate markets saw an
unprecedented over-supply, which prompted big price falls in the
year.
</P>
<P>
During the year, home prices in Hong Kong fell 38 percent;
office prices in Jakarta fell 60 percent amid an economic collapse
and political unrest; office rents in Kuala Lumpur fell 30 percent
as the city's vacancy level climbed from 4 percent in 1997 to 16
percent. In Bangkok, office vacancies soared to nearly 30 percent.
In Singapore, retail rents plunged 23 percent as the vacancy level
nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish trend is expected to continue this year as
potential buyers are waiting for further prices slides,
real-estate experts said.
</P>
<P>
In a study on the prospects of the property market in 1999,
property consultancy firm Cuervo Far East Inc. said that there is
still a risk of owning and buying property nowadays on the
assumption that prices of real-estate are expected to come down
further.
</P>
<P>
"It is only a question of time when landlords lower prices to
attract a shrinking market whose demand has been dampened by the
crisis. We therefore expect prices, especially in certain sectors
and market segments with looming over-supply, to slide as
developers succumbed to market pressure," Cuervo said.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the downturn trend, the worst may be over for
the property market because interest rates throughout the region
are coming down and currencies are stable, or even appreciate
against the U.S. dollar now.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last year, some Asian countries have cut
interest rates continuously to stimulate the economic recovery.
The Indonesian central Bank has brought the average interest rate
down to 34 percent now from 42 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, interest rates have fallen to below 10 percent
from 25 percent a year ago. The Philippine central bank's
overnight lending rates were lowered to 12.5 percent from 30
percent at the peak of the financial crisis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts expect the lower banking rates would trigger an
expansion of credit to potential home and office buyers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, governments of a number of Asian countries are
trying to revive the property market by allowing foreign investors
to own lands and property, pushing stubborn corporate deadbeats to
pay up or shut down.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the region's brighter economic picture could also pave
the way for the development of the property sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year, East Asian economies experienced their first
contraction in the past decade, but most of them, like South
Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, could achieve a
1-3.5 percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the quicker-than-expected recovery may push
banks to write off bad loans owned by the property sector and help
them get back to normal business.
</P>
<P>
With the economic recovery later this year, real-estate prices
are likely to become stable and start to soar in the last quarter,
they predicted.
</P>
<P>
"Last year was really bad, but there is already an indication
that business will be better (starting this year)," said Susan
Romero, vice president for marketing of a Philippine property
development company.

<HEADLINE> UK Sends Aircraft Carrier to Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Saturday it was
sending an aircraft carrier to the Adriatic to strengthen NATO's
air strikes against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that HMS Invincible is being deployed to the
Adriatic to help the NATO effort to stop President Milosevic's
offensive against the Kosovo Albanians," a Reuters report quoted a
Ministry of Defence official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is all part of tightening the screw on Milosevic," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Invincible carries seven jets and nine helicopters and
packs a wide range of firepower. It will join the British
nuclear-powered submarine HMS Splendid, which has been firing
cruise missiles at targets in Yugoslavia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
NATO already has two aircraft carriers in the Adriatic: the
United States has sent the Theodore Roosevelt and France has
deployed the Foch.
</P>
<P>
No decision had been taken to send extra British troops to the
Balkans, said the official. But units were on standby in case they
were needed to help the humanitarian aid effort or enforce any
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Blair repeatedly dismissed
speculation that NATO would send ground troops to fight their way
into Kosovo.
