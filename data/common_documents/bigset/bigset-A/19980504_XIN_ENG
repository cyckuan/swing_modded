<HEADLINE> Enqvist Outlasts Agassi for BMW Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Swede Thomas Enqvist held down Agassi's
rally to the top ranks when he rallied to beat the American in
three sets for the BMW Open title in Munich of Germany on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Overcame a series of nagging injuries before the match, Enqvist
won 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 in a thrilling fight that could have
gone Agassi's way as well.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, 28, was seeking his first tournament victory on
European red clay in 10 years and his third title of the year.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, who was seeded seventh, collected 70,000 U.S. dollars
for his victory while Agassi, who was eighth-seeded in the 500,000
U.S. dollar tournament, will move one place to No. 19 in the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Enqvist slipped one place past Agassi to No. 18.
</P>
<P>
Once the No. 1 in the world, Agassi had dropped as low as
No. 141 during a disastrous season last year.

<HEADLINE> Wanda Beats Hainiu 5-1 in Chinese First Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda crushed Qingdao Haihiu
5-1 at home to keep their lead in the Chinese soccer first
division league after Sunday's ninth round match played in Dalian,
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Wanda have ran their matches record to 7-1-1 and secured a four
points leading margin to second Shanghai Shenhua, who are 5-3-1
after Sunday's match.
</P>
<P>
Wanda have scored 25 goals but conceded just four in nine
league games, averaging 2.78 goals per game.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who previously played solid defence and well-organized,
but less attacking football, began this season with games of more
flair after Xu Genbao took the head coach pole from Chi Shangbin.
</P>
<P>
Wanda had secured the victory in the first 20 minutes and
proved their class of their own with another two in the first six
minutes in the second half, with all their top scorers fired all
cyclinders of the power.
</P>
<P>
Xing Rui scored a consoling goal in the 54th minute for the
visiting side.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua kept their press upon Wanda, who is seeking
their third consecutive title, with a 3-1 victory away over
Chinese Army in Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian international Moura made a double and Xiao Jian had
an own goal to keep Shenhua in the second place in the overall
standings.
</P>
<P>
The home team made a short comeback after Pan Yi pulled one
back on a penalty, but could not keep on running for more chances
in the front.
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu, Sichuan Province, Sichuan Quanxing had their two
goal outruled by the referee and had to contend with a goalless
draw with Vanguards Huandao.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other matches, Beijing Guo'an kept their unbeaten
run with a 2-1 win over Qingdao Hainiu at home, and Shenzhen
Pin'an were held a 1-1 tie by Shenyang Haishi.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Songri did not find their scoring power and drew with
Wuhan Yaqi 0-0, and Yanbian Aodong made their third victory this
season after they beat Guangzhou Apollo 2-0 on home turf.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Mubarak Say London Meetings Important to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Egyptian leaders said Sunday
that the forthcoming London meetings designed to unblock the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are crucial for the peace process
itself and the security in the region.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak here, visiting U.S. Vice President Al Gore said the
much-anticipated meetings afforded "a strategic opportunity for
progress before us."
</P>
<P>
"The successful outcome of the London talks will provide a
wonderful springboard to see that renewed progress on that
(Palestinian) track," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed his hope that they could "conclude something
successful" for the sake of peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If this meeting is not a success, I feel it may lead to more
complications in future," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived here early Sunday morning on a one-day visit to
Egypt, a day before the meetings U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to have with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said during his meeting with Gore, both sides hoped the
U.S. initiative on the Israeli pullback from West Bank, a central
topic expected at the London talks, will be accepted and
implemented by both Israel and the Palestinians "in good faith."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed a further Israeli withdrawal of 13.1
percent from the West Bank in exchange of Palestinians' stepped-up
security measures. But the Israeli government has insisted on a
scope of no more than 9 percent, while the Palestinians have said
the U.S. proposal is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Washington as the chief peace-broker for
the Mideast peace has not publicly presented its initiative, Gore
said it is actually doing its utmost to help out.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how the U.S. could be more active in the peace
process," he noted, citing the intensive meetings and discussions
Albright and he himself have had with leaders in the region
constantly.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a long way to go in the peace process,
regardless of the outcome in London. There are other tracks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since
March 1997 over Israeli settlement buildings in Arab East
Jerusalem and long-delayed redeployment from the West Bank. On the
Lebanese and Syrian peace track over Israeli withdrawals from
south Lebanon and the Golan Heights, no progress has been made for
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he and Gore reached the understanding that it is
extremely important that the peace process on all tracks should
move forward without delay.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that a lasting and comprehensive peace cannot
be continued without the resumption of talks on the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Gore devoted a better half of his press statement to the
praising of the achievement in the "new strategic U.S.-Egyptian
ties." Earlier, several bilateral agreements on environment, the
support for small business development and legal cooperation were
signed.
</P>
<P>
Gore's Mideast tour has taken him to Israel, Saudi Arabia and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Intensifies in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The fighting over the control of
Lower Jubba region in southern Somalia further intensified Sunday
as each of the warring parties received more infantry and
ammunition reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which seemed to have paused for a while in the
morning has restarted in the afternoon with even more intensity.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest independent reports, the Marehan
subclan militia are now gaining the upper hand in the fighting
under the leadership of General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures on either side.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the Marehan militia said that at least
18 people have been killed during the fighting on Saturday night
and Sunday morning and the wounded are countless on both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the fighting on Sunday could be
characterized as the worst and the most catastrophic since the
animosity between the two sides had turned into bloody armed
clashes nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
More than one thousand armed people from both sides and more
than 25 battle wagons were engaged in the battle.
</P>
<P>
About a hundred people have been killed since the fighting
began two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that quite a number of refugees had
begun fleeing the battle field.
</P>
<P>
General Morgan accused Hussein Aidid's faction for siding with
the Marehan militiamen.
</P>
<P>
But the South Mogadishu authorities denied any involvement in
the fighting between the two Darod subclans in Lower Jubba
region.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat held talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Sunday evening before attending the London talks to revive
the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed issues expected to be raised during
the talks U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will have
with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
separately in London Monday, especially Washington's proposal to
keep the peace process moving.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative, which is likely to be made public in
London, calls on Israel to withdraw from a further 13.1 percent of
the West Bank over 12 weeks in its second troop redeployment, with
each step met by PNA's security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has accepted the proposal but Israel still insists on
handing back no more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will leave for London after the meeting which took place
on the heels of talks between Mubarak and U.S. Vice President Al
Gore here. Gore, on a tour of the region, has met with the
Palestinian and Israeli leaders but failed to make Netanyahu buy
the U.S. idea.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference here Sunday, Mubarak and Gore urged
the Palestinians and Israelis to accept the U.S. initiative during
the London meetings, which were described by Gore as "a strategic
opportunity for progress."
</P>
<P>
But Gore reserved his optimism over the gathering in London,
saying that there is "a long way to go" in the peace process
regardless of the outcome of the meeting itself.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
1997 after Israel decided to build a settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as capital of their
would-be state.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Afghan Peace Process in Jeopardy after Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of long-desired peace
in war-ravaged Afghanistan is in jeopardy after the intra-Afghan
talks between the Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance broke
down on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two Afghan warring factions ended their parley, jointly
sponsored by the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, on a note of "total disagreement," rejecting each
other's position on certain vital issues pertaining to the peace
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two arch rivals held peace talks for five consecutive days
from April 26-30 and adjourned the parley for two days with an
understanding to resume the talks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides failed to meet on Sunday to exploit the
progress made in the five days of talks -- among other things, an
agreement on the proposed Ulema (religious scholars) Commission.
The peace talks have, therefore, ended without results.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern Alliance accused each other of
being responsible for the breakdown of the peace talks, although
they both expressed their appreciation for the efforts of the
U.N., the OIC and others of the international community for
bringing together the two sides to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The acting chief of the U.N. Peace Mission on Afghanistan,
James Ngobi, while announcing the suspension of the Joint Steering
Committee Meeting, hoped that the two sides would sit down again
soon to carry forward what has already been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi urged the Afghan warring factions to continue to respect
the agreed moratorium on any new military offensive against each
other, "as the meeting has not yet ended or concluded."
</P>
<P>
However, statements made by the representatives of the two
sides showed that it was a total breakdown of the talks, as they
failed to resolve the disputed issues peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The process of talks, made possible after extensive diplomatic
efforts and the spadework by the U.N., OIC and Pakistan, only
brought about limited success, although the two sides expressed
their commitment to non-military solution to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said they were going to consult the leaders of the two
warring factions again for the resumption of the talks at the
level of the joint Steering Committee as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iftikhar Kurshid, a senior official from Pakistan's
Foreign Ministry, said the talks did not actually break down, but
had been suspended for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
Kurshid hoped the two sides would stand by their agreement on
the Ulema Commission and take up the remaining items of the agreed
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The delegation from the Taliban side to the scheduled Sunday
meeting consisted of three officials led by Abdul Hakeem Mujahid,
a Taliban representative based in Islamabad. The previous
five-member delegation, which left after the five days of talks,
failed to come back to the Pakistani capital for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance raised objections to the authority of the
changed Taliban delegation, and refused to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance delegation insisted that the issues
relating a cease-fire, an exchange of POWs as well as the lifting
of the blockade of humanitarian assistance to central Afghanistan
be considered at the level of the Joint Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban side argued that these issues should be
left for the Ulema Commission, which they said was an
authoritative and competent body to deal with these "important
matters."
</P>
<P>
Mujahid said they had suggested the Ulema Commission meet on
May 6, either in Islamabad or Jalalabad, capital of Afghanistan's
Nangahar province.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has not been accepted by their rival.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that with their sharp divisions on the
vital issues between the warring Afghan factions, the Afghan peace
process will definitely go through more of its ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
Any hope of a quick fix on the Afghan issue, which is suffering
a two-decade-long war, is unrealistic. The complexities of the
peace process in the war-torn country should never be
underestimated, they said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Keep Close Contact With Afghan Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said on Sunday that it
will continue to maintain close contact with all the Afghan
parties to keep them engaged in the peace process and will also
consult closely with all regional countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The message was contained in a press release issued by the
Pakistani Foreign Ministry after the breakdown of the intra-Afghan
peace talks between the Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
It said the Pakistani government welcomed the forward movement,
despite serious differences between the two Afghan warring
factions, in the Afghan peace process achieved during the meeting
of the Joint Steering Committee from April 26-30.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first face-to-face one between the Taliban and
the rival Northern alliance in more than a year, has resulted in
an agreement to establish the Ulema (religious scholars)
Commission for resolving the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government hoped that the Ulema Commission would
meet shortly, it said.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate what has been achieved, the mechanism of "six
plus two" countries (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus
Russia and the U.S.) should move swiftly toward the imposition of
a comprehensive arms embargo, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The inconclusive nature of the deliberations at the Joint
Steering Committee should not be allowed to retard the momentum
that has been generated," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Pakistani government urged the international
community to encourage the continuation of this process through
the early convening of the Ulema Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Burkina Faso have agreed
to strengthen economic cooperation as president Blaise Campaore
ended his two-day official visit to Uganda Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at the end of Campaore's visit said the two
countries decided to cooperate in agriculture, trade, investment
and air services.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference Sunday afternoon, president Yoweri
Museveni and president Campaore stressed the need to strengthen
regional bodies in an effort to achieve social and economic
development in their regions and in Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he supports the idea of setting up an
African intervention force, Museveni suggested that the
Organization of African Unity could give its blessing to regional
troops which can move to stop violence in their areas without
having troops to be mobilized and transported from the entire
continent.
</P>
<P>
President Campaore arrived here from Ethiopia where he
attended a conference of African Women and Economic Development
in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Uganda is the first by Burkina Faso leader in
more than a decade since his predecessor, captain Thomas Sankara
was here in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Upgrade Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique would soon make a
decision to upgrade its air force's ability to transport
personnel and military equipment so as to give its army more
mobility, a senior official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Hama-thai, Deputy Defense Minister of Mozambican Armed
Forces (FADM), said that the move would be made by taking into
consideration the country's financial capability, the Mozambican
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's ability in maintaining the military equipment,
especially those in the air force and the armored vehicles is
"worrisome', the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
Hama-thai said that the country's armored vehicles, mostly
purchased from the former Soviet Union used to be guaranteed by
the supplier.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the change in eastern
Europe have made things difficult for Mozambique, he said, adding
that "we are short of money for the maintenance of the military
equipment and thus find it hard to bring their capacity into full
play."
</P>
<P>
He said neither the former Soviet Union states nor any
countries in the west would like to offer free training to
Mozambican pilots.
</P>
<P>
Hama-thai did not mention whether his country would continue
to buy military equipment from the former Soviet Union states or
turn over to the West.

<HEADLINE> UK Hospitals Hit by Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The millennium bug of the computer
system has begun striking Britain's hospitals as some operations
have had to be postponed due to computers' failure to provide
doctors with correct information, a national newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study to be published later this week, the Sunday
Times reported that although the millennium bug is not due to
strike until midnight on New Year's Eve, 1999, UK hospitals are
already being hit by the computer problem as the National Health
Service has to plan operations well ahead.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that operations planned after 2000 are being
wiped out from computer records.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said that a north London hospital had to
postpone an operation because the computer system mistakenly
indicated that the swabs needed during the surgery were out of
stock.
</P>
<P>
The confusion occurred because the computer misread the 2001
use-by date for the swabs for 1901 as the computer can recognize
only the last two digits.
</P>
<P>
The report said that unless the bug is eradicated, it could
make NHS computers read information incorrectly and lives could be
put at risk.
</P>
<P>
It said that almost two-thirds of the NHS executives have drawn
up contingency plans for a widescale failure of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 54 percent of them have already sought legal advice
as they believe the NHS will be vulnerable to legal claims for
breakdowns in service.

<HEADLINE> Northern Alliance Expresses Regret Over Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Afghan Interior Minister
Mohammad Mohaqeq Sunday voiced his government's regret and concern
over the deadlock in the Afghan peace talks after the Taliban
delegation failed to return to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Afghan government and the National Islamic
United Front (NIUF), I express great regret and concern over the
deadlock caused by the Taliban who refused to send back their
negotiators to the peace talks" in Islamabad, Pakistan, Mohaqeq
said at a press conference in the Afghan embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Mohaqeq said that the Taliban militia did not send back their
negotiators without any reasons and this indicated that the
Taliban do not want peace but war.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) as well as peace-supporting countries and
organizations to make more efforts to solve the Afghan crisis
through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban delegation did not return to Islamabad on Saturday
to resume the peace talks with the northern-based NIUF, or the
Northern Alliance, to discuss the date and venue of a meeting of a
40-member commission of Ulema (Islamic scholars).
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the U.N. and OIC, the two belligerent
sides agreed last Wednesday to set up a commission of Ulema to
discuss ways for an end to the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia, emerged in 1995 and occupied
two thirds of the country after driving the government of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani out of the capital Kabul in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the mediation of the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Bill
Richardson, the Taliban agreed to negotiate with the rival NIUF
led by Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Mohaqeq, who arrived here on April 26, warned that the Afghan
peace process would go back to the beginning and the military
conflicts would escalate if the Taliban refuses to return to peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The NIUF believes that the Afghan crisis can only be solved
through peace talks, he said, adding that the civil war during
the past three years has proved there is no military solution to
the Afghan issue.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Militant Sentenced to Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli court Sunday sentenced
a member of the Palestinian militant organization Hamas to four
life sentences plus five years on conviction of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Raed Abu Hamdi, 22, from the four-member Hamas cell in the
Tzurif village near the West Bank city Hebron, was convicted by
the Lod District Court in central Israel of murdering Israeli
soldier Sharon Edri and bombing the Apropo cafe in Tel Aviv a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said the Hamas cell was involved in a series of
terror activities which led to the deaths of at least 11 Israelis
and wounding of 49 others.
</P>
<P>
In a minority opinion, one of the judges in the case said Hamdi
should be sentenced to death for the serious crimes he had
committed. But this opinion was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Hamdi pleaded not guilty to the activities he has confessed,
adding he was acting in order to protect the Palestinians from the
evils that Israel has inflicted on them.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer dismissed the multiple life sentences as
unnecessary, but added that he would not appeal the verdict. He
expressed the belief that all the Palestinian prisoners would be
released once the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is solved.

<HEADLINE> Referendum Urged over Mugabe's Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United Parties
(UP) Sunday challenged President Robert Mugabe to hold a
referendum to gauge whether he still retained the people's
mandate to run the country.
</P>
<P>
First Vice-President of the party Luxon Mugara said it was not
enough for Mugabe to say it was up to this ruling Zanu (PF)
congress which in 1996 endorsed him as the party's presidential
candidate, to decide whether he should step down or not, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year old Zimbabwean leader's current six-year term ends
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, Mugara told about 500 of his party's supporters in
the low income suburb of Tafara in Harare, that the way forward
would be for Mugabe to hold a national referendum against the
backdrop of the call for him to step down instead of relying on
his party's congress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UP Secretary-General Isaac Manyemba alleged that
people were still being intimidated by PF supporters thereby
denying them the chance to openly air their views.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Open Regional Tourism Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela will Wednesday open a giant tourism and investment
project which is expected to transform poor areas along the
country's eastern coast into favorite tourism destinations.
</P>
<P>
The Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative, straddling South
Africa's borders with Mozambique and Swaziland, is designed
mainly to boost tourism development and investment in the three
countries' neglected areas, South Africa Press Association
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative also include multi-million Rand investment
projects to develop agriculture, commercial, health, education
and infrastructure in the neighboring regions of the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and Swaziland's
King Mswati III will jointly open the initiative Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed projects, all on state or tribal land, include a
30-million-Rand (6-million-Dollars) hotel overlooking South
Africa's Kosi Bay lagoon on the Indian coast and a possible
50-million-Rand (10-million-Dollars) resort in the famous St.
Lucia wetland reserve.
</P>
<P>
Similar developments are planned for South Africa's largest
fresh-water lake system at Lake Sibayi, north of St. Lucia and
also on the Indian coast.
</P>
<P>
All developments are expected to be private sector driven,
although the South African government has pledged to build the
transport infrastructure and bulk services necessary to support
the development.
</P>
<P>
Construction has begun on a 180-million-Rand
(36-million-Dollar) road along the coast from Hluhluwe in
Kwazulu-Natal to Ponto do Oura in Mozambique and on to Maputo,
Mozambican capital.
</P>
<P>
The government will also build clinics and smaller roads
around the area, which are expected to benefit the poor who had
had no access to these before.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum to be signed by South Africa, Swaziland and
Mozambique will pave the way for a series of planned regional
protocols for dropping border control and standardizing tourism
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Lubombo corridor is one of several such initiatives either
taking place or in the pipeline in South Africa.

CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian fruits and vegetables will soon make their
way back into the market of Saudi Arabia, semi-official daily
Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hamam Shawwa, ex-president of the Jordan Exports and Producers
Association for Fruit and Vegetables, said that "we are halfway to
resuming exports (of fruits and vegetables) to the Saudi markets."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had asked for Jordan's studies and documents
regarding the standard of water used for irrigating agricultural
products in Jordan, Shawwa said, adding that now Jordan has
finished such a study and international organizations have
approved it.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia cut off its imports of Jordanian fruits and
vegetables months ago, claiming that the water used for
irrigating crops in Jordan was polluted and not fit for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The total asset of the shareholders of the Jordan Dead
Sea Industries Company (JDSIC) reached 19.6 million Jordanian
dinars (about 27.7 million U.S. dollars) by the end of 1997,
recording some 18 percent increase over that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
A report issued at the JDSIC's annual assembly here Sunday said
that the company generated 2.23 million dinars (about 3.15 million
U.S. dollars) in net profits in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The company will launch new joint projects with local and
foreign partners in the coming years to produce bromine, chlorine,
potassium, sulfuret and hydrochloric acid, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The National Polyester Yarn Mill of Saudi Arabia, the
first of its kind in the kingdom and the entire Gulf region, has
been put into operations, Egyptian newspaper The World Today
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ayed Abdul Rahman Al-Ayed, chairman of the Ayed Trading Group,
said that the mill is situated in the Riyadh Second Industrial
City and cost more than 22 million Saudi riyals (5.87 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The annual production capacity of the mill in its first
operational year will be 4,200 tonnes, and it will be doubled in
the following year, he added.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Ibrahim Fawzi, chairman of the investment authority of
Egypt, Saturday announced that an Egyptian-Kuwaiti company with
capital of 112 million Egyptian pounds (33 million dollars) will
be founded soon, Lebanese newspaper "Al-Hayat" reported Sunday in
its Cairo edition.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of Kuwaiti contribution to the capital of the
company, Imac Mursi Alem for Tourist Development and
Civilizational Investment, is 65 percent, while Egyptian
contribution to it is 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Regret Over Deadlock in Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's special envoy on Afghanistan
Alaeddin Boroujerdi on Sunday voiced the country's regret over the
deadlock in the Afghan peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, Boroujerdi
announced Iran's readiness to cooperate with the United Nations
to break the current deadlock, calling on Afghanistan's neighbors
to prevent the failure of the Afghan peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Afghan peace talks have given the Afghan
people the hope that they would finally get rid of civil war.
</P>
<P>
In case the Afghan peace talks fail, the danger of military
conflicts and subsequent escalation of crisis in Afghanistan will
go high, something that has worried Iran and all other countries
trying to restore peace in the war-torn country, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan peace talks between the northern alliance led by
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the opposition Taliban militia
were deadlocked on Saturday after the Taliban delegation failed to
return to Islamabad for Sunday's peace talks under the auspices of
the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The talks had been scheduled to discuss the date and the venue
of the first meeting of a 40-member commission of Ulema, or
Islamic scholars, the two sides agreed to set up for ending the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Mohaqeq on Sunday also
expressed regret and concern over the deadlock following the
Taliban's failure to return to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mohaqeq called on the U.N. and the OIC as well as other
peace-loving countries and organizations to make more efforts to
push forward the Afghan peace process.

ANKARA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
will pay a two-day visit to Tunisia on Monday in an effort to
cement the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Demirel and his Tunisian counterpart Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali will meet and discuss regional issues, the
efforts to revive the Mideast Peace Process, post-Gulf War
developments and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Presidential Press Center on Sunday
said Turkey and Tunisia share similar foreign policies, adding
that Turkey acts together with the Arab world in a solution to the
Mideast problem and in defending the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a time when Arab countries have accused
Turkey of forging military cooperation with Israel which is
detrimental to their national interests.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly explained that its military collaboration
with the Jewish state is not directed against any third party.
</P>

discuss the bilateral trade relations and look for ways to expand
them.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad ended his three-nation Maghreb visit to
Algeria, Tunisia and Libya Sunday by forging improved economic
relations with north Africa, the Foreign Affairs Department said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ending his visit in Tripoli and Libya, Pahad met members of
the country's revolutionary command council, Libyan agriculture
and trade ministers, and representatives of the oil-rich
country's national oil company, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Pahad, accompanied by a group of South African entrepreneurs,
was warmly welcomed by the three countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In each country, he encountered "a strong political will to do
business with South Africa", and the business delegation also
received many positive responses which signaled early conclusion
of significant contracts, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
During his discussions with his Maghrebian counterparts, Pahad
said if Africa was to meet the enormous challenges of
globalization, it was imperative that "the artificial divides
which had for long separated north Africa from sub-Saharan Africa
be bridged by greater economic and social interchanges".
</P>
<P>
Ministerial delegations from both Morocco and Tunisia were
expected in South Africa later this month for meetings of
respective joint bilateral commissions with the two countries,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Mediterranean basin, the Maghreb region
comprises Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania, and
has a total population of 70 million.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on Arab States to Help Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz on Sunday called on Arab states to take actions to lift
the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"When we say it is necessary to lift the sanctions, we appeal
to the Arab states first, so that they can do their best to break
the embargo imposed on Iraq," he told the 5th Arab People's Forces
Conference being held here.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions imposed on Iraq cannot be lifted until Arab states
decide to lift the sanctions and take actions. We cannot leave the
issue to the United States to decide when to lift the sanctions,
because it will never do so," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arab countries to reject the U.S. hegemony in the
world community and the double standard policy it adopts in
handling the Palestine and other Arab issues.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Israel has not complied with U.N. Security
Council resolutions concerning the Palestine issue, but the United
States has done nothing to force it into compliance with those
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the United States demands that Arab
countries implement all U.N. resolutions in the name of
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Aziz was referring the U.S. threat of war against Iraq last
February in an attempt to force Baghdad's full compliance with the
U.N. resolutions concerning the destruction of Iraq's banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can only be lifted when the U.N. weapons inspectors verify
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Ends Peace Talks in Cyprus, Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard
Holbrooke ended here Sunday two days of intensive consultations
with the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
without reaching any agreement on resumption of intercommunal
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a resumption of a dialog to settle the Cyprus
problem" at the end of the U.S. envoy's shuttle diplomacy, Cyprus
News Agency quoted reliable sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government, in keeping with the prescribed
agreement not to disclose anything about the content of these
confidential talks, has not made any statement.
</P>
<P>
Early this evening Holbrooke had his second 60-minute meeting
Sunday with President Glafcos Clerides, also leader of the Greek
Cypriots, after talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke made no statements after the meeting with Clerides
and he is expected to address a press conference on Monday prior
to his departure.
</P>
<P>
However, Denktash was quoted as telling the press after his
last meeting Sunday with Holbrooke in northern part of Nicosia
that "this series of shuttles by Mr. Holbrooke is over. He will
leave Cyprus tomorrow and won't come back on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Denktash also said that U.S. State department Coordinator for
Cyprus, Thomas Miller will also be leaving on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Miller had been scheduled to remain on the island to continue
consultations until Holbrooke's return on May 9.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who arrived here Friday, had a series of separate
talks with Clerides and Denktash on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His visit aims at bringing the two communities' leaders back to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops on the island and took over the northern third in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Denktash walked out of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks to protest
the European Union decision to open membership talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he will not return to the negotiating
table, unless the peace talks are conducted between "two states,"
instead of two communities.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only recognized
by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Against Undermining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military on Sunday
warned European countries not to undermine the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and the transatlantic link for the
sake of promoting the "European Security and Defense Identity."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the New Atlantic Initiative Conference, which was
opened Saturday in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, Second
Chief of General Staff Cevik Bir said that the Western European
countries are displaying a tendency to draw upon NATO assets for
newly created multinational forces which leave out countries like
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Many of the European countries came together to form
new military and political groupings in a peculiarly selective
manner they have set the terms themselves as they see fit. In a
clash of individual economic interests, political integration and
real security challenges are overlooked or perhaps carelessly
ignored."
</P>
<P>
Bir pointed out that NATO is still the benchmark of European
defense with indispensable principles of collective defense and
transatlantic links.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, "NATO's fronts have
changed. Turkey, for instance, is now considered to be a front
country rather than a flank country," Bir added.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed Turkey's unhappiness with plans to exclude
Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Albania from NATO
expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exclusion of the Balkan states would not help
expand peace and stability in Europe.

BEIRUT, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE), the
two-year-old but already a leading bourse in the Mideast region,
is expecting a more active trading year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Lebanese National News Agency Sunday,
BSE Chairman Gabriel Sehnaoui said trading on the bourse rose from
64 million U.S. dollars in 1996 to 640 million dollars in 1997
with a realistic target of 1 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
He urged Lebanese dominant family-owned businesses to go
public as a means for further expansion and growth.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 Lebanese companies, mostly banks and real estate
companies, are now listed on the BSE, which was re-opened in 1996
after the 15-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Sehnaoui saw a bright future for the market, hoping it will
eventually become an important pillar for the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bourse will play a role as a funding resource
for companies which always couldn't gain enough loans from banks.

<HEADLINE> Success of London Meetings Unlikely, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Hopes are minimal in a prospective
success of the forthcoming London meetings on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in view of the continued Israeli
rejection of the U.S. initiative, a Palestinian minister said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, Palestinian minister of planning and
international cooperation, made the remarks in an interview with
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) in Gaza before departure
for London together with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to
meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the agenda of the London meetings, due to start on
Monday, does not so far include anything other than bilateral
meetings between Albright and each of Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
As to the prospect of an expanded meeting that will bring
together Albright, Arafat and Netanyahu, he said, it will depend
on the progress of the separate talks between Albright and the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and may actually take place
should the talks be positive. But nothing is yet decided, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shaath pointed out that the principal item on the agenda of the
London talks is Israel's attitude towards the U.S. initiative to
activate the peace process, particularly that the Palestinian side
has favorably responded to the U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative is based on three elements, namely, the
implementation of the second phase of redeployment by pulling out
from 13.1 percent from the West Bank so that the related lands and
towns can be under full Palestinian sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second is to pledge to implement the third stage of
redeployment, and the third is to cease unilateral Israeli
measures, in the forefront of which are settlements and practices
that run contrary to the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Shaath underlined that the Israeli side in case of maintaining
its rejection of the U.S. initiative will have to bear the
responsibility for failure of the U.S. efforts to break the
deadlock of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to MENA, Arafat's accompanying delegation comprises
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), secretary general of the Palestine
Liberation Organization Executive Committee, Shaath, and Saeb
Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Columbia Space Shuttle Returns to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S space shuttle Columbia and
its crew returned to Earth Sunday, ending two weeks of brain
research in the space while the experiments were far from over,
said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle landed right on time at the Kennedy Space Center in
Cape Canaveral, Florida, where about 200 researchers waited with
scalpels.
</P>
<P>
Columbia swooped through a clear noontime sky and touched down
neatly on the runway. The trip added 6.4 million miles to the
odometer of the oldest shuttle of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
After the shuttle landed, the crew was hustled off to medical
tests that were expected to go on for days. Six of the seven
astronauts left on stretchers; doctors wanted them reclining to
preserve their weightless state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NASA workers rushed to unload the animals so
scientists could begin dissecting the few dozen surviving baby
rats, as well as the nearly 2,000 fish, snails, crickets and older
rodents that flew. Most of the young rats died in orbit, victims
of maternal neglect.

During the space trip, which started on April 17, the
astronauts kept close watch on the 170 rodents that rocketed into
orbit, especially after 52 of 96 baby rats died. The surrogate
mother rats could not or would not nurse the young animals in
space.
</P>
<P>
Because the containers for the fish, snails and crickets were
inaccessible aboard Columbia, the astronauts did not know how
those animals fared in weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
NASA said it will decide this week whether to repeat the
Neurolab mission in August to fill the flight gap created by the
anticipated delay in space station construction.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Fund Stalls Planned Bourse in Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Lack of funds to shop infrastructural
facilities and man power training might have stalled the Nigerian
government's plan to establish a stock exchange in the capital
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The plan, contained in the this year's government budget, may
not be actualized this fiscal year because of the need to provide
hi-tech trading and clearing systems, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the current estimates adopted from the Nigerian Stock
Exchange (NSE) operating in Lagos, the proposed Abuja Stock
Exchange (ASE) needed about 15 billion Naira (about 183 million
U.S. Dollars) as take-off grant, according to sources at the
Central Bank of Nigeria and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The two official institutions are charged with the
responsibility to establish the Abuja bourse, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"With the progress made by NSE, the only way to attract
companies for listing and sustained investors' interests, quoted
companies on ASE are to think and trade by automation," one of
the sources was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Citing Securities and Exchange Commission sources, the report
said that following the current automated clearing and delivery
system at NSE and the scheduled kick-off in June last year of the
computerized transactions, ASE must have to adopt automation
trading from inception.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, the inability of the
government to provide necessary funds has made it impossible for
the negotiation with foreign vendors who are interested in the
supply contracts for the ASE infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Other impediments include absence of ASE articles and
memorandum of association, as well as delay in the proposed
reforms in the Securities and Exchange Commission as contained in
the 1998 budget.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Chief Negotiator Hopes U.S. Will </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat Sunday expressed the hope that the U.S. will uphold its
initiative in the forthcoming London meetings on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, even in case of Israeli rejection.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who accompanies Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat to the London meetings, was quoted by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency as making the remarks in Gaza
before departure to London.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. initiative, which has not been made
public, called for the transfer of 13.1 percent of the West Bank
territories to Palestinian controlled area, and the transfer of 12
per cent of the Israeli controlled area to the jointly controlled
area.
</P>
<P>
By implementing these items, Erekat said, full Palestinian
sovereignty will cover 18 per cent of the West Bank territories,
and Palestinian civil administration will spread to 26 per cent of
the remaining territories of the jointly-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
Erekat added that the U.S. initiative calls among other things
for a pledge to implement the third stage of redeployment in the
West Bank by midyear of 1998, preparatory to the commencement of
negotiations on the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative also includes the execution of the
requirements of the transition period, foremost among which are
the inauguration of the Gaza airport, the safe passage between
Gaza and the West Bank, and release of captives and detainees.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Nabil Amr, advisor to Arafat, has said that
Arafat has called upon U.S. Vice President Al Gore during their
meeting Saturday evening in Ramallah to make public the
U.S. initiative in the course of the London meetings, so that the
attitudes of each party may be exposed.
</P>
<P>
Besides Erekat, the delegation accompanying Arafat to the
London meetings also comprises Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen),
secretary general of the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Assures French People of Harmlessness of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac Sunday
again assured the French people of the harmlessness of the
European single currency euro, describing it as "a modern way of
working together" with other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statement in an interview on the TF1 television
channel after a European Union summit formally adopted the euro
this weekend in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his personal pride over euro by claiming that his
grandson, who is only two years old, knows euro too.
</P>
<P>
Chirac aimed to convince the French people that the adoption of
euro will benefit France, instead of being an "abandoning of
sovereignty" to a greater Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the on-going dispute over euro in France is "a
quarrel between the old and the modern."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed satisfaction over the acceptance by other
European countries of the social model for Europe primarily
presented by France.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I was the only one. Today, all the people have
adopted that," he said in reference to the common European
mobilization to fight unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also urged the European Union to reform its institutions
so that it will be easier to absorb new member countries in
eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Delegation Leaves for Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese delegation has left
Sunday for the Nairobi peace talks with rebels, but showing a lack
of optimism for a success.
</P>
<P>
The delegation level was downgraded from the vice presidential
to the foreign ministerial one just prior to the departure. This
has been interpreted as a reflection of pessimism in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement to the press, the delegation said it
is important that John Garang's rebel movement should take their
share of responsibility in bringing peace to southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
For the part of the government delegation led by Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail, it is keen to seek a resolution of
all differences and to make progress in the Monday negotiations,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will be held under the auspices of the
Inter-governmental Authority on Development.
</P>
<P>
Rebels have been fighting since 1983 against the Islamic
government to press for increased autonomy for the southern third
of Sudan, which is mainly African, Christian and Animist. Garang's
Sudanese People's Liberation Army is the largest rebel group.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Warns Rightwing Parties Against Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac Sunday
warned the country's rightwing parties against internal disorder
and called on them to maintain their union.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we are in a period where one should avoid
disorders. To face up to the responsibilities of each, one should
be strong, and it is union which makes strength," he said in an
interview on the TF1 television.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Chirac to appeal to the rightwing
oppositions for unity, after the Gaullist Rally for the Republic
(RPR) and the Union for French Democracy plunged into a disarray
in the wake of the regional elections in March, in which they lost
to the Socialist-led leftwing coalition.
</P>
<P>
But Chirac refrained from criticizing the RPR, of which he was
the founder, for abstaining in a voting of the National Assembly
last week on the adoption of the European single currency by
France.
</P>
<P>
"I will not talk about the disputes or the parliamentary
procedures but, in the background, one cannot scold an opposition
party for opposing not Europe -- which it had said clear enough --
but the (Socialist) government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a Gaullist, he no longer formally leads the
RPR.

<HEADLINE> ECB Deal Draws Criticism in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- German economic experts and business
leaders Monday poured sharp criticism on a compromise reached
among European Union leaders over the leadership of the new
European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
The attacks came after an announcement by former Dutch central
bank chief Wim Duisenberg in the wake of his appointment as the
first president of the ECB at the EU Brussels summit.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg announced that he would serve only four years
instead of the full eight-year term in order to make way for the
French candidate Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Hax, a German government economic thinktank, said that
the deal to split the eight-year terms of the first ECB president
between the French and German-backed candidates undermined the
independence of the new bank at its birth.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can be elected only to announce that he will accept
early retirement," he said, adding that the move did not take a
relevant Maastricht treaty requirement seriously.
</P>
<P>
The German Banking Federation on Monday regretted the
deal-making, saying that the ECB leadership dispute had shown
clearly that national considerations still put a strain on
decision-making in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The most blistering attacks were directed at German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl with the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
accusing him of caving in to French demands at the Brussels summit.
</P>
<P>
The impression given by Bonn that Kohl was the dominant
decision-maker in Europe had proven to be false, said the SPD
finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier.
</P>
<P>
"Kohl is not only politically shaken at home, but also not in a
position to assert himself abroad," she said.
</P>
<P>
The SPD on Monday also asked for a parliament hearing on the
ECB compromise, which it viewed as a breach of the Maastricht
treaty stipulation requiring the eight-year term of the ECB chief
as a condition of the independence of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Stoiber, premier of the southern German state of
Bavaria, also warned Sunday that the compromise on ECB leadership
would not put a stop to Germany's already frail public trust in
the single European currency, the Euro.

CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's national carrier Royal Jordanian (RJ)
registered a 1 percent rise in revenues in 1997 over the previous
year, the Jordan Times newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
RJ's President and Chief Executive Officer Nader Dahabi Sunday
told the 34th marketing and sales meeting of the airlines that the
outcome is "the worst (for the RJ) since the slump associated with
the Gulf war (in 1991)."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the slowdown to continued political tension in
the Middle East and a drop in demand on Far Eastern routes caused
by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), one
of the largest chemical companies in the Middle East, Sunday
signed a loan contract of 400 million U.S. dollars with national
and Gulf banks to partially finance expansion of a petrochemical
project.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by SABIC and the banks said the
project is aimed at expanding the sector of producing
polypropylene and doubling its output to about 640,000 tonnes a
year.
</P>
<P>
SABIC owns 16 industrial plants that produce various
petrochemical products and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Director General of the Standard Chartered London
Bank Dubai branch Geoffrey Rhodes has forecast a rise in gold
price in world markets this year.
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, regarded as one of the most prominent experts in the
world gold trade, was quoted by the Al-Ittihad newspaper of the
United Arab Emirates on Monday as saying the gold price would
reach 290-330 dollars an ounce by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Abu Dhabi National Bank, gold price in the UAE
stood at 311 dollars an ounce on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, a South African, said that his country shows increasing
interest in Dubai as a gold trade center in the Gulf region. He
expected it would export more than 100 tonnes of gold to Dubai
this year, compared with 54.2 tonnes last year and 13.4 tonnes in
1996.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A study made by the Industrial Bank of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) has shown that demand for gold in the country
grew by 21 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study, published by UAE's Al-Khalij newspaper on Monday,
said the UAE has witnessed an increasing demand for gold in the
1990's, jumping from 163 tonnes in 1991 to more than 660 tonnes
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Gold Council, the total demand for gold
in the world markets rose by 9 percent in 1997, with India being
the biggest market, whose demand accounted for 17 percent of the
world's total.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Emerge Strong From Crisis: IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Asia will emerge from its current
crisis not only stronger financially, but also as a showcase for
good governance and policy making, International Monetary Fund
(IMF) managing director Michel Camdessus said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus made this observation in his speech at the opening of
the IMF-Singapore Regional Training Institute here.
</P>
<P>
He said that Asia had long been an example of the benefits of
globalization. In 1996, the region attracted almost half of the
235 billion U.S. dollars in private capital flow to developing and
transition economies.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, some of those flows had clearly not been invested
wisely. However, he added that moves towards globalization had
allowed many Asian countries to accelerate investment and growth
and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
These benefits in turn filtered through to advanced economies
in the form of buoyant export markets, new jobs and higher
investment returns.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also noted that Asia's more recent experiences
had highlighted the risks for countries tapping global capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
This had underlined the need for timely release of economic
data, sound policies, strong domestic financial systems and
greater transparency, he said.
</P>
<P>
He therefore stressed that it was vital to ensure that capital
account liberalization proceeded in an orderly manner.

JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of the world's top
telecommunication companies and dozens of ministers from around
the world will gather at Africa Telecom 98, Africa's largest
telecommunication exhibition, which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela opened the event at the
National Exhibition and Recreation Center.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was organized by the South African
Communications Department, the International Telecommunication
Union and the United Nations telecommunications agency.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Mandela called on delegates to use the
five-day event to prepare Africa for the information society of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Describing Africa as a huge untapped market for
telecommunications and information technologies which offer vast
investment opportunities, Mandela called for more private
investment in the rapidly expanding sector.
</P>
<P>
The event, whose theme is "African Renaissance: Spectrum of
Opportunities", will help put Africa in the global village,
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the event, made up of a forum and an
exhibition, would focus on telecommunications needs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 people are expected to visit the exhibition where
300 of the world's top telecommunication and broadcasting
companies and other organizations are displaying and
demonstrating the latest innovations and applications.
</P>
<P>
The companies participating in the exhibition include Acyclon

</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 people will attend the forum, including more than
40 telecommunication ministers from all over the world. They and
industry players will discuss development issues, organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be debated include Africa's policy and regulation
strategies, communications technology options, broadcasting, and
women and technology.
</P>
<P>
The show would be important for sub-Saharan Africa, which is
in the middle of an economic turnaround, South African officials
said.

CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday sent a message to the Group of Seven Industrialized
Countries (G-7) to express wishes of the developing countries to
forge constructive ties, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak addressed the message to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the current president of the G-7, a club of rich countries
in the world, namely the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reviewed in his message the "aspirations and worries"
of the developing countries that are eager to have an economic
dialogue with the developed countries on issues of common
interest, said Dawlat Hassen, Egypt's assistant foreign minister
for economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
She said there are several issues which require consultations
and dialogue among the developing and developed countries. But she
did not specify.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is the chairman of the Group-15, an organization that
includes 17 developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Because its economies are the most advanced among the
underdeveloped countries of the south, the G-15 considers itself
the counterpart of the G-7, said the Egyptian official.
</P>
<P>
The aim of setting up the G-15 in 1989 was to strengthen
economic links among the group and the countries of the south in
general and to promote constructive dialogue between north and
south, she said.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 countries will convene their eighth summit on May
11-13 in Cairo to discuss the Asian financial crisis, world trade
order, south-south cooperation and south-north dialogue.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Offset Declining Oil Prices (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China plans to reduce imports of
crude oil and related finished products, increase the domestic oil
supply for foreign-funded enterprises and counter oil smuggling in
order to reduce the effects of falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)
said that international oil prices have dropped sharply since
October last year, with prices falling by an average 30 percent, or
over six US dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Declining oil prices worldwide have seriously affected China's
oil market and have at the same time further widened price gaps
between the domestic and international oil markets.
</P>
<P>
For example, price differences for diesel oil and gasoline on
the domestic and international markets stands at 300 and 500 yuan
per ton respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sharp difference in prices has resulted in increased
import of oil products. Customs statistics show that China
imported 33.8 million tons of crude oil and finished oil products
in 1997, up 140 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that excessive import of oil products has
interrupted the balance between the nation's oil demand and supply
and has at the same time adversely affected the pricing system
for oil products. China's ex-factory price for finished oil
products has dropped by an average of slightly over 300 yuan per
ton over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Due to influence of oil refining, China has also suffered from
sluggish sales for onshore oil, with stockpiles of crude oil
growing by over one million tons. This has in turn forced various
oil fields to reduce production levels, according to the
official.

<P>
A total of 1,000 wells have been capped in oil fields in
Daqing, Jilin and the Tarim Basin, with output for the first
quarter of this year falling by 700,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, oil export prices have dropped by some 33
percent, with the drop significantly affecting both exports and
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Experts stress China must squarely face the pressure of
declining oil prices worldwide by strengthening macro-control over
oil markets and promoting the rational distribution of oil
resources. They also call for accelerated reform of the oil
circulation and pricing systems.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for China to initially establish a new oil system
which combines upstream and downstream production, in additon to
integrating internal and external trade, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The country will also accelerate the development of natural gas
and develop related production as a new growth point for the oil
sector.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be placed on the use of advanced scientific
achievements and the transformation of operational mechanisms in
order to enhance economic efficiency and reduce production costs.
</P>
<P>
Even more significantly, however, China will reduce import of
crude oil and finished oil products and introduce strong measure
to curb oil smuggling to protect domestic oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises will be urged to import less and
purchase more domestic oil products.

<HEADLINE> AL: Arab Summit Hinges on London Meeting Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Monday that the issue of holding an Arab
Summit will be determined by the outcome of London meetings on
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If the London meetings fail because of Netanyahu's
intransigence, then the issue (of an Arab Summit) will be
determined," he said, quoted by the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet
separately in the British capital with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a move to
break the 14-month-old deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have long been considering a summit to coordinate
Arab stand in the peace process. It is the Arab leaders, not the
Arab League, that are empowered to exactly set and determine when
a well-arranged Arab summit could be held, said Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab body is only a supportive element to help such a
conference be held," the AL chief added.
</P>
<P>
The prospect for convening a summit of 22 Arab countries seems
near, as hopes for a breakthrough in the forthcoming London
meetings on the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are slim due to
the continued Israeli rejection of the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative on an Israeli troop redeployment from 13.1
percent of the West Bank to revive the peace process has been
accepted by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have stalled since March
1997, while peace talks on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks have
been on ice for over two years.
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. assurance that there is "a long way" to go in the
Mideast peace making, the Arab countries have repeatedly warned
serious consequences if the London meetings fail.
</P>
<P>
The last Arab summit was convened in Cairo in June 1996. Egypt
has been cool to an imminent summit, saying that the 1996
resolutions are still binding.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Environmental factors remain
a major cause of sickness and death in many regions of the world
despite vast improvements in health globally over the past several
decades, a UN report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report "World resources: 1998-1999", produced jointly by
the World Resources Institute, the United Nations Environment
Program, the United Nations Development Program and the world
Bank, says in the poorest regions, environment-related illnesses
cause 11 million childhood deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
Environmental threats to health are not limited to the
developing countries, the report points out. In the United States
alone, some 80 million people are exposed to level of air
pollution that can impair health.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 100 countries, both developed and developing, still use
leaded gasoline, unnecessarily exposing their citizens to a
pollutant long known to cause permanent brain damage," the report
says.
</P>
<P>
The 369-page publication calls attention to situations in which
problems and solutions are relatively well understood. Removing
lead from gasoline, for example, could immediately reduce health
threats.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the reports illustrates the many potential benefits
of incorporating concerns about environmental threats to health
into development planning at the outset.
</P>
<P>
"Making the development a central component in public health
strategies in essential to ensure health for everyone in the
twenty-first century," it states.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and ousted first prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
Monday agreed to send envoys to discuss the integration of
Ranariddh's forces with government army.
</P>
<P>
They held talks separately with Japanese Ambassador Masaki
Saito earlier Monday on a Japan-brokered peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh had said in April that he was ready to order his
forces, now holed up in northwest Cambodia, to give up the
territory they control and rejoin the government army.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan is aimed at ensuring Ranariddh, who won
Cambodia's last election in 1993, can take part in the next
election in July.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh returned here from Bangkok on Monday and had
expressed his hope of meeting Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Hun Sen, the Japanese Ambassador said his country
will provide Cambodia with three million U.S. dollars for building
ballot boxes and 1.26 million U.S. dollars for voting booths.
</P>
<P>
Japan will send 30 observers to Cambodia to observe the
election.

<HEADLINE> Albright Slightly More Hopeful over London Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said here Monday afternoon that she was "ever so slightly
more hopeful" about making some progress at the crucial Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a four-hour-long talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a central London hotel, Albright
was quoted by BBC television as saying: "Based on the tone, we're
ever so slightly more hopeful. But that's about hope, not
expectation."
</P>
<P>
Albright, whose government is striving to revive the deadlocked
Middle East peace process, will hold separate talks with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Washington is proposing that Israel hands over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians, a new peace initiative accepted by
the Palestinians but rejected by Israel, which agreed only to
return 9 percent of the occupied West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair held separate
talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat to
exchange views on the crucial peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians and Israelis have so far upheld their
tough positions and refused to make further concessions.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa here Monday called on
Hong Kong's young people to strive for a brighter future of Hong
Kong and for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the call in his speech at a May 4th Youth Day
reception organized by the Hong Kong United Youth Association,
which was held today at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the May 4th Youth Day is a festival for the
Chinese young people and it has a special significance for the
young people in Hong Kong after Hong Kong returned to China on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the history of the May 4th Student Movement of 1919
focusing on anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, Tung said that
great changes have taken place in China today in terms of
politics, economy and international status.
</P>
<P>
China now enjoys a stable political situation and the living
standard of the Chines people has been greatly improved, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
China not only maintains independence and acts on its own, but
also plays an increasingly important role in international
political and economic affairs, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung hoped that Hong Kong's young people can seize the
opportunity of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the policy
of "one country, two systems" to adopt the great idea of building
Hong Kong and contributing to the rejuvenating of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the SAR government and youth organizations in
Hong Kong can help the young people to adopt this idea.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 people attended Today's reception, including
members of the Hong Kong United Youth Association, representatives
from the All China Youth Association, and representatives from
youth organizations of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Macao and
Taiwan.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Monday called for a cultural dialogue between Paris and its South
Pacific colony of New Caledonia, which is now preparing for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, who arrived in the island Monday morning for a 36-hour
visit, inaugurated a indigenous Kanak cultural center called
Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center, named after a Kanak
nationalist killed in 1989 by a Kanak extremist for signing a
peace treaty with France.
</P>
<P>
The cultural center had a "double mission -- to witness the
Kanak identity and to offer a place of dialogue and exchanges with
all the Oceanian cultures." Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
"The political fight has a cultural dimension. It is the
feeling of denial of Kanak cultural identity which was the origin
of its revolt," said Jospin in reference to the independence
movement of the island which started in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Jospin will sign an agreement Tuesday recognizing an
irreversible transition toward independence by New Caledonia prior
to a referendum on its final status due between 2013 and 2018.
</P>
<P>
"Fully recognized, the Kanak culture can open itself to
others. The dialogue of cultures should be a means to construct
peace," he said, while criticizing the local French authorities
for "imprudence, provocations and injustices" inflicted upon the
Kanak people in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Center, designed by Italian architect
Renzo Piano, consists of six separate white buildings looking
like blocks and overlooking a bay in Noumea, capital of New
Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
The project was decided by President Francois Mitterrand who
first gave the green light for independence after a series of
military conflicts between the French and Kanak communities in
1980s.

SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund

that the IMF disburse its next tranche of aid money to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that he was convinced that Indonesia was
strongly committed to implementing the financial reform package it
had agreed to with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Indonesia is likely to get the much awaited one
billion U.S. dollars disbursement from the IMF after the Executive
Board meets in Washington later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised package negotiated between Indonesia and the
IMF, one billion U.S. dollars a month will be disbursed over the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
"We have observed that all the prior action they had pledged to
adopt before going to our Executive Board has been adopted,"
Camdessus said.
</P>

"So I am in a position to tell the Executive Board that it
seems only appropriate to disburse the IMF contribution," he
added.

He also praised Singapore as one of the most successful Asian
economies, saying that Singapore was a model of macroeconomics
stability and sustained high quality growth for countries around

<HEADLINE> Qingdao Hosts APEC Service Trade Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The first service trade seminar
sponsored by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opened
today in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The event attracted delegates from 15 member states,
representatives from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
experts from Japan, the United States, Australia, the Republic of
Korea, Thailand and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), told participants that the rapid development
of the service trade constitutes a prominent feature in global
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 worldwide volume for the service trade hit a record
1.2 trillion US dollars and accounted for almost a quarter of the
world's goods trade volume.
</P>
<P>
China's service trade volume grew from 5.5 billion US dollars
in 1982 to 40.9 billion US dollars in 1996, with the average
annual growth rate standing at 15.4 percent, said Long, adding the
the latter figure was significantly higher than the worldwide
average.
</P>
<P>
Service trade currently accounts for some 30 percent of China's
gross domestic product, with the nation's ranking moving from 22nd
to 16th place in the world in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, Long noted that a wide margin continues to exist
between China and other member states in terms of national
treatment, market transparency, and the collection of statistics
and information.
</P>
<P>
He said the seminar will not only promote exchanges of
information and the experiences of APEC members, but will also
help Chinese officials gain a better understanding of the
regulations and operations of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar will concentrate on eight topics,
including WTO and APEC policies on the service trade and both
problems and solutions regarding financial liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Pak Reform Package Starts Showing Positive Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said
here Monday the government's reform package has started showing
positive signs in the economy, with both agricultural and
industrial sectors recording improvements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the pre-budget annual meeting of the Advisory
Council of the Finance Division, Aziz gave a brief assessment of
the economy of the country in the first three quarters of 1997-98
fiscal year (July 1 to June 30), sources present at the meeting
said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will have in-depth discussions of budgetary
proposals and recommendations for 1998-99 budget.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted Pakistan's economic performance over the last few
years has been marked by a deterioration of its fiscal and current
account deficits, slowing down of economic activity and
double-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government introduced a series of reforms to
restore macro-economic stability and revive industrial and
agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing affects of the financial crises in East and
Southeast Asia on the process of industrial revival and export
expansion in Pakistan, he said, nevertheless the impact of these
reforms have already started showing positive signs in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the government has been successful in reviving the
agriculture sector from a low growth of 0.7 percent in 1996-97
fiscal year to over six percent in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest estimates, wheat production this year
is expected to reach 18.6 million tons which will be 12 percent
higher than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production this year is expected to be 9.2 million
bales, slightly lower than the target of 10 million bales and the
last year's output of 9.4 million bales, according to Aziz.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that revival of large-scale manufacturing
has been slower than expected, Aziz said on the whole the
large-scale manufacturing has recovered from the negative growth
of 1.4 percent in 1996-97 fiscal year to over six percent in the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Although the first five months of 1997-98 fiscal year did not
exhibit any sign of revival in industrial production, the
industrial sector began to move forward from December 1997 onward,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also said the average industrial growth in the first eight
months of 1997-98 fiscal year grew by 6.2 percent over the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the upward trend will continue before the end of the
current fiscal year. In overall terms, the growth of GDP is
forecast at 5.4 percent against the target of six percent, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that the performance of tax collections has been
mixed. In the first nine months of 1997-98 fiscal year the Central
Board of Revenue collected 199.7 billion rupees (4.5 billion U.S.
dollars) against the revised revenue target of 305.3 billion
rupees (6.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, he expected that the overall fiscal deficit will
remain close to the original budget estimates of 148 billion
rupees (3.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the external sector, the minister said, there has been
considerable improvement in 1997-98 fiscal year. Exports during
July 1997 to February 1998 had witnessed an increase of five
percent over the same period of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in this period declined by 11 percent and the trade
deficit was reduced considerably, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the current account deficit during the first eight
months of 1997-98 fiscal year witnessed a substantial improvement
of 68 percent to 1.041 billion dollars over the level of 3.222
billion dollars in the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister emphasized to diversify exports both in
terms of items and destination of exports, as Pakistan's exports
increased only by five percent during the first three quarters of
the current fiscal year which is far below the annual target
despite the announcement of liberal export and enhancement
incentive package.

LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 650,000 children in Zambia
between the ages of seven to 13 have no access to education, a
senior government official revealed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Newton Ng'uni, Deputy Minister of Science, Technology and
Vocational Training, said that the situation is worse in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Only one-third of primary school children find places in
secondary schools and other higher learning institutions, the
Zambia News Agency quoted the deputy minister as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Newton Ng'uni made the remarks at the opening of a two-day
sub-regional meeting on appropriate media and technology
application in open and distance learning.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the formal education and training system
has no capacity to address the problem of out-of-school youths
because they are too many.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to improve facilities and infrastructure
for distance learning to enable more children to have an
opportunity of education.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister called on Zambian children to turn to
distance learning through radio which is cheaper because they do
not have to pay any school fees.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Likely to Adjust Economic Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos on
Monday said that the government is flexible to adjust its economic
target for 1998 depending on the developments of the world and
regional economies.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked the government
to revise its fiscal targets following the not-too-good results of
the first quarter performance in tax collections, particularly
those from the Bureau of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Ramos described the IMF proposal as a "regular give-and-take
between the IMF and the Philippines and the other economies in
which it is involved."
</P>
<P>
Because of some external factors, he said, there is a need to
constantly monitor and adjust the country's economic target for
1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will review whatever developments that
take place in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has described the targets set by government fiscal
managers as "ambitious."
</P>
<P>
The IMF believes that the consolidated public sector deficit
could reach 26.6 billion pesos (682 million U.S. dollars) for
1998, or higher than the 22.9 billion pesos (587 million dollars)
the government hopes to attain.

DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will be able to export urea
fertilizer very soon, the Press Information Department said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This achievement is going to be materialized as a result of
successful implementation of a package of measures taken by the
government, it said.
</P>
<P>
The total stock of urea is 308,000 tons at six urea fertilizer
factories and 28 godowns, it said adding that it will be increased
to 430,000 tons by the end of June this year after meeting the
country's demand of urea through production.
</P>
<P>
All the six urea fertilizer factories will operate at 100
percent capacity immediately after commissioning of gas supply
from the country's first offshore gas field at Sangu, which will
supply gas to urea factories in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
The Sangu gas field will enable the factories to produce 2.15
million tons of urea against the expected annual country's demand
for about two million tons, and the actual demand for urea in this
year is 1.92 million tons, it added.

ADDIS ABABA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki has decribed the relations between Eritrea and Yemen as
strategic though difference existed between the two countries
over the ownership of the Zukur-hanish Archipelago in the
southern Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Isaias Afwerki said that Eritrea considers its ''relations
with Yemen as strategic regardless of the problems which happened
lately between the two countries concerning the difference over

Sea'', reported the latest issue of English weekly ''Eritrea
Profile''.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Egyptian Arabic newspaper

regarding this question was to refer the matter to an
international arbitration court for resolving the difference over
the archipelago.''
</P>

decision and the Yemeni side is also committed to what we have
agreed upon concerning the verdict of the Internatioal

"We are now on the eve of the declaration of the verdict of
the International Arbitration Court concerning the issue of the

He said that the eternal and strategic relations between Yemen
and Eritrea would remain and the temporary difference will not
have any future implications regarding the relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is hopeful for the difficulties
hindering the successive growth of the Eritrean-Yemeni relations
to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic development in Eritrea, President Isaias
said major economic achievements were realized in recent years,

scholars to China and providing higher education to Chinese
students.
</P>
<P>
He said the hard work of foreign experts has fostered a group
of backbone professionals in China's scientific and academic
fields, and in turn stimulated the development of the country's
new and high technology sector.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic development has created opportunities
for experts willing to contribute to worldwide progress in the
educational, scientific and technological sectors, said Zhang. He
also expressed hope that experts will strengthen cooperation with
China.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 experts from over 50 countries or regions are
currently working in China, and Beijing University hosts some
300-odd experts on an annual basis.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army to Be Deployed for Poll Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- About 116,000 Philippine government
troops will be deployed to ensure a peaceful general election on
May 11, a senior military official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
General Clemente Mariano, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines, said that more than half of the 116,000-man force
will be deployed in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mariano said the military will pay particular attention to the
provinces of Lanao del Sur and Jolo in Mindanao as many places in
the two provinces are seen as election hot spots.
</P>
<P>
Mariano said the deployment of troops was supposed to start
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mariano's statements came after reports said that some 1,000
heavily armed members of the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) warned that they opposed the holding of the May 11 polls
because many candidates were expected to cheat.
</P>
<P>
Mariano also said that the Armed Forces would declare red alert
four days before the election day.
</P>
<P>
Election-related violence is on the rise in the country with
the election day approaching. At least 21 people, including some
candidates, have been killed in election-related incidents since
January this year.
</P>
<P>
Fears are mounting among the opposition and business circles
that the rising election violence could cause a failure of
elections or delay the proclamation of winning candidates, leading
to political instability in the country.
</P>
<P>
But President Fidel Ramos has repeatedly assured the people
that there will be a peaceful and clean election, a timely
proclamation of the new president and a smooth transfer of power.

<HEADLINE> Some NGO Members Are Mere Job-Seekers: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua)- The Burundi government has said that
some members of the non-governmental organizations (NGO) working
in Burundi are "mere job-seekers".
</P>
<P>
There are now about 40 NGOs in Burundi, but the authorities
said that although some have proven helpful, others are made of
"mere job-seekers," said Burundian Minister of Communication and
government spokesman, Pierre Claver Ndayicariye on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed an accusatory finger at some NGOs who
always send out alarming reports with the hope to see their
presence justified and therefore obtain more financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Ndayicariye sharply criticized the work of some NGOs whose
reason to be in the country is not to assist the population but
rather to secure "employment opportunities," the Rwandan News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This reaction followed media reports quoting some NGOs as
saying that about 10 people died everyday in the camps of the
internally displaced persons (IDPs), which house between 500,000
and 700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"These reports are absolutely unfounded and ill-intentioned,"
Ndayicariye said.
</P>
<P>
The minister affirmed that the phenomenon of IDPs camps is a
thing of the past since many people have resettled in the
war-torn country in the wake of the restoration of security in
many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 500,000 or so IDPS is highly exaggerated and there is
nothing of the sort in Burundi, the minister indicated.
</P>
<P>
"These false reports emanate from people who are jealous of
the achievements of our government in that regard, and endeavor
to tarnish its image" the Minister noted.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Chief Maintains GDP Growth Forecast of 3.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The growth forecast of 3.5 percent
for Hong Kong in 1998 is "quite achievable", Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures published Monday, GDP growth
decelerated markedly to 2.7 percent in real terms over a year
earlier in the fourth quarter of 1997, down from 5.9 percent, 6.8
percent and 6.0 percent in the first three quarters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The GDP figure is "slightly better than I've expected", the
financial official told a press conference prior to his South
American tour.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-1999 budget speech, "I forecast for 1997 as a
whole, the performance was 5.2 percent. Whereas, against the
figure of GDP growth of the last quarter, the overall 1997 growth
rate is now 5.3 percent," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident, for 1998, my forecast of growth of 3.5
percent is quite achievable," he stressed, claiming that the
forecast rate is realistic and has good grounds.
</P>
<P>
But he added that as economic forecasts are revised biannually,
"we would make revisions, if necessary, in the middle of the
year."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the relatively high unemployment rate, which
soared to 3.5 percent for the first quarter of the year, Tsang
said the administration as a whole is addressing the issue.
</P>
<P>
A task force led by Tsang was formed Monday to look into the
question. The first meeting of the task force is expected to take
place on June 3.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 letters had been sent to institutions across Hong
Kong, inviting their views on how to create more jobs, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang is starting his visit to Brazil, Argentina and Chile
Tuesday, heading a high-ranking mission grouping representatives
from Hong Kong's financial and banking, telecommunications and
infrastructure sectors.
</P>
<P>
The tour is aimed at exploring the potential for developing new
markets and investments for Hong Kong in South America. It will
also lay out the benefits Hong Kong offers as the gateway to China
and as the premiere site for businesses to set up their regional
headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his way to South America, Tsang will stop in Tokyo, where he
 will update the local business community on the present state of
the Hong Kong economy, and then in Geneva where he will meet with
Director-General of the World Trade Organization Renato Ruggiero.
</P>
<P>
Tsang will return to Hong Kong on May 24.

<HEADLINE> Japan Supports East Asian Countries: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan claimed here Monday that it
is playing a leading role in helping Asian countries recover from
the current financial turmoil, and vowed that it will continue to
do so, as it is the largest economy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public lecture entitled "Japan and East Asia:
Outlook for the New Millennium", visiting Japanese Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi said that Japan, as the largest economy in
Asia, "feels a responsibility, despite its own very difficult
situation, to do everything it can to help its East Asian friends
through this time of economic trial."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to exercise the leadership to support the
East Asian countries in cooperation with the international
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister also said that Japan has
contributed, both in international efforts led by IMF
(International Monetary Fund) and in bilateral programs, a total
of 37 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was a sum that far exceeds the assistance
from any extra-regional country.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also said that Japan fully recognized how important its
own economic recovery is to restoring stability to the East Asian
economies. He said the recently announced Japanese economic
stimulus package of tax cuts and public spending amounted to "an
unprecedented 16 trillion yen, or about 120 billion U.S. dollars".
</P>
<P>
These measures were expected to "put the Japanese economy back
on the path of self-sustained and domestic-demand-led growth", he
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian NGO Removes 10 Tons of Hyacinth from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian environmental
organization has removed from the Lake Victoria 10 tons of water
hyacinth, a weed that is spreading rapidly in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Raphael Danga, the Executive Chairman of the Lake Nyanza
Environmental Sanitation Organization (LANESO), said that 100
members of the organization from various parts of Tanzania have
participated in an operation of removing hyacinth in the Mwanza
town on the southern shore of the Lake Victoria, media reports
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Danga said LANECSO, a non-governmental organization, is
committed to environmental protection and is spending much of its
time and resources on controlling pollution in the Lake Victoria,
the second largest freshwater lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
The lake areas have been infested with the weed, he said, but
their efforts have been seriously handicapped by lack of modern
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Danga said that the organization has got some equipment from
the Lake Victoria Environmental Project (LVEMP) aided by the
World Bank, which commends their efforts in removing the weed in
the lake.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the business community, the government and the
public to help the organization to obtain more modern equipment
in rooting out the water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's office recently donated equipment worth
14 million shillings (about 2,100 U.S. Dollars) in response.

SEOUL, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean exports to southeast
Asian countries plummeted 31.2 percent to 3.47 billion
U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, the Korea
International Trade Association said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Indonesia plunged 51 percent while those to
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore fell 46.5 percent, 36.7 percent
and 30.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The trade association attributed the export decline to the
ongoing financial crisis in South Korea and to local financial
institutions' unwillingness to deal with export bills to and from
the region.
</P>
<P>
The nation's major trade rivals in the southeast Asian market,
including China, Japan and the United States, also saw a fall in
exports to the region because of an overall decline in consumer
demand, said the association.

<HEADLINE> Public Holidays Cost S. Africa Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Public holidays cost the South
African economy about 2 billion Rand (400 million U.S. Dollars) a
day, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is based on the industry turnover on an average
working day, which is about 2.8 billion Rand (560 million
Dollars). As many businesses stay open on public holidays, the
average cost of a holiday is 2 billion Rand, The Star reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The gold mining industry, a major sector in the gold-rich
country, alone loses up to 97 million Rand (19.4 million Dollars)
during the 24-hour break.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Mines, which represents most of South Africa's
mining companies, said the 97 million Rand did not include
compound losses suffered by supply companies or losses suffered
while trying to get mines back to full production.
</P>
<P>
The recent spate of public holidays, from Easter to the
National Day and the May 1 Worker's Day, has again stirred debate
over South Africa's 13 annual breaks, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some business leaders and politicians think there should be
fewer holidays in order to increase productivity, though millions
of people consider certain holidays to be important for religious
or political reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said it does not think there are
unnecessary holidays, and it believes the relaxation enhances
productivity.
</P>
<P>
South African Chamber of Business labor director said small
service businesses were probably hardest hit by the holidays.
"They complain to us all the time about this," he said.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University, one of China's
most prestigious universities, opened a new library today as part
of ceremonies marking its centennial anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The new facility covers 27,000 sq.m. and shelves over three
million titles.
</P>
<P>
The old Beijing University Library, which covers 50,000
sq.m. and has reading rooms with 4,500 seats, shelves over seven
million titles and ranks as the largest college library in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The new library features traditional Chinese architecture
adopted by the Yanyuan on campus. The facility features
state-of-the-art electronic equipment, automatic systems and
networks which provide comprehensive modern services for patrons.
</P>
<P>
University officials note that completion of the new facility
indicates a significant change from a traditional to a modern
library. They say the new facility will play a more important role
in academic development at the university and help to ensure the
nation's comprehensive educational progress.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the library commenced in June 1996 and was
completed at a total cost of 100 million yuan (12 million
U.S. dollars), including a donation of 10 million U.S. dollars
from Hong Kong entrepreneur Li Ka-shing.

<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
said here Monday that there has been no progress so far in the
crucial Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair at No 10 Downing Street, Arafat urged the Israelis to
accept the American Middle East peace initiative under which
Israel will have to hand over 13 percent of West Bank to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who described the Israeli position as "intransigent",
said: "If Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu is seriously
concerned and interested in peace, today is the day."
</P>
<P>
Forecasting the outcome if the London talks failed, he
warned: "Mr Netanyahu will have to bear the responsibility of the
repercussions and the chaos which will ensue."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who met with Blair early Monday, has ruled out the
possibility of making further concessions by saying that Israel
had "gone the extra mile, well beyond the extra mile".
</P>
<P>
An Israeli government spokesman made it clear on Sunday that
it would be "utterly impossible" for Israel to accept the American
proposal by pulling out its troops from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is striving to
revive the deadlocked peace talks, will hold separate talks with
Netanyahu and Arafat here later Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Grants Amnesty to Army Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government declared a
general amnesty period from May 5 to 10 to give military deserters
an opportunity to rejoin the security forces, according to a news
release from the Defense Ministry here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release said in order to make this process more convenient
a list of all deserters have been circulated throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
All deserters could surrender to the nearest police stations, a
Divisional Secretary Office or the nearest security forces camps.
</P>
<P>
Those who surrender during this amnesty period will not be
subject to any punishment and the period of desertion will be
treated as no pay leave, the release stated.
</P>
<P>
Providing shelter or refuge to deserters or employing them is a
 punishable offense, said the release, adding that therefore the
general public are strictly warned to refrain from such an
offense, and those who found guilty of this offense will be
subject to two-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The number of deserters is reportedly estimated to be over
19,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the current military drive to recapture a main highway
in the north of the country from the Tamil rebels is moving slowly
due to lack of troops.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Army will launch a recruitment campaign to
enlist 15,000 troops in schools across the country, according to
local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the army has offered amnesty for deserters on six
occasions and over 10,000 deserters have reportedly returned.
</P>
<P>
During the latest amnesty on July 10-26 last year, a total of
4,206 army deserters returned for duty.

<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Monday upheld
their tough positions on the new American peace initiative before
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in London at the weekend, is expected to
hold separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat later Monday to
revitalize the Middle East peace process which had plunged into
deadlock for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Washington is proposing that Israel hands over 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians, a plan accepted by the
Palestinians but rejected by Israel, which agreed only to return
less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
After a brief meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Monday morning, Netanyahu told reporters outside No. 10 Downing
Street that Israel would not make further concessions.
</P>
<P>
"We have gone the extra mile, well beyond the extra mile,"
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is also meeting Blair Monday, told reporters
Sunday evening at London's Heathrow Airport that the success of
London talks depended on whether Netanyahu accepted the American
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat indicated that Palestinians would make no concessions,
saying: "We have accepted the bare minimum of our demands, the
bare minimum."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians warned that the Middle East peace
process would run into further grave difficulties if Albright
failed to press Israel into handing over at least another 13
percent of the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official was quoted by BBC television as
saying: "I think the meeting today is extremely decisive. It will
decide the fate of this peace process."

The woman, who was pronounced dead at 1:31 a.m. Monday, had

<P>
Twenty-seven of the injured remained in hospitals for treatment
on Sunday. One was in critical condition and 25 were in stable
condition late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
And, as part of the on-going investigation, a vessel with sonar
detecting equipment was sent by the Marine Department on Sunday to

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Grows by 5.3 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) for 1997 grew by 5.3 percent in real terms, slightly faster
than the 5.0 percent growth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Census and Statistics
Department here Monday show that in the fourth quarter of 1997,
Hong Kong's GDP growth decelerated markedly to 2.7 percent in real
terms from a year earlier following corresponding growth of 5.9
percent, 6.8 percent and 6.0 percent in the first three quarters
of the year.
</P>
<P>
This slowdown was mainly attributable to the impact of the
regional financial turmoil spreading to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year comparison for the major GDP components,
private consumption expenditure slowed down considerably to a 3.3
percent growth in real terms in the fourth quarter of 1997, amidst
the marked correction in the stock and property markets since late
October 1997. This contrasted with a marked increase of 11.8
percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government consumption expenditure in national
account terms fell slightly, by 0.3 percent in real terms in the
fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
On investment spending, gross domestic fixed capital formation
maintained its strong growth momentum, rising by 11.5 percent in
real terms in the fourth quarter of 1997 over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of goods grew by 9.6 percent in real terms in the
fourth quarter of 1997 over a year earlier. Within this total,
re-exports grew by 10.3 percent and domestic exports by 5.6
percent. As for imports of goods, the corresponding growth rate
was 8.2 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the Hong
Kong's economy suffered a distinct setback in the fourth quarter
of 1997, as the regional financial turmoil deepened and
intensified.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the impact fell immediately on local
consumer demand. It also aggravated the setback in inbound
tourism. Nevertheless, he said that exports of goods continued to
improve in the fourth quarter. Overall investment spending also
maintained its growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
Mainly on account of the buoyancy before October, GDP still
grew faster in real terms in 1997 than in 1996, he said.

<HEADLINE> Detained S. African Official to Be Released Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Affairs
official Robert McBride, who has been detained in Mozambique for
almost two months for alleged gun smuggling, could be released as
early as this week, Sowetan newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A charge sheet presented to a judge by Mozambican police last
week "has as good as been thrown out of court for its flimsy
details," the paper quoted sources as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The docket, which has been leaked to the South African media
and widely publicized, alleged that Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, and McBride conspired with
Cuban and American diplomats to overthrow the African National
Congress (ANC) government.
</P>
<P>
But McBride's South African lawyer said Sunday that the
American and Cuban diplomats named as McBride's collaborators
were not known to their embassies.
</P>
<P>
A Mozambican general mentioned in the docket has also been
found to be fictitious, the Sowetan report said. The general is
said to have met Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Swaziland to
arrange the training of 80 of "her men" in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
McBride, who heads the Asian desk in the Foreign Ministry, was
arrested in Mozambique on suspicion of arms dealing in early
March. According to the Mozambican law, a suspect may be kept in
custody for up to 49 days before being charged.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrest, McBride was suspended from his post
amid opposition parties' outcry. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said that he was on leave at the time of his arrest and his
Mozambican trip was entirely on his own.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, details of the charges against him are being kept
secret inside Mozambique by the authorities and McBride's legal
representatives.
</P>
<P>
McBride's lawyer said Sunday that the charge sheet clearly
depended on a single statement from a former apartheid informer,
Vusi Mbatha, who was arrested along with McBride in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"This has all been like a fairy tale and I hope to bring
Robert back home this week," the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
McBride's wife Paula was also optimistic, saying that she had
maintained from the start that there was no proof that her
husband was involved in gun smuggling, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, McBride had been at the center of a
firestorm of speculation. Conspiracy buffs claimed that he was
smuggling guns for cash-in-transit robbers, for rebels in East
Timor and even for the Irish Republican Army.

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that China and Japan should expand cooperation and establish
long-term and stable good-neighborly relations in line with
principles set out in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and
Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks today during a meeting with a delegation
from the Japanese Dietmen's League for Japan-China Friendship led
by President Yoshiro Hayashi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that mankind is preparing to enter the 21st century
and statesmen from both countries should contribute to
establishing long-term good-neighborly friendship and raising it
to a new plateau geared to the new century.
</P>
<P>
He said the league has contributed to the normalization of
bilateral diplomatic ties, conclusion of Peace and Friendship
Treaty, and promotion of the healthy development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that today's bilateral relations are the result of the
work of previous generations of leaders who concentrated on the
development of the bilateral friendship, and stressed that their
efforts should be treasured.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral friendship should be carried forward by the
younger generation and noted the more young statesmen should
become involved in the development of strong ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the Peace and Friendship Treaty, and pointed to the
fact that Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao concluded his
successful visit to Japan a few days ago. He also noted the
historical significance of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
scheduled visit to Japan this autumn.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Sino-Japanese relations are experiencing an
important period linking the past with the future, and said that
China continues to pay close attention to the development of the
good-neighborly friendship with Japan and supports Japan in taking
the path of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the delegation of the deepening of
China's reform.
</P>
<P>
Hayashi said that the briefing has enabled him to gain a better
understanding on China's reform effort, and that his
league will make even greater efforts to promote the development
of the bilateral friendship and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here as the guest of the China-Japan
Friendship Association.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Manufacturing Sector in Gloom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The latest report of the
Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has painted a gloomy
picture of the sector afflicted by growing inventory and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In its half year (July-December 1997) economic review, the
association reported an increase of 18.9 percent in the output
from 33.659 billion Naira (about 401 million U.S. Dollars) in the
second half of 1996 to 40.054 billion Naira (about 477 million
U.S. Dollars) in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Much of the increased output, however, turned into inventory,
which soared by 37 percent in the said period to reach 5.447
billion Naira (about 65 million U.S. Dollars) by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In response to the soaring inventory, the manufacturing sector
reported a 6.1 percent decline in the total number of jobs it
provided.
</P>
<P>
The capacity utilization remained significantly low at 34.32
percent, though it is marginally higher than the 33.94 percent in
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The association noted the positive development in the economy
in the period under review, such as low inflation, stable
exchange rate and lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
However, it also noted that none of these has transmitted the
desired growth momentum to the real sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The association blamed the problem in the manufacturing sector
particularly to the weak consumer demands, which it said,
is a result of declining household spending power occasioned
by decelerating real incomes.
</P>
<P>
"A combination of growth in personal income and lower interest
rates to encourage investment is necessary to boost aggregate
domestic demand," the eocnomic review said.

SHANGHAI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Blood Testing Center attached
to the Shanghai Marrow Bank opened today, China's Youth Day, and
welcomed its first group of volunteer bone marrow donors.
</P>
<P>
The 71 undergraduates from the No.2 Shanghai Medical Science
University donated blood which will undergo HLA tests, with the
results placed in a computer data bank awaiting requests for
marrow for a matching recipient.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Jin Ye and Zhou Qiang said the marrow bank
represents the hope of life, and noted that medical students at
the university should become donors since they fully know the lack
of risk involved.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jin, director of marrow donations in Shanghai, said the
ratio for finding a suitable donor stands at one in
10,000. However, he stressed that large number of willing donors
will provide patients suffering from blood diseases with a chance
for survival.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai doctors successfully carried out China's first marrow
transplant in 1996, with the success leading to a significant
increase in the number of donors.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 volunteers had joined the donor program by the
end of 1997, with blood information on some 2,300 prospective
donors currently on file.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- India's indigenously built
Geo-synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), the fourth
generation of its launch vehicle, will be launched early next
year, sources at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket contained three stages-- solid propellant, liquid
propellant and cryogenic. All the three stages had been
successfully tested at the Mahendragiri Center in Tamil Nadu in
southern India.
</P>
<P>
The rocket will carry 2,500 kilogram INSAT class satellite for
communication purposes and place it in the orbit about 36,000 km
above the earth, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
India started development of Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) in
1980. The 22.7m tall SLV-3 was an all solid four stage vehicle and
could lift a weight of 17 tons. In 1991-92, India developed its
second and third generation of launch vehicles-- the Augmented
Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) and the Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle (PSLV), which could put 150 kilogram class
technological/scientific payloads and 1,000 kilogram class remote
sensing satellite into near circular orbit and 900 km polar
sun-synchronous orbit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Announces Hike in Public Transport Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Monday
announced a rise in public transport fares following the increase
in fuel oil prices effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Giri Suseno Hadihardjono said the
transport fare hike will cover buses, trains and sea
transportation.
</P>
<P>
He said the economy bus fares will rise from 300 to 500 rupiah
(8,000 rupiah to one U.S. dollar) and minibus fares from 400 to
600 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The operation of non-air-conditioned express buses was stopped
Monday so there are now only two categories of buses, the economy
and the air-conditioned express buses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suseno said governors will decide on the bus fares in their
respective provinces, based on the local situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fares of economy trains will rise from 19.43
rupiah/km to 39 rupiah/km and those of diesel-powered trains from
15.9 rupiah/km to 27.5 rupiah/km, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there will be no change to air fares as they
have already been increased by the Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
announced the prices of seven kinds of fuel oil will increase by
25 to 71 percent starting Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> East Africa Grapples with Growing Used-Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tanzanian and Ugandan firms are appealing to their governments
to review taxes on imported vehicles, but their Kenyan
counterparts, tired of pleading for tax advantages, are calling
for a national motor vehicle policy.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Motor Traders Association said in a report that
its members sold only 86 new saloon cars in 1997, of which, 95
percent were tax free units against imports of 8,000
reconditioned saloons, mostly from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The association, which represents 20 leading motor traders
authorized to sell and service of most foreign brands, recommends
a major reduction in tax on saloon cars to stimulate demand
towards new car sales where tax revenues are fully accountable.
</P>
<P>
"The car lobby estimates that, with a more reasonable taxation
level, sales of new saloon cars will increase immediately to a
minimum of 300 units and tax will increase by 2,800 percent," the
report says.
</P>
<P>
The dealers accused Japan of treating Tanzania as a "dumping
ground" for used cars to sustain its own domestic new car sales.
They charged that imports of second-hand vehicles were grossly
under-invoiced to evade tax.
</P>
<P>
"Reconditioned cars are merely Japan's second-hand domestic
models. Reconditioning, if any, is restricted to cosmetic
touch-ups carried out in Tanzania," says the report.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 999 four-wheel drive vehicles worth 21.97 million
Dollars were sold in Tanzania against sales projections of 1,349
in 1998 worth 31.16 million Dollars. The figures include both
duty free and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
While, Uganda Car Dealers Association's petition to parliament
to increase taxes on reconditioned cars fell on deaf ears.
Instead, Uganda's Ministry of Finance reduced taxes on
reconditioned vehicles by between three and five percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Motor Industry association figures indicate that
between 1,000 and 1,200 vehicles are imported monthly with new
cars only constituting five percent.
</P>
<P>
Reconditioned car prices have fallen drastically in Uganda to
about 5,000 U.S. Dollars down from an average of 7,000 Dollars
previously.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan motor dealers are working on a national vehicle plan
with seven objectives including transport mobility, customer
choice and competitive pricing.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Mayor Intends to Create New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo announced
Monday that he would leave the ruling Likud Party to form a new
centrist party in order to run for the premiership in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Milo told a news conference in Tel Aviv that he would step
down as Tel Aviv Mayor on November 10 at the end of his office,
and would establish a new party from which he would run for the
premiership in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The moderate Likud mayor said his decision to set up a new
party and to run for premiership was prompted by the recent
controversy over the Batsheva Dance Company, which was prevented
from performing at the gala celebration Thursday night marking
Israel's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The influential religious camp lodged a loud protest against
the dance, in which the dancers stripped down to their
underwear. This led to the withdrawal by the dance company from
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Milo said his party would adopt more moderate policies than
the current hardline Likud party in dealing with the Middle
East peace process, which is facing serious stalemate currently.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, he said the objectives of his new
party will be to bridge the gap between the secular and religious
sectors in the society and try to achieve standards for living
together based on promises that each individual can choose to live
one's own way of life.
</P>
<P>
Milo is not a member of the Knesset (Parliament), but he
has established prestige as the mayor of the largest city Tel
Aviv and through his moderate views on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For the past half a year, Milo has not been at good terms
with Netanyahu due to his dissent over the government's policies
of derailing the Middle East peace process and the repeated
scandals surrounding the government over its dealing with
political matters.
</P>
<P>
Following a stormy Likud party convention last November,
Milo staged a political coup aimed at removing Netanyahu from
power and the Likud leadership.
</P>
<P>
He unveiled a plan to set up split party faction within
the Likud to isolate and thwart Netanyahu's bid for reelection
in the 2000 elections. But his bid failed largely due to the
lack of enough support within the party.
</P>
<P>
Milo's move has drawn widespread reactions from the political
spectrum, but many believed that Milo could hardly pose real
challenge to the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
the next election.
</P>
<P>
Likud's Health Minister Yehoshua Matza, one of closest ally
of Netanyahu, criticized Milo for "making a serious mistake" by
splitting the party. He added that Milo would not stand any
chance in winning over Netanyahu in the next election.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is in London for talks with United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, is expected to give his reaction to Milo's move
during a news conference in London late in the day.
</P>
<P>
Milo's action was also criticized by the leftist camp, which
is worried that Milo could in fact split the peace camp and
strengthen the current hardline Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, believed
that Milo's move could lead to the reelection of Netanyahu in
the next election for the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Chad Denies Border Clash With Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chad has played down a recent border
clash between its troops and Nigerian soldiers at the Lake Chad
area.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place on the Tetewa Island after Chadian
soldiers pulled down a Nigerian flag in the island town, leading
to the death of several people, the Guardian newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chad's Foreign Minister Mahamat Saleh Annadif denied Sunday
that there was any border dispute as such between the two African
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries had discussed the incident
during a visit to Chad by Nigeria's Head of State General Sani
Abacha last Friday, and that the problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
"It was really a very local incident in which security forces
from both sides had to intervene. It was a localized incident
which has nothing to do with any border dispute at a central
level," the foreign minister explained.
</P>
<P>
"There is no dispute, strictly speaking, between us and the
Nigerians on Lake Chad," he added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Preparatory Committee Paves Way For Macao Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee for the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), to be established
Tuesday, will be a significant step to ensure Macao's long-term
stability and prosperity, according to a Xinhua commentary today.
</P>
<P>
As an institution of authority empowered by the National
People's Congress (NPC), the Preparatory Committee will mainly
make preparations for the first government, legislative council,
and judiciary of the Macao SAR, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also pave the way for China's resumption of
sovereignty over Macao, while laying a solid foundation for the
"one country, two systems," "Macao people governing Macao" and "a
high degree of autonomy" policies, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Macao SAR will be a heavy task that
involves politics, economy, law and culture, according to
observers. And the Preparatory Committee will shoulder its
historic responsibility and follow the guidelines and policies of
"one country, two systems" in practical work on Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the Preparatory Committee itself shows the
Chinese government's resolve to have "Macao people governing
Macao," the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Of the Preparatory Committee's 100 members, 60 are from
Macao. This number is above the "no fewer than 50 percent" limit
set by the NPC, it said, noting that the members from Macao
include the very best from all walks of life and provide a wide
range of representation and help form the SAR government in the
interest of most Macao people.
</P>
<P>
Relying on the committee's 100 members alone is insufficient,
the commentary said, and during the final and key period of
forming the Macao SAR, a greater number of Macao people will have
more chances to participate in the transition work.
</P>
<P>
The commentary emphasized that the Preparatory Committee will
be an institution of authority, but will not become a power center.
</P>
<P>
During Macao's transitional period, it will handle issues
according to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic
Law of the Macao SAR and will not interfere in the administration
of the Portuguese Macao government, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration in
1987, China and Portugal have cooperated well on the Macao
question, the commentary said, adding that China hopes the
Portuguese Macao government will sincerely cooperate with the
Preparatory Committee and resolve matters related to the
transition.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Northern Alliance to Respect Moratorium on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of Afghanistan's
Northern Alliance, Rasool Talib, Monday announced that they would
maintain moratorium on any new military offensives in response to
the U.N. call for peace.
</P>
<P>
Talib told reporters here Monday before the departure of the
Northern Alliance's delegation to Bamiyan, after the deadlock in
their talks with the Taliban. "At our level, we will show
restraint and desist from military offensives," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Taliban will also do the same,
at least till the convening of the next meeting of the Joint
Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Talib said the Northern Alliance
leadership has agreed on the formation of the proposed Ulema
(religious scholars) Commission. But he asserted the modalities of
the Commission's meeting should be sorted out at the level of the
Joint Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
Talib held that the Ulema Commission's meeting in a state of
ambiguity would serve no purpose. There are a number of things
related to the Ulema Commission, which have yet to be decided, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for deciding the modalities for lifting blockade
of humanitarian assistance to central Afghanistan and the opening
of road communications, before going for the Commission's meeting.
</P>
<P>
About the Taliban's offer of allowing supply of medicines to
the blockaded areas, he said it would not be enough. The supply of
the food is imperative to meet grave food shortage in the area.
</P>
<P>
Talib insisted that the two sides should complete consideration
of the agreed five-point agenda, which includes ceasefire,
exchange of POWs, lifting of blockade and fixing of date and venue
of the next meeting of the Steering Committee, besides matters
relating to the Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance delegation led by Fazale Hadi Shinwari
left here Monday afternoon for Bamiyan aboard a special U.N.
plane.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative based in Islamabad, Abdul Hakeem
Mujahid, has already said that they are not in favor of military
solution to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban would defend their position on the ground and
retaliate only in case of any attack from their opposite side,
Mujahid said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative has stressed that the Ulema
Commission could be a competent and powerful body to decide the
crucial issues like ceasefire, exchange of POWs and lifting of
blockade.
</P>
<P>
In a move to avoid fresh fighting in Afghanistan after the
peace talks failed, the U.N. has called upon the two Afghan
warring factions to show restraint and desist from any new
military offensives.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of South Africa's
African National Congress (ANC) officials returned from Northern
Ireland at the weekend after sharing their experience with
British and Irish negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Phosa, ANC legal head and one of the four-member
delegation, said Sunday that they did not go there to interfere
or involve themselves in negotiations but to share the South
African experience with them, The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by former ANC secretary-general and now
businessman Cyril Ramaphosa, was invited to Northern Ireland by
Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which
said the ANC negotiators participating in South Africa's
transformation from apartheid to democracy would help Northern
Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
While the nature of the Northern Irish conflict and potential
resolutions differed, the South African experience could "show
what can be done if negotiation forms part of the terrain of
struggle", Phosa said.
</P>
<P>
During its four-day visit, the delegation met Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, members
of the Sinn Fein youth league, and political prisoners.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China has always held that the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace
and Friendship serve as the political basis for bilateral ties and
the criteria for settling the existing problems and differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji made these remarks during a meeting

</P>
<P>
Zhu said the advancement of the good-neighbor ties between

Chinese President Jiang Zemin this year would bring bilateral
relations to a new phase.
</P>
<P>
Kyuma said that China plays an important role both in the

<HEADLINE> Iran to Build Pipeline for Caspian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran was planning to build a
300-kilometer pipeline to facilitate the transporting of Caspian
oil to Europe, the Jomhuri Islami reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted an informed source as saying that with a
budget of 400 million U.S. dollars to build the pipeline from the
Caspian Sea port Neka in Mazadaran province to the capital Tehran,
Iran has decided to offer a tender within next two months to
attract foreign investment for the project.
</P>
<P>
With a daily capacity of 380,000 barrels, the pipeline, which
is to be completed in two and a half years, will make Iran the
quickest and the cheapest oil provider from the Caspian Sea to
Europe, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's decision to build the pipeline was to counter an agreement
between the United States and Turkmenistan on laying a pipeline
under the Caspian Sea bed to connect Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Tehran believed that laying a pipeline under the sea bed
would pose serious threat to the sea's environment because of its
location on an earthquake range.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea reportedly has reserves of 16 billion barrels
of crude oil and 8.3 trillion cubic meters of natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Continue Reducing Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Monday that Malaysia has for now not decided
to slow down its implementation of tariff reduction under the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"We at the moment have not decided to slow down the removal of
tariffs of our country," he said during a question and answer
session at a luncheon hosted in his honor by the United
States-Malaysia Business Committee of the U.S.-ASEAN Business
Council here.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of 16 American companies is on a four-day visit to
Malaysia through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand are scheduled to cut their import taxes to
an average of five percent or less under AFTA's program called the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff by the year 2003. Vietnam
which joined ASEAN in 1995 will do so by 2005 while Laos and
Myanmar which joined the regional grouping in 1997 will meet the
requirement by 2007.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told American businessmen at the luncheon that
countries in the region were looking at conducting trade using
their own currencies to counter the effects of the appreciating
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia, for example, used to conduct 70 percent of
its trade in U.S. dollars although only 18 percent of its total
trade was with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia has lots of ideas on how to rebuild its
economy following the Asian economic crisis and part of it was
the participation of foreign investors in this country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the involvement of American
businessmen would hasten Malaysia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said that with advantages like political stability, harmony
among its multi-ethnic population and no industrial unrest would
make Malaysia a suitable venue for investment.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said the economic woes had undermined the process
towards attaining the goal of turning Malaysia into an
industrialized nation by 2020.
</P>
<P>
He said while Malaysia has a "Look East Policy", it would also
look at the West in its quest for knowledge.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, U.S.-Malaysian trade in 1997
amounted to about 29 billion U.S. dollars and the U.S. was the top
foreign investor in Malaysia last year with 3.7 billion ringgit
(about 1 billion U.S. dollars) in investment approvals out of a
total of 13.6 billion ringgit (about 3.6756 billion U.S. dollars)
in foreign investment that year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Develop Process to Produce Methyl Ester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has developed a
process for the production of methyl ester from palm oil which can
be used as an alternative fuel to fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Monday by Primary Industries Minister Lim
Keng Yaik in his opening address at the two-day "1998 PORIM
International Biofuel and Lubricant Conference" in Bangi near
here.
</P>
<P>
The Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM), which
developed the process, has set up a methyl ester production plant
which has a capacity of 3,000 tons a year, according to Lim.
</P>
<P>
He said the ester produced from palm oil has been exhaustively
tested and one of the most successful tests was conducted in
collaboration with Daimler Benz of Germany and the promising
results had led Daimler Benz to endorse the use of palm diesel in
Mercedes diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
PORIM gets technical assistance for its biofuel research from
Daimler Benz, University Malaya and University Technology Malaysia
and financial support from the national oil company Petronas.
</P>
<P>
Lim expressed his confidence that methyl ester diesel fuel will
become an alternative fuel in the long-term because of the
anticipated depletion of fuel reserves and escalation of petroleum
prices.
</P>
<P>
He was of the opinion that in the future palm oil-based fuel
will become more economically attractive and environmentally
friendly.
</P>
<P>
At present, methyl ester diesel fuel is not cost-effective for
production because palm oil prices are hovering above 2,000
ringgit (about 540 U.S. dollars) per ton, the minister said,
adding that methyl ester diesel fuel has gained increasing
acceptance in developed countries like Italy, Germany, Austria and
France in view of its benefits.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the largest producer of palm oil in the world
accounting for 64 percent of the world's palm oil export, could
potentially become one of the leading producers of palm oil methyl
ester in the world due to its abundant supply of palm oil, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Thais' Life Expectancy Relatively Low: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Compared to people in other parts of
the world, Thai people are likely to live relatively shorter lives
if they don't exercise more and smoke less.
</P>
<P>
The country's Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI found in
its study that life expectancy of people in most countries with
health awareness schemes will be 88 years within the next 20
years, while in Thailand it will be only 72-75.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on estimates of the World Health Organization,
focused on preventable factors such as lack of exercise, smoking,
alcohol abuse, narcotics addiction, poor nutrition and pollution.
</P>
<P>
Accidents, crimes, injuries and suicides have increased by
about 70 percent in the past five years and have caused economic
losses of over 70 billion baht (1.84 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Supakorn Buasai, deputy director of the institute, said
health promotion activities are being carried out by various
organizations, but with a narrow focus.
</P>
<P>
He said public health policies and hospital services should
look beyond health care and enable the public to take care of
their own health.

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined in dull
trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) fell by 17 points to close at 1476.4
points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that stocks ended lower in across-the-board
selling as sentiment on the local bourse remained weak. A fall in
SIA's (Singapore Airlines) local tranche and SPH (Singapore Press

The total market volume was thin at 92.39 million units, valued
at 199.51 million Singapore dollars (about 126.27 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 234 to 73, while 285

<HEADLINE> HK's Trade Department's New Business Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Department of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government is trying to
play an even more active role in the government's Helping Business
 Program by offering new services and facilities to the business
sector, Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak Hay said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Trade Department's
Customer Service Centers and Information Center, Chau said the SAR
government is committed to enhancing the business environment in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Helping Business program, launched in 1996, aims at
providing traders with the best possible business environment and
more opportunities for growth.
</P>
<P>
The Department, one of the various departments involved in the
program, commissioned consultants to conduct a comprehensive
Helping Business Study to identify ways to cultivate a
pro-business culture and practice, to create a business-friendly
environment and to reduce trade regulatory procedures to the
minimum.
</P>
<P>
Setting up of the Customer Service Centers and Information
Center is one of the initiatives recommended by the consultants to
further enhance the department's standard of service to traders.
</P>
<P>
The two Customer Service Centers opened on Monday are under the
Asia and Americas Textiles Controls Branch and the Europe Textiles
Controls Branch respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the roles the centers, each headed by a Customer Service
Manager and manned by experienced Customer Service officers, are
answering inquiries on general licensing matters, handling
requests for special licensing and inquiry services and
suggestions, and conveying complaints from customers.
</P>
<P>
The Customer Service Center of the Asia and Americas Textile
Control Branch has been operating for six months since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
The department has also established an information center to
provide traders with a more comprehensive inquiry service.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Governor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the Bank of Thailand
(BOT, the country's central bank, Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, Monday
announced to step down.
</P>
<P>
His resignation came after the release of an investigation
commission report which said that Chaiyawat is one of the seven
people who should be responsible for BOT's failed attempt to
defend the baht against speculative attacks last year.
</P>
<P>
The abortive attempt almost depleted the country's foreign
currency reserves which plunged from 36.6 billion U.S. dollars to
2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commission led by Nukul Prachuabmoh said in its report that
Chaiyawat's predecessor, Rerngchai Marakanond, must take the
biggest blame for the lost battle.
</P>
<P>
However, Chaiyawat, who was deputy central bank governor at the
time, became the center of criticism because of his status as the
highest-ranking central bank officer still in active duty.
</P>
<P>
Also on the blacklist are former prime minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, former finance minister Amnuay Viravan, then
assistant central bank governor Siri Garnjaroendee, Bandhit
Nijthavorn, director of BOT's banking department, and Paibul
Kittisrikangwan, then head of the central bank's analysis and
monetary market section.
</P>
<P>
Siri, who is now deputy governor of the central bank, also
stated his intention to resign.
</P>
<P>
Though not mentioned in the Nukul report, another deputy
central bank governor, Jaroong Nookhwun, may also resign due to
his mismanagement of the financial institutions development fund
(FIDF).
</P>
<P>
Local media said that Chaiyawat's decision to step down Monday
aimed to avoid the prospect of being fired by the cabinet, which
is expected to discuss the Nukul report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the Finance Ministry was forming a panel to
explore the possibility of taking criminal and civil lawsuits
against the central bankers as well as the politicians implicated
by the commission.

<HEADLINE> Euro Currency Expected to Have Impact on China's Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The exchange and interest rates of
the upcoming "Euro" currency is expected to have some impact on
the amount of China's outstanding foreign debt, according to
analysts from China's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
A group of analysts from the Bank of China are studying the
possible effects of the new Euro currency when it is introduced
early next year and have, in line with these expected effects,
proposed a series of measures.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank will be formed in July, and the Euro
introduced in January of 1999. The currency's notes and coins will
be introduced in January of 2002.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group of financial experts said that,
although only 6 percent of China's outstanding foreign debt comes
from the European sector, government loans from the European Union
(EU) countries constitute 41 percent of China's total government
loans. A lion's share of those loans will need to be changed into
the Euro currency.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the spokesman said, the exchange and interest
rates of the Euro will to some degree impact the amount of China's
outstanding foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to adapt to the transition of the Euro, China's
enterprises and financial institutions will have to renew their
technological equipment, readjust related financial material and
train personnel. The aggregate cost of this conversion could be
substantial.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that many uncertainties will exist during
the transitional period to the Euro, and that China should adopt
measures to minimize debt risks that might arise by the birth
of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts also warned that China should be more prudent
in borrowing from the EU.

Maldivian government to the SAARC, Gayoom complimented the
secretary-general and the directors for their hard work and
dedication, referring in particular to the important role the
secretariat plays, often behind the scenes, in strengthening the
SAARC process, noted the press release.
</P>
<P>
Hasan assured the president that the secretariat would continue
to fulfill its responsibilities entrusted to it by the member
states to the best of its abilities.
</P>

The press release said that Hasan visited the Maldives in mid
April for consultations with Gayoom before the latter embarked on
his current tour of the SAARC capitals.
</P>

Nepal, and he is expected to visit India and Pakistan, the other
two member countries of the SAARC, during the first week of June.

ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif will make a four-day visit to China's Hongkong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) starting from May 5, according to a
press release Monday by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Prime Minister is going to pay the visit at the
invitation of the Asia Society to participate in its ninth Annual
Corporate Conference on the theme of "Engines of Growth; Asia and
The Future of World Business."
</P>
<P>
Sharif is expected to deliver a speech at the Conference on the

</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hong Kong, Sharif will hold talks with the
Chief Executive of HKSAR, Tung Chee Hwa. Primary focus of the
talks between the two leaders would be on further promoting
friendship and enhancing mutual beneficial economic relations
between Pakistan and HKSAR.

<P>
It is also an important source of portfolio and direct
investment in Pakistan. A large Pakistani community in Hong Kong
have been actively participating in the development of Pakistan's

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of the European Union countries spent a better
part of their day on May 2 in Brussels seeking a compromise over
the nomination of the president of the European Central Bank
(ECB).
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac expressed his satisfaction over the
final formula of compromise of the presidency of ECB, which includes
a French vice-president of the bank and the nomination of a
Frenchman to the presidency by 2002. "Does this make you sad? Me,
it makes me happy," said Chirac to other EU leaders.
</P>
<P>
-- For a second time in two weeks, President Jacques Chirac
paced up his efforts to sell the European single currency euro to
the French people. On the Public program on TF1 television Sunday
evening, Chirac explained how it was an outcome of "wisdom and
reason" to adopt the euro.
</P>
<P>
It is in the name of sense of responsibilities that Chirac
launched his crusade, claiming that he was the initiator of the
social model of Europe. He said a European social model is neither
a technocratic monster, nor "an anonymous society with automatic
piloting" as some Europeans' fear.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The chiefs of state and government of the 15 European Union
countries officially launched on Saturday in Brussels the euro,
but the choice of the first president of the European Central Bank
was hard. Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch banker who heads the Bank of
Netherlands, was nominated the president of ECB in preference of
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the Bank of France.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say that it was easy," said Chirac, while the
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl described the negotiation as
"extremely hard." Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said, "the
French had to swallow the final compromise."
</P>
<P>
-- President Chirac said Sunday that one of the advantages of
the launching of euro is to "force the leaders (of EU countries) to
run things seriously." He said that the criteria for joining the
euro are not "criteria of harshness" but those of "wisdom."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Dismisses Rebels' ceasefire Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government Monday
dismissed a two-day unilateral ceasefire declared by Tamil rebels
to coincide with a visit to the country's northern regions by a
senior UN official, military spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministry spokesman Sarath munasinghe said that
government troops were forced to battle the Tamil rebels because
in April 1995 the rebels abruptly pulled out of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He called the rebels' ceasefire offer a gimmick and said the
military did not take it seriously
</P>
<P>
The rebels said their latest ceasefire move was decided because
 Olaara Otunna, UN secretary general on children and armed
conflict plans to visit the war-torn regions on those days.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebel Sunday evening announced that they will observe
a two-day unilateral ceasefire on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been waging a 15-year battle against the Sri
Lankan government for a separate state in the north and east of
the island country.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting between government troops and the Tamil
rebels began on April 19, 1995 when the liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) blasted two government navy gun boats at the
Trincomalee, Eastern province of the country, signaling an end to
a ceasefire and peace talks with the government.

TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday released four
Palestinian prisoners of war (POW) captured during the Iran-Iraq
war (1980-88) upon a request of the leader of Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker on Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A massive blow-out in Australia's
trade deficit Monday spooked the Australian dollar back below 65
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
However, Australia's supreme court the High Court's decision on
the waterfront dispute provided a positive note for the currency,
with containers expected to move on Patrick's wharves as early as
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 64.65 U.S. cents, from 65.34
U.S. cents late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, foreign exchange dealer with Colonial State
Bank, said the announcement of official trade figures pushed the
local unit down to 64.37 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
A rise in imports combined with an even bigger fall in exports
saw the deficit in international trade in goods and services leap
to a seasonally adjusted 862 million U.S. dollars in March - the
highest deficit since the figures were first issued in 1971.
</P>
<P>
However, Volanakis said a positive note was provided by
Monday's High Court decision on the waterfront dispute.
</P>
<P>
The High Court upheld a Federal Court ruling that 1,400 Patrick
employees be allowed to return to work, but also gave the
administrators of the companies the power to make decisions on the
future of the companies.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed at 86.07 Japanese yen, from
86.89 yen, and at 1.1521 Deutsche marks, from 1.1710 marks.

<HEADLINE> Macao Launches Anti-Crime Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An alleged Macao triad ringleader was
taken into pre-trial detention on Monday morning following a
massive action against organized crimes here.
</P>
<P>
Wan Kuok-Koi, alleged Macao 14 K triad ringleader, was sent
into prison on Monday in accordance with the decision of an
examining magistrate of Macao's criminal investigation court, the
Portuguese News Agency Lusa reported.
</P>
<P>
Wan was arrested by local police Friday night, following a
bomb attack on the car of the director of the judiciary police,
Antonio Baptista, on that morning. The police chief narrowly
escaped as he was not in the car when the bomb exploded beneath
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
An earlier press release from the Macao Government Information
Office on Sunday said that Wan and five others taken into custody
were charged of being involved in criminal activities, including
masterminding several murders, attempted murder, forgery of
identification and utilization of forged identification, and drug
trafficking, among others.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the judiciary police have arrested 20
individuals who are among the leading figures of one of the
criminal organizations active in Macao.
</P>
<P>
It added that anti-crime action will continue in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the judiciary police have officially requested the
relative authorities of China's inland, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Thailand and Cambodia for assistance in locating and interception
of the suspects believed to have fled Macao.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia's trade data, a court
decision on the nation's waterfront dispute and ongoing caution
about the strength of the U.S. market limited its share market to
modest gains on thin trade Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Fails to Resume Intercommunal Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential Emissary for
Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, said here Monday that two preconditions
set by the Turkish Cypriot side could not allow peace negotiations
in Cyprus to resume.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the present impasse in a Cyprus
settlement is due to the European Union's stance toward Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before his departure after a
three-day shuttle diplomacy on the island, Holbrooke said the
Turkish side wants its conditions for "state-to-state" talks and
the withdrawal of Cyprus' application to join the EU, to be met
before addressing the situation here.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke described the Turkish claim for the withdrawal of
Cyprus' EU application as "unrealistic".
</P>
<P>
"Presenting these two positions, as conditions precedent to a
negotiation, will make progress difficult," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
He added "in the current situation the Turkish side does
not wish to address those issues (for a Cyprus settlement)
until two preconditions or conditions preceding have been met.
Therefore meaningful exchange is not possible."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy pointed out, however, Turkish Cypriots could
participate in the EU dialog, which got underway in Brussels
in March, as proposed by President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' proposal for the Turkish Cypriot side to nominate
representatives in the official negotiating team, has been
turned down by the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Presidential Emissary reiterated his country's
position that EU talks with Cyprus was a correct decision,
adding that the EU should not have left Turkey out.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last December to invite Cyprus, along with
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slvenia and Estonia, for
membership talks in the Union's first expansion into Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, angered by not being included in the envisaged
expansion, has threatened to integrate with the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Cyprus should the EU go
ahead with entry talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he has reported to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his
meetings here and stressed he does not consider his trip a
failure.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a solution to the Cyprus problem, but
responsibility lies first and foremost to the parties
themselves," the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian peace deal, said both
the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot sides made it clear
that they want the U.S. to pursue efforts for a settlement,
under U.N. aegis, which would lead to a bizonal, bicommunal
federation, as stipulated in U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He reassured of U.S. interest in a Cyprus settlement,
adding he would be back when needed and when the two sides
ask him to return.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that U.S. State Department Special Cyprus
Coordinator Tom Miller would be back at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who arrived here Friday, had a series of
separate talks with the two communities' leaders during his
three-day stay, aiming at breaking the current deadlock in
Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops on the island and took over the northern third in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer
when Denktash walked out of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in
Switzerland to protest the EU decision to open accession talks
with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only
recognized by Ankara.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said, the government will raise price
of electricity by 60 percent in three stages. The price will be
raised separately in May, August and November this year by 20
percent each stage, he added.
</P>
<P>

country's inflation rate which has reached more than 25 percent in
the first three months this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships Start Australia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese naval ships arrived
in Sydney Harbor Monday on a three-day goodwill visit to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The three ships, Qingdao, a guided missile destroyer of 4,800
tons, Shichang, a training ship, and Nancang, a multipurpose
replenishment ship of 37,000 tons when fully loaded, are the first
naval ships from the People's Republic of China visiting
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The ships with 676 Chinese sailors were ushered into the harbor
on Monday morning by Australian navy's guided missile destroyer
HMAS Hobart.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fleet and sailors were later welcomed by Chinese
Ambassador Hua Junduo and hundreds of local Chinese residents on
the wharf.
</P>
<P>
An official Australian naval guard was then reviewed by Rear
Admiral Han Fangrun, also commandant of the Chinese fleet, at a
welcoming ceremony held on the wharf by the Maritime Commander
Australia, Rear Admiral Chris Ritchie.

Han told reporters the visit aims at promoting friendship and
friendly relations between China and Australia and their armed
forces.

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Marks Its Centennial on Campus (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The centennial celebrations for
Beijing University kicked off today with the playing of the
national anthem by the school's band on campus at 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers rushed to pay their respects at the
flag-raising ceremony, which was "the first activity held for the
birthday," according to Professor Wang Dengfeng.
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism is the school's most important tradition," he told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The campus gala, the most grand one in 20th-century China has
drawn great attention in Beijing. Banners hailing the anniversary
can be seen on skyscrapers and in supermarkets far away from the
school also known as Beida.
</P>
<P>
Alumni worldwide returning for celebrations have turned the
campus into one of the most densely populated areas in
Beijing. The university has prepared 100,000 fast-food meal boxes
for today.
</P>
<P>
At a welcome for elder alumni, white hair was gleaming in the
sunshine. Some of the elderly arrived in wheelchairs, or supported
by youthful hands.
</P>
<P>
"Half a century has gone by since I graduated," said Guo Jin,
75, from Guangdong province. "I want to meet my classmates again,
but I failed to recognize them because of so many changes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ding Huaxian, a 1948 graduate, said: "The school has put on a
totally new look. But I am still here to look for the Beida
spirit."
</P>
<P>
Ding was an underground Chinese Communist Party member when she
was a Beida student. She said that the pursuit of a revolutionary
ideal made Beida different from other renowned universities.
</P>
<P>
On the same day 79 years ago, Beida spearheaded the May 4th
Movement to promote patriotism and introduce democracy into
China. The day has been named the May 4th Youth Day in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- About six million Zimbabwean
children under the age of 14 are to be vaccinated next month
against measles, the Herald newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination program, targeted at children below 14 years,
will cost the government an estimated 55 million Zimbabwean
Dollars (about three million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to take place between June 1 and 14, during
what the government has termed Measles National Immunisation
days.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted government officials as saying that the
program has been part of an on-going vaccination program aimed at
wiping out measles in the country. Over 8,000 measles cases were
reported in the country two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said the disease becomes prevalent in the
country between the months of August and October because of the
high temperatures and high humidity.

<HEADLINE> NW China Region Helps Disabled People Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has decided to help 144,200 disabled people
in the region shake off poverty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials say they will achieve the goal by
improving the social security system and providing job
opportunities to them.
</P>
<P>
According to them, it is difficult to find jobs for the
disabled and, as the number of people living in poverty in Ningxia
drops, the radio of the disabled in the total poor population has
increased from 13.3 percent in 1995 to the current 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 144,200 disabled people living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the region had achieved some success in
eliminating poverty among the disabled, and it in 1997 helped
about 23,000 disabled people shake off poverty. Some 25 million
yuan in government funds has been used for poverty relief projects
in 22 counties in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, about 57,700 disabled people who
cannot work will get help through social security, and 86,500
through poverty relief projects, and 21,000 with jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia will allocate one million yuan for helping disabled
poverty-stricken people every year.

<P>
A celebration gathering was held today at the Great Hall of the
People to mark Beida's birthday. It was attended by top Chinese
leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan and Li
Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Beida's glorious traditions of patriotism,
progress, democracy and science, and its fine academic style,
which have embodied the national spirit of self-reliance and
exploration.
</P>
<P>
And the celebrations are joined by 80 overseas university
presidents, including those from Stanford of the United States,
Oxford of the United Kingdom, as well as Nobel Prize laureates and
international corporate representatives.
</P>
<P>
Beida was China's first public university established in the
late Qing Dynasty to assimilate Western thought and technology.
</P>
<P>
Now, Beida has contributed a lot to the mankind. Its computer
technology for printing Chinese-character newspapers has been the
most widely applied in the world.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhida, a graduate, said that his most unforgetable moment
in Beida was watching an international volleyball match on TV in
1981.
</P>
<P>
"After China won the champion, we rushed out of our dormitory
and began a parade. We shouted out the words, which then became
very popular in the country: 'Let's get together to rejuvenate
China," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Beida was the cradle of the country's avant-garde ideas,
including Marxism, democracy, science, free marriage and the
shareholding system, as well as home to celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Among the first 53 Chinese Communist Party members, 21 were
from Beida, including Mao Zedong, who was then a campus librarian.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of becoming one of those people who have greatly
influenced Chinese history made me chose to study at Beida," said
Wang Wei, a freshman in the chemistry department.
</P>
<P>
"Our future will be quite different from theirs, but we will
work as hard," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Starts Summer Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Parliament, the Knesset,
will start its summer session Monday not only in hot weather,
but also in hot temper over the deepening social division as
well as continued deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Knesset summer session comes just three days
after the gala celebration marking Israel's 50th birthday, which
reflected the deep social division through the controversy over
the performance by a dance company.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, Knesset lawmakers from the religious and
secular camps traded blames over their respective principles on
social behaviors. The Batsheva Dance Company was forced to
withdraw from the Jubilee Bells gala celebration ceremony Thursday
night after the orthodox religious politicians protested against
their planned performance, in which the dancers stripped down to
their underwear.
</P>
<P>
The artistic circles and secular politicians angrily accused
the religious camp, which has increased its influence
significantly in the past years, of religious coercion and
cultural persecution.
</P>
<P>
But the religious camp blasted the artists and secular circles
for ignoring the religious sensitivities and pouring scorn on the
religious community in the name of artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
To compensate for the withdrawal from Jubilee celebration
performance, some secular lawmakers have demanded the Knesset
allow the Batsheva Dance Company to perform in the Knesset. But
the religious lawmakers vowed to fight to prevent the company
from performing there.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is expected to debate on the issue and tackle the
increased tensions between the secular and religious sectors.
</P>
<P>
Another contentious topic to the Knesset debate is believed to
be the issue of Israel's delay of next troop redeployment in the
West Bank, an obstacle that has stalled the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process for over one year.
</P>
<P>
On the issue, the battle line will be drawn between the
moderate leftist camp and the hardline rightwing camp. A number
of non-confidence motions and heated debates are expected in the
house.
</P>
<P>
Among the important ceremonies in the Knesset during the
session will include the swearing-in of reelected President Ezer
Weizman, the approval of a new Army Chief of Staff, election of
next State Comptroller and receiving Speaker of United States
House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and a large
U.S. congressional delegation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Estimates Lower Economic Growth for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Ministry expected
the country's economic growth in 1998 to be 1-2 percent, falling
short of the 3 percent target set in its budget, the Jerusalem
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted State Revenues Director Tzipi Galyam as
saying that it would be the lowest growth rate over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Galyam, who revealed Sunday this figure to the cabinet during a
debate on how to curb the rising unemployment, said that current
economic indicators has showed no signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
And the current growth was to slow to stop the unemployment
rate from rising, which had reached 8.3 percent by the end of
February, she added.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the growth of per capita gross national product fell
by 0.5 percent and the drop this year was expected to be even
bigger to reach a negative growth, officials with the Finance
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman proposed to
increase the budget for investment in infrastructure projects by
1 billion shekels (about 270 million U.S. dollars) in 1998 to
promote economy and create more jobs as a result.
</P>
<P>
However, several ministers opposed the proposal, arguing that
the additional funding to infrastructure projects will lead to a
0.2 percent cut in each ministry's budget.
</P>
<P>
A vote on the proposal will be held next week.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Parliament Term Not to Be Extended: Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The term of Cambodia's current
National Assembly, or parliament, which is to expire on September
24, will not be extended, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the general elections can not be held before September 24,
the National Assembly will be dissolved automatically, Hun Sen
said after an aborted assembly session Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the government headed by him and First Prime Minister Ung
Hout will stay, he said.
</P>
<P>
The session was supposed to name final three members to the
Constitutional Council, the legal body to have the final say on
any electoral dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the scheduled session failed to meet the quorum that
requires the attendance of 84 members. Only 77 members appeared
because of the boycott by those from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said, "There will be no interim government. We, Ung
Hout and I, will lead the current government till the elections
and the formation of a new government."
</P>
<P>
The general elections are expected to be held on July 26.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen asked the international community to exert
pressure on the boycotters to make the elections successful.
</P>
<P>
Opposition assembly members began the boycott recently to force
the government to agree to negotiations on the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
They demanded an amendment to the Election Law, insisting that
the ballots should be brought to the provincial capitals for
counting instead of being counted at the polling stations or
villages.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded a review of the neutrality of the National
Election Committee, saying that the assembly's three
representatives on the Constitutional Council must be neutral.

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A gathering of 8,000 people from
various circles was held in the Great Hall of the People to mark
the 100th anniversary of the founding of Beijing University
(Beida).
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., Ren Yanshen, secretary of the Beida Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, announced the opening of the meeting,
followed by the Chinese national anthem played by the military
band.
</P>
<P>
Beida President Chen Jia'er delivered an opening address,
saying that Beida was an outcome of the Hundred Day's Reform
(1898) in China at the end of the last century.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Beida's growing process in the past 100 years
has been closely linked with China's history in which the Chinese
people struggled for national independence and people's liberation
and for promoting national strength and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese culture's long history and fine ethics
nurtured Beida and helped create a school with a revolutionary
tradition. Beida represents the integration of Chinese culture and
national spirit, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhili, minister of Education, and Lin Wenyi, vice-mayor of
Beijing, offered congratulatory remarks at the meeting.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivered the keynote speech. He
spoke highly of Beida's outstanding contributions to the Chinese
nation in the past century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Beida has a fine revolutionary tradition. As
the center of the New Culture Movement and the origin of the May
4th Movement of 1919, the university was one of the pioneers in
spreading Marxism and scientific and democratic ideas in China.

Jiang said that as one of the important centers of education,
culture and academic research, Beida has cultivated several
generations of outstanding talents, and it has achieved a great
deal in both social and natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said the university should be a vigorous force in the drive
to rejuvenate China through science and education.
</P>
<P>
Education is closely integrated with social and economic
development and contributes to modernization by supplying talents
and knowledge, he said, adding that it represents the direction of
China's educational reform and development toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To achieve modernization, he said, China should have a number
of first-class universities by world standards.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the universities are expected to be a cradle for the
cultivation of highly qualified creative people; a forefront for
exploring the unknown, objective truth, and providing a scientific
basis for dealing with new problems in society; an important force
to promote updated knowledge and to transform scientific and
technological achievements into productivity; a bridge between
China's culture and the world's other advanced cultures.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he expects the students of Beijing University and
other universities as well and the young people of various circles
to learn and absorb modern science, technology and cultural
heritage, to go in for self-improvement and actively participate
in social causes, to foster the proper world view, outlook on life
and value of judgements.

the National People's Congress Standing Committee Li Peng, Premier
Zhu Rongji, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference Li Ruihuan,

</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders met

noted scientists.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University's (Beida) original name was Jingshi
Daxuetang. In 1912, it changed its name to Beida.
</P>
<P>
Founders of the CPC such as Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu and Mao
Zedong as well as the forerunner of the Chinese New Culture
Movement, Lu Xun, worked on the faculty at Beida early this
century.

<HEADLINE> One Million Zimbabweans Apply for Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one million hungry
Zimbabweans in four of the country's eight provinces have so far
applied for food aid under the government's grain loan scheme,
according to the Ministry of Local Government and National
Housing.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Local Government and National Housing, which
is responsible for the program, continued to receive requests for
food aid from thousands of villagers from various parts of the
country, Civil Protection Director Madzudzo Pawadyira said in a
recent interview with Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is fairly serious in all these areas. Rains
were erratic and harvests were poor as a result," Pawadyira said.
</P>
<P>
The number is likely to swell considerably, given that the
other four provinces are still to submit their applications, the
Herald newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government's grain loan scheme was resuscitated recently,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official in the Department of Social
Welfare as saying that although drought relief aid continued, the
distribution of maize under the grain loan scheme had been
stopped because the government wanted to reassess the food
situation.
</P>
<P>
Although some areas have received good rains this year, other
parts are virtually dry, resulting in poor yields which affect
the overall food production in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official forecasts released last month by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Regional Early Warning Unit
predict that maize output this year will be 1.42 million tons, a
35 percent decline compared to 2.19 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to reduced opening stocks and harvest prospects,
preliminary supply and demand assessments suggest a domestic
cereal deficit of 810,000 tons for the 1998/99 marketing year.
and Maize deficit alone is assessed at 612,000 tons, the
forecasts said.

<HEADLINE> Two Chinese Shipping Giants Join for Service on Japan Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's COSCO Container Lines Group
and China Shipping (Group) Company recently signed a contract to
cooperate in container shipping services on the Japan route.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will help container density, utilization of
shipping space, and size of business on the route without any
additional spending by either partner.
</P>
<P>
China Shipping has refitted two luxury ships as high-speed
refrigerator ships for transporting livestock and fish from
Shanghai to Japan. Japanese buyers favor the route because of
timely and cheap service.
</P>
<P>
The group, which has total assets valued at more than 25
billion yuan (3 billion US dollars), handles over 60 percent of
the shipping of China's coastal provinces, and is looking for a
larger share of the container business. It set up a specialized
container shipping company in October of last year.
</P>
<P>
COSCO moved its container shipping headquarters to Shanghai and
merged with the Shanghai COSCO Shipping Co. in December of last
year and now has a fleet of 150 container ships.
</P>
<P>
It has 50 international container shipping routes with more
than 300 departures for other countries and regions every day.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai have decided to entrust the selection
of the next chief of general staff to the Appointments Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was established last year in order to avoid
untoward motives in appointments, is expected to call in the leading
contenders, General Shaul Mofaz and General Matan Vilnai, in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli sources said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
was willing to agree to an 11 percent second withdrawal from the
West Bank during his talks with the U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in London on May 4.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Netanyahu has indicated his new flexibility to the
U.S. Vice President Al Gore last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A poll conducted by the newspaper recently showed that 63
percent of Israeli Jews agreed that there was religious coercion
in the fields of culture and art in the country.
</P>
<P>
But 61 percent said it was right for the Batsheva Dance Company
to cancel the seminude performance in the jubilee celebration last
week, which has spurred a debate over the influence of the
religious parties in the country.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Euro's Influence on Sino-EU Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The integrity of European
currencies, which gives birth to a new currency, "Euro", will
reduce the risk involving exchange rates for European Union (EU)
member countries' trade with China.
</P>
<P>
The official initiation of the Euro at the beginning of 1999
will also help China to better use EU loans and optimize China's
structure of foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The European summit at the heads-of-state and government levels
confirmed early Sunday the recommendation that Belgium, Germany,
Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Austria, Portugal and Finland will be the founding members of the
Euro club.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that, while the unity of the EU currencies
will promote trade across west Europe and create more business
opportunities for EU companies, the birth of the Euro will have
few negative effects on Sino-EU trade.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Chinese companies will take fewer risks in trading
with their EU counterparts because of the expected credibility and
stability of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Euro, with higher international status than
the currencies of most European countries, will be more credible
and stable because these 11 countries' population, gross domestic
product and world trade volume share are close to the figures of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The complementary economies of China and the European Union
also portend bright prospects for bilateral trade ties as China
will continue to import advanced technology from Europe, and
European countries will in turn import large amount of Chinese
products, which are highly competitive on the world market.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is possible that the integrity of EU currencies will be
accompanied by greater openness and activity by EU countries, as
well as a more flexible attitude on the elimination of EU trade
discrimination and support for China's access to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The expected stability of the Euro will be conducive to
economic development in Europe and the world, to the reform of the
international monetary and foreign exchanges systems, as well as
to China's better management of EU loans and meeting its debt
repayment schedule, said Song Jian, a researcher with the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has provided China with the largest amount
of foreign governmental loans. By the end of last year, the
contractual loans supplied to China by EU governments and official
financial institutions was 12.8 billion U.S. dollars, accounting
for 41 percent of all the loans China has accepted.
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that China will use the Euro as a currency for
trade settlements, valuations and investments because the EU is
China's major trade partner and its investment in China is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Song said, after the initiation of the Euro, China
should properly adjust its foreign-exchange structure to weaken
its dependence on the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He added that lack of knowledge of the new currency would
inconvenience Chinese businesses, and relevant companies should
pay close attention to possible changes in the Euro and its
influence, so as to avoid losses.

Speaking to reporters at London's Heathrow airport, Arafat said
that the success of the London talks depended on whether Netanyahu
accepted a U.S. proposal to hand over another 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians. Before Netanyahu's arrival in
London, an Israeli government spokesman made it clear that it
would be "utterly impossible" for Israel to accept the
U.S. proposal of demanding Israel's troops pullout from 13 percent
of the West Bank. (UK-Arafat-Netanyahu)

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A control rod drive mechanism for
300,000-kw nuclear power reactors, developed by the Shanghai
Xianfeng Electric Manufacturing Works, has been given ministerial
certification.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of a test witnessed by the State
Development Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the China Nuclear Power Industry Corporation, and
some departments related from east China provinces.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the factory say, the new device has a life of 40
years and can work at 150 atmospheres of pressure and 300 degrees
Celsius. And it uses electromagnetic wire to improve the control rod
drive mechanism used at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in the
1980s. Located in Zhejiang province, Qinshan is the country's
first nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Xianfeng Electric Manufacturing Works was founded
in 1922 and is the only manufacturer in China of control rod drive
mechanisms for nuclear power reactors.
</P>
<P>
It also has the job of designing control rod drive mechanisms
for two 600,000-kw nuclear power reactors for the second phase at
Qinshan, and a sub-contract on control rod drive mechanisms for
900,000-kw nuclear power reactors that will be used in the second
phase of a nuclear power station in Guangdong Province.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin called
on young people, university students in particular, to cultivate
correct value judgements and world outlook while studying
diligently for the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call in his speech at a meeting here today to
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of Beijing
University which coincides with the May 4th Student Movement of
1919 focusing on anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 people including state leaders, overseas
celebrities, university faculties and students attended today's
celebration at the Great Hall of the People, the venue of major
political and social meetings.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hopes university students and young people across
the country first learn and absorb modern science, technology and
cultural heritage and, at the same time, conscientiously work for
self-improvement and acquire a correct world view, outlook on life
and value judgments.
</P>
<P>
"If one does not have a correct ideology and good moral
character, it would be impossible to contribute one's learnings to
the motherland and the people, let alone to play an important role
in society," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded young people of the need to participate in social
practice which is the source of knowledge and touchstone for the
truth. Young people should go where the country and people most
need them, Jiang said. Hardships can help form a strong will and
good character while practice sharpens one's capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president encouraged young people to achieve personal goals
by using their talent in the interests of the people and the
country, saying that China's reform, opening-up and modernization
drive have set the stage for their future accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
However, young people should have a clear understanding of
national conditions and should prepare to take challenges and
overcome difficulties on the road to China's modernization, Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Sector on Way to Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate sector is
entering a boom in the wake of a year-long depression because of
the central government's policy of stimulating domestic demand,
according to a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
In March, the "business climate index" for the real estate
sector, which is used as a key indicator to evaluate the
industry's prosperity level, reached 99.05, the highest point
during the past 13 months. This figure is 1.54 points higher than
the March of 1997, when the once overheated real estate industry
unexpectedly stagnated.
</P>
<P>
The report released jointly by the State Statistical Bureau
(SSB) and the China Business Climate Monitoring Center said that
the pick-up in the real estate sector is a result of the sharp
growth in government investment as an effective means to guarantee
an 8 percent increase in the gross domestic product this year.
</P>
<P>
The reform of China's housing system, which was given top
priority on the agenda of the State Council, or the Chinese
government, is having an effect on the country's real estate
sector, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the investment in real estate projects
rose by 9.3 percent on an annual basis. This increase is 4.1
percent higher than the corresponding period of 1997, ending a
six-month investment decline.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Scrutinize Tourism Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
scrutinize investors in tourism to avoid sub-standard
developments in the economically-crucial sector, Zambian Deputy
Tourism Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Daily Mail Monday quoted Deputy Tourism Minister
Cecil Holmes as saying recently that the government cannot afford
to give land to speculators in the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia has reached a stage where every investor in tourism
will be judged on merit. Shoddy investment in this area can be
to the detriment of the country," Holmes told a seminar held in
Livingstone, the most famous tourist spot in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Genuine investors will be monitored and assisted to settle
down to help develop Livingstone into real international
destination," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to up-grade infrastructure such as
roads and airport which need resurfacing and expansion in
anticipation of bigger tourism business.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar called on the government to
clearly define the type of investment desired in the tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zambia's tourism industry has been growing
well. It earned the country 62.7 million U.S. Dojlars last year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Speaks at Beijing University Centennial (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang recalled Beida's history over the century, saying that
Beijing University was established at a time when China was
surviving a series of foreign invasions. Its founding and that of
other institutions of higher learning at the time marked the
beginning of China's modern education system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have occurred in China in the 20th century, and
the Chinese people have successfully taken the right road of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiang said, adding that
Beijing University has at the same time become one of the
world-renowned institutions.
</P>
<P>
As an important educational and academic base, the University
has trained highly qualified people for the country generation
after generation, making important contributions to China's
revolutionary and reform drives, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of modern science and technology,
competition has become more fierce as the information economy
emerges in the world, Jiang said, emphasizing that the whole Party
and society must pay attention to knowledge updating and the
importance of tapping human resources in the process of economic
development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping told us repeatedly that science and
technology are the primary production forces. We must respect
knowledge and people of high caliber," Jiang said. "His important
thoughts provide the theoretical base for China to carry out the
strategy of revitalizing the country through science and
education."
</P>
<P>
China's universities should become the leading force in the
strategy of revitalizing the country through science and
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today is May 4th Youth Day," Jiang said. "The patriotic
students of Beijing University staged the May 4th Movement 79
years ago. Modern Chinese youth should carry out the glorious
tradition of the May 4th Movement, shoulder the historical mission
of revitalizing China, and live up to the expectations of the
people and times."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Zealand By-election Shows Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The results of New Zealand's
by-election held at the weekend show that the popularity of the
coalition government is still low after the ruling National
Party's leadership change.
</P>
<P>
Although support for the National Party has recovered somewhat
in recent months after Jenny Shipley replaced Jim Bolger as the
party's leader and the prime minister, the party's performance in
the by-election held last Saturday is far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Its candidate Shane Ardern managed to win the seat in the
parliament left vacant by Bolger, who had quit the parliament to
become New Zealand's ambassador to the United States. But Ardern
scored only 29.37 percent of the total votes compared with 54.6
percent which took Bolger to the parliament in the last general
election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The junior partner in the coalition, New Zealand First, fared
even worse, winning only 2.75 percent of the total votes, down
drastically from the 17.22 percent it captured in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The combined votes going to the two ruling parties are more
than halved to only 32 percent from the almost 72 percent in the
last election, a clear indication that the voters are unhappy
with the government.
</P>
<P>
But the government has to feel content with the results, in
view of the fact that its approval rate in the country now stands
at less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner is the ACT party, which snatched 24.52
percent of the votes, up from 3.3 percent it gained in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Support for the opposition Labor Party and the Alliance also
rose, and so did that for three smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
But Ardern said he did not expect to receive as much support as
his predecessor Bolger, who had served as an MP for 25 years and
enjoyed high popularity among the voters in the farmers-dominated
Taranaki/King Country electorate.
</P>
<P>
The election results may signal some trouble for the coalition.
Under the agreement on forming the coalition, New Zealand First
will have three more ministers in October this year to increase
its total number of ministers to 11. But the National Party can
safely thwart any New Zealand First bid for more ministers, given
its partner's poor showing in the by-election.
</P>
<P>
ACT leader Richard Prebble has even predicted that the
coalition would split before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The rise of ACT does not mean all bad for the National Party.
Before the last general election, many analysts had indicated that
the National Party could form a coalition with ACT as the two
parties shared many common policies. But ACT won only eight seats
in the parliament, dashing National's hope to form a majority
government with ACT.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Shipley, who has signaled a preference
for keeping the coalition intact, is unlikely to rush into any
deal with ACT now.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the National Party had taken on board the
by-election messages that farmers and business owners wanted an
environment where they could thrive and that rural people were
worried about social services.

<HEADLINE> China Using Steel Caissons to Develop Oil in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Since April last year, China has
successfully been using steel caissons to develop oil in the
Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
A cylindrical steel caisson, 13.8 meters tall and 38 meters in
diameter, was put in April last year on the seabed in the
oilfield's eastern section, where it has been used as a platform
for drilling and storage of oil, according to Jiang Hengyu,
manager in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has used this technology in
offshore oil production, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the new technology effectively prevents
sedimentation and icing on a drilling platform, and a new
10-meter-thick oil-bearing stratum has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
The Jinzhou 9-3, which is 20 km from the city of Jinzhou in
Liaoning Province, has proven oil reserves of 30.8 million
tons. The oilfield was discovered by the Bohai Oil Company in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The water over the oilfield is 7 m deep, making conventional
oil development methods costly and difficult for recovering
investment. After eight years of study, petroleum engineers
decided to use the steel caissons for efficiency and safety.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield's eastern section will not have any living
facilities, but will be linked with the other section by a 2.7-km
marine pipeline and a marine cable.
</P>
<P>
The caissons for the western section have been completed and
are expected to be installed soon, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Jinzhou Oilfield is expected to have 27 production wells,
26 water filling wells, and one natural gas well, and a designed
annual capacity of a million tons. The oilfield will cost 1.8
billion yuan and will go into production in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Oil Company was originally set up in Tanggu of
Tianjin in 1966, and now has 10 billion yuan in fixed assets and
10,000 employees.

<P>
HANOI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to expand the
export-oriented rice-growing area to one million hectares, mainly
in the four major rice-growing provinces in the southern Mekong
Delta, the Vietnam news reported Monday.

incentives for expanding rice-growing area, including investing
more in scientific research, constructing irrigation works,
providing low-interest bank loans to farmers and establishing a
rice export support fund.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong Delta, known as Vietnam's "the main rice-growing
area", accounts for half of the country's total rice output and
more than 90 percent of rice export.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which is expected to export four million tons of rice
this year, has exported about 2.2 million tons in the first four
months, said the report.
</P>

AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel Sunday reopened its air traffic
to international airlines including Royal Jordanian (RJ) after a
one-day hiatus due to a strike by the Israeli air controllers.
</P>
<P>
Semi-official Jordan Times Monday quoted Captain Jasser Ziyad,
head of the Civil Aviation Authority, as saying that RJ flights to
and from Europe and North Africa have resumed their normal routes
over Israeli airspace as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ziyad said that RJ flights Saturday had to temporarily take
alternative routes over Syrian airspace because of the strike by the
Israeli air controllers.
</P>
<P>
The national English daily Monday also quoted spokesman of the
Israeli Embassy in Jordan, Ro'ey Gilad, as saying that air
controller struck to protest the regulations issued by the Israeli
Airport Authority one month ago, which stipulates new working
hours and shifts on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
"Royal Jordanian is not the only airline that has suffered
from this strike. All Israeli and international flights have been
affected. Now everything is normal with all the airlines," he
said.
</P>

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Common interests instead of
conflicts characterize Sino-Nigerian relations, Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian stressed today in a meeting with visiting
Chief of Staff of the Nigerian Navy O.M. Akhigbe.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
state councillor, said that China and Nigeria have a tradition of
profound friendship. Since the establishment of diplomatic
relations, the two countries have conducted various forms of
friendly exchanges and productive cooperation in such sectors as
politics, economy, culture and the military, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed gratitude for Nigeria's consistent stance in
support of the `one China' policy and its support for China's
reunification endeavour.
</P>
<P>
He said China treasures the friendship between the two peoples
and armed forces, and places importance on developing friendly
relations and cooperation with Nigerian armed forces. Chi
expressed his conviction that Akhigbe's visit is bound to push the
friendly relations between the two armed forces toward
multi-directional and multi-level cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe said Nigeria and China have always supported each other
politically and economically, and their military relations are
also developing. He said he hopes that the friendly and
cooperative ties between the two armed forces, especially the two
navies, could be further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Failed Kenyan Insurance Firm's Assets for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The sale of the assets of the
collapsed Kenya National Assurance Ltd (KNAC) is expected to
raise nearly 400 million Shillings (6.6 million U.S. Dollars),
the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, fears are rife in the industry that the properties
could be disposed off at throwaway prices.
</P>
<P>
Companies which have shown interest in acquiring the assets,
include Madison Insurance, First Insurance and Kenya Re-Insurance
Company Ltd, all among the top class in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Before it was placed under statutory management, the KNAC
accounted for nearly 60 percent of the national insurance
business. However, a large chunk of its business included high
risks covered at very low premiums.
</P>
<P>
On April 27, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae announced that
all assets and liabilities of the collapsed firm's life fund
would be transferred to private companies.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts contend that even after the transfer, such
payments as bonus to policy holders are not guaranteed since
there is a possibility that return on assets may not result in a
surplus.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that with the prevailing high interest rates in
the money market, property values could nosedive spelling
disaster to policy holders or pensioners who still depend on the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Plans are at an advanced stage to sell off the closed life
fund, which is estimated to worth 3.38 billion Shillings, to the
highest bidder and this is open to both local and international
investors.
</P>
<P>
Troubles at the KNAC began when a number of financial
institutions, in which the company had invested about 300 million
Shillings, went under.
</P>
<P>
Following persistent failure to maintain liquidity margins,
several major clients withdrew, dealing the final blow to the
firm which was finally placed under statutory management and then

<HEADLINE> Election Kits Begin to Arrive in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The first shipment of voter
registration kits for Cambodia's general elections scheduled on
July 26 arrived Saturday at Pochendong Airport.
</P>
<P>
The 522 kits containing Polaroid cameras and laminating
machines will be sent to Preah Vihear, Mondolkiri, Koh Kong,
Kandal, Kompong Speu and Battambang provinces and Phnom Penh
within two weeks, according to an National Election Committee
official.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration is scheduled to begin on May 18 and last 28
days. Each kit is expected to register 3,500 voters. The
registration process had been pushed back three weeks because the
foreign-donated training kits arrived late.
</P>
<P>
Some non-governmental organizations and international
organizations recently expressed their concerns over technical
delays for the poll preparations, uncertain whether the elections
could be held on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Many problems remained to be solved before the elections, such
as the setting up of the Constitutional Council, the arriving of
foreign donated funding for the elections and the freedom of
access to media for all political parties.

<HEADLINE> East China City Trying to Better Protect Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Xiamen in East China's
Fujian Province says that the city will crack down on illegal
behavior by local government officials to protect the interests of
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Shi Zhaobin said that an
effort will be made to make the city one of the best choices for
overseas investors in China.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is one of China's five special economic zones and is
just across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan. The mayor said that
Xiamen's infrastructure has improved a great deal after several
years of intense work, but that the investment environment is far
from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Problems with illegal charges, poor law enforcement,
lack of efficiency, and failure to implement state overseas
investment policies have run rampant in the city, hampering
efforts to protect or attract overseas investment, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
So, a series of regulations have been worked out by the city
government to deal with the problems, he said, and seven meetings
have been held to discuss the problems, with overseas investors
and local enterprises taking part in.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Border Guards Opening Up Friendly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- One spring morning recently, a group
of Russian border guards crossed the border with China, the
Heilongjiang River, to meet with Chinese counterparts in the city
of Heihe in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting simply involved sending birthday greetings to
Colonel Liu Hong Kang, a member of the Chinese border forces, who
remarked, "If these Russian friends had not called on me, I might
have forgotten my birthday."
</P>
<P>
The officer can in fact remember the birthdates of many of his
Russian army friends stationed in Blagoveshchensk, just across the
river.
</P>
<P>
When he looks back on the old days, when China and the former
Soviet Union were at odds with each other and had millions of
soldiers along the border, Liu says, "There was nothing but
protests and quarrels," then, but, "Things have changed a lot,"
and there are now other things to talk about and the number of
ceremonial meetings for national days, army day, and birthdays is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
"We often visit the Chinese as if we were relatives," says the
Russian Colonel Takayev.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Liu says that hundreds of thousands of Chinese and
Russians have crossed the border to visit or do business, since
China, Russia and other three central Asian countries signed an
agreement to build mutual trust in border areas in April of 1996,
and he concludes, "Trust is the basis of friendship."

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has issued
vacation notices to 101 striking postal workers under emergency
regulations, government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
These workers had ignored the Emergency Regulation declaring
the postal service an essential service and had not reported for
work.
</P>
<P>
According to postal authorities, these workers had reported for
work but instead of performing their duties they demonstrated
outside their work places.
</P>
<P>
The authorities claimed that 60 percent of the backlog of mail
had been cleared since the promulgation of emergency regulations
to stifle the strike, which began in early March.
</P>
<P>
The postal unions, however, claimed that the situation had been
aggravated by the promulgation of the emergency regulations and
threatened that more postal workers throughout the country will be
demonstrating from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government declared the emergency regulations on
April 24 in a bid to end the prolonged postal strike which has
severely affected the country's economy and administration.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea Claims 86 Lives in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Diarrhea claimed 86 lives in
Bangladesh in the first four months of this year, The Independent
daily reported Monday quoting officials in Dhaka's Directorate of
Health Service.
</P>
<P>
At least 64,000 persons were affected by diarrhea in 17
districts across the 64-district country in the period, according
to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of deaths was registered in the southeast
district of Noakhali where the disease took away the lives of 27
persons.
</P>
<P>
Of the total number of patients, 17,828 were found in the
northeast district of Kishoreganj, followed by 11,500, 6,700 and
4,500 in the southwest, northwest and north districts of Khulna,
Naogaon and Netrokona respectively.
</P>
<P>
The officials denied the outbreak of the disease in an epidemic
form, but said local medical teams have been working in the
disease-affected areas to check the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Besides, diarrhea-affected patients from Dhaka and its
adjoining areas have been rushed to the city's International
Center for Diarrheal Diseases Research, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Usually, about 200 to 250 patients go to the center for
treatment on average daily, but now as many as more than 500
patients go there for treatment a day. The center treated more
than 14,000 patients in April, the center's chief physician, Abdus
Salam, said.
</P>
<P>
The center usually has the largest number of patients from the
end of March to May every year and 60 percent of them are children
below five years of age, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Salam attributed most of the cases mainly to the intake of
polluted water and contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey report on diarrheal diseases in Bangladesh
showed that 35 percent of the deaths in the country were due to
persistent diarrhea, Salam added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Military Leader Begins Visit to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the
Myanmar Defense Services General Maung Aye, who leads a military
goodwill delegation, began his visit to Vietnam Monday to promote
the ties between the two armed forces and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Maung Aye, who is also vice-chairman of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC) and commander-in-chief of the Army,
 is accompanied by SPDC Second Secretary Lieutenant-General Tin Oo
and other military leaders.
</P>
<P>
The trip followed a visit to the country by SPDC Chairman
Senior-General Than Shwe in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, relations between Myanmar and Vietnam
continued to develop with exchange of visits by leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, the then Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet
came to Yangon and agreements were initiated on trade, tourism
cooperation and establishment of a Myanmar-Vietnam Joint
Commission for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC).
</P>
<P>
During Than Shwe's 1995 return visit to Hanoi, the first
meeting of the two countries' JCBC was held and mutual cooperation
in drug abuse control and forestry agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
The second meeting of the JCBC held in Hanoi in January 1997
further discussed measures to promote multi-sided cooperation,
particularly in trade, agriculture and forestry.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, the then Vietnamese Party General Secretary
Du Muoi officially visited Myanmar and the two countries'
relations were further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
A visit by Vice-Minister of National Defense of Vietnam and
Chief of the General Staff of Vietnam People's Army
Lieutenant-General Pham Van Tra in June last year also boosted
cooperation between the two countries' armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Have 3 Desalination Plants by 2011 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore could have three
desalination plants by 2011 and these would produce enough water
to replace the supply under Singapore's first water agreement with
Malaysia, the Straits Times reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Singapore National Development Minister Lim
Hng Kiang as saying the government is working on a set of plans
under which it could build two more desalination plants between
2003 and 2011.
</P>
<P>
The first pilot plant is being set up in Tuas, western
Singapore, at a cost of 1 billion Singapore dollars (about 628.93
million U.S. dollars). It is due to be completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The three plants would produce a combined 400,000 cubic meters
of water a day, enough to replace the amount supplied under
Singapore's first water agreement with Malaysia, which expires in
2011, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Desalination is one of the options Singapore is studying to
help it meet its future water needs, the report said, adding that
Singaporeans consume some 1.2 million cubic meters of water daily.
</P>
<P>
Close to half, or about 680,000 cubic meters of the water comes
from water-catchment areas, such as the 14 reservoirs on the
island and storm-water collection ponds in town, while the rest
comes from Johor, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
After the first Singapore-Malaysia water pact expires in 2011,
the second such agreement between the two countries will expire 50
years later in 2061.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has given verbal
assurance that Malaysia will continue to supply water to Singapore
even after the pacts expire, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But it said a firm agreement on continuing the water supply and
the terms and conditions on which this might happen, has not yet
been reached. Malaysia has said it would prefer to negotiate these
terms closer to the 2061 expiry date of existing water pacts.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has also indicated that it would prefer to supply
Singapore treated water rather than unprocessed water in the
future, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Lim reportedly said Singapore is prepared to buy treated water,
but Malaysia must give Singapore guarantees. He said the quality
of the water would have to be as high as that which Singaporeans
consume today.
</P>
<P>
"There must be safeguards to maintain this quality everyday,
for every gallon of water. Then we are comfortable with buying
treated water," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Hydro-Electric Power Station Still in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shilongba Hydro-Electric Power
Station, China's oldest, is still operating in Kunming, the
capital of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1910, the people of Yunnan raised funds for the construction
of the power station and worked for more than three months moving
heavy equipment, including a German generator, from Dianchi Lake
to Kunming.
</P>
<P>
In 1912, when the project was completed, residents of Kunming
took to the streets to see the wonderful electric lamps. Three
decades later, in the World War II, the plant was attacked four
times by Japanese bombers, but it never halted operation.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, the plant installed its first Chinese-manufactured
turbo-generator, with a 3,000-kw capacity, and now, after decades
of expansion, the power station has a 7,040-kw capacity. It annual
power output accounts for only 0.03 percent of the province's
total.
</P>
<P>
"The power station is too old to really talk about, but it is
a 'living monument'," says Zhang Junfeng, director of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, it was given protection as a provincial
relic, and since then, more than 50,000 people from around the
world have visited it.

<HEADLINE> Austria Says Euro Launch to Promote EU Common Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Austria said Sunday the launch of the
European single currency would promote countries of the European
Union to implement a common economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The European summit at heads of state and government level
agreed early Sunday in Brussels that 11 EU countries will adopt
the euro, the single currency on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 11 original members of the euro club include Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Denmark and Sweden chose not to join from the outset
and Greece failed to qualify for the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said the European monetary
union was a great European project and "an engine" of the European
unity. It would increase Europe's strength in the world
competition and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the monetary union among the 11 EU states would not
only promote better coordination of the economic and social
policies in Europe, but also its foreign and security policies.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said
the population in Europe makes up 6 percent of the world total and
the gross national product accounts for 20 percent of the world.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone, which will embrace about 290 million consumers,
would make Europe play a vanguard role in the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM to Visit U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
will start a visit to the United States Tuesday, aiming to explain
to U.S. President Bill Clinton the "mysterious object" called the
euro.
</P>
<P>
Prodi will be the first European head of government to be
received at the White House since Sunday's birth of a single
currency for 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The advent of the single European currency, the euro, has been
given little attention in the United States up to now. And the
White House recently has come under fire for having underplayed
such a historic event.
</P>
<P>
A White House official comment on the euro said what is good
for Europe, its growth and stability, is good for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Being an economist as well as a head of government, it would be
easier for Prodi to lay out for Clinton the prospects opened by
the euro.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the United States, Prodi will also meet
U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the majority and minority leaders
of the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
He will leave for Chicago Friday, where he is to give a speech
on the roles of Italy and Europe in the global economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Severe Drought Plaguing Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Due to the El Nino abnormal
phenomenon, the Philippines is being struck by the worst drought
in recent years and at least 80 people have died of hunger and
diseases induced by the dry spell.
</P>
<P>
In Metro Manila, the residents have not seen rains for the
fifth consecutive month in the year. Water supply has been reduced
by one- third since November last year. As a result, millions of
people can no longer enjoy hot showers and long soaks. What they
think about first now is how to get enough water for cooking.
</P>
<P>
With summer arriving, people are becoming hot-tempered as the
temperature rises. It is often heard that women lining up for
water fought when somebody jumps the queue. Water service
officials have been regulars on TV talk shows, trying to explain
the water shortage to short-tempered residents who don't want to
hear any more excuses.
</P>
<P>
Yet the situation in Manila is not the worst. In Mindanao, the
southern Philippines, drought has brought about famine, diseases,
forest fires and deaths.
</P>
<P>
In at least seven provinces in Mindanao, dry grass and
farmland, stunted corn and rice that turned brown, wilted trees
and smoke from grass and forest fires have been common views
during the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Department of Agriculture as of March this
year revealed that the drought had caused an estimated damage of
1.37 billion pesos (about 34 million U.S. dollars) to corn and
rice, affecting 3.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
Months of not being able to plant have reduced the capacity of
people to produce enough food. Since February, massive hunger has
happened in some areas. Among the victims, the indigenous people
were the most adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
The incessant drought has destroyed the indigenous people's
crops planted before the El Nino started, leaving nothing but
cracked earth. With the famine worsening, they were forced to eat
wild root crops and some were poisoned and died.
</P>
<P>
After their potable water sources had dried up, they had to
migrate to riverbanks and creeks to rely mostly on tadpoles,
frogs, turtles and whatever freshwater creatures that can be
caught.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, patches of fire resulted from the act of
slashing and burning of shrubs to locate frogs and snakes. When
left unattended, the fires spread to adjacent dry forested areas,
contributing to most of the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Last month, about 21 forest fires occurred in Mindanao,
destroying thousands of hectares of forest lands and killing seven
people. With the joint efforts of volunteers and troops based in
these areas, the fires were finally put under control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an outbreak of cholera and diarrhea has also struck
the areas, killing at least 17 kids and downing dozens of others,
health authorities said, attributing the cause to dirty water from
a few existing muddy rivers.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated calamity funds for the affected
areas. The Department of Social Welfare and Development is
distributing rice to the affected people. Food assistance,
however, is very limited. Although the national food authority
said it has enough rice stock, observers said the country needs to
import at least 1.5 million tons of rice to feed these hungry
people.

<HEADLINE> African Ostriches Getting Used to Life in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Lianyi Ostrich Breeding Farm in
Gansu Province is the first ostrich breeder in northwest China and
now has 35 such birds.
</P>
<P>
According to He Zhengyuan, the farm head, the farm was built in
December 1995 with state poverty relief funds on the southern edge
of the Tengger Desert, and the birds were brought from Qingdao, a
seaside city in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
There are eleven keepers looking after the birds. An ordinary
adult ostrich puts on as much as a pound a day, according to He.
</P>
<P>
At night, they like the open air of the desert. Most of them
are 2.4 m. tall. The biggest weighs 200 kg and can carry two
people, He says.
</P>
<P>
He explains that their healthy growth is caused by the natural
conditions here, which are quite similar to their native Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Ostrich never attack human beings on their own initiative, but
will kick out with their legs or peck with their beaks if they are
attacked," He goes on.
</P>
<P>
The ostriches have laid more than 300 eggs, and six of the
young birds have been sold.

<HEADLINE> Rain Brings Relief to Fire-Hit Indonesian Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An intermittent rainfall in many
areas of Indonesia's East Kalimantan recently has brought a relief
to the fire-ravaged province, where almost 500,000 hectares of
forests have been razed in the last three months, a local official
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rain, the situation is still "worrisome" because
underground fires, kept alive by coal seams, continued to ignite
in many areas of the province, Awang Farouk Ishak, head of the
provincial Environmental Impact Management Agency said Sunday in
the provincial capital of Samarinda, according to reports reaching
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Fires in the Kutai National Park and Bukit Soeharto forest
reserves are almost out," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 hectares in the 200,000-hectare Kutai National
Park and close to 7,000 hectares in Bukit Soeharto forest reserves
have been burned, causing an estimated loss of 9.2 trillion rupiah
(1.15 billion U.S. dollars) in timber revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province has an estimated 21 million hectares of forests.
</P>
<P>
Despite the temporary relief brought by the rain, Awang
expressed the hope that the United Nations would soon fulfill its
pledge to donate 10 million dollars to help Indonesia address the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Antara News Agency reported Monday that despite
some rainfall, fires are still burning on more than 4,000 hectares
of forest concessions and timber estates in the province.

<HEADLINE> Auto Producer in China to Double Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Dong Feng Motor Corp, one of the "Big
Three" in China's automotive industry, is expected to double its
output within two years.
</P>
<P>
The firm has set its goal for the year 2000 to sell 350,000
vehicles and realize 35 billion yuan in sales, including 100
million US dollars in export earnings, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to increase market share to 14 percent by then
from the current 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the country's largest manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty
trucks, the firm sold 174,000 vehicles and reported 17 billion
yuan in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the firm has begun to shift its strategic
focus to the development of passenger cars and light-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
Dong Feng-Citroen Automotive Co, a Sino-French joint venture
under the firm, plans to develop its capacity of producing 150,000
cars a year and is set to turn out 60,000 cars this year.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, about 100,000 cars will roll off its assembly lines
annually.
</P>
<P>
The paper also noted that the joint venture will unveil a new
model late this year.
</P>
<P>
China's auto production has seen a dramatic surge in the past
decades, with the output rising to 1.47 million vehicles in 1997
from 149,000 in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Bad Debt in Indonesia's Property Sector May Hit US$ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Bad debt in Indonesia's property
sector may jump to 35 trillion rupiah (4.4 billion U.S. dollars)
by the end of 1998 unless the government comes up with ways to
help the ailing industry, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented 25 percent of total loans to the sector,
property consultant Panangian Simanungkalit said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In 1994, bad debt was only 3.9 trillion rupiah (one U.S.
dollar equals 8,000 rupiah at present), and in just four years it
could multiply by 10 times," the Jakarta Post daily Monday quoted
Panangian as saying.
</P>
<P>
He explained that domestic developers had been aggressively
expanding their operations through rupiah loans and U.S. funding.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in the value of the rupiah against the dollar
has enlarged their overseas loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Panangian, dollar-denominated loans held by the
property sector now total 7 billion U.S. dollars, of which 3.4
billion is owed by publicly-listed developers, 1.6 billion by
non-listed companies and the remaining 2 billion in the form of
commercial papers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that unraveling property sector problems are a key
to solving the country's banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Developers have cried out loud and clear that they can no
longer pay their debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Restoring the banking sector without cleaning up the mess in
the property sector is a waste of liquidity, he said, pointing out
that problems in the banking industry could not be separated from
those in the property sector.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah started to tumble against the U.S. dollar in August
last year and reached its lowest level of 17,000 per dollar in
January this year. In July last year it was trading at around
2,400 per dollar and is now hovering around the 8,000-rupiah mark.
</P>
<P>
As part of the multi-billion dollar IMF (International Monetary
Fund ) reform program, a total of 23 commercial banks have been
shut down since last October in Indonesia and many are now under
the supervision of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency.

<HEADLINE> Ways Found to Kill Microbes in Aircraft Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese aviation experts have
discovered ways to eliminate microorganisms in aircraft fuel that
might lead to flight accidents.
</P>
<P>
Engineers with the Chinese Air Force Fuel Research Institute
have, for the first time, successfully separated and catalogued
microbes in the domestic-made jet fuels, and have developed
quick-testing methods used in the laboratory and in the field to
find out if the fuel is contaminated.
</P>
<P>
Also, they have developed a compound pesticide effective in
killing the microbes, according to sources with the institute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese air units have been plagued by the microorganism in
jet fuel for many years. The microbes can cause corrosion in the
jet-engines, shortfalls in fuel supply, and even a breakdown of
the fuel-supply system.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tons of aircraft fuel polluted by the microbes
have to be used for other purposes, along with the
discommissioning of dozens of airplane engines, before the
pesticide was developed.
</P>
<P>
The air force has tried out the pesticide to kill the microbes in
fuel tanks and, according to military sources, the method will
be widely used soon.

COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Sri Lankan Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Sunday evening attacked a police
station at Muttur in the east and killed 10 policemen and a
soldier, military sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They also seriously wounded nine others who were in the

</P>
<P>
The attack on Sunday came a few hours before the rebels
announced that they would observe a two-day unilateral cease-fire
on Wednesday and Thursday to enable a representative of the U.N.
secretary general, Olaara Otunnu, to visit the war-torn regions,
the sources added.
</P>

<P>
ROME, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romani Prodi
said Sunday that he believed a political union was undoubtedly to
be established in Europe in the wake of the birth of a single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking Italy's admission into the
monetary union in the first wave, Prodi said the birth of euro
"links the future of the 11 member nations" and undoubtedly a
political union will be established.
</P>
<P>
"The world is changing here without a war," Prodi told
reporters before the rally in front of Rome's city hall.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the European summit at heads of state and
government level confirmed early Sunday the recommendation that
Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland be the original members
of the euro club.
</P>
<P>
The move gave a green light to the 11 countries to switch to a
single currency at the beginning of next year, which was regarded
as a big single step toward an integrated Europe.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 European Union countries, Britain, Denmark and Sweden
decided not to join euro from the outset. Only Greece failed to
qualify for the union.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar Increase Anti-Drug Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar joined hands in
tackling mounting cross-border drug trafficking by agreeing to
increase the exchange of relevant information and evidence, the
newspaper The Nation Monday quoted a senior Thai official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Payon Pansri, secretary-general of the Narcotic Control Board,
said the agreement on greater cooperation in the exchange of
information was reached during a Thai-Myanmar ministerial meeting
last month in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar shows great concerns over the spread of drugs as it
fears that serious drug problems may emerge in the country as in
Thailand, Payon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agreement will help track down drug offenders
who have used Thai territory as a transit route for drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Under Thai law, if an offense is conducted outside Thailand,
the offender can be tried in a Thai court if there is evidence
that the offense has had negative effects on Thailand.
</P>
<P>
With this legislation and a greater exchange of information
between the two neighbors, Thai authorities have high hopes that
they can bring to court those using Thailand as a transit route.
</P>
<P>
Payon also said the drug problem cannot be tackled unilaterally
but requires cooperation among neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that a conference will be held in Vietnam on May 14
and 15 on drug suppression with the participation of
representatives from Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia
and China.

unilateral cease-fire to coincide with a visit to the country's
northern regions by a senior U.N. official, informed sources here
said.

The LTTE stated that the truce on Wednesday and Thursday is to
be effected because Olaara Otunnu, special representative of the
secretary general on children and armed conflict, plans to visit
the north region on those days.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the truce was ordered by S. V. Prabhakaran,
leader of the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the Sri Lankan government
to the LTTE cease-fire announcement, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit to the country.

<HEADLINE> Loan Growth Slows Down in 1st Quarter in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Burnt by the sharp rise in bad loans
amid the region-wide financial crisis, Philippine commercial banks
became more selective in lending money in the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times Monday reported that during the period, the
banks' total loans grew by only 18.8 percent to 1.33 trillion
pesos (about 33 billion U.S. dollars) from the year-ago level,
significantly lower than the 26.9-percent growth rate in the
fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said it was the lowest year-on-year loan growth
posted by the banks in recent years. It added that the growth rate
had been declining from 44 percent in the first quarter last year,
to 36.16 percent in the second quarter and 32.4 percent in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released earlier by the central bank showed
that the banks' non-performing loans had more than doubled to 73.7
billion pesos (1.8 billion dollars) as of end-1997 from the
year-ago level, accounting for 4.7 percent of the total loan
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Many firms found it difficult to pay their loans on time due to
the weak peso and high interest rates. The peso plunged from 26.2
to the dollar last July to 40 a dollar by the end of last year
while the interest rates soared from 15 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The declining access to loans will force some firms to reduce
their operations or go bankrupt, dampening the country's economic
growth in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Wins Tennis Challenge Title in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded American Pete Sampras
on Sunday beat second seed Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, 6-7
(2-7), 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in the final of the Challenge tennis in
Duluth, Goergia, ending his four-year title drought on clay.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Sampras, who regained the world's number one
ranking from Chile's Marcelo Rios this week, won his second ATP
Tour title of the year, 54th of his career.
</P>
<P>
Sampras last won a title on clay at Rome in 1994. His only
other clay court title was gained at Kitzbuhel, Austria in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sampras won the tournament in two hours and 40-minutes by
capitalizing on just two of 16 break point opportunities and
taking advantage of 13 double faults by the Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
Sampras improved to 11-1 in his last 12 finals, including a
victory at the Advanta Championships in Philadelphia in February.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who will attempt to end his futility at the French
Open later this month, improved his season record to 21-5 and 4-0
lifetime against Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, 28, suffered his second straight loss in the final
at this event, and third loss in an ATP Tour final this year.
</P>
<P>
He was seeking his fifth career ATP Tour title and first since
last year at Coral Springs, Florida, a title he will defend
beginning Monday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Managers Subject to Market Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of Shanghai
is preparing to abandon its decades-old practice of nominating
managers for state-owned companies, and all managers will be
selected through market competition, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Shanghai Guanshengyuan Group became the first
local company to use a local head-hunting firm to find managers. The
group has since recorded remarkable success with sales surging
from 3.6 billion yuan to 5.5 billion yuan over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai managers are now selected through various channels,
including selections made by the board of directors, the
employment market, election by staff or recommendation by local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
All managers, regardless of the selection method used, are
subject to competitive mechanisms, according to the officials.

<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in London
Sunday evening for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in an effort to revive the deadlocked Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at London's Heathrow airport, Arafat said
that the success of the London talks depended on whether Netanyahu
accepted a U.S. proposal to hand over another 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat ruled out the possibility of making further concessions
by saying, "We have accepted the bare minimum of our demands, the
bare minimum."
</P>
<P>
Before Netanyahu's arrival in London, an Israeli government
spokesman made it clear that it would be "utterly impossible" for
Israel to accept the U.S. proposal of demanding Israel's troops
pullout from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in London Saturday evening, is expected
to hold separate talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President
Arafat Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who visited the
Middle East early this month, will also meet with Arafat and
Netanyahu separately Monday.

<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
arrived in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia Monday
morning (local time) for a visit, the first by a French head of
state or government to the South Pacific island in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
During his 36-hour stay on the island, Jospin will sign an
agreement on the future of the territory with the leaders of both
pro-French and pro-independence political groups.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was struck last month by the pro-French Rally for
Caledonia in the Republic and the pro-independence Kanak Socialist
Liberation Front with the French government.
</P>
<P>
It predicted an irreversible evolution toward independence of
the island from France, prior to a referendum on the final status
of the territory between 2013 and 2018.
</P>
<P>
Jospin will also inaugurate an indigenous Kanak cultural center
named after Jean-Marie Tjibaou, a Kanak nationalist killed by a
Kanak extremist for signing a peace agreement with the French
government in 1988.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet in Noumea, capital of the island, with the
leaders of the neighboring countries or territories of New
Caledonia -- Australia, New Zealand, Cook Islands and Vanuatu,
which make up the South Pacific Forum.

<HEADLINE> Le Figaro Publishes Report on Suppression of FLN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- France's conservative newspaper Le
Figaro revealed in its Monday edition an official report on the
1961 bloody suppression by French security forces of a
demonstration by the National Liberation Front (FLN) of Algeria in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by Dieudonne Mandelkern, the president of
the National Commission of Control of Interception of Security,
said that "dozens of people" were killed by French security forces
in the night from October 17 to 18, 1961, one year prior to the
independence of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The figure fell short of the hundreds of deaths -- from 200 to
800 -- as was claimed by FLN and some independent investigators,
including writer Jean-Luc Einaudi, who wrote on the event in his
book "The Battle of Paris."
</P>
<P>
The French government has classified the official files on the
crackdown until 2021, but Mandelkern was given an exceptional
privilege to look into the archives of the Paris Police Department
and the French Interior Ministry on the crackdown.

power base of the FN.
</P>
<P>
The FN lost the only seat it won in the early legislative
elections last June after Socialist Odette Casanova won 50.07
percent of the votes from the constituency of the navy port base
of Toulon, which represents one seat in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The FN candidate, Cedrine Le Chevallier, who is wife of FN
mayor of Toulon Jean-Marie Le Chevallier, lost.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Le Chevallier was the only FN candidate elected to
the National Assembly last June, but was deprived of his seat
after being found to have abused campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist victory, while marking the first failure of the
FN in Toulon for years, also confirmed the firm establishment by
the Socialist Party in the southern region of Provence-Alpes-Cote
d'Azur (PACA).
</P>
<P>
The Socialists won the PACA regional parliament presidency from
the rightwing Rally for the Republic and Union for French
Democracy in March.
